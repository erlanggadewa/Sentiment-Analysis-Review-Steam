Negative,Fix the servers!!!!
Negative,Online services still broken half a year later.
Negative,"I heavily enjoy this game and do recommend it to people who read this, but I am going to review a negative review as a major exploit that lets hackers flat out reset your save file with a possibility of crashing your PC if they want is currently going around and causing lots of damage, and as such this thumbs down review will be a semi-silent protest to Fromsoft and Bandai to notice the sudden drop in positive reviews and see that this massive explot is the reason and fix it.Here's a link to where you can learn more about this exploit:https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/n1235k/potential_pc_security_exploit_spreading/Good luck to all, and hopefully your jolly co-operation stays jolly."
Negative,"Update 07.08.2022 - they finally have warnings up to let potential buyers know that the games don't currently have multiplayer. Now we wait. 6 months and counting for a AAA studio to fix an issue that modders fixed on custom servers way back in January.Because I don't see many reviews talking about it, I'll do so. The entire Dark Souls series on PC has been offline since 23.01.2022 due to an exploit. Bandai Namco promised a fix ""soon"", but as of 04.04.2022, we still haven't heard anything back. On the store pages for Dark Souls 1 Remastered and Dark Souls 2, multiplayer is still one of the advertised features in the descriptions. Bandai Namco is selling these games without telling people that the multiplayer is no longer available and there is no definite date for a fix."
Negative,"Love the Dark Souls series. Love this game. Lots of great challenges, loads of good lore, lots of good times on multiplayer. Why am I leaving a negative review? Hackers have ruined the online experience. And for me, online play is a huge appeal in these games. But after years of playing and over 100 hours logged, a single hacker throwing hacked items into my inventory has banned me from online play. Nevermind the fact that I hit alt-f4 immediately after I saw this happening. Nevermind the fact that I loaded a backup save from before I even encountered the hacker. No. Bandai doesn't give a shit. A hacked item touched my account for 1 second. Now I'm deemed a turbo-hacker in Bandai's eyes and I can't play with my friends, which is why I came back to this game in the first place.I will change my review if and when Bandai decides to not punish players who make active strides to circumvent the efforts of hackers and want to play the game legitimately."
Negative,"You know the drill. Dark Souls 3 single-player is great and worth price of admission alone. Contrary to the memes, the game is not that difficult. It’s true!Then why the negative review, you ask? Because Dark Soul 3’s thoroughly lacking net code for online play is extremely dangerous. At the time of writing, at least two different unpatched Remote Code Execution (RCE) exploits in Dark Souls 3[duckduckgo.com] have been found. RCE exploits allow bad actors to execute arbitrary code on a player’s PC remotely. RCE exploits are the Dark Souls of cyber security. I cannot understate the severity of this. And Dark Souls 3, when connected to online multiplayer, leaves your system wide open.The first RCE exploit, found and detailed in April 2021, has persisted for almost a year without any reaction from Bandai Namco & FromSoftware. It fell on the community to provide unofficial anti-cheat software (entitled “Blue Sentinels”)[www.nexusmods.com] to protect Dark Souls 3 players from malicious actors online.The second RCE exploit was made public in January 2022 by members of the Dark Souls community. (The exploit had already been previously reported to Bandai Namco & FromSoftware in December 2021[www.fanbyte.com].)  As of today (2022-02-09) online play in FromSoftware’s Souls games (DS, DS2, DS3) has been disabled for more than two weeks[www.theverge.com] following a public demonstration of this second RCE exploit on twitch[clips.twitch.tv], ostensibly to mitigate risk and give FromSoftware time to fix the issue before the launch of ELDEN RING (2022), which is assumed to share a considerable part of its net code with the older games. The fact that the revelation of the first RCE exploit last year did not warrant an immediate and coordinated response from Bandai Namco & FromSoftware is frankly unacceptable. Adding insult to injury, it took a second RCE exploit and the resulting financial risk of it torpedoing the launch of their highly anticipated next title to actually spur Bandai Namco & FromSoftware into action. Needless to say, this is extremely irresponsible behaviour by a software firm selling its product to millions of customers. The only silver lining is that the temporary take-down of online functionality at least mitigates the present security risks. A much belated software patch to fix the exploits might be incoming.Buyers beware."
Negative,I kept dying because i was distracted by the oiled up blacksmith
Negative,Fix the servers please.
Negative,"This game is amazing, but I'm setting a negative score until NAMCO decides to set an acceptable price tag on this game. This is a 2016 game where they're charging full price. Here in Brazil, this game is actually more expensive than Elden Ring (and there wasn't a single instance where they put this game on sale during the entirety of 2022, check SteamDB),. A complete joke by NAMCO. If you want this game, try to find another store to buy the key, I'm pretty sure they're way cheaper than through Steam.EDIT (July 30th 2023): They lowered the price a little bit, now it's costing the same as Elden Ring. It's still super expensive for a 7 year-old game nonetheless."
Negative,"Honestly an amazing game. But this game was released in 2016 and still costs like the price of a 2023 brand new game (60 bucks), and is even worse in South America, where money inflation is a hell. This game offers nothing new appart of the classic 2 DLCs and basic mantainment. So you CAN'T be serious with the price."
Negative,Love this game but right now on PC it needs to be patched there is too much hacking going on. just lost my progress due to hackers
Negative,couldn't focus Andre is too hot and distracting
Negative,"Hackers can force shit into your inventory, break your save and permanently ban you from online servers.What a fucking embarrassment."
Negative,Fun game but Bandai-Namco doesn't understand what a PC is.
Negative,"Honestly an amazing game. But fuck me, this was released 7 years ago and still costs 101$ for me with both DLC's?? You can't be serious. For PS4 it's less than a 1/3rd of that. And for that, you greedy bastards, you get a big fat 0 from me."
Negative,"One of the greatest games ever made, following the footsteps of the first dark souls with improved animations, netcoding and general mechanics. This game feels very smooth and fights are absolutely amazing. Dark souls 3 adds more challenge to the game by making the mobs more aggressive, a lot like in BloodBorn. I absolutely want to recommend this game as a big fan of dark souls series and for the gameplay quality but due to it's state I can not do so, I feel like I have the responsibility to inform you about the situation that's going on in the game. Cheaters have taken over the game in large numbers, Dark souls has it's own brutal anti-cheat system but it is very ineffective when cheaters can create alt steam accounts to bypass bans and strike again. The cheating scene has been going on for years and years now but it has evolved to the point where cheaters can actually cause permanent damage to your PC or even pish information you'd not want to share online. These cheats are evolving constantly due to the big playerbase and lack of action from Bandai Namco. So who knows maybe in future Dark souls 3 on steam could work as a backdoor access to your PC in a way. Very high security risk here. I talked to Bandai Namco's support about the issue and they are aware of what is going on and I was told that they are working on the issue, but in truth nothing has been done in 3 years or so when all this started to boom.If you play this game in OFFLINE mode you will not have any problems, also there are mods such as Blue-Sentinel which is telling you when you are being invaded by a cheater and it tries to block you connecting to them in future, use of this mod is bannable reason but Bandai Namco's anti-cheat can't track it as the mod does not affect the game itself that much. I recommend using this mod if you plan to play the game."
Negative,"UPDATE FROM MY OLD REVIEW FROM THE RELEASEa Remote Code Execution (also known as RCE) exploit has emerged for Dark Souls III on PC. This means that potentially malicious players connected to your game may be able to execute code by sending information to your game that directly affects aspects of your operating system. This can lead to sensitive information leaks, including but not limited to: installation of malicious programs such as keyloggers or viruses, theft of account information or login tokens, and access to other sensitive information such as banking info or other things that may be stored on your computer.DO NOT PLAY THE GAME ONLINE, blue-sentinel is working on a fix, but a complete newbie who buys this game on sale will be exposed to this regardless, please be careful guys.I love dark souls 3... BUT! [CAUTION] INVALID GAME DATA HAS BEEN DETECTED! This Anti-Cheat programm causing legit players to get banned!Cheaters are currently able to get innocent players permanently banned, as well as modifying stats.. As a result, the online is unplayable for anyone who doesn't want to risk having their save ruined and get permanently banned from the online as a result.Fix this Anti-Cheat programm please!Namco noted that some of the bans may have been by accident. They'll check for false positives, and in the meantime, you should contact customer support. (i will delete this review if namco fixed this anti cheat)"
Negative,"Great game, as long as you don't play multiplayer.I encountered someone who had glitched the game.  When they hit me with an enchanted dagger, they started changing my soul count to 50,000,000+.   The game then ejected me and banned me due to having 'inconsistent data'.   Due to someone else's hacking, I lost a character I had used 20+ hours of time.   Hackers remain unpunished while legit players become victims.   Unacceptable. Patch notes have absolutely no detail of changes, just some vague statements about things being 'adjusted'.  Also Unacceptable.From Software needs to step up and fix their issues or their amazing game will wind up a disappointment."
Negative,"How's that possible to a multimillion company with multibillion publisher to have not solved security issue less than a month and stop game servers altogether? You could probably with 5% of any DS sales take security experts and game devs around the world to resolve this in a month, but greedy Fromcuckware with Banzai Scamco thought that resolving this issue is not important and just don't give a single fuck about fanbase and their bestseller games, the games that made this company as big as they could, but yet everything remains still.I'm utterly perplexed why community haven't had a backlash towards those cucks. Fuck this greedy bastards, remove souls games from steam - if you have zero capacity to properly maintain your games."
Negative,Can't sex firekeeper
Negative,GIVE ME BACK MY INVASIONS FROM
Negative,"Fantastic god tier game, but it ain't worth $60 in 2023."
Negative,no big boob lady in anor londo 0/10
Negative,Why is this 299.99 AED (80 USD)?and 102 USD with DLCis this a joke?game is great but this business practice is egregious
Negative,"I'm bad at this game. But instead of taking accountability and improve my skills, I will blame the game instead."
Negative,"The game is amazing. but i got banned because i picked up something from an invader who turned out to be a hacker, resulting in me not being able to play co-op. Such a let down for such a great game.This game also does not have cloud saves."
Negative,"I got banned because someone else was hacking and injected items into my inventory, they say if it happens again I'll be perma'd. Yeah thanks, better not get invaded or summoned ever again. Don't make backups either, that's a bannable offense.I'm not trying to pretend there's an easy fix for hacking without a better anticheat, but anyone can tell that a system that allows cheaters to ban innocent players is worse than no system at all.EDIT: LOL there's an RCE exploit"
Negative,"I'm editing this review later on into a proper one, but I'm leaving a negative review because Bandai is at it again trying to straight up rob people with their prices in south america.There's no excuse for these prices, since they can still load their pockets from people who can actually pay for them in first world countries, so I'm putting negatives on every game that updates prices to unreasonable amounts in a market that actually allows for regionalization.And for all my south american friends out there who can't pay for it: Just play the Jack Sparrow version, don't let them get away with it ;)"
Negative,">be me>first time invading>get put in auto-death cycle by hacker>support says that i need to delete character with 100+ hours>forums say that if i use some CE engine table, I can move my character and break the auto death cycle>works>feelsgood.jpg>""you have been penalized""> unable to play with friends again.>roomate encounters literally the same dude and is put in the same cycle while not penalized>mfw from soft banned me for fixing the shit they wont but not the guy who did this to me"
Negative,"I love this game, but cannot recommend it until FROMSOFTWARE stops banning innocent people for using programs that allow people to use controllers etc.."
Negative,stop looking at bad reviews. get the game dumbass. its a good game get it already.
Negative,Banco has a major issue with banning the innocent and somehow turning a blind eye to the actual cheaters. Seeing how I have been banned from Remastered and 3 I cannot support Banco
Negative,My wife left me
Negative,"Absolutly amazing game, worth the money atleast twice over. Beautifully dark and superior visuals. However, there's a chance you'll get banned from online play for no reason because From Software and their buggy servers think you have ""invalid game data"". After they warn you to stop using your save you still get the warning and banned even if you delete your save and start over. A cruel joke.EDIT: To answer your questions, the best cause for the ban I can figure is that I played offline for a bit when steam went down then went back online with a save file that probably didnt match their records."
Negative,"As much as i want to love this game , there is one thing that really put a bad taste in my mouth.First week i was playing fine , the second week they started their anti-cheat system. (which usually is a good idea).I got a warning that i had invalid data on my pc, and reading after several threads i decided to remove the game, save games and blacklist in rivatuner (so it wouldnt use it).After redownloading the game, starting fresh (with a xbox360 controller) , i had fun for about a week until yesterday.Yesterday i got a message my account has been penalized and i had been banned from the multiplayer part of the game. So i can no longer co-op  or invade.I have no 3rd party software running , no cheats, no mods and no overlay software (only the steam overlay!).I have read on many forums this thing is all happening automaticly , and from software cant do anyting about it.  im pretty gutted since MP was a crucial part of the game and now i cant play it properly anymore.     And to think i even bought the season pass as well. I wanted to buy the PC version since obviously that is supposed to be the best version , well after this drama i cant really recommend it to anyone.  So either get the console version or avoid it at all cost."
Negative,"This is mostly a baby rage post, but in late january 2022-early february 2022 FSW identified a terrible exploit which allowed people invading you to remotely run most any program they want on your PC. Downloading any username/password/file you have saved to your computer? done with a single command. It is almost 2 months after their announcement of this and it has not been fixed, and on the day of their announcement they shut all Dark Souls servers down until further notice. I had no idea this existed until I looked into why I could not login to the server no matter what, and have been playing the game since like 2018 for 161 hours. It's not terribly much, but this exploit has been present since I started playing, and for the risk posed to me and other people I bought the game for and exposed to this, fuck this game."
Negative,"Welp 1st negative review I think. Great game. Everything is top tier. Easily the most challenge I've ever experienced in a video game but From, the Devs, are trying to destroy the game.The anti-cheat will ban innocent players because cheaters injected items into your game. Hundreds of hours wasted because From is too lazy. If you intent to play the game normally and use online aspects you are forced to manually save your files, download 3rd party programs that apparently bypass the broken anti-cheat TO PROTECT YOU from wrongfully getting banned and even then you might still get penalized because another player decided to cheat in your game. Unacceptable.They also recently got rid of Family Share which helped players who were wrongfully banned and lost their characters to still play.Avoid this until something serious is done to properly address the issues mentioned."
Negative,"-Play 120hrs-want to play area so get the season pass-play well enough to get to gold -face hacker that one shots you with invisible soul spear-take screenshot of hacker before game freezes and bugs out-report hacker-start playing game again after 3 months have pasted-wonder why no one is playing area-realize that you were banned-realize there is no way to get unbanned-nothing but regrets.Lesson learned: never play online......Honestly I love Dark Souls, but this kind of stuff is ridiculous."
Negative,"I was subject to the new hack that reset all my save progress and sent me back to firelink shrine, trapping me there.I had been loving the game and I had just spent the last 37 hours playing.This security issue needs to be addressed before this game can be recommended again, this is a huge issue that could even cause GPU hacks and totally corrupt your PC.VALVE ADDRESS THIS NOW, THIS GAME SHOULD BE PULLED FROM YOUR STORE UNTIL THIS IS ADDRESSED!!!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!"
Negative,"Edit as of 28-05-2021: Hackers are running rampant in this game. Playing with a friend, and he got put into NG++, then after 30 min he got put into NG+4. Just playing co-op, no invasion or anything. Just a connection error and back to the start of the game it is. Lost all progression multiple times and got put into a more difficult game.A fix is a MOD, not something official by the developer. I would not recommend getting this game until this is fixed. If you already own it, I would strongly recommend you to use the Blue Sentinel mod. Spend more than 100 hours ""getting gud"" only to be one-shot by a naked dude with a massive weapon hidden in his prison pocket. 10/10, would recommend. On a more serious note: Beautiful scenery with a bittersweet ""story"", rewarding combat and adrenaline inducing fights. This game keeps dragging me back in, play through after play through. There is enough content to enjoy yourself and the DLC's are the cherry on top. If you like to challenge yourself and have the temper to not destroy your controller, you should definitely try it out! Stay safe, skeleton!"
Negative,"This game is great i love it enjoy it alot.but it has the worst automated cheater detection ever.I just got banned for no reason. i died alot but i never hack, never cheat, never use any outside programsLike many other legit players that got ban because of their shtty ban system. and i swear that im not the first and wont be the last.    In most common infamous case. A hacker happen to join into your game. they can do weird stuff like force adding stats, forcing items into your characters and mess up your save files and you'll be ban and burn in hell for it. and there are many hackers out there. game will force you to delete your savefiles.  all those time you invest into leveling will be gone. If you wanna buy this game to experience online PVP coop. you have to accept that you risk lose your characters and all your sht at anytime. all those hours, days, weeks invested, gone.  its really frustrate. its a great game tho if you wanna buy it and dont care much about pvp and just wanna enjoy sp story. but you have been warned."
Negative,do not get into meta pvp if you want your braincells and mental health to be in good condition
Negative,Can't sex the firekeeper wouldn't recommend
Negative,Can't co-op. Fix servers pls.
Negative,"3-30-22 i'm still unable to access the the online game server, and I suspect they think this issue is resolved, it is not. Do not purchase this game for download until they finally get off their ass and fix it for everyone. In addition, they conveniently leave out the fact that your save files will not go to the cloud, soyou will not find out until after the fact when you have a PC issue that requires reinstalling your operating system like I did, stupid me for not taking an image, but f*ck you for wiping out 464 hour of gameplay."
Negative,"I can't beat pontiffUpdate: I already beat him Update: I can't beat nameless kingUpdate: Thanks to the souls collected from all the salty people in the comments, I was able to improve my build and beat the game and all DLCs... Midir is a different beast though..."
Negative,"The point of this review is to point out the flaws and problems with the game. To help people make an informed decision before buying the game. You should always read multiple reviews, not just one. It's with a heavy heart that I write this review. It is of course my personal opinion. As a player with several thousand hours between Demons souls, Dark souls on PS3 and PC, Dark souls 2 on PS3 aswell as on pc, Dark souls 2: SotFS on pc, and Bloodborne on PS4, I feel I am obligated to write this. For the record, this review will change if the current state of the game improves, but as it stands, the game is not worth buying. While yes, it is a souls game, it is in a poor state. I'll first start by saying that I never played the japanese version, even though it released almost 3 weeks early there. That of course would allow for some sense of reassurance that many of the major issues with networking and balancing would be sorted out by the time of full release. Unfortunately, that's not the case. When the game fully released, the first area of the game after getting to the main hub was in essense broken. For whatever reason, the game made it almost impossible for a lot of people to see summon signs of friends while using the password system. The system that is supposed to make sure that those summon signs were the only ones visible to you and your friends. However, without a password, tons of signs were easily visible. Even if they were useless in the sense that 70% of summon attempts would simply fail and say ""unable to summon phantom"". So, 3 weeks early and the networking for the first area doesn't even work properly. Alright, moving on to the next area, summon signs without passwords still refused to work on a regular basis, and STILL DO at the time of my writing this. However, passworded signs would show up. This brings me to the next glaring issue, there are multiple covenants in the game that are dependant on automatically being summoned for an area to defend it or to defend a player who is already invaded. These covenants were next to useless when the game released as they would never send you to defend the area associated with your covenant. Thus making it that much harder to aquire the covenants items required to rank up to aquire certain spells and rings that are necessary for the acheivements. Unless you want to farm trash mobs for an hour+ to get your covenants drops. That's right, FromSoft was kind enough to add a method of grinding for the covenants that negates even needing to use them. Seems to me they knew that their networking was so broken that they made sure to add an offline method of doing covenants. Before anyone says, ""Well they put it there so people can play offline and still do all the covenants and such."" I doubt that someone so concerned with collecting all the items and such would play offline. Another interesting thing, is that the armor stat ""Poise"" (it's in armor pieces stat pages, on the character stat page and there's a ring dedicated to boosting poise) is turned off in the config files for players. However, NPC's still have it. It essentially makes actual defense stats more important than anything. Unless you use certain heavy weapons that have infinite poise while using a light attack. It makes trading with heavy weapons an impossibility if you're playing PvP as hitting them before their attack connects does not stun them and leaves you completely open for a full hit, which WILL stun you and give them a free second hit before you're able to roll away. And again, before anyone says ""git gud"", keep in mind I typically keep my builds lightweight and even use the carthus bloodring to improve my i-frames while dodging. Not being able to interrupt someone simply because their weapon is bigger and happens to give them hyper armor while swinging puts myself at a major disadvantage regardless of any factors. What else... Oh, the mind numbing difficulty of the game... I'm kidding of course. As far as souls games go, Dark souls 3, is objectively the easiest and most forgiving. Not only are most of the larger, tougher enemies either stun lockable with the help of a phantom, but the larger ones can be viceral attacked after connecting a few hits on them, usually killing them. Also, the difference between New Game and NG+ is negligable. I've completely the game 4 times already, both NG and NG+ and have been horribly dissappointed with NG+. The enemies are hardly any tougher, as you're character is already fully geared by the time you get there and just getting more powerful. Not to mention the signature addition of random dark spirit invaders and red phantom versions of normal enemies that would appear in NG+ in previous games, all the way back to Demons Souls. It's not a new concept, and it kept NG+ fresh and exciting. The ONLY thing to look forward to in NG+ over NG in Dark souls 3 is +1 versions of rings. And I've heard that the only thing in NG++ is +2 rings. It's a massive disappointment for more hardcore players like myself that liked the added challenge of turning a corner and running into a skeleton or hollow on steroids that hits twice as hard. It takes a lot of the hardcore ""YOU WILL DIE"" mentality that's been a trademark for souls games away and instead changed it to ""YOU WILL FARM"". I suppose another small thing to note is that large portions of the game feel highly unpolished and rushed. Some areas are breathtakingly beautiful, while others are full of large portions of texture and mesh completely missing, leading to literal holes in the world. Not to mention the weird graphical errors people get where everything goes wire mesh and turns bright shades of purple and green. Or players body texture clipping through armor when you hold a specific type of weapon as a specific gender. Or the fact that on full release, bonfires were one of the most dangerous things in the game, as they would cause a graphics driver kernel crash if you're lighting setting in the options menu was set to anything above low. A real kick in the ribs to players with high end pc's capable of running the game at max settings but being forced to tweak on setting to avoid crashes. Or the fact that after shutting down the game and restarting it, the game had a tendancy to reset the lighting setting to the recommended, detected setting without your knowing, causing crashes that you thought you'd fixed. Another thing of note, is that the game runs like trash on console. It does not play at an acceptable framerate on PS4 compared to pc. Looking at one, then the other, the difference is almost physically sickening. As stated above, this is my personal opinion, and this review is subject to being edited if the game sees improvement. I wish I could recommend it, but I simply can't, and it pains me to say that. I hope you found something useful or helpful in my review before making a purchase. Have a nice day."
Negative,"TL;DR: The game is fun, the community isn't.I'm going to be 100% honest with you, the game is good. Really good actually. The combat is fun enough, the enemy design is unique and different from the first two games, the weapons are neat with the weapon abilities, and of course, it's very pretty graphic wise. But only if you play it offline, can you actually enjoy it. Do not make the same mistake I did in actually trying to co-op with a friend. You can't. You just can't. Dark Souls 3 is not a game meant to be enjoyed with a friend, it was never designed properly to be an actual co-op, online experience. And here's why:Invasions aren't something I complain about as a concept, they're not my favorite thing about the souls series but they're alright when they happen. Keywords: as a concept. This implies that no one would abuse such a system. This implies, that you'll actually be fighting people your player level, and skill level. This implies, that you wouldn't be fighting some dude with 9000+ hours, invading as a player level 10, with the best gear in the game.For people who need hand-holding, I'm talking about twinks. I'm willing to bet all the money in the world that the glowing, positive reviews, are written by these people who think this is actually enjoyable to newer players. As a new player, I'm telling you now, it's not. Not even a little bit. Don't even think about saying 'git gud', because there is no getting good against someone with amazing endgame gear at the very beginning. And the only way to counter a twink, is by playing offline. You cannot win against these people. And as far as I am concerned? These are the only people who are invading. And these people are the same ones, telling everyone 'iNvAsIoNs ArE iNtEgRaL tO tHe ExPeRiEnCe.' Then maybe, you should all go fight at your own soul level on your mains, where the invasion experience is actually an experience for both parties? I'm sorry if it's an actual challenge fighting against people who know all of your tricks up there at that level, but you are actively killing the community who actually kind of enjoyed the normal invasion experience.Again, Invaders are fine, I had the pleasure of fighting someone who was actually in normal gear, with a normal weapon, and a normal shield, where we duked it out. No lightning, fire, dark, poison, toxic, or bleed, just a regular fight. So, heed my warning, new players/returning players from other games, this game is built for invaders, not for co-op, and it will actively make you hate the entirety of the Dark Souls community, because they're all little toxic basement trolls who are worse then the League of Legends, Dota 2, and Counter-strike: Global Offensive communities combined, actively seeking to ruin your experience of the game. Play offline for the full, real experience of Dark Souls 3. But just to make it fun, I'll even allow comments, so you little twinkies can throw a fit in the comments, click the 'Not Helpful' button, and show everyone what terrible people you are, that you must validate your self through personal attacks.Edit: As fun as it was to draw twinkies out from their basement, to try and tell me how wrong I am, I think it just goes to further prove how abusive this community in particular is. I am disabling comments, as this community was wrathful, hateful, and abusive. I wish I could keep the comments up, but I do not want anyone to experience the amount of abuse I have over writing a simple negative review.It further proves my point that this community alone is the problem with this game. There were a few reasonable people, but I am pretty sure there is a sub-reddit or a group online somewhere, where these people gather to learn of anyone who reveals their secret, because the amount of twinks as opposed to rational, normal people that were commenting was truly disturbing. I never felt so attacled over writing a simple negative review simply describing my experience with the game and the people who play it.From Software really needs to do something about this. Like maybe matching people to hours played on steam, or some kind of thing to be able to match people to their time played with other people. It really is scary to think about the kind of reaction I gained out of these people for simply stating there is a problem."
Negative,"Extremely good game, however, an ongoing issue yet to be fixed or remotely addressed is the issue with hacking. In the last month, several issues with player's game being completely hacked into with malicious code that not only lets them into your game, but also your hard drive, SSD and potentially more. Check out the reddit for this game and its pinned post or some of the negative reviews below for more info. Great game, but probably one of the worst instances of hacking in terms of severity I've ever seen from a mainstream game that's being completely ignored."
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 price: R$ 257,90Elden Ring price: R$ 249,90What the fuck"
Negative,"too hard, can't get past the tutorial"
Negative,you can't pet any of the dogs
Negative,Great game with terrible online.Full of hackers and company didn't do anything to prevent that.
Negative,"Played against a cheater, now my account is banned. Never picked up an item or anything, literally just got invaded and the next day I was banned. Everyone who has been banned should be given refunds for receiving an incomplete game."
Negative,"1- They did knew about exploit and they did nothing for years until it became a disaster.2- No online for 6 month.3- They said that they will gonna fix it after Elden Ring release, 5 month and still nothing. and guess what??!!They are working on another game and its in final stage. But still no fix for DS3."
Negative,"A game that I went into expecting to hate and was pleasantly surprised. Dark Souls 3 is fantastic, but unfortunately at the moment I cannot recommend it because of the utterly broken anti-cheat system.Cheaters are currently able to (and quite easily so) get innocent players permanently banned, as well as forcibly modifying stats, wiping inventories, etc. As a result, the online is unplayable for anyone who doesn't want to risk having their save ruined and get permanently banned from the online as a result. As time goes on, cheaters doing this will get more and more common, until the entire community dies off. Until Fromsoft/Namco Bandai does something to remedy the situation, I cannot recommend this game, especially not at full price."
Negative,"Dont mistake my negative review for disliking the game, I personally think the game is fantastic. However a remote code execution exploit (or RCE for short)  has been discovered in the games netcode effectively making the game a virus for anyone who plays it online. This exploit allows anyone who invades your game or someone you summon to run code on your computer without your consent. This exploit can be used to simply crash someones game, or open up random programs on the users computer, steal private information, or even brick your PC.The community managed mod/anti-cheat Blue Sentinel has patched out the exploit and it is highly encouraged that you install the mod before playing the game. I have linked the mod below for convenience. https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/723While im thankful for the effort of the developers behind the Blue Sentinel mod and their speedy response in fixing the exploit, the community should not be responsible for making sure a product works and is safe for its user base this responsibility should fall on the developers and the publishers. I hope to see an official response from either Bandai Namco or Fromsoftware soon addressing the issue and insuring us this issue will not be present in the upcoming Elden Ring. Until then i cannot safely recommend a game that has the potential to harm your PC."
Negative,"An amazing game everyone should play at least once, but play offline, I'd rather eat broken glass than play the awful PvP system again, the starter areas are filled with individuals that use high-end gear to farm new players, usually putting them off the game permanently, it sucks. Oh, and don't forget the hackers. I've had some good experiences with the community, and I've also done what I can to add to that group, invading and giving people embers etc for free. However, good experiences online here are few and far between, avoid it like the plague and weep because we're definitely not getting any kind of private co-op mode for you to show your friends how great this game is without xX_NewbpWnAgE42069(InsertEdgyClanName)_Xx or 'shreklolXDXD' invading with a dark hand and caestus.Edit: 'You suck' and 'casul' is not a valid argument, especially when it takes no skill to stack buffs, equipment and stats for low SL invasion easy-mode time. I think you're a sad basement dweller if you feel the little endorphin high you get from winning an invasion matters in life, but the thing is, if you exploit new players for covenant items, YOU suck, not me.Edit edit: I believe in criticism quite wholeheartedly, but I'm also not very good with being spammed dumb insults in the comments section (although more depressing to read than good as insults). I thought I'd be able to handle that better, but it's just not something I am decent at it seems, which is sad because I really didn't want to disable the comments. Considered deleting the review but I think it's important to keep up as a little message on how idiots are ruining the online experience of a game that is otherwise what I'd consider the most immersive and fascinating fantasy universe ever written. Haven't received any constructive criticism to warrant keeping comments enabled, so, I'm sorry, I have anxiety, and not self-diagnosed, I gotta disable them so I'm not worrying about what's being said here 24/7 and tempted to reply to every 'git gud' or 'casul' comment."
Negative,"I absolutely LOVE this game, I have every item in the game as far as I know and I've completed every achievement. Sadly though, I've been false banned and now I can't even play with my friends anymore. It's a beautiful game but do beware, there's the ever so small group of people who get false banned. You could end up in that sliver of a statistic. Don't bother emailing support either because they just reply with automated emails and if you try to contact them again they threaten to perma ban you just for basically bothering them."

Negative,"===== Updated June 9, 2017 =====To follow up to some of the remarks and update on review: with last dlc and patch about half a year ago it seems like support for this game has come to the end. With Dark Souls: REMASTERED out I can recommend playing that one instead of this, since it got (in my opinion) much more solid mechanics in terms of design, even though in terms of functioning they may be not ideal (notorious lagstabs that are not as unfair as people would think, there is long explanation but it's for Remasterd review).Dark Souls 3 is certainly still a decent single player/co-op experience, but sadly in terms of gameplay it's an inferior game to past 2 (and now Remastered). PvP experience is still better in other entries. Perhaps if one day FROM decides to remaster DS3 and add back some of the cut content, as well as revert poise to how it used to work in past games, when that happens it will be indeed a superb experience on par with past 2 games. Untill then it's a subpar ""just more dark souls, kinda"" game.As for build diversity - weapons being worse or better is good for an RPG. But some weapons being drastically better to the point of making whole weapon classes redundant/obsoleteis not healthy balance.As for meta builds - sure you can play with almost any build through game, but as soon as you hit PvP you will have certainly much worse experience than you could running objectively better build.But even then you wouldn't really want to run a build with heavy armor since it doesn't provide you much but requires lots of investment. From being generally and pretty universally useful in past titles, Poise (which is found on heavier armor types) transformed into highly situational and niche stat that demands to be played around instead of supplimenting the way *you* choose to play. In past titles having more poise was a really appealing option, and there was meaningful choise - you could sacrifice some damage for poise and it would pay off since it's universally useful for about any kind of build (maybe except full on glass cannons/builds that are built around never ever getting hit). In DS3 poise only works on particular moves during those moves and generally is restricted to massive-heavy part of weapons spectrum. To make use of it you would have to build your playstyle around forcing hyper armor trades with your opponent, and any decently smart player simply won't trade with heavy armored UGS opponent, because it's obvious who will come out on top should they attempt trading blows. It's just really poor design.===== This review was last updated on July 6, 2016 =====This game could be one of the best Dark Souls games. Really it could. But there are some things that are done way worse than they were even in the least loved by DkS community DkS2.I've tried to do my best at condencing this review and updating it.Weapon movesets. After DkS2 you would expect to see cool, diverse and unique weapon movesets. Wrong! Welcome to next-gen DkS game, where all weapon classes have 2 movesets at best for all the weapons. Boss Soul weapons? Nope, same boring and sometimes even bad movesets. Same goes for weapon AR values: most weapons can be just infused for quality and use that way, that leads to another problem - complete lack of build and weapon diversity.One could argue that ""there are different builds!"". Yes there are mage builds for example. Could just as well cound fashion souls build too, or cosplays! Majority of players pick quality build, and for a good reason - it is the most effective and universal one. Ofc there are caster builds or dex/str builds but they are much more rare and compared to quality - simply suboptimal.Weapon arts - while some are OKish. some are just disgustingly bad. Scythe weapon art in particular - about same windup as fully charged heavy attack, but way less damage and requires FP. Landing ""headshot"" adds a little more damage, but it still does way less than charged heavy, having same windup and readability. Greatswords have same weapon art as straight swords mostly (so ye, same weapon art for 2 weapon types). I would any day pick DkS2 parry on Greatsword L2 over the awful weapon art.Weapons balance - a lot of weapons are just plain better than others. Same goes for some weapon classes. Ofc it is souls game so you can play with any weapon and win, but why play with sword ""A"" over sword ""B"" if latter is only different from the other in stat scaling and has completely identical moveset?Poise. There was a lot of drama about it, but I will keep it short. As of right now poise is extremely situational, and one could say that wearing heavy armor is heavily punished in this game by making player sacrifice stat point into completely useless otherwise Vitality (that requires ridiculous investment compared to previous games). Fact that some NPC enemyes have properly working poise only serves as more salt on injury. Poise in DkS2 was working almost perfect after all the tuning done, and now we have this.A big step back from previous game in itemization. In past games you could get all weapons or armor you could see in game, with extremely few exceptions. In DkS3 there are quite a  number of unobtainable armors and weapons you will never get, some of them were just cut and are still present in game data.Absolutely same NG+ and on. One of few things DkS2 did right was NG+. It added not just dull ""more hp, more damage"" difficulty, but also new enemy placement and harder boss fight mechanics. Here it's just +X rings that you can loot.Covenants feel really shallow and oversimplified. There are 2 covenants that autoinvade to kill players, and if you forget about phantom color and ""currency"" name they are essentially exactly same. 2 Blue covenants that are almost exactly the same except a gimmick difference which doesn't really make much difference (oh, and blue eye orbs gone, so prepare to enjoy sitting for hours waiting to get summoned). Red and purple covenants are pretty much the same as well if they invade with minor difference of purples having a bit more options on how to complete invasion.Regional matchmaking - absolutely useless. On PC game has 2 regions - Japan and not-Japan. So pretty much all this matchmaking does is filtering out Japaneese players (which is actually yet to be confirmed) if you happen to have it on. Other than that - Australian players will get matched with European players or NA players just as likely as players that are actually are in the same region.Patchnotes quality - average patchnotes for DkS3 look like this: ""We did some tweaking to Axes, changed Swords a bit, and did some other stuff we do. Also some adjustments were made to Rapiers. Go ahead and guess what we actually did.""Overall I'm really disappointed in how DkS3 turned out to be, sure it is great single player(ish) experience for 1 time, but it betrays what Dark Souls was in so many ways by completely discoraging invasions (because in majority of invasions you will be facing 2 or 3 or even 4 man ganks) and should you die you will also leave your souls on the spot you got killed as invader! There are no arenas, no interesting tech in PvP, really boring weapons and bland armor, and rather weak underlying game mechanics.My advice: if you want Dark Souls PvP - play Dark Souls 2: SotFS. If you want to experience another chapter of Dark Souls - sure, this game sure does deliver at least on that, but once you're done with it - you're done with game. It is so unlike previous games in longevity, but it is what it is.My rating for this game as Dark Souls fan is:As another chapter of world story/lore - 8/10As a Souls series game with multiplayer - 2/10I would recommend waiting for FROM to finally decide what they want to do with game and fix at least some of these issues and buy it once it will come with all DLC and some GOTY version. Untill then - Dark Souls 2 is better Souls game."

Negative,"Was pretty decent until I got the notorious ""Invalid data"" message and now I am basically doomed to a softban for having done nothing wrong. Great Anti-cheat guys, So good that it even gets those pesky players who don't cheat.Update : I have recently been cleared of this anti-cheating flag and can resume playing the game.However the story is not the same for everyone, and I have since lost interest in the game due to being afraid to play at all if it would result in a soft-ban, barring me from the part of the game I enjoy most. The base game is fantastic with a few balance issues and optimization issues that I would normally recommend to people. However there is a lingering fear that should you continue playing this game online that you will someday be flagged or worse, soft banned while playing legitimately and until that is no longer an issue I will keep this a negative review."
Negative,"as a person who has lots of sex all the time, i can say that this game is 100% accurate to having sex with sexy women. like i do. everyday. this game did not make me horny however. i am not gay. i just have too much sex with real women to spend more than 15 minutes in this game. on the other hand i would recommend this game to people who do not have sex (unlike me because i have lots of sex with women a lot) as there is a naked woman in it and she is naked. she kinda looks like one of my many girlfriends who i have sex with a lot. i have lots of sex. i also an very handsome and women ALWAYS want to have sex with me because i am very muscular and handsome and very good at video games. all my girlfriends say im very good at sex and playing video games and being handsome. one of my girlfriends asked me to have sex with her but i told her i was playing a sex game instead so she started crying and became a lesbian and killed herself because i did not have sex with her. i have sex with women. not men. i am not gay. i am very cool and handsome so girls always have sex with me because i am very cool and sexy. my penis is very big. all my girlfriends like my penis because it is very big and i am very good at sex with my women. every woman ive had sex with is very sexy and so am i. i have lots of sex. i am also very handsome and sexy and i have lots of sex."
Negative,"A dangerous remote code execution (RCE) exploit found in Dark Souls 3 could let a bad actor take control of your computer, according to a report from Dexerto. The vulnerability only puts PC gamers who play online at risk and may potentially affect Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2, and the upcoming Elden Ring. Servers for various Dark Souls games have since been shut down in response.The exploit was seen in action during The__Grim__Sleeper’s Twitch stream of Dark Souls 3 online. At the end of the stream (1:20:22), The__Grim__Sleeper’s game crashes, and the robotic voice belonging to Microsoft’s text-to-speech generator suddenly starts criticizing his gameplay. The__Grim__Sleeper then reports that Microsoft PowerShell opened by itself, a sign that a hacker used the program to run a script that triggered the text-to-speech feature.RCE IS ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS VULNERABILITIESHowever, this likely wasn’t a malicious hacker — a screenshotted post on the SpeedSouls’ Discord may reveal the “hacker’s” actual intentions. According to the post, the “hacker” knew about the vulnerability and attempted to contact Dark Souls developer FromSoftware about the issue. He was reportedly ignored, so he started using the hack on streamers to draw attention to the problem.But if a bad actor discovered this problem first, the outcome could’ve been much worse. RCE is one of the most dangerous vulnerabilities, as noted by Kaspersky. It allows hackers to run malicious code on their victim’s computer, causing irreparable damage, and potentially stealing sensitive information while they’re at it.Blue Sentinel, a community-made anti-cheat mod for Dark Souls 3, has since been patched to protect against the RCE vulnerability. In a post on the r/darksouls3 subreddit, a user explains that (hopefully) only four people know how to execute the RCE hack — two of which are Blue Sentinel developers, and the other two are people “who worked on it,” possibly referring to the individuals who helped uncover the issue.A representative for Bandai Namco, Dark Souls’ publisher, commented on a Reddit post in response to the issue, stating: “Thanks very much for the ping, a report on this topic was submitted to the relevant internal teams earlier today, the information is much appreciated!” The Verge reached out to Bandai Namco with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back. I recommend to download the blue sentinel mod, report this to the software devs, don't recommend dark souls to anyone and don't pre purchase Elden ring until Software takes this situation seriously."

Negative,"Good game, but is PLAGUED with hackers that teleport, force instant death animations, prevent you from using separation crystal (forcing you to force close the game) and in other cases completely wiping ALL of your progress That's right, a hacker can invade you and simply erase countless hours of progress from your character. They can also force actions on your character that makes the game detect you as a cheater, penalizing you and BANNING you from online forever even though you didn't do anything. While this hasn't happened to me there are plenty of cases of it happening. I cannot recommend the game until this is handled properly by FromSoftware. A system where fair players get banned and hackers continue terrorizing the community is unacceptable."
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 is a great game for all who loved the series, and is especially more forgiving to newcomers. The game has a greater focus on gameplay and less emphasis on story, which basically means less talking and more killing. The PC port brings us better framerate and graphics, and that adds to the beauty of this gem. I definitely recommend anyone who wants a game with great mechanics to buy this game and play it...Offline.On the PC port, the online gameplay is utter cancer. How so many hackers are allowed to roam free without any repercussions is beyond me. You will literally despise being invaded or invading players that either clip through attacks, have infinite FP or stamina, or just ghost through the entire area, literally unkillable. How Steam or From allows this nonsense to go on unchecked and letting these hackers get away with all this is beyond me. I'm all for the modding community that wishes to mod their game, BUT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, LEAVE THAT FOR OFFLINE PLAY. Seriously, Steam...or From...anyone. Ban modded saves from being playable online and let people play in peace!....Oh. Other than that, this is a great game and you should definitely buy it for a great experience...Offline. Until those hacking bastards are banned from any online play."

Negative,"Why did they remove family sharing? Now if you get banned due to a hacker, you have no way of continuing to play unless you buy another copy with a different account? The hell are you smoking? A friend of mine got banned due to a hacker invading him and injecting him with illegal items, and he had to play using a family share account. And now that account is gone because you disabled family share? Is this your half assed way of dealing with hackers?"

Negative,"People are being softbanned by hackers. The game has literally no anti-cheating measures and was released with several bugs that have not been fixed a month after launch. Needless to say, this is a negative review. I do not recommend this game if you plan on playing multiplayer."
Negative,"New hack just bricks your save, sending you to NG+ and locking you in the starting area.Totally trash level network security and lack of support plus unavoidable multiplayer = unacceptable. The new hack makes the game unplayable online, since some sociopath can just destroy your save instantly. A friend of mine and I have been looking forward to co-op on this for months after doing DS1 and DS2. The day before we were going to start, the hack went public and now cheaters are bricking save files left and right. Bandai/Namco+Fromsoft were apparently warned about this exploit years ago and didn't care, and I'd take odds that it's not going to be fixed now.The base game is pretty good (played it on the PS4), but the absolutely trash level indifference about years of cheats and hacking from Bandai/Namco+Fromsoft, culminating in this latest horrible hack, is unacceptable. If I hadn't bought this so long ago I'd just get a refund."
Negative,"Why negative review? One word:HACKERS.The game is full of hackers using teleport, being impossible to touch (but they can heal their friends or kill you), players that insta kill you or put items in your inventory that will be detected as hacking and you'll get banned.So until the hacker problem is taken care of and permabans start happening, the game is not worth it.There are also other problems that make the game not worthwile if you plan to play online:LAGIt's unbearable. Luckily there's a matchmaking option but guess what: it doesn't work at all.Brazillian players will parry you no matter what.Russian players will teleport to your back.Japanese and Chinese players will hit you from the other side of the map.It's, literally, unplayable. It doesn't matter your connection, if you use cable or anything.So for all these troubles, it is not worth it unless you plan only to play PVE and offline."
Negative,"If you want to play online, be it with friends or to pvp, avoid it, recent updates made it quite possible for you to get banned with literally no way of restoring access to multiplayer, at least for free.

Negative,Thumbs down is not for the game itself but for the exploit that's currently ongoing. Hackers can get you into ng+ and by doing that your ds3 account can get softbanned. I recommend playing offline until this is fixed. My thumbsdown will stay down until this gets fixed.https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/n1235k/potential_pc_security_exploit_spreading/#bandainamcofixexploit
Negative,"Here's how your experience with DS3 will go if you buy it:You'll get invaded by a hacker that injects invalid items into your inventory and immediately kills you.The save system will trigger since you died, and the game's servers will detect an invalid item in your inventory.You'll then get banned a week later from online play because a cheater messed up your save file.And as of today, bandai namco has stopped allowing DS3 to be family shared, so if this happens to you, there is nothing you can do to fix your game.Do you want to be unable to play a game you played 60 bucks for online?  Then buy dark souls 3 right now!"
Negative,"This is a fantastic game that I would recommend to everyone, if not for one thing:The state of online play. The game is plagued by hackers, capable of not only instantly killing other players, but corrupting their game files, or getting them banned by inserting invalid data into their account. With the ability to invade another player's game, encountering these cheaters isn't even something you have control over. I've just recently been banned in online play because OTHER players are cheating. Apparently Bandai Namco's anti-cheat is incapable of stopping actual cheating, but punishes victims without any issue."
Negative,"They are actively working against the modding community by disabling family share preventing people from playing the game on alt accounts to avoid having their primary account banned for using mods that add more content to the game (like ""Champion's Ashes"" which adds a lot of cut items and bloodborn content to the game for PVP or ""Cinders"" which overhauls and rebalances the game. They might try to pass this off as something done to stop cheaters but they have been able to get other players banned without the anti-cheat tagging them for a long time. The choice of making this change right after a sale really makes it obvious that their trying to force players to pay full price if they want to use mods without banning their main account.and to rub salt into the wound, if a hacker adds illegal items to your character and gets it banned, it is permanently blacklisted from the servers, not even rolling it back will do anything."
Negative,"I just got the game so I don't have too much time into it yet, but I do want to express something important.  First, I love the Dark Souls games.  I feel they surpass most games in sheer artistic value and atmosphere and their ability to draw you into the game and make you care for it.   The art design guys should all get medals and baubles and goodly things.   I specifically wanted to give a not recommended vote here as a gesture and demonstration, because I think for an established franchise like this, that makes very good money, it's sheer laziness and unacceptable to refuse to make a decent PC port, with 2016 frame rates, and not forcing me to find a mod somewhere and use some crazy key binding so I can do some basic moves like jump attack or kick with my keyboard and mouse.  It's not like you haven't seen the comments EVERYWHERE since dark souls 1, come on, don't be cheap, don't be lazy, make it right.  Be a stand up game developer guy; say hey, we sell a lot of these games on Steam for the PC, so let's do it right, yes many play games with controllers even on the PC, but many don't, so let's give people an actual choice.  If some kid somewhere can make a mod to make this work, so can you.  Or better yet, pay the guy some money and buy his programming wizardry from him and put it in your game if you can't figure it out.   Now here's what I mean by lazy... the game recognizes I'm playing with a keyboard, because that's what I have in my settings.  So I'm walking around through the intro, where they have signs on the ground that tell you what buttons do what... and it's press triangle, press left bumper , press O, seriously?  It's that hard to change the message so it matches the actual device the game knows I'm using so it can give me the correct keys?  Heck I can do that for you and the only programming I took was some Basic and Pascal in College.  Give me 10 hours and a box of Twinkies and a connection to the net and I guarantee I can  fix that for you.  In conclusion, great game, and I WILL love it.  It's successful, and it deserves to be.  But be a standup developer guy, take a bit of that money, and make the game right for ALL the devices.  Thank you.  But yes, people should still buy it."
Negative,I regret investing in bank shares instead of stocking dark souls 3 keys.

Negative,"I don't remember ever playing this game, but Steam says I have, so here's what I have to say. PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, PUT THESE GAMES ON SALE. And don't BS us with anything less than a 50% sale, considering the sales that have happened in the past."
Negative,"This game is a very fun game, and I loved every second of it. However, FROM SOFT has ruined the game for me. 1. Softbaning. According to the anti-cheat software shoving its head up its ass I, and many, many other players, have been softbanned for no reason. CO-OP does not really exist for me any more, and apparently the invaders have given up on trying to get me as well. I'm basically playing a single player version of a multiplayer game because of some formatting error. On top of all that I deleted my main character because I thought it would fix the error message. So there goes 30 hours of my time, FROM, I hope you're happy. 2. Glitches. This game is riddled with glitches. Some of them allow enemies and other creatures to hop around the screen and attack you at lighning speed in seconds. It was not a framerate issue, it just happened for me. My game would sometimes give me delayed responces as well. Sometimes I would try to roll, but it would not happen. I did the most logical thing and tried to roll again, and I just ended up rolling twice. It was NOT a framerate issue. 3. Online Play. I'm not going to lie. My internet connection is not the best, but I get a decient ammount of bandwith that I have little to no trouble with playing other games in multiplayer mode. Most of, if not all, the games that I invaded orwas summoned into had Lagasaurous-Rex teir lag. Players would SLIDE across the screen in their idle position whilst making damaged gasps and attacking sounds. Enemies and BOSSES would revert to these stances whenever my host was attacked by them. It was incredably easy for me to backstab every enemy due to the extreme lag on FROM's servers. The worst part was the invaders and the bosses. Invaders would do the same thing as the host while attacking in their idle position. invasions turned into a spam fest because no one could tell what the others were doing. When bosses became like this I could not be damaged. I don't know if it was the fact that the boss was nowhere near me due to lag or the fact that an animation had to hit me to damage me. I don't know. However, the fact that this happened is outrageous for a game. Conclusion. Don't buy this game until it has been fixxed. Otherwise you may be banned for no reason, thus limiting the game, become frusterated when glitches ruin your fun, and generally become confused when everyone is in their freaking idle position."
Negative,"Steam still charging $60 for a game that still doesn't have online working and is 6 years old.Great game, but what the heck. Online content doesn't work, don't buy unless on sale. I don't know how you can charge full price for a game that's this old and missing content. Shame."
Negative,"I feel that this game should have answered questions and helped to wrap up the series. But instead the game is just littered with references to the other games, which would be fine if it was done in moderation. Also the overall linearity of the game and lack of viable build variety is going to ruin replayability. The only reason you'd have to replay the game would be to attempt completing the finicky ""quests"" which are so asinine that there's almost no point other than achievement hunting. If you're desperate for more Souls, I suppose you might enjoy this a little bit."
Negative,"Warning: This game does not have multiplayer anymore.Fix and restore multiplayer support as soon as possible, FromSoft."
Negative,I hate this game so much that I completed it 6 times. 2/10
Negative,"I lost my life to this game, would not recommend"
Negative,"This game, to this day, still doesn't have cloud saves."
Negative,Can't sex Aldrich + can't oil up Lothric
Negative,"Removing a fundamental portion of the game, that is multiplayer, and still selling for retail price is not ""recognizing a problem"". It's abandoning the game, over an agenda for a more modern game.More detailed review soonTM."
Negative,"Great game just a real shame that hackers can force hacked items into your inventory thus getting you banned with no warning and no hope of getting it undone. Now this was already an issue and has been pretty much the whole lifetime of the game but recently Fromsoft/Namco Bandai removed the family and friends sharing option which was the only real defence you had for not getting your legit copy banned by sharing the game and playing it through a separate account so when/if you get banned though a third party acting maliciously you could still play the game as intended. (though it would normally cost you the current save as well up until your last manual backup assuming you though far enough ahead to manually back up your saves for an online game . . . )This only really harms legit players as hackers were already getting around the item checks and ban waves anyway and have been for a long time.Also, this means that anyone using legit mods (as in mods not made for cheating in PvP but changing the game itself adding more challenge e.c.t) now has a choice of playing the vanilla game as intended or using mods and catching a ban for doing so.This was a poor choice and really makes me think less of Fromsoft/Namco Bandai and makes me wonder if they will pull stuff like this further down the line with things like Elden ring."
Negative,Removed multiplayer because there is an exploit on pc.Meanwhile Xbox and Playstation continue to be allowed to use multiplayer and co-op.This issue has been going on for 4+ months now without any updates from Software anymore.Multpiplayer/Online co-op tags have been removed from this page.
Negative,"Im going to start off by saying this is a review of the games PvP/PvE aspect and the feedback the community has gotten from Fromsoft. If you are only playing this game for the story and are not interested in any of the semantics than I whole heartedly recommend this game to you.Going to start off with a series of pros and cons.-PROS--Gameplay is very fast paced and fluid, I have never had a problem with my movement being stunted or interrupted at all-Weapons are very diverse and there are alot of choices this time around, albeit a bit less than Dark Souls 2-Every weapon has a very satisfying moveset that really feels like the hits impact and connect-Enemies are very memorable and so is every bossfight-The levels are very diverse and the final boss was the best boss I have probably ever fought in a videogame.Now here comes the cons.-CONS--Incredibly vague patch notes that literally say nothing in terms of information, ie ""Performance adjustment for Greatsword"" what did you fucking adjust???-Magic requires a huge stat investment to even consider being viable, Im talking 40-60+ Int/Faith to even START doing any type of damage, and even then the spell ""Farron Dart"" doesnt even 1 shot the starting enemies, it takes TWO. And not to mention that anyone with half a brain can dodge a spell in PvP.-Straightswords are literally the best weapons in the game, there is no point in even using anything else because anything other than a rapier or a straightsword is a complete waste of time and effort because unless you are incredibly consistent at parrying you will ALWAYS get R1 spammed down.-Invasions are also a complete waste of time considering that Estus is virtually unpunishable unless you keep CONSTANT pressure, the host has 30% more hp and TWICE the Estus flasks and literally infinite phantoms (Coop players) to summon and just wittle you down until you finally die, and at that point if you do somehow manage to kill all of them, the host will just disconnect. Not to mention that you can't even use the games enemies to your advantage because Seeds of a Giant Tree (Items that turn enemies hostile to invaders, they normally are not) are so fucking easy to get.-Poise is completely non existant, allowing someone who is wearing a greatshield and the heaviest armor in the fucking game to get staggered by an enemy with a fucking dagger, when Fromsoft was asked about this, all they had to say was, “The poise stat is working as intended and is not ‘turned off’ as some fans have theorized,” a spokesperson for Bandai Namco told me. “The stat works differently than in past games and is more situational, which seems to be the reason for the confusion.” Even though the stat is literally DISABLED in the games code.-Straightswords have literally twice the hitbox than the visual length, and can hit you from what seems like 10 feet away when they are clearly swinging at the air. And no, Im not talking about phantom range, Im literally talking about the hitbox. Outranging even some Ultra Greatswords in length.In short, fix your fucking game FromSoft."
Negative,"It's 2022 and Dark Souls III still has ongoing issues involving Remote Code Execution. Malicious parties are able to remotely execute arbitrary code on your PC, which exposes you to a whole range of serious security issues. Playing this game while online is genuinely putting your PC's security and private information at risk. Avoid."

Negative,"Until the extremely obvious issues regarding online play gets fixed (they won't), don't buy."
Negative,Bad PC port. does not have full keybinding control. Frustrating when killed due to keybinds that cannot be changed.
Negative,"Edit: 5/5/2016 My review will be negative and it's gonna stay negative until From Software / BANDAI NAMCO adresses the issues allowing hackers to soft ban inocent players using the same lousy anti-cheat system it has proven to fail before, outdate and useless, until the wave of ppl softbanned STOP, i will NOT recommend this game to anyone and i will try to prevent ppl from buying this game until the anticheat system works properly.(Old Review)Today's Review: Dark Souls IIIOverview: Dark Souls III is the third delivery of the franchise (leaving aside Demon Souls) from the developer From Software for PC and consoles. This third (and supposed to be the last souls ever) boost overall what has been done in the past, for me at least raising the bar for fans and newcommers alike. Many will buy this game not fully getting that's basically a hardcore game, pretty much old school in the way that is meant to reward you for your hard efford, the game have 1 set difficulty and you will have to struggle, maybe coop with friends and try countless times until you get the grip of it, eventually you'll understand the mechanic of the game and you will die in ocations but in the end this is a really amazing journey within a story that i still don't fully understand, before i forget this is an Action RPG game, third person and for new ppl this is NOT something to take it lightly.First steps: At first when you start to understand what's an unkindled, a hallow, a lord of cinder, you will start playing a souls game, you will admire beautiful landscapes, amazing scenes while playing and cutscenes that are really well made until you get frustrated by being killed by any single enemy alone in the game, yet with perseverance comes strenght, you will succed if you keep trying, you will see the amazing many places this game have (tho linear, really restricted) and the amazing bosses and INCREDIBLE soundtrack, the gameplay for me was made to use a controller rather that the keyboard but that's up to you and one final thing, optimization has been done really good but the game's frames drops sometimes so it would be nice a patch to adress those issues.Final note: i have so much to say about the souls games and this one in particular, i might update this review later, for me this game it's a bit expensive at the moment but if you're looking for a challange then this is a great game. I'm happy i've got this one.Metascore: 82/100 ""Give it a try, if you don't mind losing your souls, unkindled one :)"""
Negative,"Whilst I really like this game, I cannot recommend anyone buying it. There is a serious exploit making the rounds online that lets hackers mess up your save game really bad and Bamco and FromSoftware have been made aware of it a long time ago and they have chosen not to patch it. So unless you use 3rd party software to protect yourself from hackers, you are putting your save game to serious risk every time you engage in online play. Not to mention the plethora of older exploits and hacks that have not been patched. Fix your game From, this is not acceptable."
Negative,Lost to menu
Negative,deacons too hard. i broke my monitor fuck
Negative,didnt even meet Dark Soul
Negative,fix the thing and bring the online servers back to us
Negative,"I actually very much enjoy this game and wish for many others to play it even now... The only reason I give it a thumbs down is because ""From Software"" neglects the PC players tremendously. There's hackers still in pvp that not only can use normal cheats, but crash your game through animation spamming that overloads your framerate and even WORSE than that.... they can put items that are bannable into your inventory such as ""20 Storm Rulers"". No weapon goes beyond +10, so when you log in, the game detects ""unusual data"" and automatically bans you from being able to play. From Software has nothing to combat this and will take quite a while to unban you assuming you even have proof.Aside from that, PVP in this game, while fun... is kinda past its prime. Everyone's been playing this game for years already, the community agreed level cap of 120 goes overrated because people will new game plus and setup areas that are invaded frequently to become these ""fight clubs"". It gets really annoying being an Aldritch Faithful covenant member wanting to PVP when someone's in the territory, only to find out they cleared every mob and have 3 friends with them that were pre-summoned level 900+'s just looking for an easy gank. It kinda exploits the system and makes any genuine fun you'd get out of intentional designs, a bit hit and miss.... I love invading and being invaded, but the system is very easily exploitable and not well designed.The story won't make sense at all, even if you've played the other 2 dark souls since every NPC's dialogue is cryptic and written with assumed context of you knowing what's even happening. You WILL spend mountains of time googling everything, from story to content you missed because it's very poorly explained.... which is a good thing and bad thing imo. It creates a more genuine RPG feel but neglects the player's ability to understand or displays rather bad ""conveyance"". How are you supposed to know its your responsibility to do even half the things the NPC's say when half of them are just rambling about what you should do but are not actually capable of right?It's still a really fun game and I'll still be playing it, but From Software needs to take this down vote and realize they need to add anti-cheat software when it comes to PC games. Not only that but the balance in this game is.... very questionable as the META ruins a LOT of pvp encounters you may have and even some of the PVE.Something to add.... The playerbase is mostly toxic and meme based. Every name you come across is a meme, no one plays this game like an actual RPG, they just read it like a math exam and name themselves one of the following....""bruh""""dude""""Something Racist + word""""Praise the Insert Meme here""""dddddddddd""""12345678""""Cosplay as anime or character in game""I'm not much against the last one but damn after a while this just gives you an actual headache when you realize everyone treats this game like it's made specifically for memes... I miss when RPG's actually enveloped players and they were immersed in the environment they were in over being able to wave their shield button 90 times and throw dung to imply ur ""bad""."
Negative,why the fuck this game does not have a cloud system on saves.
Negative,60$ in 2023
Negative,"Bandai Namco: Responsible for a half-ass poorly optimized port of a game and acting as enablers for hackers and cheaters. They also seem hesitant on fixing either one of these issues, and, instead, blaming their consumers.I thought you were better than this, Bandai. Come on. Placing the blame on players for taking advantage of an in-game feature that's MEANT to be taken advantage of? Seriously? I don't care how good your game is if you're gonna be that irresponsible with it, this level of laziness and negligence cannot be condoned.Edit: Is everyone marking the review as ""not helpful"" looking at nothing but the red thumbs down and the playtime, and ignoring what the actual review says? Seriously. Again, I don't ""hate the game"" like some people are suggesting, I hate Bandai's management of it and find a large part of its functionality and content not worth the risk of using because of the way they're doing things. It's the equivalent of serving people frozen or undercooked food in a restaurant and then saying ""oh, well, you should've checked the food more thoroughly and brought a portable microwave before buying"" after they complain. Developers should not be allowed to place the blame of their own malfunctioning products on the buyers."
Negative,"I have to say, genuinely, this is such a good game, and DS3 is the most quality version in PC platform.However, I hope I am not the only one who wants to critisie its file checking system, which results in so many true fans of DS3 got soft banned or even permenantly banned.Why? Because so many cheaters not only happy with editing their own files but also want to do so to others. They are able to use such as CE to craft a weapon which is not belong to the game, and this kind of weapon can achieve consequences like one-shot kill or 'back to level-1'. This very negative phenomenon causes many legal players banned by the system mentioned above when it identifies any 'invalid' date in their own files.What makes me even angry is, the game operators do not give a shit about it, especially for the customers in PC. They even stated that this is only our faults to 'play with' or 'recieve gifts from' thoes inappropiate players. However, could you plz tell me how can I avoid being invaded by these players? How can I know they are the ones? Someone might argue that  YOU CAN JUST TRUN OFF THE ON-LINE PLAY OPTION. Yes, I can, if the online content is optional, I would rather ask a refund for castrating this content off.To sum up, if you really love this game and you like pvp and/or any other online game-plays,  PC VERSION IS THE LAST OPTION."
Negative,This is a great game but the online dueling community is swarmed with hackers that will make your account get banned. I talked to support any they told me there is nothing they can do to unban my account because the main company is based in Japan. Very unfortunate that this amazing game is getting gutted by hackers on pc with no fix in site.. If you must play this game I recommend offline but most of the content is made for online so you will feel lonely and like you are playing an incomplete game.Really hope Elden ring doesn't do the same auto ban system.Hackers are able to fill your character up with hacked items once you join their world. And even if you delete them right away you will still be flagged and banned.
Negative,"Good game, don't get me wrong.. but with the seemingly random performance problems some people have, the issue of fromsoft banning people for no reason and their total lack of feedback or customer service, I can't in good faith give this a recommended."
Negative,"IDIOT BANDAI NAMCOGreat game with terrible online. Full of hackers and company didn't do anything to prevent that.Don't play online!!!! YOU WILL GET BANNED.Hackers can force sshhhhiiitttt into your inventory, break your save and permanently ban you from online servers.What a Fffuuuucccckkkking embarrassment.Cheaters are too rampart to enjoy the game, and they can put cheated items into your inventory, causing you to be softbanned, along with the cheaters.hackers started to easily spawn you and put hacked items in your inventory, corrupting your game files.It is extremely frustrating and makes the game almost impossible to play online. You should not buy the game if you are planning to play it online.I did my research and found that FromSoftware does not respond to complaints like this and the ban is permanent."
Negative,Every moment I spend in this game I come closer to ending my life
Negative,rip online features
Negative,"Developers disabled family share for this game, after it has been working fine for years"
Negative,"Honestly, I'm not a big fan of Dark Souls III. Truth be told, I kinda hate it. I'll say now that most of this is probably personal bias.To me, this game feels a lot more artifically harder than it needs to be. The lack of any hitstun from just wearing armour can be bloody unbearable sometimes, like when some tosser hits you with a knife and your guy staggers as if he just got hit by a bloody bomb while wearing full metal plated armour. And yeah, there are hyper frames when you swing with Great/Ultra Great weapons, I know.The melee combat is fine, obviously. It's a souls game, simple if you just boil it down to it's basics which would be ""press circle/b when bad man swings, press r1 to hit when bad man no swing"" just like the other games. The spell casting is different this time around, and I kinda enjoy it. It's probably one of the few reasons why I occasionally revisit this game. I find a fair amount of enjoyment rolling around a boss and throwing a massive orb of fire in their face, or slamming a lightning stake right into the feet whenever I get the moment to.The progression isn't too bad, I suppose? Upgrade Materials are fed out at a reasonable rate, though I dislike how rare infusion gems are. You get like what, one lightning gem the entire game unless you're willing to farm Lothric Knights? Good luck with that though. There doesn't seem to be many options early/mid game, either. The game might be a little rough early game if you pick a caster as a starting class, and dear lord pyromancer starts off with some awful stats which is fair enough I suppose since they also start off with pyromancy and high faith/int.The weapon arts are also new, kinda. Every weapon has some kinda gimmick attached  to it that you can use when two handing, many straight swords have a Stance that allows you to break guards if you land the hit or close the distance with a lunge, some weapons can buff themselves, and some weapons have completely unique weapon arts. Weaponarts use FP, and to restore that you'll mostly be using Ashen Estus to restore that and you'll have to carefully balance what amount of Estus you convert into Ashen Estus to use both weapon arts and spells which is fair enough I suppose. Spells can demolish bosses pretty quick so you'll have to give up some healing to kill em with just spells, so carrying 20 soul spears and 20 estus (exaggeration, but still.)I don't really know what else to say, to be honest. It's a decent game I guess but I still kinda hate it. Maybe it's just not what I'd expect from a souls game or maybe I'm just awful. So maybe you'll like it, maybe you won't. Just keep in mind it is difficult at times and, in my opinion, it feels ""Hard"" for the sake of being ""Hard"" rather than challenging.And dear GOD the first DLC is bloody dreadful. It's short, some of the enemy encounters are just outright unfair and awful. DLC2 is.. eh, I didn't like it. I suppose it's just more dark souls 3, really. Though it did have one boss I enjoyed, who was Gael. He's a pretty good fight and I had a lot of fun with that boss."
Negative,Fix the damn servers.
Negative,F*ck Fromsoft. I pirated Elden Ring
Negative,"read this for god's sakehttps://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/n7kj0r/lost_all_story_progress_due_to_a_hacker/Play offline or look into the online network exploitation/shit hackers can do to you before you even consider buying this game. In its current state, to my knowledge, literally any hacker can 'invade' your world at any time and completely wipe your progress/get you banned. Potentially, they can brick your computer and fuck with your shit. This is not a review on the game itself, but rather the horrible negligence from the higher ups at From Software who don't seem to grasp the effect these kinds of breaches can have. If you have any concerns about your cyber security whatsoever, don't get it.My experience: Started a new game, got to the first area I could co op with a friend so we could play together, and within an hour we were invaded and had both of our games reset to the opening cutscene. Upon investigation we found out the extent this exploitation can go, and how From Software has seemed to completely ignore this problem for fucking years.You know who knew about it for years? A small portion of the playerbase, specifically Luke Yui who has developed Blue Sentinel, an unofficial anti-cheat software that identifies and protects against these exploits. Let me repeat: An independent, willing fan has developed software for free that fixes a totally glaring issue with the game. Luke has tried alerting From Soft to these issues, but despite his and every ticket submitted all this shit just gets swept under the rug. Basically:1. From Soft has not fixed the issues themselves despite being aware of them.2. From Soft doesn't direct players to download Blue Sentinel despite being aware of it.3. From Soft doesn't even warn you about the network issues with their game despite being aware of them.Yeah, you made a fucking sick game. Why the fuck are you leaving it open for my computer to get bricked? Even if it hasn't happened yet, it WILL happen. And once it happens it will happen to others. Whyyyyy the hell would you allow yourselves that possibility? Just incorporate Blue Sentinel or design your own shit. Let people know the problems they could encounter. Apparently this sort of thing is infrequent, but I had this happen within two hours. Could you imagine if I had played upwards of 40, and THEN had it happen? Even putting my computer's integrity aside, that sort of thing just doesn't fly. So what? It's up to the players to fix your shit? And to inform other players? Cool, well I wasn't informed. Just ranting at this point but whatever I posted that link that's better than this shit. Understand I'm pretty reasonably pissed off. I wish there was more noise around this, it's been going on for so long.Oh, and yeah, refunded."
Negative,"This is a beautiful game.  The artwork is superb, the fighting mechanics are nearly perfect, and the story is fascinating if you take the time to search out the clues.  The game is quite hard, but oh so satisfying when you progress through it.  However, the community of PVPers are for the most part horribly rude, there are issues of rampant cheating on the PC version of this game, and there is really no viable way to avoid the endless invasions by cheaters and non-cheaters alike if you want to play this game with a friend.  And that is the point, if you want the PVE coop experience do NOT buy this game.  I bought this game for myself and a couple of friends so we could play together. I played it offline (which is obviously solo) and loved it.  I  played online by myself and the invasion frequency was  tolerable and I actually had fun at times.  However, when I played coop, it was one invasion after another; it took forever just to advance the story.  Now if you want to play PVP go for it; the PVP is actually excellent.  If you want to play solo offline go for it, like I stated earlier, the game is beautiful and satisfying.  But, if you want to play coop with friends for the PVE experience it will just suck plain and simple.  I will not recommend this game because FROM software has an elitist attitude about this game and punishes coop PVE players.  Recently they just patched the game to make invasions occur even more frequently so now in coop all you will be doing is playing PVP; frankly, it sucks.  I am sure I will get alot of hate for this review, and the hate is strong from the Dark Souls 3 PVP crowd, but I believe the issue must be stated.  Thanks for taking the time to read this if you did.  Have a great day."
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 is a pretty decent single player game.The enemies are varied, the boss fights are engaging, the level design is great. I prefer Dark Souls 1 level design in particular, however, because teleporting was not an option until much later in the game; it made you feel like you were truly exploring the world, and everything was connected. Comparatively, you are now required to teleport to get to the first actual level in this game, and to subsequent levels. Teleporting was very seldom a requirement in Dark Souls 1.The way multiplayer/PVP is balanced is horrid.Sure, co-op with friends is good. Just as it always has been in the Souls series, when you look at the co-op aspect by itself. However there is a major problem. Now more than ever in this game series, invaders are urged to twink (at lower levels). Here's why: 99% of the time, invaders are matched with players who already have co-op phantoms in their world. Yes, the invading system favors hosts who already have their buddies with them, ready to gank your invading ass back to your world. Coupled with the covenant system where blue defenders can show up and gank you even harder, it's no wonder why invaders twink. They have to twink in order to win. And when these twink players invade a player and his friend who are playing normally, with no upgraded equipment and early-game gear, they become casualities to this idiotic system.When it comes to PVP at higher levels... Well, let's just say it's not fun. Since there is no poise as we're used to from DS1 (and to a lesser extent 2), and since shields are pretty useless except for a very small percentage, PVP is a roll-fest. Have full Havel's on? Prepare to get stunned by bare fists. You wanna use a shield below a greatshield? You better be ready to become a parry king through guesswork, or get shield broken and take repost damage. By the way, when it comes to armor, heavy and light are now not viable. The only truly optimal armor to wear is medium. It provides the best amount of defense in the game for the least amount of weight. Miyazaki got the title wrong, this should have been named Bloodborne 2.I say that because it's a game completely focused on dodging. You are encouraged to dodge, and that idea is exemplified by the fact that you basically have fast rolls until 70% weight ratio. Rolling is simply absurdly over powered and is essentially a core gameplay aspect. Regarding shields, all but greatshields are useless. All parry options now have a windup before the actual parrying window starts, and combined with the fact that attacks from enemies are much faster than in DS1, it's much harder to parry on reaction, if not impossible.Overall,I'd say if you want to play the newest Dark Souls game simply for the sake of it being a part of the Souls' series, do it. But if you're going to be playing, be prepared for what I have described."
Negative,I can't fucking see
Negative,Quit punishing your veteran players and bring back the multiplayer!!!
Negative,Too many scary parts
Negative,Its a great game but as long as hackers can destroy your playthourgh by invading and giving you hacked items you can not delete which makes ds3 ban your account you should stay away from this game.
Negative,"The price change is a damn joke, it's now more expensive than Elden Ring in Brazil...DS3 is a great game but this is just stupid..."
Negative,great game pls fix servers ;(
Negative,"The game was great, but following the update in 2022 that restored connectivity to online play my saves were corrupted and I cannot create new ones due to some kind of file writing bug. I cannot even enter the main menu and have been unable to resolve this issue. What a shame."
Negative,"Dark Souls III is one of those few games that I love dearly, but can’t recommend to everyone because of a number of different issues that bring the experience down. Fans of the series can possibly interpret my review as an overall positive experience, but new folks will need to consider the game more carefully. Hopefully, some of my gripes have already been addressed by developers. Let’s begin with the performance.Dark Souls 3 continues the tradition of having areas that drop frames. It was a mostly stable 60fps experience for me, but dropping frames didn’t do me any favors when I was carefully timing my movements. The frame drops weren’t restricted to one area either. I had this problem over the entire course of the game. Some areas in the later portion of the game were really horrid. What also made me really sour was whenever I lost connection to their servers, I’d be booted back to the title screen instead of just going into offline mode. I’ve seen this happen during a boss fight. I also had a few crashes, but they were rare enough to not be a serious problem. Finally, I joined a significant number of other players’ worlds as a friendly phantom only to not be able to enter the boss’s fog door. For reference, I am using a GTX 970 and an i7 4790K with 8 GBs of RAM and Windows 7.The combat in the game is very familiar if you’ve played the previous games, but the weapon variety and weapon skills help spice things up. Wielding a weapon with both hands lets you use its weapon skill which can be anything from a special parry, firing three arrows rapidly, summoning lightning, having a new strong attack combo, a quickstep, or even giving yourself a temporary attack buff. Having more tools to handle a situation is a plus in my book and this game’s implementation of it gives melee players an incentive to put the shield away. Weapon skills being available on every single weapon made combat feel much more entertaining, especially when the boss weapons have some of the boss techniques on them. I didn’t engage much with spellcasting since I heard it required a lot of specialization. Pyromancy is still very accessible for characters, powerful, and looks great. The magic buffs in general are also well worth the effort to acquire for melee characters.However, the combat has significant flaws. Poise doesn’t do what you would expect. Poise didn’t keep me from being staggered by attacks and no matter how much poise I stacked, even the weakest hollows could stagger me without much effort. Because of how poise works in this game, heavy armor doesn’t feel like it’s protecting you as much since stun locks can still happen. I believe some spells and definitely some weapon skills can increase your poise to prevent stagger to allow uninterrupted attacks. For example, the Black Knight Sword has a skill called Perseverance which says “Raise sword… to temporarily boost poise. Damage reduced while activated.” When this skill is used, you can avoid any staggering effects and attack without restraint. Notice how it says it’s raising poise, yet any poise gained from any wearable equipment cannot avoid being staggered. They should have renamed the stat because of how confusing and misleading it is to have two different kinds of poise with very different effects. From what I read, regular poise has to do with vulnerability frames (not i-frames) with rolling. I suppose that’s what they want from players, more rolling.The second major problem with combat is how the walls interact with players and enemies. You’ll soon discover that as you try to attack through a solid object, you’ll recoil from the impact. This recoil can occur when fighting near pillars or walls and makes sense when it happens. You don't have Kitty Pryde's phasing abilities. On the other hand, enemy attacks will ignore walls and strike you for full damage. I’ve only seen enemy phantoms and two very large enemies recoil from trying to attack through walls or objects. One of those large enemies threw a chain axe through about 14 feet of wall and managed to hit me. There were far too many instances where enemies could attack through extremely thick walls or obstacles and still hurt you. I wanted tough, but fair, not this nonsense. I’ve even seen some enemies shoot projectiles through walls. I don’t understand why enemies are allowed to ignore solid matter to such a degree. I don’t remember if the other games had this enemy behavior, but it’s really obvious in this installment. At least the boss combat is pretty good.The boss fights in DSIII are very well paced and are much more memorable than DSII. There are less bosses which appears to have resulted in higher quality fights with unique and interesting movesets. The overly humanoid setup of DSII didn’t make a comeback for this title. I enjoyed most of the fights and found myself pleasantly surprised at what the bosses brought to the table. Sometimes, the fights can change in a way that I’ll not spoil here. I liked how they were designed, both mechanically and visually.Speaking of visuals, Dark Souls III is the best looking one in the series. It’s a gorgeous game with gorgeous views. The environments also tie together pretty well. You can’t exactly travel to all the places by foot, but if you can see it, you can probably go there. I greatly enjoyed how you can constantly see places that you’ve been to in the background which gives a good sense of progress and where you are in the world. Seeing what’s up ahead and thinking “Oh man, do I get to go there too?” is another thing that DSIII does very well. Here’s an example of what I mean from very, very early in the game:I’d also like to point out that there’s no impossible elevator à la Dark Souls II.Multiplayer is fairly pleasant, but From Software’s approach to handling cheaters doesn’t seem like the best approach, mostly because of how the innocent are soft-banned along with the guilty. Be sure to never, ever accept an item from a stranger, but unfortunately, sometimes that may not even be enough. In addition to that issue, some of the covenants have difficulty finding hosts. The game’s matchmaking seems too restrictive which doesn’t make sense since it’s capable of scaling players down to the host’s level. If you go and reach a high level with a character, be prepared to have a really difficult time reaching certain covenant ranks. The password matchmaking is quite good and allows friends to easily play with other friends.  Just make sure you both spell the password exactly the same. I spent a large portion of my time engaging in jolly cooperation. I also did deliberate pvp which was also a good deal of fun. The multiplayer functions mostly and it’s fun, but it carries the risk of contracting a digital STD. No one wants to be soft-banned unjustly. Yeesh.Whew, here are some other things that affected my time with DSIII: I’ve seen my friendly phantoms die to an invader after I finished watching a boss intro cutscene, the patch notes for this game are vague to the point of being almost useless, the camera will sometimes work against you if you’re too close to a wall, and the game has plenty of nods to the previous titles that sometimes turn into full body spasms.I really enjoyed Dark Souls 3, but hoo boy did I also grow frustrated with the game. I uninstalled and reinstalled it several times before finally keeping it uninstalled. I just grew tired of the problems it has, but I do acknowledge that there’s still a great game in there to be experienced. It’s just a darn shame that they went with the decisions they did that prevent the game from reaching its full potential. I was almost done with NG+ too. If you can look past its issues, prepare to buy."
Negative,"Let me Preface with thisI am a huge fan of Dark Souls and Bloodborne, (I've sunk well over 1k hours into each) I have played the second DS and didn't like it (Big suprise) and was looking forward to this one with optimisim and was hugely dissappointed Dark Souls 3 Is unbalancedI feel as if I am playing an early build where tweaking and rebalancing is in its early stages,Keep in mindI have multiple max all stat (all 99) characters I went to NG+9 and invested many hours into this game(Note I do not have very much PVP experience but I do have some. I am mostly reffering to Offline play in this review)1) Poise is non existant and worthless.Poise was a major factor in combat in DS 1. It allowed you to take hits without being staggered; if you had a high enough poise value. This allowed you to effectively trade blows with Mobs and Players. You could initiate an attack and not be staggered during the animation. Hyper armor is present in DS3 but it's situational at best. This leads to stunlock gameplay. The best/ultimate/only viable strategy for PvE is to equip all light armor and a weapon with good range and wide sweeping attacks to stagger every enemy in the vacinity and stun lock all of them. I.E. in the Boreal valley I used all light armor and the Wolf knight Great Sword to stagger ever enemy encounter before they staggered me and I got through the area unscathed. However if I tried to use heavier armor and trade blows I would loose everytime. So why bother using heavy armor at all? This brings up two more issues. Sheilds being useless, and enemy aggression/overall combat pacing.2)Shields. Sheilds have alway been a very usefull offensive and defensive item in previous souls games. The ability to throw up a shield and block an attack was invaluable. Enemy's blows could bounce off your shield and staggr your opponent creating an opening for you. Depending on the sheild taking a blow would not consume much stamina. However in DS3 I was onlyable to take 2 or 3 hits before my gaurd was broken on most normal sheilds. Thiswouldn't be a problem if the enemies werent so aggressive, but more on thatlater. The offensive side to sheilds in previous souls games in the Parry/Riposte Mechanic which also suffers in this game. I mastered Parrying in DS1 and as a result I could combat most enemies no problem. However in this game the parrying is almost entirely luck based. Enemies swing so quickly parrying is very difficult to perform. Especially when enemies have multi hit combos. Combined with the lack of poise and the stamina cosumed in blocking, screwing up a parry can cost you a fight. Great sheilds are also usless. They too consume a great amount of stamina when blocking attacks leading to frequent guard breaks. 3) Enemy AggressionThis is more of a personal opinion but I feel it still holds weight. Enemies are much more aggressive than they have ever been in a souls game. many enemies have multihit combos that result in the player being stunlocked due to the lack of poise. blocking does not help because your guard breaks easily. Rolling is the only efficient method to combat. Armor and sheilds are way to underpowered to deal with the aggressive enemies of DS3All of these issues lead to only one viable playstyle. Light rolling, and heavy weapons. Using Heavy armor is pointless as it yields no benefit. Shields can only block a few attacks at best before your guard is broken so why bother with them. The lack of poise leads to a stunlock gameplay. It feels as if I am playing bloodborne with a Souls skin. From should have made another bloodborne since they obviously wanted to4)Map designWhat is porbably my favorite design feature of DS 1 was the intricate map design. The waps were wooven together vertically which allowed for shortcuts and hidden passage ways. it was really interesting to explore the map and see how it folded back in on itself and how it flowed. Just the oter day I was playing DS 1 through again and I noticed that you can see Lost Izalith from the Tomb of The Giants bonfire. It made the map feel titly knit and jammed packed. Being forced to explore the map and every nook and cranny due to the inability to fast travel early on made me very familliar with themap. I now have it memorizeed like the back of my hand and can navigate it very quickly. However DS3 is rather linear. The map doesnt come together and suprise you like DS1 did. Its not a major issue I'm Just dissappointed slightly5) Hub WorldDS2 and 3 adopted a HUB approach to the game design. they forced you to return to a certain area to level up, upgrade weapons, and to purchase items. While in DS3 merchants, blacksmiths, andbonfires were all over the map. You could all your weapon upgrading, repairs, and leveling up from any bonfire. This allowed the game to flow and didnt interupt the exploration at all. Instead of warping back to a HUB and going through multiple loading screens just to level up I could instead do it all at a bonfire. This made my journey feel much more personal and lonely which really helped deliever the atmosphere of lonliness that Dark Souls nailed perfectly.The game does have some pluses however. It is visually stunning Some of the bossfights are fantastice. The music is top notchPvP from what I played is reasonably fun despite the many balancing issuesThe enviorments, while linear, are gorgeous and intterestingIt has interesting endingsthe Quests are fun and rewardingVoice acting is stellar"
Negative,Servers been down for months and the developer won't even acknowledge the actual cause for why even though its public knowledge they will neither confirm nor deny.  Also they benefit from the fact that their new game elden ring is the only choice gamers have for a multi player souls-like experience.
Negative,"Why doesn't this game have steam sync?! Even the first Dark Souls has steam sync, but this game doesn't. This is not okay."
Negative,"hi, please turn back on pvp :("

Negative,Removed multiplayer from a 60 euro game suck my asshole miyazaki
Negative,No fire keeper romance option 0/10 fuck this game
Negative,"Family sharing removal was kind of a d*ck move.It's been the easiest way for removing players from their servers and having a pretext for closing them to focus on Elden Ring.No other explaination comes to my mind about this behaviour.Also doing it just after a sale... hilarious, you got us all, good job."
Negative,Servers were taken down for an exploit that was fixed by independent people in less than a week. There hasn't been a single public announcement since they said they were taking the servers down until after Elden Rings release.The prices for the souls games here on steam were all raised after the last major steam sale while there hasn't even been an attempt to update players on the plan for the servers. They are now charging more for literally every 'Souls' game on Steam right now more than they have in years. What are you getting for these hiked prices? Less of a game than you would've gotten when you could've bought the whole series for the price of one game. A bad deal if you ask me.
Negative,"BE CAREFUL IF YOU'RE GOING TO BUY ELDEN RING!Game has always had a cheater problem, which they've always ignored, and even ignored the guy who alerted them about RCE, and only now bc elden ring sales are now at risk they shut everything down and stay silent for 1 week (and counting), probably will last until elden ring releases.Only thing is, modders (including anti-cheat creator blue sentinels), already analyzed the code from the network test on elden ring, and the game's netcode is basically the same, so, until further notice elden ring is 100% certain to have the SAME exploits and cheats that all dark souls games already have, INCLUDING RCE.Keep in mind, this exploit is ALREADY FIXED IN BLUE SENTINEL since around jan 22, and a triple a company can't make this fix? Very suspicious."
Negative,"Well, well, well... I will say that I did, truthfully, GOY, SLOP, SLUSH, GUSH and CREAM all over myself and my monitor when I saw they brought back Anor Londo.

Negative,THIS GAME IS SO HARD I HATE IT I WOULD MUCH RATHER PLAY A GAME LIKE SUPER MARIO WII
Negative,being honest now. for real this time.The pve side of the game is good. Its enjoyable.The online side of the game is god awful. Its so bad that you could say that dark soul 3 was designed to bring out the worst out of people. In any way possible.
Negative,"was having much enjoyment out of the new dark souls and felt it was a huge step in the correct direction but since being banned for invalid game data bug , I think this is an absolute joke and a slap in the face to the player base. I have sent multiple emails and tweets regarding this and the fact bandai or fromsoft are staying quiet on the situation infuriates me!"
Negative,"The first Dark Souls is one of my all time favorite games. I really enjoy this game too, did several playthroughs on 2 characters before focusing on PVP. I used to open this game for a little PVP almost every day before the servers were taken down on Jan 23rd. This game feels beyond hollow without the messages, bloodstains, summon signs, invasions, etc.Maybe From needed to re-purpose the Dark Souls servers to handle the player base of Elden Ring. If that's the case, then they should have anticipated demand for their new game. If they don't care to fix it, that's neglect and a middle finger to their own fanbase of existing games. I doubt they're unable, since a modder fixed the issue within a day or two. There has been no update from the company since I believe Feb 10th, saying ""wait at least until Elden Ring releases.""Well, it's [July 7th] now. Rest in peace dark souls.#Savedarksouls"
Negative,"WAIT FOR FIXES. Frame Rate chugs like a train make of solid turds, magic is broken (in a bad way) dodge roll is shit (maybe Bloodborne dog roll was just too good?) anyway wait a bit till news states its proper fixed, frame rate drops i ususally dont amssively mind but when it LITERALLY goes form 0 to 60...."
Negative,"I made a single playthrough because I've been playing the Souls games since the original Demon Souls. I love this series. Dark Souls 3 could be the very best yet, but it isn't. Due to a single, but overwhelmingly obvious oversight, this game is not currently worth the time it takes to play. I praised the previous games in the series for giving the player the choice on how to play, how to build their soul slaying hero.Dark Souls 3 forces the player into specializing their offensive capabilites but gives them no choice on defense. Blocking, and wearing heavy armor, no longer serve a purpose. The only viable options for defense are to roll out of the way or parry. Some people will read this rant and say ""git gud"" but believe me... I am good. I'm pretty awesome at this game, but I felt like my choices were stripped from me as I was forced to adapt to the Iframes given during rolls and the activation frames of various parrys. In previous games you could choose to simply invest in equipment load and build yourself a heavy armored tank, this is no longer an option as the weakest enemies in the game will stagger you in 1 shot, and a dagger wielding invader can stunlock you to death.PoisePoise is what is missing in Dark Souls 3Poise is a vital part of the series to date.Poise is the only reason I am not recommending this game.If Poise isn't important to you or if you were planning on making a light armor, ninja esque styled character or a mage in robes then you probably won't notice or care. But, for those who want a bad A$$ in Havels armor strutting around, brushing off attacks without a care in the world... go play dark souls 1 or 2, they're great games still, and they have poise."
Negative,"Will remain a negative review until softban issue is resolved.Note: I was banned during the first ban-wave, FROM claims that the system has been changed meanwhile, but I have no way of verifying this one way or another. I went through almost 4 complete game cycles to get all possible gear and achievements on one character (one additional cycle because Sirris' quest line is made out of really thin paper) and now I got penalised for I don't even know what.Corruption must have happened during NG, as none of my save files (I made a copy before starting each new cycle) were able to remove the Invalid Game Data warning.——Edit: In light of very recent evidence (FROM coming down from their throne to impart some knowledge upon the unwashed masses) it is clearer now why this approach didn't work. Even the complete removal of all game data after receiving the warning, was no guarantee that you wouldn't get penalised (by design, FROM claims, and contrary to everything the ""warning"" message said or implied.)——While I had fun exploring and collecting everything, I have absolutely no desire to do it again. Since, let's face it, this game isn't all that deep once you have seen everything at least once before. The NG+ cycles are uninspired and unchanging. PVP is the real endgame and I'm barred from it as I write this. I wouldn’t have bothered if rebirth wasn't a thing, if having a character with all gear to choose from didn't have a tangible benefit. Which is another gripe I have with the game (only 5 rebirths per cycle, no forgoing of SLs, you can't re-roll the starting class) but that is another issue, and one I would begrudgingly accept if everything else worked as it should. Which currently it doesn't.Get your shit together FROM. This is just disgraceful.  Update 2016-05-02: Do not bother with Bandai Namco support. I finally got a reply out of them, after a few emails. It was a generic, canned reply saying that I should be patient. Yes, I am patient. Very patient. You have to be, if you are forced to do PVP on the shadow server. Talk about adding insult to injury.Update 2016-05-09: I opened a ticket to see if that works better than email. I linked this review and received a reply within 24 hours, asking me several questions. I answered the questions, but nothing has happened since then.Update 2016-05-13: I don't even care anymore. Praise Steam Family Sharing.Update 2016-05-17: Put in an edit about the warning/ban system as some new information has surfaced. FROM claims that the review system it is working now and that mistakes made previously will be rectified. We shall see."
Negative,"This game is nice, but there is a critical security vulnerability when you play online.I don't want to install a third party patch/mod from Nexus which pretends to solve the problem.Instead I added a firewall rule which blocks all the network communication of DarkSoulsIII.exeThe security issue is listed here:https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34170The player should not solve this problem for the developer/publisher."

Negative,"game is total clownfiesta after the last patch, ds never was so boring and badworst ds game i ever played, hyperarmor made this game unskilled swamp for goblin traders, no skill required anymore, i miss ds2"
Negative,"The game is fantastic. It's a game where things are difficult because you don't understand how they work, and not because you don't have an item or are too low level.You should buy it if: you like games that are challenges of study and practice, and not immediately easy.Don't buy it if you want to play co-op with friends. The games ""invasion"" mechanic (hostile players while online) is full of players who've loaded up new characters with end-game gear. They're basically untouchable if you play legitimately, and the game provides no way to avoid them."
Negative,"Quick Review after reading some other reviews and having played many hours of this game following the other iterations:Firstly, Dark souls 3 does not disappoint in the areas of lore, pacing, rich and varied environments, or visuals and audio.In all of these ways I want to love Dark Souls 3, and most folks seem to agree with that.It's only some of the diehard older fans of the series like myself that seem to have an issue, and that issue is primarily with the gameplay mechanics. I won't rattle off the myriad of things that other top rated reviews here have mentioned as being changes that some see as unfavorable, like the general issue of the removal of poise or the lack of viable character build choices.Let me lay it out simply: If you're paying attention, this game's mechanics are so fudged they aren't even consistent with themselves.Example: Pick up a sword and shield. Approach PvP generic undead soldier who also wields sword and shield. Swing sword, he blocks, you recoil from his shield stability rating, which exceeds the weight/force of your smaller sword's swing. Undead soldier gets a free hit on you.Then you get invaded. Undead player approaches with dagger. You think, ""I'll use my shield!"" No, you won't, because the mechanics for PvE combat and the mechanics for PvP combat are literally not the same.Undead player swings dagger at your shield, hits, and reduces your stamina for taking the hit....and he keeps swinging without pause, because your shield does not recoil any attacks in pvp. Dummy, you shouldn't have bothered bringing it....Except you like to play both PvE and PvP...what do you do? Apparently learn the unwritten rules for the differences between PvE and PvP mechanics and conform only to character builds that thrive in both situations after hours of trying to figure out why issues like this exist without any explanation.As a long time Souls player, I don't consider issues like this minor. I consider them at the very least enormous gripes that generate frustration and break immersion. At the most, and at the current moment, I haven't played this game in awhile because I find this sort of issue to skew my view so negatively.To me, Dark Souls 3 feels like they superimposed the richness of lore and setting of the best of Souls onto the mechanics of a 7 year old, somewhat fleshed out, forgettable action RPG. That's exactly how it plays for me.I love it and I hate it. Take it as you will. I hope you find this helpful."
Negative,"At the time of posting this, the cheating that's going on it this game is still an issue. Both valve(I understand they don't have to) and fromSoft refuse to do anything about the cheaters who have been running around in this game. Having put in a ticket with both steam and bamco about this I basically got a whole lot of f*uck you in response. Cheats since last I played outside of 5 mins ago to see if anything changed(well over a month ago at this point) fake phantoms that serve as dmg sponges, the usual infinite health/stamina, and the most annoying of all being one that will actually get you softbanned by fromSoft. These are still a thing. What makes it so bad was that these cheats started popping up around 2 or so weeks after the game came out... The rest of this review is based on my own personal feelings as someone who has played as sorcery based classes since demon souls. As for the actual gameplay my major complaint, besides enemies following the tired formula of have infiite stamina to bash you with, is how bad sorcery has it this time around. No one was asking for from to make the game easy for us(don't understand how it ever was. Dodging skills were a must in agressive boss fights and pvp). However with 90% of the bosses in this game being aggressive and spells damage being nerfed hard, it makes boss fight needlessly difficult and maybe even a little unfair. Playing as melee, Spell damage has been given really odd base requirements before the it become decent. Starting at 60 int is where you'll start to see the damage accel at. Keep in mind that in previous souls game you maxed out at 60 if you were hardcore sorcery otherwise 50 was perfectly fine at you're still dangerous. Remember how soul spear and the crystal spells(bar homing crystal in dks1) were good? Yeah not so much in this game. Incredibly slow and in most cases outclassed by the arrow spells. I started the game as a spellsword thanks to some people on reddit I was able to see just how jacked sorcery really was. To start  my Dex was 25 and int 15 with base class being merc. Casting magic weapon wields an extra 50 points of dmg at best. I don't remember these results in the first 2 games. In DK1 with mild point allocation I remember seeing around 100 points of extra damage on an unupgraded weapon. In this game I deal with one swing 200~210 per swing on a normal enemy with a +3 Uchi. Respec to 31 dex and 21 int damage went from 263 to 290 with magic weapon. This was done as apparently you don't see minor returns on int until at least 20. So that's my opinion on this game from a spell slinger pov. I wanted to love this game. Really I did. But I have completely lost faith in from's ability to make an anti-cheat system that's worth a damn and that sorcery will stop being completely eclipsed by other styles of play."
Negative,"This game was fun until someone else put modded gear into my inventory and now I have restricted gameplay.If you buy this, keep a backup of your saved game files, or play offline only.Don't expect any support from bandai from hackers that get to keep ruining the game for other people.*Update*  Bandai has now told me that I should keep a backup saved game file (which I did) in order to restore my game in case of another player using hacks.However, I have now been flagged because my level changed too quickly for their anti-cheat system.*Update* Bandai has removed the ban, but there is always a chance of the same thing happening again and I receive the perm ban.They disabled family share so you have to buy a second copy once that happens.I would not buy this game until they have a better system for hacking or they remove the anti-cheat all-together.Broken anti-cheat system and broken support for the game."
Negative,"This negative review is solely about my experience on a PC. If you plan on buying this for PC beware the game is designed for console use and the user interface reflects that, a lot. All hints are given in a console style, LB + A for example. Every time some tutorial command popped up I eneded up having to go the menu (also designed for console use imo) to cross reference the command given versus the keyboard command. So theres some frustration and confusion right off the bat. Had to google how to jump and kick and I still havent figured out kick yet. Needs more cross platform support, maybe an option to map kick to a key. Other than that the game is spectacular, combat is smooth and realistic, and playing in the dark with head phones is downright scary and I'm a grown 40 year old man. I bought it on sale for $25, honestly I'd be a little hot if I paid the full $60, probably would've returned it. Make it a little more PC friendly and I'll happilly change this to a thumbs up. Thanks!"
Negative,"There is an exploit in the game which can be used by hackers to manipulate the save game (and possibly others files on that persons computers) of someone through invasion/summoning. I just lost like 40h of progress due to that. I recommend playing offline for the time being, until the publisher decides to do something about this. Since mods that can protect against this arent officially allowed, this game gets a downvote."

Negative,"DS3 Servers have been down for over 6 months. The backdoor exploit that caused the servers to be taken down was solved by modders in less than a week. Unless the maintenance team has been working on drastically overhauling the anti-cheat, there is no reason why customers should be getting their products features retroactively removed."
Negative,"https://cve.mitre (DOT) org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-34170hackers have achieved Arbitrary Code Execution within DkS3's online mode. It's unknown exactly the capabilities right now, but frankly it's only a matter of time until someone can do something more malicious than simply corrupting your saves. Don't buy this game until BamCo implements some actual anti-cheat into their games, unless you feel like getting invaded by Dark Spirit WannaCry!"
Negative,"Encountered a lot of cheaters invading. Ineffective anti-cheat and twinkers/exploiters galore sours the pvp experience. Since the only way to opt out of PvP is to play offline or unkindled, you miss out on Co-op as well. Playing offline isn't so bad but you do feel you're missing out on a large portion of the game; since all covenants are Online based and such. Truly a shame because the game is great. No idea if Fromsoft is going to do anything about the cheating at this point.Addendum: If you are only interested in SP and don't care about online features then the game is fine.TLDR(for commenters with comprehension problems): I like the game, but cheaters ruin a fun portion of the game and Fromsoft doesn't seem to be doing anything about it. So this product gets a thumbs down for PC. The end.Other than 1 or 2 constructive exchanges the comment section accumulated to much stupid. Ain't nobody got time for that."
Negative,I doubt they will bring back the online features.Half of the fun was playing this with friends and they took it away.It's been over half a year and they still haven't fixed an issue that the modding community fixed in a week.I have lost a lot of respect for these studios...

Negative,"I finally get to join the illustrious club of ""negative review after hundreds of hours of gameplay"". Despite enjoying myself at game launch for these many hundreds of hours playing the active PVP, I cannot recommend this game. Dark Souls 3 is a game that lacks soul, ironically. It's very polished, and I can't even really call it bad... but it never really tries to excel anywhere or experiment in any other ways that the previous games experimented. The story is a basic chosen one tale that just has you do the same thing that you've done in the other two games again but while being obsessed with self-reference (OMG look it's that thing from Dark Souls 1) and with none of the nuance of the previous titles or any attempt to try anything really new. Where Dark Souls 1 shrouds its story in a fallible myth that the player may not even discover the cracks in and where Dark Souls 2 tries to depict a new world built on the ashes of the old one struggling with themes of memory, identity, and loss, Dark Souls 3 tries nothing. It just falls back really hard on the key imagery of previous games (mostly Dark Souls 1 because the game really wants to tap into your nostalgia) without any of the other unique things that made that imagery work. The whole world is structured completely around the cycle of the first flame repeating for the millionth time and the importance of you as the Ashen One and nothing really questions it any significant way. Most of the NPCs are happy to be shopkeepers for you for the entirety of the game and don't really have anything interesting going on with them. The lore is a vague and sometimes jumbled up mess thanks to a rearrangement of content during the development cycle that is somehow even more incoherent then Dark Souls 2 which had a way worse development cycle. There's not really any theme other than decay and even that is not really explored in any meaningful way or employed beyond being set dressing. The alternate story paths provided by the game don't have any depth and yet again rely on imagery that has already been used more effectively in previous titles.The combat and visuals have improved compared to previous entries, but they both suffer from varying levels of blandness. The visual fidelity of the game is much greater than the last two Souls games, and there's great detail put into both the textures and the actual level geometry. Despite that, many places have a very limited color palette with washed out or gray colors, and it's common to find tombstones and corpses absolutely everywhere or giant piles of ash and dust, to an absurd point. There are still very stunning vistas that will drop your jaw, but everything kind of blurs together during the actual playthrough of the level. The combat is a lot faster than previous entries, and enemies and bosses alike are well animated and have a sometimes surprisingly large repertoire of beautiful or intimidating moves. This is especially true of the boss fights, which steal the show with their incredible visuals and good movesets, marking them as some of the best boss fights they've ever made. While the combat has sped up in the boss fights have improved tremendously in both presentation and in difficulty, it all lacks real depth. Stamina management and rolling are easier than ever in this game, making combat often boil down to roll at kind of the right time and then press r1 or cast a spell. This greatly diminishes the impact of the boss fights especially and reduces many of them to surprisingly lenient reaction time tests. Not all of the bosses suffer from this; some of the bosses towards the end of the main game and all of the DLC bosses start to use moves that are structured or delayed in a way to catch panic rolls or rolls that were timed to initial movement and not the actual swing. That is really as deep as it gets though. The actual level design is okay, but it lacks the intricacy of Dark Souls 1 or Bloodborne. Levels often are very linear with few branching paths, and the level to level exploration follows suit. This is the most linear entry in the series, and every diverging path is just a fork whose other path ends pretty quickly. These diverging paths also never really interconnect, meaning that when you're done it's just back to the main path or to the other path. Levels themselves and level to level exploration boils down to holding forward into the boss and then repeating that past the boss until you can no longer hold forward. It's not devoid of interesting things; there are a few interesting secret levels in the game. But most of the game playing is just finding the obvious path forward and then holding to it. The two things that I can say are really good are the music and the second DLC. The music is emotional, epic, and beautiful. There's not a bad track in the whole soundtrack, and all the songs are beautifully composed and performed to capture and enhance the mood of the boss with which they're paired. The second DLC has the most varied and expansive visuals and level design in the whole game, and as a whole homages the previous entries in the Souls series without the cloying, empty, and uncritical nostalgia of the references in the main game. Great bosses, great music, great levels, and  the best Patches arc in all the games!  Dark Souls 3 is a game that is far too safe. It seems deeply afraid to experiment or to truly do anything exceptional. All it seems interested in doing is being a medieval knight game with the same imagery as the previous entries in the series. I guess in that regard you can consider the game a success. But as the final entry in a series that has made its name through experimentation with how it presents its story, its themes, and the player's relationship to the world, it fails to really do anything but be a decent action title. If that's all you're here for, you'll probably like Dark Souls 3. But if you want anything that the previous entries experimented with or want a truly deep action experience, look elsewhere."
Negative,"tl;dr If you had no expectation from waiting since DS2's release to see where FROM was going to take the series, this game would seem crazy good.For context, ever since I completed Elden Ring's DLC, I've been replaying the old Souls games to compare where FROM has been going. It's been a few years since I played DS3. I've put in nearly thousands of hours into PTDE, Original DS2, and DS3 each individually.This might be the only one out of the three I'm genuinely embarrassed about my hour count in; much like how a Korean MMO player feels after developing a brain.This is not nearly as good as I remember it, and I've been thinking lower and lower of it ever since my disillusionment with it a year after it first came out. The constant fawning over DS1, areas that are not fun to explore where the stage design is either: take it extremely slow and tediously fight literal hordes of enemies to get rewarded with mostly garbage, or do the smart thing and ignore everything with brief detours to pick up the items that are marked with a larger glow until the next bonfire. This game is genuinely Bonfire > Run > Bonfire > Run > Boss > Bonfire... you get the idea.NPC quests have always been FROM's weakest suit, but I did Anri's because I thought it'd be funny to kill Yuria after I got the Dark Sigil. Her questline was genuinely lame. I talked to her in 3 spots and killed Horace in Smoldering Lake. That was the questline as far as Yuria's quest was concerned. Also, why are two of the biggest questline NPCs wearing DS1 gear? I get it, I liked DS1 a lot as well FROM, but when are you going to allow DS3 to have its own identity? YOU DON'T NEED TO REHASH SIEGMEYER 1 TO 1 TO MAKE ME SOYPOG.The bosses are supposed to be what makes this the stronger title out of the 3 games, but not a single one held up to time. I'm just amazed how dull the AI is; they'll do a swing, I roll it, walk to their ass and swing, they'll do their ""get off me"" move which I will roll and then await the next attack to punish. This system was fine when they've been doing that since DS1 and DS2, but I just had this misconception in my head that DS3 wasn't like that as well. With the exception of the DLC bosses, I was very wrong.The saving grace for this game felt like it was DLC2, but on reflection, Demon Prince is kind of lame, Midir was bait for the bite attack lest you run for 10 minutes, Gael... he's cool, and in DLC1, Friede seems to be the only interesting boss in the entire game. But I don't think it's worth spending that much money on a 12-minute DLC for her.This game was also more designed for gameplay over RPG elements unlike DS1. The most telling example being the hot-swappable covenants which ruined the whole point of it being a sect you become tight-knit with, but gameplay fans love it - let me drain my rewards so I can return to invading at Irithyll and dump the covenant. The exploration being killed for the sake of it being a straight line to the boss was bad, but gameplay fans don't care; they'll always beeline to a boss either way. Medium rolling being taken out and with it a lot of thinking in build-making/having trade-offs for being overgeared just so everyone can be a light-roll spammer, in my opinion, was the worst choice FROM has ever made, but for gameplay fans... again, you get the idea. These changes sate people who only care about the surface level of these games, take away a lot of aspects that make Souls games Souls; make it a boss rush for pete's sake and they'd probably still be frothing at the mouth to play. In fact, there are a lot of vastly inferior soulslikes that are popular for a reason. It's why I don't listen to a lot of speedrunners' opinions about these games.(I should know, I used do a lot of SL1 speedruns in 2017)Disappointment through and through, but if you had no expectations from waiting since DS2's release to see where FROM was going to take the series, this game would probably seem crazy good. And that's usually my problem, much less the game itself, more the community. A lot seem almost blinded by nostalgia of having it be their first title, and they liked a lot of the things the games did to become less RPG and more action. Most long-term fans seemed to quickly move on from 3 and I should've too."
Negative,FromSoft has taken down the DS3 server for at least 4 months now. There's a high chance it will never come back again. Sacrilege.But DS3 itself is a great game.
Negative,"DO NOT BUY DARK SOULS 3 ON PC. Bandai have now prevented family sharing. This means that if you are visited by another player and they mess with your game, you can get banned and have no way of playing online again unless you pay for another game.Just buy it on Switch/PS4/Xbox if you can. It is still an amazing game."
Negative,"I love the game, but at the moment I can't recommend it for anyone. Hackers can brick your save and get you banned, and knowing Bamco they will not unban people.  It's truly a shame some angry minority of hackers can ruin it for everyone.If you decide to buy/play it, get third party anticheat for your own protection."
Negative,"This is a hard review for me to write. I love the Souls games, I love Bloodborne and I love Demon's souls. I've double dipped on buying each game multiple times and (obviously) played this one several times to completion itself. It's not even that this game is bad, it's just that with the option of any other game developed by From Software of it's type, there is absolutely no way I can recommend this game to anyone who has the option of getting one of the other games. I wanted to write this review mostly to say simply that if you get in on playing dark souls with this one then you'll miss out on what's so good about the series, even if the game has made great strides to being more accessible, this is not even close to the best souls experience you can have. If you have access to a ps4, Bloodborne is my favourite PvE experience of all the souls games, and the first game is still worth a playthrough. This game and its handling of poise and heavy nerfing of magic/faith scaling until outrageous levels also makes the PvP much less interesting, and for that there is Dark Souls 2, despite not liking the adaptability mechanic, that game allows for many more fun builds, in my opinion."
Negative,"♥♥♥♥ game mechanics, very clankyThis is a console game ported to the PC and they didn't even make the effort to adapt it to the keyboard, everywhere in the interface it shows the controller buttons such as A, B, X or Y. Meaning you have to constantly go check on the settings to map whatever one button means on the keyboard:("
Negative,"I bought this game right on release. I'm a big Dark Souls fan - hundreds of hours in the original on 360, and the PC re-release. Over a hundred hours in the not-quite-as-good Dark Souls II. So natually I was expecting more great things from Dark Souls III.First of all: the world does not wonderfully interconnect in a work of fantastic genius as Dark Souls I's world did. It's not quite as disconnected as DSII, but it's close.Second: it's better than Dark Souls II, in terms of level design and combat. The world and the odd Poise setup aside, it's roughly as playable and decent as Dark Souls I.Third: this game crashes and glitches. It crashed and glitched on launch. I persevered. It did not get better. Driver rollbacks did not help. Different settings did not help. I know my way around a PC, and final-release games do not crash on my PC. That is, except for Dark Souls III (and XCOM, occasionally).I withheld a review at the time, expecting it would be patched, but going back nearly a year later, the game is still unstable and prone to glitches and crashes. For that reason, I sadly cannot recommend this very good game."
Negative,"Where are multiplayer, Lebowski? Why We must farm what we can get in MP?Goal - get extra 27 Proof of a Concord Kept for leveling up Blades of the Darkmoon.At the end of 27-th ear and 3-rd evening:SK Helms - 111.SK Armors - 85;SK Gaunlets - 85;SK Leggins - 89;Shields - 45;Titanite shards - 750+;Souls ~3 000 000+and over 9000 520+ dead Silver Knights.30 Marauders bones are next with similar grind.My point is - thank you BN for disabled servers. You are truly as'home.For all community - have a good day and may the souls be with you."
Negative,"Turn the online features back on, I'll change review then"
Negative,Servers ds2 and dsr?
Negative,"It’s criminal,  they are asking 85 euros for the deluxe edition for a game from 2016"
Negative,game should be priced at half value because no online play therefore only half of game worky
Negative,Full of cheaters ruining your save file and making you shadowbanned.
Negative,"I can't recommend a game that cannot be played properly in its current state.Over 120 days with the servers being taken offline, and absolutely zero communication about if and when they will ever come back.I used to praise your games Fromsoft, now I've gone Hollow."
Negative,"Online on PC is a complete cancer full of cheaters, and devs don't give a single **** about it, and why would they, the game already sold like hotcakes and got critical acclaim it's not like they care about people who support them since they released original ds on pc.PVE - 9/10PVP - 2/10Will boycott any future Fromsoftware games if they don't implement a proper anti cheat."
Negative,"It's not that I found the game displeasing in the combat mechanics. I found that the Keyboard ports for those who do not have controllers are ridiculiously hard to learn. I'm aware that Darksouls was intented originally for the Controller, but if the developers can't make a setting that changes the tutoritals from Controller to Keyboard, then why allow keyboard to begin with?"
Negative,"FROM has really screwed the pooch on the latest updates. Their anti-cheat protections are literally getting players banned for being the victim of malicious hackers, which they do nothing to deter. RIP DS3."
Negative,Don't buy this game if you don't own a console controller.
Negative,"OMFG i cannot express just how mad the community for this game makes me. i have never in my life met such hatefull hackers and counter hackers EVER. let me put in better perception my experience with this trash heep of a game's community.so originally i had owned this game for PS3 and thought to myself after 100s of hours wow this game would be awesome if it could be modded so i had bought it for PC and knew nothing of the ban system (as a side note OMFG why DOES THIS GAME BAN PEOPLE SO EASILY BUT NEVER TOUCHES THE GRIEFFING HACKERS WTF) instantly i get in the game alter my stats so pretty much go through the game in a day because i was not there for the base game i was there for the modding of the game. tues comes around and in the same instant i modded my stats i get banned :/ ""ok no worries i clearly caused it"". so i learn about family share ""nice"" make a new account beat the game legit this time and start looking up whats ""bannable"" and whats not during this time i see a few videos around about peoples homemade boss characters and think wow that would be Amazing!, So i make one myself do a few matches in a high PvP area get all around well reception :3. But then the salty hackers comes online. I had decided to do a role play in the ringed city where i was the ""Void Lord"" causally strolling through the city with my phantoms acting as my royal guard. now as a side note i want to point out how much work it is to change anything in the game EVERY EFFECT AND EVERY CHANGE MUST BE MANUALLY IMPUTED EVERY TIME YOU LAUNCH THE GAME this takes hours my fastest time being two hours of raw data setting. i start my walk through the city not hiding that the ""hacks"" are in place i also want to point out that my ""boss""character does not fight and is very beatable not broken just flashy. but no a hacker who's character name is end see this as cheating breaks the role play invades me and insta curses me. Not only does he do this once but keeps invading just to insta curse. ""but Stormy"" you say ""you were hacking you deserve this"" i was trying to host a fun little role play not break the PvP element to the game. so i think to myself ""ok this dude is the only one its a bad day to do this"" log off and try again tomorrow.so again i get problems i log on the next day everyone plays along the invaders if have fun AS THE WHOLE THING WAS SUPPOSED TO BE. but then i find out that one of the players not only hacks items into the account to ban it but he also HACKS THE FAMILY SHARE ACCOUNT TO FORCEFULLY DISABLE THE FAMILY SHARE ON THE GAME.so yes if you ask is the game worth it on PC HELL NO! the publisher is to ignorant to figure out how to appropriately make a proper ban system and allows constant griefers to run rampant in the game."
Negative,140 hrs on record. Save files gone. Bet the guy who pirated the game save files are fine though.
Negative,"This game is literally the Infinity War/Endgame of Dark souls, zero creativity, 100% callback to everything before."
Negative,"I don't recommend this game at all.In fact don't ever buy the game until they fix their issues up.Innocent people are getting banned because some autistic script kiddie decided to soft-ban people by exploiting the half-assed anti-cheat system this game has.I suggest everyone to give this game a bad review until they unban every innocent people that got banned cause of this and until they solve this issue.They don't deserve your money when they are being this unprofessional.Dont be a tool and protest againts this circus.Edit:Great Job, Namco!Now i am somehow banned for doing nothing bad too? I didn't even encounter any hackers or cheated in anyway, but somehow i got banned.Is this how your anti-cheat system works.That is it, i am going to ask for a refund.Fix this shit or go fuck yourselves."
Negative,"Online is currently broken, with no word from the devs for 2+ months on when/if a fix will come.EDIT MAY 18TH 2022:STILL no update on when or if the servers will come back online. Unfortunately fromsoft seems content to just completely abandon this game, and force people to play the (in my opinion) significantly weaker Elden Ring if you want any kind of online play. Gigantic disappointment, and frankly disgusting behavior by fromsoft, I don't understand how they are content to still sell this game for SIXTY DOLLARS (game came out in 2016 btw) while a massive chunk of this games content is completely unplayable."
Negative,It broke me
Negative,FromSoftware does not care about its users neither about remote code execution.
Negative,doesn't have jester set
Negative,"Bandai namco are banning accounts of innocent players, knowing that hackers can inject items into a player's clean save that triggers a ban"
Negative,FIX YOUR SHIT
Negative,Online is down and they won't fix it. It's not worth buying as of now.
Negative,"Fromsoft have deactivated the servers for Dark Souls series so it's no longer possible to play online. Meaning no PVP, No coop, no blood, no signs... Half the game, just gone..."
Negative,i never even met john dark soul
Negative,"Love the game but, this is pretty dated and with elden ring now being out for this long. Drop the price"
Negative,Broken server Broken heart Broken review.
Negative,"Do not purchase this game! The game servers have been down since February. They said there was a security leak that couldn't be fixed until after Elden Ring was released. That was 6 months ago. I planned to purchase Elden Ring and reinstalled DS3 to warm up. Now, I don't think I will spend money on a company that screws over its customers to drive sales of a new product."
Negative,"I have never written a review a day in my life. But after seeing the recent news that family sharing was cut to prevent ""cheaters"" from playing on the official servers I believe the developer is just slapping us consumers because they couldn't figure out how to fix their own product. I love this game, love everything about it and how it makes me want to fling my controller at the screen. However, when a company gives little regard for people affected by hackers and just throws out one blanket ban after another to try and solve the problem they hurt the people that are trolled by hackers. It says something where a majority of the players (excluding new comers to the franchise) are in one sense or another banned, most of the time for doing nothing wrong apart from being hacked and reported by the hacker. Because yes, I have the technological know how to add a +1000 damage ring to my inventory when I barely can figure out how to work my smart phone these days. If you love this franchise by all means get it, but do not be surprised when you either get hit by a hacker and banned or are unable to find anyone to summon because most players are not on official servers anymore. (And most of them would never pay full price to get the game on a new account just to get banned again in a few days) I hate writing a negative review about a franchise I would play until the end of time, but it was something that had to be said for those who were wrongfully removed. (I am not alone in this belief, search the internet and you will find many a story already published on how this change will damage the player base with people even saying that its better to be banned so you dont need to worry about it anymore.)"
Negative,too many grey skinnies
Negative,"New game, invader filled inventory with hacked items, forced to delete character in case of ban or download mods just to fix this issue."
Negative,"Bandai Namco just disabled Steams family sharing option. Everyone who got banned or will get banned because of cheaters injecting hacked items into their inventory is basically permanently excluded from the online part of the game. I cannot play with my friend anymore because of precisely this.Instead of trying to fix the issues with the game, Bandai Namco takes the route that will bring them the most money (forcing players to rebuy) without any regard for the community. Hacking won't even necessarily be curbed by this.Scummy behaviour like this shouldn't be tolerated and this game will be the last Bandai Namco game I've bought."
Negative,They promised me i would die and yet here i am.
Negative,Fantastic game but servers are shut down for almost 4 month since January.Plus game doesn't have could save and I lost my 180 hours save because of it.
Negative,"Excellent game hampered by a blatant lack of an anticheat, leaving you in fear of getting softlocked and losing your save"
Negative,I CANT LOG IN FCKN ONLINE

Negative,Currently unplayable. Crashes all the time. Ran fine the first day (except the Bonfire crash bug which could be avoided) but now it crashes all the time. Console developers strike again.
Negative,Whoever added pvp to this game deserves to die
Negative,fix the servers
Negative,Online still doesn't work.
Negative,"Apparently having shadowplay and using a ps4 controller can get you softbanned, so if you aren't using those you're golden."
Negative,"No Gwynevere tits in this game either.Dancer's rear might be the closest thing we get for compensation in this game, but she's a little freaky."
Negative,"Bring family sharing back, lower the price to its normal state again, and put a better discount on ds1 (not that crappy 10% discount)"
Negative,"I love this game to death, this isnt my first 50 hours of this game. I played the shit out of this game on ps4 until i got a computer to play more. When i logged in today after being invaded by a hacker, who was spawning in items like 30 embers at a time, i was restricted of my online play and can no longer play with my friends and other people i would need to bring in like pvp fight clubs or helping me or another player with a boss. I wish i did not have this problem because now i have to play with no online play. please fix this problem From software"
Negative,"Random crashes here and there, when changing graphics, when traveling to another bonfire. One of the 20+ crashes in my current playtime (3~ hours or so) made my pc unresponsive and in need for a hard reset.I dont think that its acceptable for 3xA games and especially this one, thats been available to some people for some time now to request 80€ and behave like this on launch.For what it counts, here are my specs:I5-4670k 3.40GHz16GB DDR3 1600MHzGainward GTX 760 2GBEven with everything on its lowest setting/off i get framedrops in some areas. So yeah, i believe and hope this will get fixed and optimized, but come on devs.."
Negative,"I bought the game on sale, knowing it is always spoken of highly and hoping to find out why. While it seems like a great game, I hate playing games with a controller, and there is no option to change the prompts and display of controls for playing with a keyboard and mouse. I imagine you could eventually get used to it, but it seems like a huge oversight, and I decided to get a refund and play other games that are actually properly intended to be played on PC.Maybe give this a pass if you don't want to use a controller? I do realize I'm in the minority and this probably seems like a stupid thing to complain about, but maybe someone else out there doesn't like controllers and can save themselves some time by reading this."
Negative,"Fun, but god damn From, get your shit together. Maybe I'll change this when and if things get better.The game feels like several steps forwards and several steps backwards. The bosses are a lot better and more fun to fight this time around, though a good amount of them are still humanoid bosses, a common criticism for Dark Souls 2. Poise, for some odd reason, has been turned off, giving way to faster weapons being better and weapons that give super armor. The Covenants were made easier to switch between as you can just ""equip"" them but are even less interesting and have some design flaws (Like Blue Sentinels and Darkmoon basically being the same thing).The world design is much more linear now, while not a concern of mine, it can be for a lot of people.Anti-cheat is basically non-existent and is a joke. Again. Enjoy being banned by some dude giving you free souls by stabbing you.There are still performance issues that I feel shouldn't be there."
Negative,Apparently we can't family share anymore ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Negative,I hate everything about this game.
Negative,this game sucks because I'm bad at it
Negative,it insists on itself
Negative,Servers are baaaack!! Let's goooooooooo!!!!nvm!
Negative,"It's fitting that the last entry in the Dark Souls series, with a story about a world buried in the ashes of myth and mists, feels so bone-dry. All that's left is the ashen husk of a better game stumbling around familiar landmarks. Thoroughly depressing."
Negative,"This review is one giant rant, butthurt fans go away please. I have played the Souls games for hundreds upon hundreds of hours each, the only one I haven't played is Demons' Souls. I hate on this game because I love this franchise, and i'm willing to see each and every fault in each game, and after playing this game for over 140 hours, I can safely say the following: Is Dark Souls III an enjoyable experience that is worth your money? For the most part, no. First off, the immense lack of polish, this game is a reused asset wonderland. Every player animation, some enemies, most armor sets, weapons, even entire freaking locations and concepts, are reused/rehashed from older titles, I can't find a speck of originality in this game, which is a big goddamn dissapointment. People claim that it's ""fanservice"" or an ""homage"" to the older titles, my cynical brain sees it no more as laziness cause they were too busy making the awesomeness that is The Old Hunters DLC for Bloodborne. At least Dark Souls II had the freaking courtesy to refurbish and refine reused armor sets and weapons, such as giving the Elite Knight set a static left pauldron so it wouldn't clip so bad for example, and what do they do in 3? They bring it back, obviously cause they just ripped the armor set straight from Dark Souls 1, and added some physics to the movy bits, just like what they did with every other armor set from older games. Also, bugs, lots of em. This game is so unbelievably poorly optimized that its actually amazing, even people with the recommended graphics card can't run this game. Lag spikes abound, weird enemy/ai glitches, random shit all over the place, this game is a bug ridden mess. Next, the gameplay. Fromsoft was sitting in their office thinking to themselves, ""Man, people really like Bloodborne, let's just take all the enemies from that game and just put a slow ass Dark Souls 1 PC into that bowl of rape."" And that's exactly what they did, pretty much every enemy is annoyingly quick, recovers way too quickly, has way too much health, and kills you in 2-3 hits. In Bloodborne, you have massive speed, a fast, quick-changing weapon, and a gun, to compensate for this, but in a Dark Souls game, you have no such advantage, making every death feel cheap and undeserved. Lothric knights are a good example of what I mean, spamming shield bashes constantly, and attacking faster than a longsword R1, all the while having actual freaking poise. Poise, let's talk about that for a moment. ""Working as intended,"" they say, apparently all it does now is keep you from losing i-frames on your next roll after being attacked. So basically, poise is useless, there is no benefit to wearing heavy armor anymore, hyper armor is the new poise practically, but all you need for that is a big weapon. This game doesn't promote smart movement or movesets, it promotes a whole lot of quick r1 spam, emphasized by the Dark Sword and Estoc PVP metas. Also, parry frames, they bring back the crappy Dark Souls 2 start up frames, which was fine, in Dark Souls 2 I mean. In 2, enemies were fairly slow and predictable, which warrants the use of startup frames. But in this game, where everything is insanely quick and hard to follow, startup frames makes parrying in PvE a complete hassle, and pointless, when you can just R1 spam and stunlock your way to victory like a goddamn toddler. It's pretty ridiculous when a caestus is more reliable parry weapon than a buckler by the way. I will say, the early introduction of the soapstone, and the red eye orb is a fantastic choice, along with the password system, making this game the most enjoyable souls game to play with friends, the fact that my SL 15 buddy can summon my SL 110 character, and I'll be downleveled to compensate quite nicely, is a great addition and something that was truly needed in past souls games. Theres also the little things, like being able to cancle the roll after a jump, or quick-switching to the first item in your hotbar, that makes this game extremely convenient at times, allowing you to move through your hotbar hassle-free. Also, gestures, despite the fact that most of them are, again, reused assets, they are still a great addition. I wish you had more gesture slots in your hotbar because there are just so many good ones.Im normally not this bitchy with souls games, I love the souls series, because when I die in these games, I usually feel at fault, I usually feel like there was something I couldve done to change that situation, and so I try again. But in Dark Souls 3, I just feel cheated, I feel like whatever I do is just luck, a roll of the NPC die (see what I did there) to see whether or not an enemy knight spams like he just snorted 40 lines of cocaine, or if he just sits there and lets me guardbreak him. Each enemy is a freaking roulette wheel. Next, Bosses. Bosses for the most part, suffer the same problems as normal enemies. Your a freaking snailman when compared to any enemy in this game, that goes for the bosses as well. There's the chore bosses like Wolnir and the Cursed Rotted Greatwood, which are never difficult fights, more so incredibly annoying. Also, the bullet hell that is the crystal sages. Fromsoft knows how much everyone loves the cloning magic user boss! They know we love it so much, they made this one actually do some freaking damage, to the point that he'll one shot you if you don't have perfect 360 degree vision (or a summon). The Lords of Cinder are all complete jokes bosses. The Abyss Watchers, a boss with amazing lore, great first encounter, awesome looks, and the best song in the whole damn game, arguably one of the best souls songs of all time, and yet the fight itself is reduced to a clanking ganking spam fest of cheese, full of 7 hit unending combos with perfect tracking. They lack poise, which once again promotes the belove R1 spam, as opposed to actually using your human brain for actual human function. And then they top it all off with a crappy bootleg Maria from Bloodborne, which just adds on top of the already spammy combos. Aldrich is more of a magic spamming nuisance than an actual fight. Yhorm is the most dissapointing, a giant anticlimax to one of the most hyped up fights in the entire game. Lorian and Lothric are the only good fight out of any of them, being incredibly enjoyable and tough at the same time. Theres also the super fast spammers that give you no breathing room, like The Dancer, or Champion Gundyr, pretty much any human-style boss is just a neverending wombo combo spam fest. And the final boss, good ol' cinderbro, is just as spammy and tracking as the rest of em. Its a really neat idea to have a boss use only abilities available to the player. Great idea, horrible execution. You know what game had player-style bosses and did it right? Bloodborne. Gherman, Gascoigne, Maria, all amazing fights, that truly felt like a level playing field. Meanwhile this guys over here, with shit tons of poise, being unparryable, and a having a 65% damage-dealing 6 hit combo in his second phase with insane range and perfect tracking. Fun. All of these fights can feel like a chore, feeling either insanely unfair or cheap on your own, or way too easy and boring with a friend or two. Now, there are plenty of fights that I actually find myself enjoying. Iudex gundyr is always a blast, , Nameless King is always a great endurance battle, Vordt, the Deacons, Dragonslayer Armor, even Pontiff Sulyvahn I feel are all relatively fair and balanced fights that are always enjoyable. Overall, I believe this game is not worth your time. If you're a diehard souls lover, get it on sale, don't pay full price. If you're new to the series thanks to Dark 3's successful marketing, I suggest you spend your time on Dark Souls 1, 2, or Bloodborne first before deciding to pick this one up. Despite what people say, Dark 2 is a great and solid game in my opinion, and perfect for newcomers to the souls series."
Negative,"THE GOOD:  Awesome gameTHE BAD:  There is a bug that will put you in a shadow/ban server with like 20 other unlucky f**kers for NO REASON.  If this happens to you...no summon signs...at all...and you'll be stuck here anywhere from 72hours to months.  No ""invalid data"" warnings, no mentions of being ""banned"".  One second there's all the signs/pvp/jolly coop you could ask for, then just as your getting in the swing of things...nothing...my DS3 is a d*mn ghost town.I had a friend come over and hook up his rig and see if he could PVP on my network.  Both lvl 120 quality build at Pontiff - His game: 15-20 signs    My game: 0The first time it happend I had to unintall the game because I would constantly sign in to check if it was working again, every five minuets.  Came back to the game when the first DLC released and here I am again, alone and bored.I've never cheated or hacked in this or any modern game.  There are multiple triggers and absolutly no way to fix it.  You pretty much just have to wait until the servers update and your poor bored and lonely charecter that you just poured 86 hours into perfecting for PVP is finally set free from his/her/its unjust imprisonment.TL;DR:  This game has a fun-sucking, ball-rocking bug that puts a screaching halt on any and all PVP/Co-Op that has remained unfixed since release. No way out - no fix - ...going...hollow...goodbye cruel worl..."
Negative,Doesn't have a talking cat
Negative,the servers have been offline for 3 months and they are most likely lying about bringing them back. if you want multiplayer do not buy.
Negative,Really loved Dark Souls 1 and wanted something to replace it now that I finished it.This game didn't do it for me..
Negative,Massive exploit Negative review so the fix before Elden Ring.
Negative,Servers Are Still Offline After half a year
Negative,all the dark souls games took off their online because someone figured out how to run code on someone elses pc and potentially they could brick ppls computers or steal their information. they still havent brought it back online its beenover 100 days. at this point i wont recommend anyone buy any dark souls even if its on sale UNTIL they fix the internet.
Negative,"I purchased this game for my partner to play cooperatively at the start of 2022, prior to Elden Rings release. On January 23rd 2022 the online services were taken down due to an exploit, with a promised fix to be released ""soon"". I waited for months for this fix to release, eager to play through the game with my partner but no fix released. It is nearly 100 days since the services went down and there is no fix, or announcement regarding the fix in sight. I am an avid Fromsoft fan and I can honestly say I am beyond disappointed with them and were it possible at this stage I would demand a refund for the copies of all ""Souls"" games I purchased for my partner, however it's unlikely that will happen as it's been quite a while.Dark Souls is my favorite franchise, and I cannot recommend enough to NOT BUY THESE GAMES. Fromsoft does not care about their community. Fromsoft does not care to fix their broken product. Fromsoft only cares about getting your money, and once they have it they're more than happy to leave you holding the bag of their problems while they run off into the sunset."
Negative,"One of the best things about Dark Souls 1 was that it walked a fine line between difficulty and insanity. DS1 was hard, but fair - you learned, you became better.DS3 is not fair. It does not walk that line. Be prepared for raging, anger, frustration. Be prepared for enemies with infinite poise, fast rolling in heavy armor. Be prepared for sudden ambushes that you cannot predict or see. Be prepared for giant hitboxes that make no sense with AOE  that gives no warning.Dark Souls 1 is one of my favourite games, and i've played it through and through. The fact that i almost - almost - rage quit DS3 at one point should tell you a lot. Pros: - Great story and setting- Great storytelling- Good performanceCons:- Terrible gameplay- Terrible balance- Meh endings, compared to how good the game lore was"
Negative,"I know a lot of people are in love with the series but it just isn't fun for me. There's a thin line between hard and frustrating and this game is just frustrating. There's no sense of accomplishment after a hard area, there's only relief. All games should have difficulty options and I don't care what so called “elitists kids” say. These developers do not care and they ignore a huge number of potential buyers. Do they realize there are older gamers? People who are just bad at fast games? Or even handicapped gamers? Nope, these people are not allowed to play this. Easy mode wouldn't hurt ANYONE, it only would make some people happy.Why play it then if you don't like it you ask? Well, this game has amazing atmosphere, lore, music and wonderful artstyle so you know, just maybe people want to play it for these things? But the whole series is marketed as insanely difficult games and this creates toxic elitist community on top.I've got this from Humble bundle after playing Dark Souls 2. I managed to finish that one somehow and DS3 looked prettier and had much better level design, overall look and mood so I thought why not? I'll activate my key. And then the frustration started. I had absolutely zero fun with this. All those things I mentioned like lore, atmosphere, music, I forgot about them after couple of hours and stopped caring about them because frustration makes it impossible to pay attention to.So what is DS3? It's a third person action game with rpg elements and barely any story (I want to notice that story doesn't equal lore, the latter is great, or maybe i should say the story-telling sisn't good). You just run through the levels while fighting extremely cheap and overpowered enemies. They always have more health, no stamina system, they hit harder than you and they often ambush you and put you into an impossible situations.Basically there are few types of enemies only. They have different textures but they all have same moves and patterns. Worst thing is that if you die you must go through the level again. Unlike in DS2 you can't get rid of enemies here. Another stupid decision. DS2 was at least playable because of that.Bosses are pretty boring. Their visual design is awesome but the whole fighting is boring as hell. Bosses have few moves and just repeat them over and over again. Compare it to Monster Hunter and DS bosses feel like they were made with zero effort. “Hey just put this huge boss there, give him insane amount of hp and strength and be done with it”. It's just cheap lazy design. Cheap ambushes, cheap enemies, cheap bosses (which actually are easier than regular enemies).Controls are ok'ish. It's janky and unresponsive. You can easily fall, your inputs have intentional delay to make it harder to react. Rolling doesn't work half of the time. Shield should help huh? Nope. Shields worked as intended in DS2, but here shields barely help. You don't have any special moves or skills, can't even jump, you only need to press the button at the right time, 0,1 seconds too early or too late and you get hit and get caught in a series of non-stop attacks.I'm not sure what the story is about because it's way too hard to follow it when you get 30 seconds of story and then 10 hours of frustrating combat. That makes you forget what npc said and you forget what are you doing there in general.You think maybe you can farm/grind and level up like in normal game as Final Fantasy and make it easier or harder depending on how much you grind. Nope. Leveling up makes little difference. Instead of losing 40% of hp from one hit you lose 38%.One more downgrade comparing to DS2 is that you can't restore your health as many times as you want. Overall DS2 was a better game, not as pretty but it was balanced at least to some degree while DS3 is poorly balanced where nothing matters except your reaction time and ability to predict enemy moves.It has really dark and grim atmosphere which is stunning. It's rare for games to have such an amazing atmosphere, another one which pops into my mind is Stalker (another game I did not enjoy at all). That is accompanied by great soundtrack which transitions into epic music when fighting the bosses.There's also always online function which makes the game even harder. Other players can invade you and kill you. Another “amazing” useless feature. At least you can turn off invasions here but then you lose online features which helps sometimes a little.Graphically it looks average. Artistic style is amazing along with level design. Both environments and enemy visual design is amazing. But graphics in general aren't very good. The game is quite blurry, it lacks graphical options, locked to 60fps and has no native ultrawide support. These developers clearly do not care about user experience.Yes I know for those who are extremely good at action games this could be fun, but its not for me. Games should bring joy to you, entertainment, having good time etc. And this only induce stress, negative stress which overshadows all the amazing things this game has. This game is nearly impossible for me and I only feel frustration. Maybe i'll finish it someday if someone helps me out, otherwise I think I will never finish it. But i'm sure i'm gonna ignore all the souls-like games unless it's safe to use cheats.ProsGreat atmosphereGreat soundtrackGreat artstyleGood loreConsJanky controlsCheating, op, cheap AIFull of of cheap deathsWay too difficult for normal peopleNo out of the box ultrawide supportLocked to 60fpsBoring combatBoring bossesFrustrating gameplay which becomes tediousLeveling up makes little differenceToo repetitive"
Negative,"As of today you cannot play this game with family share, they removed this option. A friend got banned a second time god knows why, he did not mod or cheat (first one was because of a mod, his mistake) and now he can not play online because they will not un-ban him.If they remove the option to play from family share, at least remove the rule of the second permanent ban, otherwise he will have to buy the game again for something he did not do."
Negative,Game bans you for playing as a skeleton
Negative,I wanted to come back and play with my friend but i got online play restricted when i came back to the game after three years of inactivity. Nice. Now i cant play with my friend. Thanks FromSoftware.
Negative,"Multiplayer shut down, save file corrupted."
Negative,"Generally good.But downvote because:- Camera/lock-on is unexpectedly worse than  DSII, which is already bad enough.- The way they handle hack/cheat issue."
Negative,Pretty gud game. It's a shame Bamco are just a bunch of lying sacks of shit though. Where are the servers?
Negative,"I'd to expand on my previous review, especially with the point about anti-cheat. With the amount of money-grabbing, anti-cheat related shit and dumbing down on game mechanics, I can't give this or Dark Souls 1 demastered a positive rating anymore. As what is most likely the last in the Dark Souls franchise, my experience with Dark Souls 3 surpasses that of its predecessors. Soul Level Matchmaking is back, with an anti-twink measure (weapon reinforcement). Multiplayer is made way easier with password matchmaking too. (Thank goodness Soul Memory is gone.)The characters, lore, questlines, bosses are quite a massive improvement from DS1 and especially DS2, with all bosses having at least 2 phases and interesting backstories. Weapon movesets are rather varied, especially with the introduction of Battle Arts. Armor upgrades are gone but that means more Fashion Souls! It's also very nice to see customization options improved such as Character Creation and Optional Manual Attack Aiming.They should really work on the Poise system though, as stunlocking by Estocs and Straight Swords (Dark Sword) is... is... sigh. Phantom range is not as bad as DS2, but it happens sometimes due to bad connections on top of weapons like estoc and katanas. As for fanservice, of course there will be, but it is acceptable. (cough cough DS2 Old Dragonslayer cough cough) However, one thing that must be fixed in the softban issue. Many players falsely flagged as hacking/cheating, restricting online play. Luckily, it seems that the devs/publishers are actually doing something about it, albeit slow. All in all, Dark Souls 3 is a game well worth its asking price. Even new players to the franchise should pick it up if they can as it will provide them an exprience no other game can ever give. To players struggling with the game, I have this to say, ""Don't give up, skeleton!"""
Negative,"This game comes with a neat feature. If you experience a power outtage or even a BSOD caused by the game, the anticheat built into the game will automatically corrupt your save file.You lose everything. This blind retribution is invasive and unreasonable in its emboldened action of corrupting data on the consumer's PC.If they had banned me from online multiplayer, I could have still completed the game. Instead I lose my time spent and am told I need to start over from scratch due to the developer/publisher's poor judgement.The first 80 hours were from the first playthrough. The game was not as fun the second time. Might just be that I have eidetic memory, but the mystery and confusion that the game series is known for was gone and it did not feel rewarding to complete it all the second time. I had made it to Lothric Castle the first playthrough (the one that was corrupted), completed all DLC as well, and I had that much of the game to replay just to get a sense of the ending,After playing all 3 Dark Souls games, I can really only endorse the first game. The level/world design of the first game was unrivaled with each game becoming more linear and less ""swiss cheese-like"" in how interconnected each area is to the whole rest of the world. This interconnectedness made the first souls game so very amazing.This game feels too polished and lacks the clunkyness of real world armored combat that the first game had. The weight of the movesets was a mechanic unto itself, where learning the timing and reach of the weapons were essential to successfully finishing an enemy before their hits connect.This game feels too much like Devil May Cry with all the fancy movesets. I would rather play Lords of the Fallen than this game.Feels more generic and far less mysterious and confusing than first Dark Souls. Lack of mystery affords less rewarding experience for accomplishing anything in the game because it is too straight forward. Glad they are not making a 4th Dark Souls as it would be too diluted from the original formula to be anything worth playing."
Negative,"Bought the deluxe edition over a year ago on sale for $20. Right now off sale, they're pricing this game that came out in 2016 at $85. Oh yeah, the servers are offline and have been for over two months. Just pirate it. you'll have the same experience as the person fool enough to buy it for $85."
Negative,"So this game has a huge issue with hackers, like a HUGE issue the anti-cheat system in place is an ABSOLUTE joke. Like hackers can basically anything you can think of an experienced CE user can do it. One of the things that DOES ban you however is if you have an illegal or impossible item item in your inventory such as a stormruler +69. Now recently there has been a malicious script floating around that enables hackers to force said illegal items into other players inventories and get their accounts banned. As shitty as that situation was you COULD just make another stream account and family share the game to your new account to get yourself UN-Banned. As of today because FROMSOFT disabled familysharing of a game YOU LEGALLY OWN. You can no longer do this, this change is absolutely TERRIBLE because it enables malicious hackers to PERMANENTLY get innocent players banned. Fuck From Software and fuck Dark Souls 3 , DON'T Waste your money on this POS."
Negative,Alright game.  But Bandai Namco / From Software have the worst consumer service I've seen in years.  I've been banned for years.  And don't even know why.  Maybe picked up something a hacker dropped. And after 4 years it says no changes have been made so I will stay banned.  Yet I reformatted my hard drives.  Reinstalled Windows once a years. To make sure there was nothing on my PC that was messing me up.  All  characters are deleted.  What else is left to do? But no one from this company is checking if any changes have been made to my PC.  In my 25 years of gaming I have NEVER been banned from anything before.  And have never been treated  this way before. Keep away from this one.  Or you might paid 60+ dollars for a game you can't play
Negative,"it plays good but its really soulless and the dlc is pretty weakbloodborne, ds1, and ds2 are better games in different ways. i never beat demons souls i dont have a ps3?"
Negative,I love this game (my favorite in the series despite its flaws) but it's been 2 months now and the servers still aren't up. Believe it or not I miss the PVP in this game. Pls bring them back
Negative,this game makes me want to tear every hair out of my head one by one and then hot glue them back on7/10
Negative,No happiness ahead
Negative,"One of my favourite game made by a studio who is even worse at communicating and fixing shit than rockstar. Get a grip fromsoft, its soon been OVER 6 MONTHS SINCE THE SERVERS WENT OFFLINE.If the modding community could get servers running the same week as when the servers were shut down, why cant you guys?"
Negative,"""My thanks, Ashen One.I will assuredly finish the painting.Of a cold, dark, and very gentle exclusive IP for PS4.One day, it will make someone a goodly Bloodborne™.""Now, getting into the heart of the matter, as part of the DkS trilogy it's the worst in terms of PvE (besides being the easiest of the series, even DkS II had a few good areas beyond the DLCs) and PvP (not due to connectivity, which is by far the best of the series, but lack of poise and variety of weapons; spammable weapons and stunlock weapon arts being so popular, especially among gankers, as a direct consequence of the aforesaid). It turns to be a pretty straightforward experience with little, if any, differences between playthroughs and boring duels / invasions."
Negative,"For the TRUE DARK SOULS FAAAAAAN this game is obviously a must-buy.But be warned, it pales in comparison to the majesty of Dark Souls II.At launch, Dark Souls II had much more impressive set pieces, more content, and a more varied equipment library. Dark souls III also lacks the NG+ red phantom occupation that made Dark Souls II so much more fun to play through a second time.Equipment upgrading is streamlined. You can no longer upgrade armor, but shields and weapons are still upgradable. DSIII spams you with a variety of upgrade stones, so any non-unique/soul weapons can be gemmed up for any character build. Want to use a giant hammer with your dex character? Just toss a Sharp Gem in that thing, and now it scales with DEX instead!The covenant system has been simplified in favor of an item-equip method for changing between them. A welcome change, in my opinion.I-frame management (dodge ability) has changed back to the system from Demon's Souls. Adaptability has been removed, and now your I-frames are entirely dependent on your equipped weight percentage.Playing with friends is easier than ever before! Summoned phantoms scale to your level in damage and defense, Soul Memory is GONE, and so is that annoying ring-based co-op system. Now you just enter a multiplayer password in the options menu, and you'll only see phantoms with the same password.The fidelity of animations seems to be improved. Baddies track you better during strafing manouvers, bosses have an easier time keeping their focus on you, and there is plenty of fast and furious fighting to be had again this time around.Really, where darksouls III falls flat is in the breadth and quality of it's content. The game as a whole feels lifeless and gray compared to previous titles. Not to mention short, and much easier than it really should be. Beating the last boss left me saying ""That's it?""Gone is the terrifying filth of the Tower of Latria, the splendor of Anor Londo, and the GIANT SWINGING AXES of Sen's fortress. You can't go on adventures in any paintings, and there are no giant rusted copper knights with heavy green adornment, or fields full of crystal monsters. All of those memorable, difficult fights from previous games like the Armor Spider, the dragon you have to kill with the huge crossbows from Demon's Souls, the rickety wooden bridges that swing to and fro, the slums filled with backstabbing thieves and the damn demon-headed asshole with his super cheezy dog minions that they put WAYYYYYY TOO EARLY IN THE GAME GOD DAMNIT! YOU COULD GO TO HELL IN DARK SOULS. AND THE UNDERWORLD! WITH THE ENDLESS ASH LAKE BENEATH THE EARTH! I mean, shit. Look at what they did with the dark souls II DLC. The castle of ashes? Collecting allied knights to help you kill that dude in the arena of flame? The evil fucker in the bottom of that one place with the two swords who was SUPER tough? Entering the samurai dude's memory through his flaming red armor? That was AWESOME!It has all been replaced by hordes of foot-soldier hollows, one or two beastly worm creatures from Princess Mononoke, and knight spam. All of that in a monotone brick castle. Oh yeah, and you can dunk your head in wax. Cool.From Software has made the most technically complete Dark Souls title, and left out all of the content. This game feels almost like a tech demo compared to their previous entries in the series.I hope they pick it up with a totally awesome suite of DLC, because it has SOOOO much potential."
Negative,"Online play is absolutely terrible. -People you summon might be ice-skating around and the same goes for invaders, hitting you with no animation and being impossible to attack. When being summoned to another hosts world you might have similar problems with lagging and even NPCs being statues taking dmg 5 seconds after being hit.-Covenants are absolutely broken. Blue Sentinels and Darkmoon Blades are the same thing and both share dependancy on way of the blue users. Not only does the way of the blue player need to be around the same level and weapon upgrade level they also need to have not defeated the area boss, so this leads to people never getting summoned as a blue in 200+ hours of gameplay. The matchmaking is even broken beyond that allowing some people to be consistently summoned as blues due to being prioritized for unknown reasons, making everyone else wait forever. So hope you will be one of the prioritized players or you will never be able to get any PvP with those 2 covenants ever.-Rosarias Fingers covenant is also completely useless, you never need to equip the covenant item as you can invade as any other covenant except for mound makers and Sunbros and be always rewarded with pale tongues which are the reward for Rosarias covenant. As a result players end up with hundreds of Pale tongues that they can do absolutely nothing with since every covenant item is worthless beyond 30. The general feeling you get is that the covenant system is an afterthought added into the game with no depth whatsoever. Grind 30 of each item and never bother with the covenants again.-Invading is broken. You invade a host who can have 3 phantoms at the same time, each with Estus flasks to heal themselves and the host with 25% increased health due to being embered. If you somehow manage to kill a phantom the host can immediately summon another. So have fun invading into a 4v1 gankfest with the latency inconsistencies mentioned.Play through the game offline and experience the different endings and never look back and never go online and you will have a good time. If you try PvP or online play you will be gravely disappointed."
Negative,"I do recommend; however, you should probably disable online until From Software releases a fix for the Remote Code Execution exploit that allows whoever connects to your world run code through your computer and infect your computer with viruses."
Negative,Thank you Bandai Namco for such a great anti-cheat system. After disabling family share option I cannot play online anymore. P.S. Boss Rush and Cinders are great mods btw.
Negative,"No cloud saving, is this a joke ? (almost all the games on steam have this service)Lost my 37 hours save because of that."
Negative,dont play this game right online right now as there is a remote executable  exploit  that puts your pc at risk.
Negative,"Do not get the game yet, as the servers are not up and are a pretty important part of the game."
Negative,"Okay, i always loved this game, and (partially) loved the community, however getting banned and loosing all progress on 5 fleshed out characters that i loved and worked on played for years felt like shit and still does, hackers and their filthy tricks are absolute scum and from software seems to only make it worse by banning it;s victims, i would rather encounter 10 hackers each time i log in than getting wrongfully banned and losing everything on ALL characters because of ONE character getting hacked, HOW DOES THAT EVEN MAKE SENSE? FUCK THIS  GAME AND FUCK MALCOM REYNOLDS"
Negative,"My game has been ruined by an exploit which the developers could have fixed but chose not to. It's unacceptable. Indeed this exploit has been described as possibly allowing other players to negatively influence your computer in ways outside of just influencing your save.This game is literal malware, and should be removed from steam until the developers have fixed it."
Negative,"No Cloud Saves. This is the exactly the kind of game that absolutely needs to have cloud saves. It's easy to implement. Almost every developer, large and small, does it. The worst part is that the game makes a big, dramatic fuss about ""Syncing"" and ""Retrieving your save data"" every time you start it. But all of that is for nothing. The game works *exactly* as if your game saves were stored locally only. Any time you have an issue with Windows, need to free up space or whatever, your progress is irretrievably wiped. The game forgets that it was ever installed on your system."
Negative,"Gameplay wise i'd give this and the other games in the ds line of games a positive review, it's been a bit over 6 months since fromsoft took the servers down to fix an exploit modders fixed within a month of the exploit being revealed. It really feels like fromsoft is pulling a earlyaccess and abandoning their prior games. Online play is a big bit of these games,even if you just do coop/read messages. It also locks people out of some achievements/guild gear."
Negative,"The game itself is excellent in most respects. From Software's treatment of their paying customers? Not so much. I was banned from multiplayer on accusations of cheating/hacking: I have not modified the game in any way whatsoever and From offered no evidence in support of their claims. They won't be getting a dollar from me ever again, and if even 1/4 of the internet is to be believed, I am far from the only one who has been treated this way. Buy this game if you like giving your money to people who then make false accusations and ban you from using a major part of the product you paid them for."
Negative,"Wonderful game, can't recommend enough. However, some hackers have recently become active who can put your character in a NG/NG+ (with all of your gear, inventory and SL) through the very fact of your summoning or invading into your world. Doing so makes your character vulnerable for anti-cheat ban cause now you look like a cheater. Word is that it was reported to the devs about exploits in the net code but they didn't respond. And now here I am, losing all 66h progress of my first run because of this.Stay safe and use anti-cheaters modes, now I am aware that there are some good options out there."
Negative,Servers still down.
Negative,The servers are down still even after 2 months.
Negative,"This is, thematically and in terms of gameplay, the finest game in the Dark Souls trilogy. I recommend getting it on PS4 on XBox One, or getting it on PC and immediately installing an anti-cheat mod. Unmodded, the game has serious vulnerabilities. We're not talking floaters in Fall Guys - we're talking unpatched exploits that can potentially damage your hardware. Thus, and considering Bandai Namco's and From Software's poor track record with reacting to vulnerability reports, the product as is is extremely not recommended."
Negative,"I'm really trying to like this game but i get invaded every 5 minutes by either a player who clearly has much much much better stuff then i have or a straight up cheater. I also feel like i cant criticize this game without all the fanboys acting like i just butchered their Sacred cow. I loved the pvp in dark souls 1 and 2 so its not like i just don't like dark souls pvp. I'm not sure what i don't like more. How toxic this game can be or the people who are willing to defend it. Its like people cant understand that maybe there's a happy medium between getting invaded every 10 minutes by someone whos clearly got far better stuff then you and never getting invaded at all. I had to literally go offline for the aldrichs faithful area cause of how insane it gets. Which is sad cause i used to love the coop community and the invasion community. I love taking part of it and doing the covenant stuff but this just goes to an extreme. Hopefully this is just cause of the covid-19 and everyone is just online right now cause if this is the norm i have seriously lost respect for these developers. Also when people say that is excusable merely cause those are the intended game mechanics i really think you have your head up your dark hole. Just cause its an intended game mechanic doesn't even remotely mean that its a good one. I can make a game mechanic that makes it so you have to hit an enemy 1 million times before you kill then and they only have to hit you once to kill you plus your character is blind so your screens black and oh your opponent can move faster than you can react......that doesn't mean anything cause just its in the game. And those who say ""stop complaining and just play offline"" just show how bad the pvp really is. Cause that means i literally have to stop playing a decently big part of the game all cause of one toxic mechanic. I shouldn't have to forgo many fun gaming mechanics cause of one terrible one. ""go offline"" isn't a solution its a testament to how bad this game is with pvp. I'm sure some people are going to rabidly defend this games pvp but hopefully those who are actually willing to put down the pitch forks and listen hopefully this review can give you some insight. There is alot good about this game but thats no excuse for how terrible the pvp portion is."
Negative,"Pros: Stunning visuals, epic boss encounters, wide range of weapon choices and combat styles. The game isn't so much ""difficult"" - it simply has a high learning curve for basic combat. Cons: For players who enjoy pvp... this is probably not the game for you. The developers quit caring about the game ages ago, while serious exploits (such as cast animation swapping, moveswapping, and tumblebuffs) have been known about and left unfixed for years. Furthermore, every aspect of online play is riddled with hackers, which the developers do absolutely nothing to deal with. Furthermore, the ""artistic vision"" of the developers got in the way of making a quality game in numerous aspects: involuntary pvp for players trying to co-op, pointless platforming sections on a game engine that can't handle it well, bonfires being set too far from bosses, and arbitrary npc triggers for questlines that are so unintuitive that you're practically forced into using a wiki if you want to finish their quests.Addendum: For the players saying having the nearest bonfire to every boss being at least a 1-minute walk is to prevent the game from being easy - wasting players time playing a walking simulator rather than being able to practice fights isn't creating difficulty, it's just wasting time."
Negative,NIGHTS OF THE HOLY!!!!!!!! Every single person playing this game is a LARP fanatic who thinks playing with swords is cool...... touch a woman not a child!  Also you wouldn't be able to swing around half of the weapons in this  game because you wouldnt be able to lift your obese club you call an arm!  You can put points in dex all you want and you still wont be able to get out of the disgusting chair you are sitting  in!! Look down and be ashamed you aren't a knight or a crusader  you are a grown ass man playing a 90 year old game that isnt fun!!

Negative,"Lots of hackers on ds3.  One force joined my game as a blue sentinel, added every item to my save and crashed my game.   This exploit is listed here, https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/n1235k/potential_pc_security_exploit_spreading/ and it ruins the game.  After trying to play this game with my partner for 15 hours, its very disappointing to have our progress reset as we want the challenge and to be unable to play the game due to the exploit also causing overheating issues with GPUs!!!  We have uninstalled the game and will not return until this exploit gets patched, I STRONGLY encourage others to do the same."
Negative,"If you have a xbox controller available to you, get this game! The graphics are lovely, and the game lives up to it's hype. If you're like me and you play with mouse and keyboard, you're better off buying a different game. The in-game tutorial is based on xbox controls, so unless you constantly want to check in key bindings what key equals what xbox-button, this game is not a good choice. I was extremely excited to play this game, but the lack of mouse-keyboard support made the game feel even harder than it is meant to be. Even switching weapons takes up more time than it should. Conclusion: Great game if you have a controller. Not so great if you have keyboard and mouse."
Negative,Online servers are still down.
Negative,Great game but the amount of cheaters just ruins the online experience for everyone
Negative,"Cheaters are too rampart to enjoy the game, and they can put cheated items into your inventory, causing you to be softbanned, along with the cheaters."
Negative,good game but no server sadge. imma not recommend until server back up
Negative,no online multiplayer server support since Elden Ring released. I was looking forward to playing DS3 in co-op with a friend while I wait for Elden ring to get a few patches but that's no longer an option -.- 4/10.
Negative,"I've been trying SO HARD to actually enjoy this game. And the first DS for what matters. On the paper these are games I should love: I really like the art style, the theme, the quirkiness. The inventive bosses design, the many way the game can be played, the many weapons, etc.I like the slow pace, being rewarded for being clever and thinking outside the box. Love the exploration, the level design.I should love this game but I just can't.I played twice: a few years ago for about 8 hours and again now, because of the hype around Elden Ring, I wanted to give this franchise a second shot. I've also played a bit more hours of DS1 which I prefered overall.Now I've been stuck again for hours at end with the first boss, Iudex Gundir. I can almost kill him but just by luck most of the times.I tried not fighting him to understand his attack patterns, I played defensive waiting for my window of opportunity and then striking him. The second phase is what I find unfair: the boss assumes a shape so odd and so big that it's really hard to tell what's going on on the screen, to begin with. There's no way to understand its patterns because I just can't see shit of what's going on. Overall after hours of trying to fight the same boss, I see no progress at all. It is just too much frustrating.I gave up. My theory on this Souls game: some people have grown up playing this type of 3D games with controller, I've never owned a console apart from an ATARI 2600 in the late 80s and a NES. I believe I'm just not trained enough to play 3D games with a controller.And then when I look at people playing it on YT they make it look super easy, I saw people beating Iudex Gundir at their first try. There's something to get used to that I just can't see. The movement system, the constant timing of the rollings, getting used to the timings of the hits.I don't know, I'm a bit jealous of people that are enjoying this kind of games because I can see the appeal but I have to admit to myself I'm not meant to play and enjoy them.Have fun!EDIT: Out of spite, I've bought Elden Ring and I'm really enjoying it, especially the combat! It may sound absurd but I believe after I'll finish ER I'll give the old DS games a third chance. Thanks for all the awards, you git gud folks!"
Negative,WHERE IS SERVER
Negative,I have skill issue.....
Negative,Servers still down
Negative,My Favorite game of all time. Worth buying.
Negative,"I enjoyed the game, but my progress got reset because of a retarded hacker. Think they should invest in some anti cheats. Not invest anymore time in the game until they get shit sorted out.Always save you game files after each boss if you wanna be sure."
Negative,"This is my personal opinion""I expected nothing and was still let down"" describes how I feel about this game and here is why:I have played a whole lot of Dark Souls 1 and 2 and some bloodbourne on console and have been a huge fan since. To begin with I have to say the game plays amazingly fluent in PvE. Hitboxes are great, rolls feel really smooth. The bosses are some of the most memorable fights in the entire series. Although I dislike the artstyle of bloodbourne and Dark Souls 3, I have to say the game looks great, not amazing but great. Since the release of Dark Souls 2 I became a massive Pvp enthusiast. Despite great flaws Dark Souls 2 offered endless motivation: a sheer endless amount of builds, weapon variety, great possibilities to outplay your opponent and much more. I feel like Dark Souls 3 misses out on so many of these things. Backstep invincibility frames are gone, power stance is gone, arenas are gone. This game feels like a downgrade in terms of online gameplay to me. Furthermore most of the weapons feel the same. Movesets are mostly the same and nothing extraordinary. Weight makes no difference for stamina recovery or invincibility frames which then gives no reason to use light weight armor at all. Also NG+ is another disappointment. No new enemies, no new armor or weapons, only upgraded versions of rings. So no real motivation to go into NG+ at least for me.  As for now one of the most core mechanics of the series is simply turned off: Poise. Wearing heavy armor used to give your character poise which resulted in you not being stunlocked by light attacks. Now that this is turned off you can get stunlocked by a rat even when wearing heavy armor. Bandai namco is denying that this feature is turned off and are simply saying: ""works as intended"".  In other words there is little to no hope this will ever get fixed. Dark Souls 2 has been a complete mess the first months after release too but not like this. Despite insanely broken weapons, spells, mechanics the game was still fun. I can not say this for Dark Souls 3. I want to love this game but I can't. All in all: If you are looking for singleplayer, this is your game. But in terms of online gameplay and PvP this game blows as for now. Maybe it will be fixed, probably not."
Negative,"Bandai Namco blames players for getting their saves ruined by invading cheaters.Also since poise dosent work, over half of the armors are useless.This game is currently getting staggered simulator.If you want to play Dark Souls 3, play it on consoles."
Negative,"Well, instead of actually making the anti-cheat good, like some of our modder friends out there, Fromsoft went and decided to take away family share, so when people are banned illegitimately, they have no other way to play the game, aside from buying either the 60 dollar normal copy of the game. OR end up buying the 89 dollar, deluxe edition, which isn't really worth it, because I'm just going to get invalid items, forced straight into my inventory by another hacker. Fromsoft really did something wrong here. Also think about all the innocent people who were just trying to let their sibling try out a game they think they would really like. No, Fromsoft decided just to give them a big F U."
Negative,"Love this game. Bought it a while ago and had countless hours of fun with it. But online is a large portion of all of Dark Souls games. And the servers are offline and it looks more and more like they are offline for good. And yet the game is labeled as ""coop"" and sold for $59. That's full price for what is essentially half a five year old game. Not recommended."
Negative,Ty devs for the dead servers after elden ring release
Negative,"Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' - Bandai ""Limp Bizkit"" Namco"
Negative,piece of shit easy game
Negative,A I D S
Negative,"not worth buying for online experience, you should pirate it"
Negative,"Entertaining game but have the worst publisher. Just think, Namco ban you for what a dude with scripts could do to your account with CE. But if you reclaim, they gonna flagged you anyway for something before the current incident. Is sad how, they even try to remove family sharing, to save play its games out of your main. Cannot say I am happy with communitty itself. But totally is worth playing the story. PVP, you can by your own risk."
Negative,Online experience game that can't be played online without the risk of hackers accessing your machine. Would not recommend.
Negative,"No more Zweihander wielding Giant Dads, unplayable."
Negative,This game is a smegma parfait.
Negative,"Don't buy this game until the servers come back up, the game is worse without it. No news on when that'll be."
Negative,"No servers, no save game, if that is OK then you will have NP."
Negative,"Thumbs down only for the fact that bandai namco has not said a word about the sever issue. I reccomend others do the same. Co op and pvp are extremely important elements in the soul series, and for bandi namco to treat the games this way is just insulting to the players."
Negative,"If you have any intent or thought about playing online, do not buy this game. You can get banned for doing nothing wrong or just being in the session of a hacker. All your time and work but unable to use online because you were in the same session of a hacker.--Edit after a long time. The game had an issue with shadow banning people for no good reason. Game itself was very good."
Negative,"I'll start this off with saying I'm a huge fan of FromSoftware and their games. Dark Souls and Demon Souls are games that are great enough to have an entire genre based off of them. Across the Dark Souls trilogy I have over a thousand hours across PS4 and PC - so it goes without saying I've enjoyed it at some point.To get to the point, the issue with Dark Souls III isn't the game, it's a chunk of it's community in online play. I'm not going to sit here complaining about 3v1s, cheesy tactics or chugging, but there's so many cheaters here now. A big part of Dark Souls for a lot of players is the PvP, but whats the point when people can teleport you/mobs, deliver instant kills from nowhere or toggle invincibility?I mean just recently while invading as an Aldrich Faithful, my screen went black then I got a ""You Died"" screen pop up repeatedly while I lost all my souls. Couldn't even do anything aside from force closing the game as I was stuck in a cycle of death. As far as I'm aware, that's shouldn't be possible. Sometimes you meet some cool people who respect the game and people trying to play it, and you'll get a fair game. But with how rampant it's been today I feel like I have to leave this negative review.I was hoping to get back into this game's PvP after a long hiatus, but I really couldn't recommend it - hopefully one day they find a way to prevent it from happening, but I'm sure someone will still find a way to ruin it.As a side note - might be worth buying on discount as a game to play offline.For any real players still out there, you're masochists."
Negative,"It seems I was mistaken in giving FromSoft another chance. When they released Dark Souls 2, it quickly became apparent that they had lost their way and insisted on fixing things that simply weren't broken. And although the environment of Dark Souls 2 was interesting, it was the completely mucked up controls that took away any chance of me enjoying it. Add, on top of that, the strange system of ""soul memory"" and limits on enemy respawns, and you get a clumsy and awkward game. This  leads to the current game of Dark Souls 3.Now, I enoyed Demon's Souls and Dark Souls 1 immensely. These were, after all, so well done that I figured everyone messes up now and then (DS 2). Surely they would see the error of their ways and make Dark Souls 3 something to remember. I watched reviews on YouTube and read several articles online that seemed to indicate that FromSoftware was aware of their mistakes, and were coming back to form, as it were.When I finally decided to give it a try, I found myself enjoying the game, much like my experience with Demon's and Dark Souls 1. It wasn't until I had played the game three or four hours that I realized something was very different about this iteration. There was something wrong with the whole poise system. It seemed no matter how high I got my poise rating, any and everything could interrupt any and every attack of my own. I saw complaints about this online and even read that poise was simply deactivated in the release. Okay, maybe they'll just reactivate it in the next patch. No big deal, right? Wrong! Apparently, according to FromSoftware, the poise system was working as intended. Apparently poise is now a useless stat. Anyone who's played the previous Souls titles knows that poise is vital to gameplay. If this stat is working as intended in DS3, I cannot recommend this game to anyone.On top of this essentially game-breaking stat, you have the issues that many have been complaining about since lauch. Players are getting hard and soft banned due to unintentional run-ins with hackers and the like.Another issue that comes up is enemy placement. In the previous games, you can tell that FromSoftware strategically placed enemies after careful thought and consideration for the flow of the stage. In DS3, ""Moar is better! Just put enemies any and everywhere for strategy and stuff."" seems to express their approach more accurately. They really gave up a lot of credibility, in my mind, when they stooped to this type of mentality. Now I haven't played the game all the way through, but I get the impression that FromSoft has simply peppered the story with nostalgia characters/items to entice those who loved Demon's and Dark Souls.My advice: stay away from this game. If you loved Demon's Souls and Dark Souls 1, you will be disappointed. If all you want is to have the game in your library so you can say, ""LOL it's hard. Recommended,"" just... no."
Negative,"Servers still down months after the bug that lead to them coming down was made known, and months after the same bug was fixed for Elden Ring. Absolutely no excuse for such behavior, they're clearly trying to push people to buy and play Elden Ring instead."
Negative,"For the purpose of this review, I will be putting out there that I've had over 600 hours clocked in on the PS4 version of the game, and for the PC version 102.8 hours. So I've played Dark Souls 3 for a total of 702.8 hours(at the time of this review).Dark Souls 3 is in a bit of a weird place for me. I want to enjoy it, to praise it as an amazing last entry to the Souls franchise, but I can't. The game has quite a few glaring issues that many reviewers have simply over-looked. So let's get started.Gameplay wise, the game is the exact same as the previous two entries. Which is all well and good, the only differences from the other two entries is that they brought back the Magic Bar(now dubbed as Focus Points), and introduced Weapon Arts. However, mechanically speaking, the game plays almost entirely different from the previous games, Poise now dictates how many hyper-armor frames you have in your attacks, rolls cost little stamina and can be spammed in succession, the game has a ""two-hit"" system, where if you hit someone with a single R1 with anyone except 1-handed daggers, you're guaranteed a second hit. A 3rd swing after the 2nd one will not stun them, as after the second swing they can just roll away. This transitions over to the PvE aspect of the game as well, making it to where the PvE AI is almost always going to get a 2nd hit on the player if they hit them once. This is a very poor system, and makes for a very shallow PvP, as well as making any runs after your 1st of the game feel tedious and redundant. R2's are nearly useless, as they don't get the same benefit of the system as R1's do.Along with the puzzling balancing of two R1's doing more damage then a charged R2 in most scenarios, it makes using R2's laughable, making one part of a weapon's move-set almost never used. Nearly all the weapons in a singular weapon class will have the EXACT same move-set, with only maybe 2-3 weapons having either a unique Weapon Art or R1's/R2's. Which makes only maybe 2-3 weapons in the ENTIRE class of those weapons worth using, and any other weapon in that class useless in comparison.This game's soundtrack is nothing short of amazing, there's nothing more to say on that topic.Although there are amazing boss fights in this game, quite a few of them feel laughably easy. For example, the Deacons of the Deep, High Lord Wolnir, Yhorm the Giant, etc. Although the designs of quite a few of the lesser enemies in the game where great, there were quite a few that honestly felt really lazy, such as the hollows in the High Wall of Lothric, the Deacons, the Crabs, the hollows holding a wooden spear in the Crucifixion Woods, etc. That's not to say that the game's PvE value is lessened by this, because it's great, it just feels like From could have done more.I normally don't have an issue with fan-service, but it feels as if the entire game itself is just one big bundle of fan-service. It feels as if we didn't really get anything new, and that a lot of the armors, weapons, spells, rings, and even NPCs were reused. I questioned myself on multiple occasions if I was playing Dark Souls 3, or a Dark Souls 1 remaster that got Dark Souls 2's armors and some weapons and spells. The major issue that I have, basically, with Dark Souls 3 is that it does nothing to stand out from it's past two games. It doesn't try to break the mold, it stays too close to the Dark Souls 1 style of things, but without true poise, open world exploration, meaningful lore, etc. For me personally, Dark Souls 3 is exactly what I wanted it to not be, a watered down Souls game. For the newcomers to the series, this is a great place to start, as Dark Souls 3 is the most accessible of the Souls games, with Dark Souls 1 having the best PvE, and Dark Souls 2 having the best of PvP. I was hoping that Dark Souls 3 could mesh the two together, and then create something entirely new out of it, but it's too scared to try anything new. Great game, but not the final sequal that I was hoping for."
Negative,go fuck urself
Negative,FIX THE FUCKIN SERVERS FUCKING FUCKS
Negative,This game took my wife. 10/10
Negative,"dont get me wrong, i love this game, but if your going to softban me for using borderless window, thats pretty crappy. not to mention the frame rate drops. waste of money."
Negative,put the servers back up foot-man you lazy bastard
Negative,F8UCK DARK SOULDS ITS A SHIT GAME MADE BY SHIT DEVELOPERS WHO HAVE NO FYUCKING CLUE WAHT THEY ARE DOING WHEN THE FUCK WILL THE DARK SOULDS SERVERS BE BACK ONLINE THEY LITTEREALLY HAVE TO WRITE ONE LINE OF CODE AND ITS TAKING THEM 2 MONTHS. FUCK THIS GANMEN ITS POO AND SHIT
Negative,"Love this game and everything about it, and the series as a whole. However the ban for nothing at all is awesome. So nice to be banned for doing nothing at all. Had a dude gank me who was completely immune to all dmg, and tele backstabs, but im banned. Nice. 10/10 multiplayer"
Negative,"Despite there being no mention of it in 'minimum requirements', this game is unplayable on a keyboard/mouse and requires a controller.The game is a copy/paste from xbox and all of the instructional text refers to xbox controller.  There's no options to customise key-bindings and the default keyboard controls are seemingly placed at random allover the board, while some aren't there at all.As it is, I can't recommend this game to a PC user, as many PC users, like me, would be expecting to play with their standard PC setup.I attempted to play on, using keyboard/mouse, as I assumed I'd better able to, but I was unable to git gud enough."
Negative,"Finally about to play this gem of gaming, but servers have been down since February?  Lol, what timing.  Oh and it would be really nice if the tutorial area tips had the Mouse & Keyboard commands if the PC player were using M&K."
Negative,Fix the servers :/
Negative,"Dead servers, at least could refund or give discount for elder ring for every souls game u own that has servers down. R.I.P."
Negative,"Got permanently auto banned from the game for absolutely no reason, never used mods, never cheated. Yet I saw cheaters constantly in pvp. Good job."
Negative,Hacker forced items into my inventory getting me banned. It takes a month to get unbanned as long as it doesn't happen again. You can only get unbanned once so if it happens again after being unbanned too bad. Family sharing was my only way around this to actually play with my friends but now I can't. Thanks for trying to shove a fat___down my throat Namco.
Negative,Clearly i love this game but after 2 months of the servers being offline all they did was remove the multiplayer tag from the dark souls games on steam. The online component is a pretty big part of DS3 for me. Some of my most memorable moments in this game were just messing around with other people. I guess that's not happening anymore.
Negative,"For the time being this is going to be a negative review, don't get me wrong the game is great and all but I would like to point out a lot of aspects that just make the game bad and no I am not going to rant about the bad optimization but rather the overall feeling of the game and how the ""PVP"" works.Right let's start it off with this game is not hard, the bosses themselves feel quite easy to kill especially with adapt not being in the game anymore its not so much of a challenge to roll out of certain attacks or for the most part you don't even have to roll at all you just use a shield and block all of the attacks yes that is possible now and makes the fights feel just that much easier.Here is an example of a new player to the souls series taking down Pontiff Sulyvahn on their second try:For the PVP it feels like a step back from the Dark Souls 2 more strategy orianted PVP to more Bloodborne mixed with Dark Souls 1 which was okay but that was 2011 and I would like to see an upgrade not a downgrade. For parrying it doesn't even feel rewarding anymore because its so easy to pull off unlike in Dark Souls 2 where you had to know your timings very well to do the parry. As for the rest of the PVP R1 spamming is more rewarding along with shield whoring not only that but its nearly impossible to break through greatshields also I would like to point out that the weapon arts feature feels like its a thing for newcomers to the Dark Souls series because you get a skill with a push of a button like seriously earn your kill don't rely on a in game ""skill"" to help you win. Two more things I would like to point it is the chugs, iframes and HP as an invader. In Dark Souls 2 you would have adaptibilty as your source of iframes and your chug speed which was a great idea it would stop the host from trying to chug and if he had phantoms with him they were not allowed to chug and the host could not heal them by chugging which made ganking situation more fair in a sense that you had a chance to kill the phantoms and the host. However in Dark Souls 3 there is no adat and everyone can chug and also the host has extra 300hp bonus thanks to the ember how does that make things fair I mean sure you can chug so what if the other phantoms can chug too I do know that you get an estus for each phantom you kill but that doesn't necessarily mean that its more ""fair"".Overall the setting of the game and feel is fantastic the game immerses you very well into its world and is very nostalgic so many things to remind you of the past and I really do love Miyazki for brining back most of these things that we loved about Dark Souls 1 but nostalgia cannot save the game alone.If the PVP does change which it will of course they have to balance out the game but in its current state I will leave this review as it is and when the game changes ovetime I will re-write my review and give my definitve answer."
Negative,"Great game, but malicious script kiddies and poor anti-cheat systems are currently teaming up to ruin online play for a lot of players. Don't bother buying it unless single player is all you care about.Edit: slightly less punishing for being the victim of a hacker, but you still need third-party software if you want decent anti-cheat. Also the best weapon is DLC-only (rip Door fans)."
Negative,"False Positive Sensitive System can cause you instant ban. During my DS3 offline farming ( because my friend is on holiday ) My SL is only level 124 , Don't even like cheating crap and stuff, I was that time had 150112 Souls. With arming "" Shield of Want "" ( From Smouldering Lake ) , I can rake up 200k souls in 10 - 15 Bonfire run in Anor Londo.But when my friend comes back and i turned back "" Online "" mode on DS3, I suddenly got : [CAUTION] YOU HAVE BEEN PENALIZED. Whut... I haven't cheat ever since. like wtf is that all about?!Don't even think about asking me to delete my toon which i worked hard for. Fromsoft, you better fix that False Positive system of yours. I am Wrongfully banned for this.Edit for extra reasons :If you un-banned me, il fix back to Recommend this game to YES. Because now your stupid system are Wrongfully targeted me for being a Cheater like I've been using a trainer or something...Don't think of what I've wasted my money for 2 Extra DLC ,Ashes of Ariandel and The Ringed City... I PAID FOR THOSE GAME!"
Negative,Trash muliplayer hacker broke my games 2 timesHad to restart 2 timesmultiplayer is broken pos who invade u and use their cheats to destroy your game with cheats already made by someoneSteam does nothing even if you report them You can launch the game go to all players in shift tab and report themall these mofos had private profiles Multiplayer is fucking brokenI have had 2 saves which helped me for hackers but don't expect to be playing online and not encounter cheaters oftensave often aka backup your save which is assthat sounds like fun doesn't it?waste of time
Negative,fix the servers
Negative,Game has a lot of bugs. Wait until the first batch of updates roll out before purchasing.
Negative,"had three hard crashes in two hours worth of play, all without warning, running smooth on max settings.alse random 1-2second freezes sometimes when picking up items."
Negative,please understand small indie company can't fix their broken ass multiplayer lolealso its worse than ds2 (which also sucks) because at least ds2 is interesting to play
Negative,"I love the souls series. I've played 'em all for hours on end. Even this one, you'll find, i've sunk 300 hours into. But 299 of those hours were spent lying to myself. I was happy that soul memory was gone, and that the password system had made it in. But the password system wasn't the only thing they took from Bloodborne. The combat system functions more like Bloodborne than Dark Souls. Dark Souls was about being caution, timed blocking and stamina management. Now it's about being fast, and agressive. That worked in Bloodborne, but Dark Souls 3 gives you the tools to play cautiously, like other souls entries, but encourages that you play fast and agressive. There are many risks to playing slowly and carefully such as being guard broken or being overwhelmed, but all these risks can be negated by abusing the powerful dodge roll. It costs little stamina and has incredible frames, which can be further buffed by rings.  The plot is a mess. ""Time is convoluted in Lordran"" is what we're told, but that statement can be used to answer most lore questions. There are a few interesting character questlines, and these really shine. When the game isnt appealing to your nostalgia by directly and unironically refrencing the previous games is where Dark Souls 3 perks up. But then they recycle a theme, location or straight up character and the game shrugs its shoulders and says ""time is convoluted but isnt it cool they're here?"" The DLC does little to bring anything new, content to wallow in nostalgia. They even go as far as to make a certain boss painfully similar to a Bloodborne boss. Anything new is shoved aside and concluded poorly to focus on refrences. One of the most praised elements of Dark Souls 3 is its level design, but even there the laziness shows. The world isn't interconnected, like Dark Souls 1. There are 3 branching paths that are available later in the game; a secret area acessed pretty cleverly, a second secret area accessed by going left in a fork in a road, and the DLC. The rest of the levels are in sequence. The level themselves are pretty boring, however. They do look good and are visually pleasing, but very often rely on ""find a bonfire and then unlock shortcuts back to that bonfire."" There are very few options for alternate ways to progress, as most levels are incredibly linear. Some areas either have a shortcut available that just needs some clever dropping/jumping, or are simply huge open forested areas. Exploring these areas yields very little, as equipment is very limited. There are plently of weapons available, but each weapon class has its clear best choice, while the other weapons in its category are largely worse.  There is no replayability in Dark Souls 3. Once you've beaten the game, you'll find that NG+ has nothing new to offer except some stronger versions of already exsisting rings. The only point to NG+ aside from the rings is resetting your respec currency and respawning the bosses. The bosses are where the game really shines, sometimes. There are very few unique and original ideas for bosses here. They tried to step away from armored humanoids that Dark Souls 2 continued to throw at us, but ended up relying on that trope too much again. So many bosses are praised to be the best in the series, when they're painfully generic. The soundtrack sounds good, but all the songs are interchangable. ""An orchestra has a fit while a woman goes ""ahhhhhhhhhhh"" sums up most tracks in the game. A lot of bosses are just more nostalgia pandering as well, as they all have some tie to a previous souls game. It wouldn't be so bad if they expanded on the refrence, but they dont. The refrences are there just to refrence. That's it. The bosses can be defeated by rolling through their attack, then pressing your attack button as fast as you can. Rinse, repeat, dead. There are very few bosses that deviate from this, but the ones that do either die in one hit after jumping through some hoops or are defeated using a special weapon that directly refrences Demons Souls.  I tried to tell myself that all the obvious pandering, poor gameplay and horrible multiplayer was ok. It was more Dark Souls, that's not a bad thing. But it is. From Software designed Dark Souls 3 to be a trip down memory lane, to be experience once and then shelved. It might be the closest thing we get to Bloodborne on the PC, but that doesn't mean i'm supposed to ignore the issues and praise it because it's the last entry in the series. It's unfortunate that Dark Souls had to end this way. If you're looking to pick up Dark Souls 3, don't. Play the other entries in the series and don't spoil your love for the series with this lazy attempt to appeal to it."
Negative,"Servers still down after 3 months! For a game franchise that has such a massive loyal fan base and community and they hit us with something like this. I cant even explain the amount of disgust and shock that a company would even try to harm their community the way they have done. all the souls borne are absolute masterpieces and new players to the franchise that are might come from Elden Ring will never experience the same experience that all us fellow fans have experienced (yes they can play solo but were is the PVP or even messages to leave for new players to guide them on there journey). I'm not sure if the developers had looked at the success of Sekiro (I love the game BTW) and thought that they could do the same thing to dark souls but it just does not translate into a game like Sekiro. I know for a fact that I am not the only one thinking this as anyone can see on this page dark souls used to be above 93% positive and now its been lowered to 76% and counting. I understand why they took the servers down to fix a serious issue but there are people who have already written the crucial lines of code that could be implemented and then everyone is happy, to me it does not make sense with the launch of Elden ring for people that complete it they can revisit / be introduced to dark souls. Please bring the servers back thank you."
Negative,"I have mixed feelings about Dark Souls 3. On one hand, it's not obviously bad in some places like Dark Souls 2, but on the other I don't know what this game is trying to be. It has elements from all 4 Soulsborne games that don't go well together. It's definately an enjoyable game, if you're into the Souls series, but also disappointing in some ways. Let's start out with the positive side of Dark Souls 3:+The game looks gorgeous, no question about that. Probably the best looking Souls game on PC to date. +The world is huge and well connected. Not quite as well connected as DS1, but you can see other areas from your current area (like seeing the Bell tower from Sen's Fortress) and there are no weird Earthen Peak -> Iron Keep situation. +It is easier than every to play with friends with the new password system (although I've seen people say it doesn't work)Now let's talk about what I don't like in Dark Souls 3:-My main problem with the game is the change of pace. Enemies are a LOT more agressive this time around, with seemingly infinite stamina and long combos. It gets particularly bad mid to late game when enemies get a ridiculous damage and health boost. The game essentially punishes you hard if you do anything other than roll and mash attack. Tanking is pretty much pointless (you can't even upgrade armor) and magic users are at a serious disadvantage compared to previous games since their casting speed is so slow and scaling is so messed up early to mid game that you'll be spending more time swinging a sword than casting Soul Arrow. I heard scaling gets better around 50 INT/FTH but I don't care enough to get to that point. -There is a LOT of reused content in this from all previous Souls games. I don't want to spoil it, but there are more recycled characters than new ones. Same could be said about the armor and weapon sets. There is an area that is LITERALLY ripped straight from Dark Souls 1. I know the official explanation is some time distortion shit, but really it's just lazy pandering. I can bash Dark Souls 2 all day, but at least it had more original content than this-Covenants are kind of half baked. People have been reporting that some don't even work properly. -This is the THIRD game on PC that still has fucking Xbox prompts. Why is no one complaining about this? Some people actually play with a keyboard and it's not even that much effort. Modders have been doing it since DS1. Maybe I'm just tired of the Souls formula at this point, but at it's current state Dark Souls 3 is not as fun to play as Dark Souls 1. It's certainly better than Dark Souls 2 but that's not really saying much. I would advise you to wait for the inevitable GOTY edition which will hopefully fix the gameplay issues I have with the game. As it stands it's an okay game, with some really glaring issues."
Negative,Comon. These hackers are still into this. Comon fromsoftware. Get a anti-cheating system.
Negative,No cloud save in 2021.
Negative,"Where are the servers, From?You've sold enough Elden Rings already!"
Negative,"Souls are a great game, but the pathetic number of people who beef up low lvl characters just to invade the first few levels makes the game nigh unplayable. If you havent played a souls game before, DO NOT START HERE. If you can muscle past or have enough experience to go unembered (offline equivalent) Its a blast and I would recommend for anyone looking for a more fast paced, challenging grim fantasy ride."
Negative,"Here in the land of who the fuck knows, be welcomed by familiar faces that want to kill you in the land of Anor CopyPasterino. Be amazed at the sheer downfall in PvP. Going from Honorable duels to Gangbang fools. With that out of the way, Welcome to Gank Souls 3, The Poise strikes back! In this addition be prepared for getting an ass whooping by multiple foes at once as nobody plays fair in this game. If you didnt know it yet you either arent one or you R1 in this game. Be prepared to get trainwrecked by the incoming Scrubfest All night service, Bringing the Chugger Chugger to you at any time in the day. With all these memes aside, the PvE is fun and the bosses are much more challenging than DS2, cant comment on DS1 besides the references to some places. However the PvP in this game is absolutely abysmall compared to the other soul series. No Honor, No Fun, No Escape. *Each purchase of game comes with included pOisters, Poise not included*"
Negative,"I want to reccomend this game, I really do.  The core gameplay is fun, fast, and challenging just like the other Dark Souls installments.  However From Software always seems to put one step forward and two steps back.  The balance in this game definitely needs some work with sorceries and miracles ranging from pointless to OK.  Poise as a mechanic entirely seems to not even be enabled.  Not to mention From's horrible anti-cheat software causing legitimate players to be soft-banned and hackers/cheaters to be able to go unpunished.  If these issues get fixed this game could be outstanding and I will change my review.  Until then, avoid and wait for some major patches."
Negative,"the only award this game should take is for being the worst in its trillogy. this game isthe downgrade remastered version of darksouls1. this fraud of a game has the same bosses, the same locations, the same weapons, the same story, and without shame,they even put the same boss movesets.this game is a fraud. it was meant to be a legal money laundry with a very specific target: no life cucks with noodle arms and used wifes. could never be me btw.nothing is special about this trash. the only notable thing they did is the fact that now they charge 20$ more for a way poorer experience."
Negative,"The bad is far outweighing the good these days on Dark Souls 3 PC... The biggest issue is of course hackers. They're rampant at the meta (SL100-SL140), and there is absolutely nothing you can do when they hit you with a Souls hack, once it has been done you must delete your character and start over, and for someone with as many hours as I've put in on not only PC, but PS4 over 800 hours, Xbox over 500, and on PC 421 hours, most of which was with CHARACTERS I HAD TO DELETE BECAUSE OF HACKERS. It sucks the joy out of the game, and then these trolls sit here sipping their Mountain Dew making excuses for why they hack. It's SIMPLE, you suck at the game, therefore you feel the need to hack. All the cool things these hackers could do and they try (and often succeed at) getting legit players banned.  It's not funny, in anyway, and only serves to anger the good people that paid with their hard earned money for a game that penalises the victim rather than the villain. If I end up getting softbanned, because a hacker modified my save file I'll just go back to PS4 painful as it will be considering the lower grade graphics, and FPS, but it's a lot better than dealing with hackers on a daily basis. If you're just now getting the game, play offline."
Negative,fix the servers
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 is not a bad game, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you have no other Souls-likes in From Software's catalogue to play. If there is another Souls-like in From's catalogue you haven't played yet, go play that instead.Dark Souls 3 is an awkward compromise between Dark Souls and Bloodborne. It wants you to play with the speed and agression of Bloodborne, and so it nerfs or removes many of the defensive mechanics from previous Dark Souls games, like poise. At the same time, because it wants to be a sequel to previous Dark Souls games, it does not include any of the mechanics that make Bloodborne's pace of play fun, like rallying. The result is a game with a confused mechanical identity. While Dark Souls 3 is by no means bad (none of From's modern games are bad), it is the least fun to play out of all of From's Souls-likes."
Negative,"Mechanically speaking, it feels like some weird middle ground between the combat of Bloodborne and Dark Souls, and not always in a good way. The backstory is likewise a jumbled mess with inconsistencies and hanging threads everywhere, despite the actual plot you follow being basically a retread of the first game. That isn't a bad thing in itself, but it compounds the other story issues when the first kept things so much more coherent even in ambiguity. There's still some brilliant level design to be found, although it's balanced out by some equally stupid design choices. As well, the setpiece fights are as gorgeous as ever, but some enemies are so big and visually busy as to obscure their own tells (a problem leftover from Bloodborne), making fighting them that much worse. Netcode seems noticeably sloppier too, given how often phantoms get bugged out of joining boss fights- I've been on both ends of that problem myself.If you're a big fan of the series and dead set on playing this final entry, I guess I can't blame you. Just know that this swan song stumbles as much as it succeeds, and if you came for closure, you're going to be disappointed."
Negative,11/10 best crashes ever.
Negative,"The game gets a load more hate than it should, it's not as bad as people say. View the game for how it stands individually without comparing it to Dark Souls.The only reason this review is negative is due to FromSoftware removing the servers, forcing us to be unable to play with other players."
Negative,"Thanks for ruining my sister playthrough. You dont update the game for 3 years and then decide to update it to remove a feature, instead of improving the actual anticheat. Good work, greedys. I'm sorry but wont pay for Elden Ring."
Negative,"Horrible game mechanics, very clankyThis is a console game ported to the PC and they didn't even make the effort to adapt it to the keyboard, everywhere in the interface it shows the controller buttons such as A, B, X or Y. Meaning you have to constantly go check on the settings to map whatever one button means on the keyboard"
Negative,Servers still offline.
Negative,Staggered by a naked man punching me while in Havels.
Negative,Servers still gone...
Negative,"gud game, but those dum dum stoopid heads gotta fix the servers. Too busy makin Lord of the rings or somethin"
Negative,Do not purchase this game. they are charging you full price for only half the features. BRING ONLINE BACK!!
Negative,"DANGEROUS SOFTWARE!!!Do not purchase this game! There are potentially dangerous network vulnerabilities in the multiplayer which allow tampering with not just your game, but your entire PC. Bandai Namco should be held legally responsible for any and all damage done to users devices and immediately patch the game or shut down the servers entirely - let me repeat that you SHOULD NOT buy this game even if you are willing to deal with hackers, it would be like inviting a burglar into your home and asking them not to steal. Your personal information, and ongoing network security could be at serious risk."
Negative,"So the game itself is actually pretty awesome. Save for basically every single online feature.Elaboration: playing with friends is pretty much the only way I'll play a Souls game (yeah, I'm a pansy WTF ever), and for the most part it makes the game way more tolerable; there's another target for enemies to seek, so you're not just instagibbed by a group of 3 skeles hiting you with 5+ stabs like a fucking prison shanking, bosses become less infuriating, and the company is always appreciated.However, this game is entirely ruined by pretty much everyone else that you come accross online. Save for the entirely intolerable hackers, the PVP fights are complete and utter dumpster fire garbage. Seriously, worse than GTA V's melee combat, which is saying something, since this WHOLE GODDAMN GAME IS MELEE, despite clumsy firebombs, throwing knives, and essentially unusable bows. Player models mean nothing, you're often hit mid roll, melee weapons can become somehow ranged and have the reach of a 50 cal, and you're invaded by some high level douchebag with nothing better to do than ruin your day pretty much every 6 minutes, as if being killed by the last hacking fool wasn't fun enough. As if the Souls worlds weren't already dangerous and infuriating enough, you have to consistenly maintain a supply of embers to even play online with friends, and being killed by an invader, despite losing through lag / hacking / bullshit surprise attacks by people WAY higher levels than you means that you lose your embered state along with all of your souls.I get it. Souls is supposed to be hard, and I'm just being a baby. But gettting killed by some level 100+ asshat with a magic spear that can attack me accross the map is so fucking dumb it's just not worth it to me. Oh, and the blue guys that are supposed to come to help? Yeah, forget them, they're apparently busier than a one toothed man at a corn eating contest, because not one has come to the rescue.All in all, great game. But fuck what they did to online, IMO it ruined basically every redeemable part of it."
Negative,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU ARE NOT PREPARED TO MEET CHEATER INVADER THAT CAN ONE SHOT YOU FROM AFAR USING SMALL SWORD. AND WHAT MAKE IT WORSE THAT IF YOU CAN LAND A HIT OR TWO, THEIR HP DOES NOT EVEN DROP MUCH BUT THEY CAN ONE SHOT YOU. I TRY TO REPORT THE CHEATER BUT I AM SURE DEVS DOES NOT CARE WITH GAME ALMOST 5 YEARS RIGHT. THIS GAME NOT EVEN HARD, WHAT MAKE IT SAD IS THE STUPID PEOPLE THAT CALL THEMSELVES GOOD BY USING CHEAT TO BECOME GOOD. TO ALL CHEATER GET GOOD NOOB. DONT USE PROGRAM TO PLAY GAMES NOOB"
Negative,bring back the servers
Negative,fix the servers
Negative,Horrible performance issues and massive stuttering/fps drops making it unplayable as is.
Negative,Terrible performance on a 5820k with two 980ti in SLI (regardless if sli is enabled or not). Another bad console port to stay far away from.
Negative,good game ahead 9/10 Beeg points not a 10/10 cause it wasn't destiny 2
Negative,"Exceptional singleplayer experience but Pvp sucks and is unbalanced. There's still cheaters everywhere. Some enemy balancing is off, and the lack of poise like DS1 limits your build potential.The game is still 60 euros after 7+ years which is unacceptable"
Negative,"Double Edit: It took them from early february to late september to bring back servers they themselves brought down for zero solid reason for all of their games except Elden Ring. Why do people accept this?Edit: All Dark Souls games and Sekiro are no longer classified as multiplayer on steam, avoid this game and this developer until further notice since they can't even fix fixes correctly.Servers have been down for 3 months, From Software has done absolutely nothing to fix them. There is one post of acknowledgement from over a month ago, and no other news since. This goes for every souls game, and it's shocking that a company could sink as low to abandon their most popular games. It really shouldn't take 3 months to fix servers."

Negative,"PVE is good but this review covers the PVP in this game:No regional matchmaking or connection preference: 70% of your fights are going to be against people from the other side of the world which is unplayable because it throws off the balance. It might take a couple seconds for your opponent to take damage on your end which might also prevent you from getting combos, you can get hit from ranges where you would never expect to get hit or they teleport around without any animations if their own connection is horrible.This game has no anticheat: You can have your whole savefile ruined with Cheat Engine and you can only combat this by making backup saves or protecting yourself with other third-party programs. Reporting profiles on Steam doesn’t do anything.The devs stopped patching this game: Some weapons clearly outperform others and this is because the balance is focused on PVE. This game also has some terrible glitches/exploits."
Negative,"While a lot of fanboys will rage at this review, I need to make this clear that this is a shitty console port.What I mean by that is they literally took the xbox one version, stapped a resolution to it, added steam integration and shipped as - is.. Tooltips ingame tell you to press ""(A)"" on your controller when you do not have one plugged in.Mouse makes you turn your camera and you have to press W to actually turn your character,.The port was done so poorly that even if its gameplay would be good, I say go buy it on a console, it's meant for that.. Don't support a lazy steam port.Thats not even taking into account people that get banned from multiplayer for no reason // Having a hacker invade them.If you're a fan of darksouls, give yourself a favor and get the console version instead. This is pathetic."
Negative,"servers need to be fixed, not worth buying until they do"
Negative,"Fix the servers, Fromsoft.3 Months without any new information.Only focusing on the new title since it brings more income.Sad state for the entire community."
Negative,"Bloodborne with shields.3/10 would ruin a franchise againRecommended with 75%+ offEDIT:I mean it, that's a Soul Series game scrambled together in Bloodborne's engine. Just that (which could explain several lacks in gameplay, like dual wielding and magic sucking a$$ hard).After the release of the 2nd DLC, I have to change my review as to not recommend the game. As someone that pre-ordered it, I felt really disappointed overall. Everything bad in the series came back worst: horrible camera angles, cheap difficulty, NPC bossess, useless magic and a wide array of büII$H!t. Other than that, now I know what real garbage is. DS3 turned out to be a sorry excuse for a money grab, more than DS2 SotFS edition."
Negative,"They just removed family sharing from this game as a warning.  Dark Souls 3 is a fantastic game and I love it.  However this (my primary account) got soft banned a long time ago due to hackers modifying my character and never got unbanned after clearing my data.  So I had to use family sharing as my account to this day is still penalized.  Now my choices are: Buy this game again because of someone else or play only with people who have also been soft banned (my friends who play are not on said list).  If From Software was going to decide to do this they should at least ACTIVELY restore wrongfully punished accounts.Now again, this is a great game and has tons of replay value, but if you have a chance to randomly get banned and have no fix, what's the point?EDIT: After appealing to Namco support my account is finally unbanned after over a year, but they've said next time a character gets modified it's a permanent ban.  Not sure why they'd enforce that without a proper anti-cheat though to help people who get attack by cheaters."
Negative,This game makes me feel like im infected with the rage virus from 28 Days Later.
Negative,love offhand dagger
Negative,"1 hour in, 6 crashes. Around the same places - twice just after tutorial boss just before the double door exit from the boss arena, once inside firelink near the centre bonfire and 3 times at the highwall at the bottom of the stairs near the first bonfire. I am not prepared to suffer through anymore crash-zones til the patches drop. The game seems to run smooth enough but the fps spike down sharply for a second or 2 when it autosaves I noticed (the little flame in the corner that pops up).Don't get it til they fix it, when they do I'm sure it will be a crackin game and I might change my reccomendation when I can actually play without crashes.I can handle a few bugs and glitches in big rpgs like this what I like, but crashing to desktop over and over is just not on.UPDATE:   Turning the lighting and shaders to low in graphics settings has lowered the frequency of crashes. But the dips in framrate are still making it very laggy to play. Changing equipment, picking up items, entering certain areas and sometimes when enemies aggro, the framrate tanks to below 20 for a few seconds, still not changing reccommendation until a proper fix comes out for problems.UPDATE 2:   3.4 hours in -- Crashes without fail everytime 5 seconds after loading into a my character, I run a few steps and boom ""Dark Souls 3 has stopped working"", was working fine then I went and got some food loaded back up and it is straight up not working, no idea why this has started happening, all the settings were the same as before.Sort your game out Fromsoft...UPDATE 3: 30+ hours in Crashing has FINALLY been fixed and can I can play. However lag spikes/FPS drops are still there sometimes causing the game to freezeframe for a second or two! Covenants are not working properly and I can't be summoned by any of the auto-summon covenants depsite being able to invade and be invaded just fine. These are big gameplay elements and they are not working, it is staying negative review until fixed."
Negative,"Firstly I'd like to say that Dark Souls 3 WAS a great game. If you're looking for a good single player game that's difficult get this. However you cannot access co-op without special software because the servers are down indefinitely.However it's been about five months since the RCE exploit was discovered and made public by Blue Sentinels. Apparently FromSoft knew about this exploit (which basically allows a hacker to get complete control over your machine) for a year before this and only paid attention to it when this was made public.After this they made the game offline only and I decided to not leave a review as the community assumed ""It'll be up when Elden ring is out, or just after""It seems that FromSoft just want people to buy Elden Ring and ignore their previous releases and from what I've heard the hasty tacking on of easyanticheat to Elden Ring has seriously impacted performance.If the RCE exploit was impossible to fix I would understand FromSoft keeping the servers down. However the team who discovered the RCE exploit (Blue Sentinels) and made it public have released a community mod that patches the exploit out. FromSoft should have hired these guys from the start. The souls series is a series that heavily focuses on co-op and that has been effectively eliminated by poor management and shekel pinching CEOs. TL;DR - Buy the game when it's fixed. It's currently incomplete. Would you buy Left4Dead if the multiplayer didn't work?"
Negative,"Alright, now that I've slogged through the game, I feel safe making a final judgement.While I have a lot of good about to say about Dark Souls 3's visual style and atmosphere, the game is severely hampered by poor optimization, nonexistant weapon balancing, completely useless heavy armor, and a truckload of bugs.The main issue stems from the gameplay. You, as the player, are slower than molasses, yet nearly every enemy in the game is lightning-fast and comes in packs. This leads to a LOT of cheap deaths, unlike in previous titles where you were punished only for making bad choices. I can't bring myself to recommend a game that punishes you for playing the way it was intended.PvP is in a completely broken state. Poise, as many know, has been cut down to a near-nonfunctional state, encouraging the usage of weapons that can stun-lock an opponent into submission. This turns PvP encounters into something more closely resembling an Old West-style High Noon duel, where whoever draws first wins, rather than a test of your skill against another individual.Final recommendation: If you're a hardcore Souls masochist, I'd still recommend you wait until the game goes on sale. If you're someone who wants to get into the Souls series, go play Dark Souls 1 or 2 instead. Anyone else, don't bother.Also, if you're going to comment, please actually contribute something constructive. ""Git guds"" and the like will be deleted. I won't delete your message if you disagree with me, but your argument should actually be more substantial than a childish insult."
Negative,"I love this game, but the fact that all the PC versions of all the Dark Souls games still have no online functionality it absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable. They need to communicate with us at the very minimum of why it is still not fixed, as they promised it would be up after Elden Ring, which has been out for a while now, so that should be reaching out to us at least. This game is fantastic, but I cannot recommend it until the online functionality is fixed"
Negative,Thanks for charging 60$ and removing multiplayer from the game.
Negative,no keyboard and mouse interface.
Negative,Worst Anti Cheat system ever seen. All praise family account. 5 patches with unnecesary fixes....
Negative,overrated 0- story nothing interesting.i like only bosses. only difficulty makes this game popular
Negative,"one of the best games ever made.terribly run development, poor management from bamco and fromsoft, and offline play has been removed; months after the release of Elden Ring it is still not back online.and it's not just this game, all dark souls games are now offline. a hack / bug is not the reason. they're forcing fans to buy elden ring to be able to play anything online to boost sales of the new game."
Negative,"This is a great game, no doubt about that and if you're playing it as a single player experience then you'll likely have a great time. If you're hoping for an enjoyable online experience look elsewhere. The community can be great, but the underlying problem of cheaters remains unaddressed. Just today I had someone spawn undroppable items onto my character, I deleted my character that I had invested 90+ hours to avoid a ban.These sorts of things simply shouldn't be allowed to occur.. There should be systems in place to make this sort of thing nearly impossible, and yet it seems to be commonplace. The fact that fromsoft still hasn't addressed these issues this long after release is nothing short of a disgrace."
Negative,"Dark souls 3 is frustratingly amazing, but in its current state I do not recommend the purchase of this title.Dark souls pc servers have been offline for two months as of the time of this review, due to an rce exploit. This exploit would have definitely made its way into Fromsofts recent title Elden Ring, if it hadn't been made readily apparent by the community anti-cheat developers ahead of time. With the most recent title exceeding 500,000 players at any given time I wouldn't be surprised if the Servers never come back as they're most likely being used. I can't imagine they would release Elden Ring without patching this issue, or maybe they just slapped easy-anti-garbage onto it as a band-aid fix and this could possibly explain why from has been on hiatus in regards to any announcements outside of the obligatory post on feb9/10.currently 4 out of 5 souls games are not playable online, so no ghosts, messages, bloodstains, co-op/multiplayer/pvp. all online aspects for the pc dark-souls series are currently inoperative, if you play exclusively for these reasons i would recommend to play on console.edit: officially offline for three months."
Negative,"The publishers of this game have screwed the player based at every opportunity.don't be surprised if this game is deleted off steam to make way for the new $60 """"""remaster"""""" they force out in 2025.Edit: Servers are no longer online after only 6 years after release. Don't buy."
Negative,Multiplayer has been offline for a VERY LONG TIME. The amount of manipulation going on their side is disgusting to the point where I will never buy a bandai namco game again. I like the game but this exploit shouldnt take 4+ months to fix. It's a multiplayer game with no multiplayer.HELL NO for recommend.
Negative,"If your favorite 'Souls' game is Bloodborne you'll probably like this.  I however didn't like Bloodborne very much and this game has way too much of Bloodborne's DNA in it.It feels like enemies move at BB speeds while I'm stuck moving slightly faster than DS2 speeds.  Combined with the poor camera (how they fucked this up after so many games I have no idea) spazzy enemy attacks result in cheap deaths.  Too many times an enemy does crazy gymnastics resulting in a camera stairing at my own taint as the bad guy dances on my head.I've been playing these games since Demon's Souls and this is the first one I really just don't like very much, which is a huge bummer.  They lost the balance of very challenging but when you died it was *your* fault and next time you just need to do better.  In previous games every once in a while a death fealt cheep, in this game way too many death's feel utterly cheese-tastic.Controls are good, world design is amazing.Camera is horrible, enemy design is full Bloodborne gangly, spindly, walking on all fours goofyness.5/10, I wanted to play Dark Souls, not Bloodborne.EDIT: Oh and it performs like absolute shit.EDIT EDIT: After spending more time with it I feel even more annoyed.  The random bans, the horrid netcode, estus during invasions, invaders on ice skates, already tons of hacks, the number of weapons that are viable is an all time low.  Seriously, what the fuck are you doing From?"
Negative,"This game is offline, and is not worth buying. The makers of this game has effectively ruined this game indefinitely, buyer beware do not waste your money on DS 1 2 or 3."
Negative,"2 months without servers, what a fuckin joke.Update: Looks like they finally brought them back, but found out the hard way that this game doesnt have cloudsave. Rip my 200hrs chars i guess."
Negative,Gwynevere's chest is missing. This is unacceptableAlso Fromsoft forgot to add powerstancing and NG+ AND WHAT'S UP WITH THAT CRAB IN THE CATACOMBS? WHAT IS HIS PURPOSE???
Negative,Less than 3 hours of game time and got hacked items forced into my inventory that can get my account banned. I will not be playing this game again until they fix this issue. There is no point in putting time into a game when random hacker can ruin all of your progress in an instant.
Negative,"Instead of fixing problems in the game with hackers for years, they continue to add problems to the community by disabling family share for this game right after a steam sale. If you are thinking about buying this game for single player go for it. If you want to play online prepare to get banned, Malcolm Reynolds always wins!"
Negative,"An all time great of a game that the developers have thrown to the dogs. Hackers have taken over the game with the sole purpose of getting people banned. And the developers answer to this was to turn of family share thinking this would somehow solve the problem. It hasn't, never will do and have no idea why they thought it would. RIP DS3"
Negative,"They took away MP to promote elden ring, masking it in a ""technicall issue"" that the fanbase fixed in 2 days but an official company cant in 4months. While in the store the multiplayer is still there and you pay extra. Game is great but this behaviour is just ass.#savedarksouls"
Negative,Imagine a game where you could roll as much as you want for little to no stamina and get a billion iframesImagine a game where 99% of the weapons are garbage and horrible and the other 1% is S Tier godlikeThis game is terribley easy and is just a cash grab from Bandai to get some $$$ from the Dark Souls label. Conclusion:
Negative,"Maybe fix the game before releasing it to public? Unbelievable! it crashes whenever I reach a bonfire,is that supposed to be a joke? so now we can't even save or teleport to level-up? FIX THE DAMN GAME!!! >:|Will not recommend till you release a patch for this immediately! -_-Love the series,but I freakin hate this trend of not putting effort towards the PC version!Will change this when I see BandaiNamco & Fromsoftware giving a damn and fixing this issue ASAP."
Negative,"Cann`t connect to game servers, so cann`t play the game.Nice bugfixes From Software, very nice!"
Negative,Bring back DS Servers.
Negative,"They fully removed the co op experience, which was the reason I bought the game."
Negative,Although ı consider this game one of the greatest of all time and best in the series ı cant recommend it. Dont get me wrong game itself is fantastic but in its current state its unplayable beacuse of hackers who invade your game and drop of items in your inventory that inevitably get you banned. Fortunately I have not been banned but ı dont plan on playing the game again anytime soon. I suggest you get this game on ps4 where there are fewer to none hackers. Or just dont bother at all since the games creators dont seem to either. This was one of my favorite games of all time. What a shame...
Negative,"Is it a bad game? No, but that doesn't mean I would recommend it. After playing Sekiro and Elden Ring I decided why not replay DS3 and give it another chance? I somewhat enjoyed it the first time but there were definitely a lot of things I didn't like, but maybe I was overreacting.. Now that I have mostly completed the game again I can confidently say, no I was not.DS3 suffers from pretty bad level design and overall areas, terrible bonfire placements and generally bad boss fights (I'll get to this later I know a lot of people will disagree). The areas and their design are the most boring and uninspired out of the 3 Fromsoft games I've played. While each of them looks and plays quite differently, it just doesn't come anywhere close Sekiro's Fountainhead Palace, Senpou Temple or Elden Ring's countless breathtaking areas and legacy dungeons. Every area in DS3 looks gray and dull in comparison, and the level design itself also leaves a lot to be desired. Considering it's a lot more linear than ER, there weren't a lot of secrets or hidden paths to discover and even though some areas offer the player different routes to take, they quickly reconnect after about 10 steps, making them feel like a gimmick. Even Irithill Valley, which I've seen being praised a lot, disappointed me. Next up, bonfire placement. I can already hear people shouting ""Boohoo just git gud and don't die"" but the thing is, I rarely ever die in this game and if I do it's to the shitty platforming, or badly placed enemies. In my entire replay I've died to actual bosses (the supposedly hard part of the game) less than 10 times and I'm already past Irithill Valley, it's incredibly easy. Thing is, when you die to something like the platforming which this game really isn't made for, or even to a normal enemy, having to run past 20 enemies you've literally just fought, walk through 3 different caves and a forest just to get back where I was earlier is just not fun. It's incredibly tedious, annoying and adds nothing to the actual difficulty, especially when it comes to bosses. Did they think I'll actually fight all the enemies in front of a boss room again after dying? No, I'll run past them, meaning they could've just as well put a bonfire right in front of the arena. They fixed that problem in ER (for the most part) so they're fully aware it was an issue making it even more frustrating than it already was now that I've played ER.Lastly, the bosses.Their design, while good, is easily overshadowed by both ER and even Sekiro. Most of DS3's bosses are really just big guys with swords or some generic demon (with exceptions of course but still), whereas ER had all kinds of people and creatures to fight, even if a lot of them were reused. Gameplay-wise they're also lacking. DS3 has the least complex combat system out of the 3 Fromsoft games I've played, meaning the bosses' movesets are also not very complex, making most fights while having a different arena, boss and music, feel samey. Sekiro had a very straightforward, but still complex combat system, allowing each boss to feel unique, with different combos and movesets, grabs, thrusts, unblockable attacks, etc. that you all have to react to in a different way. ER had so many different kinds of bosses ranging from a pretty normal warrior with an axe, to a gravity controlling bull with one eye, to a dragon that can control lightning, to finally an alien from the cosmos being able to summon meteors through portals at will. I don't think I have to explain why none of these fights are similar and why DS3's bosses don't really hold up in that regard.In conclusion:DS3 isn't a bad game, there are just a lot of things I dislike about it that other Fromsoft games simply did better, so there's no real reason to play this game over the other ones. Get it on sale or not at all."
Negative,"fromsoft/bandai. wtf my guysstopping family share wont solve the problem, because the problem this game faces cant inherently be solved in a way that wont either a) make the community turn against you or b) kill the game outright. sure, ive had to make several alts because of hackers getting me banned but guess what, family share let me keep enjoying this 5 year old game because guess what From/bandai, people that enjoy playing your game will do what needs to be done to keep enjoying it. by removing the only way around your ultra specific yet vague TOS and ban detection, anyone that gets banned now will have to contact you guys directly causing more work to be done on your part to again, which most people dont wanna do because actually getting in contact with the support team is about as direct as trying to get help from steam support 3 years ago. what you have done will ultimately kill the game, cheaters will just keep doing what they do because thats what cheaters do, sure it will deter a few, but those that keep plugging along will enjoy having the knowledge that if they inject invalid items into multiple inventories at once that they will have caused more turmoil and rage than normal because now, its either BUY THE GAME AGAIN or spend 2 weeks just trying to get unbanned, and with your support team being as small as it is, this process could take longer and longer until people find the effort and money not worth it and then permanently stop playing your game. and then the cheaters/trolls will have won. you gave us the worst solution other than outright turning off the serverim not sure what would be the best solution, but im fairly certain this was not it.enjoy watching the game's playercount steadily decline into the realms of Artifact and Demon souls."
Negative,"Stay away from this trash IF you like complex, deep, elaborate combat. From start to finish, this game boils down to mashing two buttons: hit and roll. That's what you gonna be doing. It's the most dull, repetitive, shallow game I've ever played. The only redeeming feature is the graphics and the atmosphere, but when a game that's all about fighting fails dismally when it comes to the combat system, there's no saving grace. Don't get misled by all those 10's disgorged by fanboys, they're only playing it to prove how amazingly pro and superior they are to 'casuals'. If you look at any gameplay, you will see within 10 seconds EVERYTHING that games has to offer - a roll and a hit. That's all there's to it. Some of the enemies are gonna be bigger, some of the weapons are gonna be more rusty. But in the end this 60 dollar 'masterpiece' can be summarised in three words: roll and hit. 1/10. For graphics."
Negative,"The pros:- Excellent artistic work, great visuals and beautiful environments.- Clever game design, rewarding exploration.- Rather intuitive controls, even for keyboard and mouse gameplay.- Fair PvE combat; I have never felt that any moment or battle was unbeatable or that any dangerous situation could not have been overcome, provided that I played properly.- Fun and creative online interactions such as the use of messages left by players for others to stumble across in their adventures, be it a joke, assistance or to applaud the player's progression.The cons:- Questionable checkpoint/bonfire placement. Certain checkpoints in the game appeared to have been placed too close to eachother and I believe that finding each of these bonfires did not feel as rewarding as proper spacement could have lead to.- No keyboard and mouse button prompts. The game is clearly expecting you to use alternate controllers to play, but supports keyboard and mouse, should you not have such.//ONLINE cons (Wall of text ahead)- Inability to change the name of a created character. Especially to escape censorship filter. The character creation does not offer any warnings about the restricted visibility of created character names. (Even my name was partly censored, displaying only ""Br***"" rather than Bread, incredibly shoddy filter! And I had only finally found out about this hours into the game, when a friend let me know.)- Co-op balancing. Trying to play with a friend has lead to a rather awful online experience. Not only do I believe the invasions to be rather toxic by design, I believe FromSoft has failed to properly balance online experience for both the invader and the Host/co-op players.Rather than use invasions as a way to ""balance"" the online PvE adventure, there are alternatives that I believe could easily have replaced the PvP imposed by the developers, for anyone that isn't committed to a PvP experience.Disabling achievements when clearing content with help. Massively increasing the health, damage, stats of enemies when a player is helping you. Disabling all enemy loot while a player is helping you. There are a meriad of alternatives available to help balance the online experience, aimed at people who wish to play with a friend and no-one else.Note: I can understand to some extent the reasoning behind people that believe invasions are an integral part of the game, which may be true. I simply do not believe that the game needs to have this mechanic forced on players that wish to play with their friends and offering an alternative grief-less experience would not have any noticeable impact on the health of the game in the long run; is what I strongly believe.""Git Gud"" does not apply here. Why is the host expected to use dirty tricks to get rid of the invaders? All help available seems to lead to a more toxic experience for the invader. Summong more allies to help,  using seed of a giant tree to make enemies also attack invaders.- connection issues. This issue likely does not affect many, but in my experience with online play, I can't count the number of times the servers have failed to allow my friend to join my game, same way around; I have disconnected multiple times from my friends game or had the game fail to send me to his game.I am against recommending this game to anyone that is looking for a good online experience to play with friends or ally with strangers.If you are a solo player or you enjoy more competitive environments when you are actively competing against other players, then this game offers a decent experience to you.My conclusion: I don't recommend this game, it's clearly not for everyone and doesn't have to be. However the game has issues that discourage me from recommending this title to others. However, I have gifted this to a friend who enjoys these kinds of games, with challenges to overcome in a punishing but fair universe.EDIT: If you got nothing constructive to write in the comments, I'll just delete your comment. Saying ""git gud"" or complaining to me how I'm dumb for trying to play online, in an online game or similar nonsense, does in fact not serve as constructive criticism and will be deleted without second thought. Cheers~"
Negative,"Cant recommend this game or the earlier souls games until they fix the servers especially when they can rush out a fix pre-release for elden ring, its a shame because id like to but not in its current state as the invasions and co-op is some of the best in this and 2."
Negative,"love dark souls 3 played it loads, no servers for half a year now..."
Negative,funEdit: This game is not for straight people
Negative,"server dead, will change my review once it returns"
Negative,While thankfully they shutdown services when they became aware of an RCE exploit. Having the game unplayable since January is a bit silly.
Negative,No widescreen support
Negative,"Well done, Bamco, you killed regional pricing because you thought it was funny, maybe? We know we live in the most stupid country ever, that our economy sucks and that we may aswell have got what we deserve. But, did games like GTA V or The Witcher got a raise in their price? Freaking GTA V, a game that keeps selling copies even 8 years after its release. That much tells you how money mongering these guys are. Last game i bought from this publisher, even if it means skipping on the upcoming Tales of Arise. Go screw yourselves."
Negative,"It's certainly a bad look that FromSoft's multiplayer service was demonstrated to give hackers command access to user's computers, even worse when you know that their policy before the leak was to just ban anyone who was invaded by a hacker, but at least they shut the online servers down after the leak. I honestly don't miss the frequent interruptions by smurfing invaders that typified my experience with the previous Dark Souls games, so that was no loss to me. Unfortunately the problems with this entry run deeper.Dark Souls games have been lauded for being very tough but essentially fair, and I found that to be largely true in the previous games. Sure, enemies will get the drop on you now and then with ambushes and tricks, but there was at least a sense that the game was internally consistent, the enemies at least seemed to play by the same rules as you.In this game it's obvious that half the enemies have infinite poise (resistance to interruptions), and even if they've just finished a long string of heavy attacks that missed and you're swinging in to punish them, don't be surprised to get interrupted mid-swipe by an immediate new combo because they also have clearly infinite stamina and YOUR poise stat counts for nothing. Oh you're a heavily armored knight with very high poise you say? Well you better keep your shield up to any knife wielding ghouls or dog-sized rats because they'll knock you right out of your stance with one jab to your armored shins.If the previous games were 90% hard and 10% BS, this one's about 75/25. It's still not a majority but that's a lot of bull to take, it grates on a person. It's probably a similar overall difficulty level to previous games, but it's been sped up significantly, which has the knock-on effect of making victory rely more on reflexes and luck rather than just caution, knowledge, and timing. The bosses in the first 10 hours have either been very fast and relentless, or very big but able to do high damage over a large area, in both cases they lacked useful tells or inertia to many of their attacks. I would end up winning -- sometimes on the 1st, sometimes on the 10th attempt -- by simply running in to do as much damage as I could, taking the unavoidable damage as a result, then retreating to heal, and repeating until they were dead or I was. Caution was essentially useless because any attempt to mitigate the damage either drained my stamina more (blocking) or resulted in much less damage to the enemy (retreating early), and usually resulted in taking just as damage anyway.It's possible that since people loved Bloodborne so much (since it was brilliant in a lot of other ways too), they thought we just wanted to be all aggression all the time, so defense and caution in Dark Souls 3 was nerfed even more.. but it's at odds with itself, you still get punished for going all-offense like Bloodborne a lot of the time, the net result is the game is just more punishing."
Negative,"I would honestly love to recommend this game as it's fantastic - HOWEVER I cannot recommend it to anyone in its current form unless you don't mind the risk of being banned or being forced to delete your progress. This game has a strict (yet terrible) anti-cheat that seems to punish all but the serious cheaters (that set out to ruin others games and experiences). Simple mods and even playing offline for too long can get you banned. Even worse is that there are no cloud saves on PC (whereas these are available on PS4) and now actually implementing your own manual backup, if needed, is considered by Bandai-Namco to be against the rules and a bannable offense. This means you cannot even take your save with you on another device or install it to a fresh Windows install etc. without breaking the EULA. Also obviously if you lose your local save for whatever reason you will lose all your progress.Although you will probably still make these backups out of constant fear as other players/hackers (for instance Malcolm Reynolds) can forcibly put corrupt items into your inventory to give you a softban and a bunch of other tactics to do so. If you are effected support will tell you to 'Delete your character and wait a month' regardless of your progress or hours played. You also will only get 1 unban (if they accept it). The community has made a PVPwatchdog mod that can protect you but this is ALSO considered a bannable offense by Bandai-Namco and FROM (although is carefully tested/maintained by the community). For these reasons Dark Souls 3 on PC is probably the worst place to play despite the high res/fps. It is actually sad that they choose to ignore these issues and the reason I am putting forth the effort with this review. FIX YOUR GAME."
Negative,"This game is fun. It has a lot of fun things you can do and it's beautiful in its own solemn way. The reason I can't recommend this review is because Bandai Namco has ignored the glaring security issues this game has and it's beginning to get worse and worse. People have begun reporting corrupted saves via invasions and are forced back to the beginning of the game with no way to progress. This can also extend to the PC's command line, which is self-explanatory on why it's an awful idea to even attempt to play this game right now. Until it's fixed, stay away.EDIT: Playing offline is doable and keeps you completely safe via (allegedly) ceasing all network traffic in general rather than just refusing to connect to people. Still a bad thing that needs fixing, but if you're like me and you still want to keep playing it's a small solution."
Negative,Bought for the possibility of Co-op. Co-op game is infested wtih invaders with  1M+ higher level and instakill capabilities. _NOT_ _PLAYAPLE_ _in_ _Coop_! And GidGoD does not apply here. The mechanics themselds are flawed.  Systems reward invaders more than the low level starting coop players. There is no legal way to stop this. This drives ppl to massive piracy. This is why piracy even exist.
Negative,I haven't seen the sun in years.
Negative,They've removed multiplayer when there is still a massive online community for this game. I now have an objectively worse version of the game that I bought. Not very consumer friendly behaviour.
Negative,"I have never written a review for this game since i felt it was not necessary since it has always been a great game and a challenging one also  one that i always enjoyed playing with friends and even the PVP community was strong and serious about the game bringiong it to an excelent state where no matter how difficult the game or the PVP was it was always rewarding even losing a fair and square PVP match since the game always pushed you to become a better player and to keep improving this game WAS REWARDING.With all of this said now I will start with the ad things and for me its not much things, in fact there is only 1 thing and is  THE SORRY STATE IN WHICH YOU FROMSOFTWARE HAVE YOUR GAME, with all of the hackers present on this game more and more honest players have abandoned this game and almost 100% of remaining player base are hackers who not only they seek to ruin the game for others but also to steal from them and you should be aware that its incompetent to let your fan and player base to fix your mistakes so unless you are willing to do something about this issue which by the way is the main one and protect your players against this I WILL REFUSE TO KEEP SUPPORTING YOUR GAMES AS YOU CLEARLY DONT CARE ABOUT US PLAYERS, and by the way I am pretty sure even if this is the only bad review the game has I am not the only player that feels this way,  FYI YOUR GAME IS AWSOME... BUT YOU NEED TO CARE ABOUT IT AND THE PLAYERS TOO."
Negative,"Cómo le van a subir el precio en un porcentaje del 100%, eso es injusto y muy abusivo con su comunidad de clientes, por favor no sean tan ambiciosos."
Negative,This game sucks ass
Negative,"The fact that this game doesn't have cloud sync pretty much eliminates its ability to function as a steam deck game. The moment I opened it on my deck and saw that the only option was ""new game"" was the moment I stopped playing"
Negative,"If you're coming from console, expect every invader and everyone you invade to be using cheat engine. Ruins the experience."
Negative,where'd the guns go?
Negative,"I love this game, I have these hours plus another 600 from another account and console. Even after all these hours I feel like the CO-OP experience is unmatched, there is never the same situation when you're pvping or co-oping, and for the thing to ruin it being some random exploit that the community fixed within days and the developers are still working for, I just cant look past it, so thanks for the run and I hope you guys find your maidens in Elden Ring, sunbro out."
Negative,"After 170 hours of play and multiple characters, I am summoned into another player's instance and get my inventory automatically filled with random items. I revert back to an older save. 2 days later, I get the notice that I have been penalized and can no longer coop with my son. I did my research and found that FromSoftware does not respond to complaints like this and the ban is permanent. This is the first and last time I will be purchasing games from this developer for my self and for my family."
Negative,FromSoft brings shame on themselves. Fix Poise and Fix Multiplayer connections! Shamefurrrr dispray! I will change review upon completion of the base game with these 2 mechanics fixed.
Negative,"Poorly made, not enough content, stale weapons despite new weapon art system 4/10"
Negative,"Been having a blast with the game with one BIG exception, online mode has been disabled since January due to an exploit being discovered, with no word from the devs in months about when servers may be back online. Almost 400 hours in the game, and I just wanna be able to summon help for the final boss."
Negative,"Before all the negative votes come out...The game is good, but it should say ""controller required"". This game is poorly set up for keyboard/mouse controls.All the ""push this button"" pop ups on screen to say open a door, or read a note refer to the controller buttons not the keyboard bindings. Half of the moves of hold LB and press X can't be done (that I could work out) without a controller.Comine that with the steap learning curve for new player like myself and the insane difficulty and it's just not fun.If I had a controller maybe it would be a different game.But people need to know....I DON'T RECOMMEND YOU BUY THIS IF YOU DON'T OWN A CONTROLLER"
Negative,"Dark Souls III had the potential to exceed all others but squandered it with mismanagement of the game's servers, customer relations and game balance.Pros:+Nicer graphical fidelity than previous Souls games, though barely an improvement over Bloodborne+Engaging bosses+Interesting world design, if a bit repetitive sometimes+Familiar Souls feel that fixes what Dark Souls II messed up+Online far more usable+Many quality of life improvements such as in the UI+Lots of nice new fashion and weapons for aesthetic+Challenging the whole way throughCons:-Two covenants basically identical and still broken despite a patch-Quest lines still buggy despite a patch-Poise is turned off in the game and does exactly nothing. Despite this, Bandai Namco blatantly lied and told their customers it was ""working as intended"". They've since been proven wrong but haven't fixed this very important mechanic.-Innocent players being banned en-masse. Some even without having booted the game up or accepted the EULA-Patches breaking more than they fix, usually with adding stuttering (NOT FPS LOSS) which is unavoidable no matter what level your PC is at. Having to retcon the patches due to widespread complaints of outright freezes and crashes.-Lying to customers by saying no innocent players are ever banned and each account is checked by hand. Proven false by multiple youtube videos and twitch streams of people getting instantly auto-banned before ever owning the game. Hackers and cheaters are running rampant in this game.-PVP practically unplayable due to horrendous balance. Patches still haven't addressed most of the first-order-optimal strategies that unhinge the game despite claiming to.-Unbalanced magic and miracle scaling that does nothing until extremely high points in the stat (50-60). And I mean almost nothing despite upgrading the tools and casting bigger spells. Pyromancies work out of the box, so this appears to be another bug that wasn't addressed.-FOUR covenants based on being randomly summoned with no control over it. Two of which are broken. Covenant rewards consist of very little of note. No rewards for one of them at all.-Everything in the game is item-gated so you have no real freedom from the start like in previous Souls. You're not really free to immediately begin your build and must start each character fresh as though you have no knowledge of the game.-Very little interconnectivity among areas. They're essentially rudimentary choice trees much like Dark Souls II.Update 2017: They never fixed Poise and kept going with their blatant lie that it was supposed to be terribly implemented all along. Meta is still completely terrible because of the poise system."
Negative,"The game is decent but I can't give it a good review for the following reasons:1- From bans undeserving players in many, many ways.2- They don't communicate properly in regards to anything at all (patches, exploits etc.)3- Certain essential stats (such as Poise) don't work, and again, zero communication from the developer"
Negative,"Problem with controls. If you don't have a controller, you'll have a big problem. In the game, help is showing controller commands (no keyboard commands). And as I've searched the web, you can't do anything about it.  I have HOTAS for flight simulations and game recognize it as a game controller. And it interferes with controls. The solution is to pull HOTAS cables out.I don't like to review a game when I didn't put some time in it. But as devs didn't put any effort into it so that it would be playable on PC without a game controller ..."
Negative,As much as I didn't like the servers being removed I accepted it however it wasn't until about 6 hours into my new run to realize that certain spells and weapons are now unattainable because PvP is gone. No more being able to get those specific items that could be crucial to your build. Oh well guess its a dead game now. Thanks Fromsoftware for being the corporate shill we wish you weren't.
Negative,This game suffers from serious networking vulnerabilities that can be used to harm your PC.It may be possible to minimize the risk of getting hacked by using 3rd party modifications.I just lost the whole progress and my character received some invalid items (probably to get me banned).
Negative,servers taken down instead of applying a very easy fix
Negative,Game hurts. Not optimized at all for PC. Would only recommend this game if you like tasting your keyboard.
Negative,"Invader popped in and broke the game for me, as in, did something to my save, giving me a preposterous collection of items and starting a new game. What a crock of poop."
Negative,DARK SOULS™ III has stopped working gg
Negative,"I don't know. I love Dark Souls. I even really liked Dark Souls 2. Demon Souls has a special place in my PS3 heart. Elden Ring is a master class epoch of the souls-like genre. But Dark Souls 3 just doesn't do it for me. I bought Dark Souls 3 at full price when it released and honestly, I regretted it. I've tried several times to really like this game the way I love all the previously mentioned games but something about Dark Souls 3 just does not click with me. Something about the level design, something about the combat, something about the bosses just doesn't feel as good as what was done before and after this game. I feel like Dark Souls 3 is the consequence of doing the same thing too many times and getting worn out. I feel as if the dev team behind this game just didn't have the same ambitions and passion. I hate to give this game a thumbs down too, because I know that I'm an outlier on this personal take, but I can't recommend this game to anyone. If you are looking to  play any Dark Souls, definitely play the first one not this one."
Negative,"Please make sure you play DS3 offline or any Souls game if you are currently playing or plan to buy the game. I will post the information below that was recently found out and I truly hope FromSoft does something about this. There is proof of this exploit on both twitch and reddit. Keep safe everyone.""It has come to our attention that a RCE exploit has been found for Dark Souls 3RCE stands for Remote Code Execution, meaning that hackers can run arbitrary code on your machine without permissionTHIS IS A SERIOUS EXPLOIT THAT CAN CAUSE LASTING DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER AND ALL OF ITS CONTENTSBy using this hackers can take hold of your PC and can do essentially do what they want with itThey canBrick your computerSteal your logins and banking information stored on your computerExecute malicious malware like bitcoin minersAND MUCH MUCH MOREIt has been confirmed by the Blue Sentinel anticheat developers that their software does not prevent this yet As such the only way to protect yourself from this exploit until further notice is to,Stay away from all forms of online activityThis means no coop, no invasions, and no PVP, essentially if you connect to another player, YOU ARE AT RISKAs such PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM ONLINE ACTIVITY AT THIS TIME"""
Negative,"As much as I love the dark souls franchise, I simply CAN NOT give this product a thumbs up in its current state because of a devastating and unacceptable issue that fromsoftware and bandai refuse to address. There are hackers on this game that will invade your world and AUTO INJECT hacked items onto your character unconsentually ( there is nothing you can do to stop them from putting these items in your inventory), and the next time you log onto dark souls you will be perm banned and unable to play online ever again.There is literally no way to drop these hacked items once they are given to you, so at that point you are either faced with a decision, to either alt f4 and delete your character with possibly hundreds of hours of progress  (and hope this method works) or get perm banned from the game for life.So now if you choose to play this game online with friends you are essentially gambling because you can be invaded at any time by one of these hackers and their sole purpose is to just get you banned. There's nothing you can do about it. This issue needs to be fixed and addressed now. I don't care if this game came out in 2016, if you are selling a product for $59.99 or any amount of money and you just simply drop it and refuse to take care of it, then it doesn't deserve to be bought.PATCH THIS GAME AND STOP BANNING INNOCENT PLAYERS!"
Negative,"PVE is less inspired and way less fun than both of the other games, for a wide variety of reasons I don't really feel like describing.PVP is completely unplayable garbage, and clearly just an afterthought to the base game of PVE.* Nightmarish latency issues that are routinely as bad as dial-up internet used to be, or worse. I'm talking ping in the thousands. In the range of actual full seconds.* The mechanics of game are designed for none of the above. Sidestepping is virtually impossible, and if you try it, you will probably get ""hit"" by the sword that is visibly ~4m away from you.* Apparently some information is handled client-side while other information is not, meaning that you can roll away from a swing, hear the sound effect for damage received on your screen but take none of it, and somehow wind up with bleeding also even though you (I think?) didn't get hit.* The actual method of getting PVP going is terribly designed. The dedicated arenas are only active for 1v1s because apparently actual organized teams just stomp all through the brawls and team battles so no one plays them.* The more common way this happens is with impromptu ""fight clubs"" that only happen at a very narrow range of player levels where a host will invite players in to essentially duel.* Sometimes though, no one cares and you wind up summoned into a 3v1 where they just slaughter you, or it's a ""duel"" until someone decides it's not anymore. Impossible to know what place you've been summoned to beforehand.* Add all that to the several minutes it takes to actually get a connection to play with someone else, and you wind up with an hour of PVP mostly spent waiting around for a summon and getting ganged up 3v1 with virtually no chance.* Even coop PVE suffers from most of these issues, including hit reg that's so bad it is sometimes impossible for the non-host to damage enemies because of the server rolling back what you're seeing client-side, resulting in enemy health bars that just kinda oscillate when you hit them.In summary, this game is not at all designed for PVP and shoehorning it into this is a buggy, laggy mess of unplayable garbage. Which is a real shame, because the actual multiplayer aspect could have been fun if they just fixed a few of these trivial issues no video games since 2003 have had any problems with. I recommend DS2 instead."
Negative,"Main thing people enjoy about the games is being able to co-op/pvp and at this time THAT IS NOT AVAILABLE. FromSoftware took the servers down due to cheaters/hackers exploiting a game bug, (maybe) fixed it for elden ring and NEVER put the Dark Souls servers on PC back up. Absolutely disgraceful."
Negative,No Steam cloud saves is completely unacceptable in a game you're selling for $60 in 2024. Great game though of course.
Negative,"servers down for 5 months, not on sale for steam summer sale, dead game"
Negative,Imagine having to buy the game again because you were given a +99 stormruler and can no longer play online co op or invasions.
Negative,"If you play this game offline, you'll experience a great game with amazing level design, original bosses and near unlimited customization.If you play online, prepare to meet some of the most passive aggressive sociopaths you'll see outside of 4chan."
Negative,"Online servers taken down, will likely never come back due to from's inability to listen, put effort and do something about the rampant cheating and lackluster online, as well as the spaghetti netcode.Edit: servers are back but the old problems will never be solved."
Negative,"Going to have to thumbs this Game down(would Give it a Mixed rating if i could).And will explain why and my thoughts on this game.First off:●Dark Souls 3 is a fantastic game, I had put more then 70+ hours in just the main Game/Story to beat it(2nd boss as well), And it is indeed a fantastic Action Rpg game(one of the best of 2016).▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬Some Thing's i noticed in this game(small complaint):1: The poise System is pretty much non existent, So armor is pretty much for fashion after a certain point.2: Some delay in the controls(about a second deley when pressing the dodge button..ect).3: No way to turn of Vsync(Vsync causing Imput lag/delay).▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬Why the thumb's down?The Online Security System:●Well, This is where i start to hate how this game works, and The Main reason is ""THE SERVERS SECURITY"" And here is why(Console are excluded from this, as it's a PC thing).●It seems the game will try to detect certain software as a Cheat/hack(like Controller or Recording softwares), Basically Causing a message ""Invalid Data"" and even if you delete your data(Completely All Save's and in Appdata), They will still ban you(Yes, They banned me for NO REASON) And, When you contact bandai they basically tell you off and wont do anything about it(As they don't control the servers).●You Can't even use your PS4 controller(At the time you need ""Inputmapper"" to use it), Because as soon as you jump online for the first time when you want to Coop, it will harrass you. So, The whole Fromsoft Online security is REALLY crap And a dodgy system if bandai Can't control this. ●Out of the 498+ games i own, i would say This is the first time i experience this, And had a server security in a game this ""HORRIBLE"".And NO, For the last time, i would never Hack or cheat.(i have no reason to).▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬Thing's i Noticed While Online:●The main one is the Online invasions(only goes to people that does this), This seems to be common in the newbie area's, You're Basically Getting invaded as soon as you set foot in high wall of lothric(When You're around level 8-16). I Do not mind getting invaded(as long is it with legit items/gear).●This is where the complaint come's into place, Is when People Who invade Are those with end game Items/Spells/flasks that insta heals, And Because of This, it pretty much ruins it for new players. And  this is starting to become more common now(if you play online).▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬Conclusion:●Get this on CONSOLE.That is If you want to Co-op with a friend(that's why i went online, And had got this game as well). Because, the servers anti Hack/cheat system in this game is REALLY crap on PC, And it will treat your pc software like i mention above like one and ban you(My friend who i was cooping had just been banned as well, As we where using the same software/controller to play).Edit:They had unbanned me 3 weeks later after i tried to get in contact with them.Their systems are still really crappy on PC."
Negative,"no online support since January due to a discovery of a system compromising bug that allows attackers to launch executable on targets while joined on a Online Session. This server code is pretty much shared between all the PC ports, and probably Elden Ring. The slowness on patching this exploit hurts the community on these games."
Negative,"Do not get tempted to buy this by false promises or maybe even your own memories of the previous Souls Game´s PvP. In    it´s current state PvP absolute shit. It is unbalanced, outright broken and full of completely retarded features that are abused by 99% of the community because some moronic Youtubers talk trash on Reddit and reveal these features to the players. Seriously 90% of the fucking players are using the Dark Sword or a Estoc its ridiculous. Poise is nonexistent while the praised ""Hyper Armor"" lets you combo other players to death effortlessly. If you want to desperately win take a UGS and spam R1 you cant be countered. Generally PvP was lessened to mindless R1 spam and the blind Miyazaki dickriders are even praising it while belittling Dark Souls 2 and the ""B-Team"".PVE and especially the bosses are a huge improvement to Dark Souls 2 and the only reason to buy this game. An average player´s run takes about 40 hours. So it´s your call if you want to sped your money on this game. If you´re buying it for PvP that equals burning 60$."
Negative,"With over 100 Hours on the game, I can say that this is a great game. but I cannot recommend this game after suffiering from the egrigous failure that this anticheat is. FROM software has given me and a large amount of players a INVAILD GAME DATA warning which leads to a ban from online play. even though normal players don't utilize cheats. also actual hackers have managed to find a way to de-level players back to SL 1 or force them to gain 50,000,000 souls for no reason banning their account. In my personal expeience I haven't ran into any cheaters. but I know there are people out there like the character Maxwell who actively  go out and delevel random people. Don't Buy this game Until FROM Software and NAMCO USA fix their shit. works great on the steam controller btw"
Negative,"The community of this game is filled with toxic idiots, hardcore RPers, and very straight men looking to pound my ass with their +10 caestus. And I love all of it.Can't recommend it though, since I tried playing it this october and I got penalized on startup on a completely new windows installation, on this account and a different one. The online service of this game is a joke. And what fucking game doesn't support 21:9 in 2021?Just wait for Elden Ring."
Negative,"Why fix problems with servers if you can just turn off the servers, by this act you have descended to the level of Electronic Art."
Negative,"This game used to be great fun, but however with the servers offline... the community has died off. Bring back servers FromSoft!"
Negative,Permanently banned from playing online because when I invaded a hacker they put a 99x every item in my inventory. Been trying for months to get unbanned. Garbage customer support. Garbage banning system.
Negative,my friends keep dropping coins on the ground and making fun of me whenever i pick them up :(((((((
Negative,is not worth to play it without online buy it if u want to losse your money with a incompetent company
Negative,"It's a pretty nice game, but the lack of keyboard prompts is just a nope. ""Recommended to play with a controller"", yes. But that doesn't excuse not putting the proper icons in for the PC version."
Negative,No multiplayer anymore.
Negative,Where is My Fcking Poise?
Negative,"Needed a Xbox controller to play. You can use Keyboard and mouse but its difficult. They didn't even bother to try and fix it for keyboard and mouse, you are just asked to use X and A and buttons like that. I found that very lazy for such a hyped game."
Negative,"I was not aware the Darksouls series require a controller to play. I probably spent 30 minutes trying to EXIT out of the systems options because I do not have a AB button. Nor do I have RB or RT button as the tutorial tries to tell me. I have a disability that prevents me from using controllers. I would have never bought this if I had known, And as far as I can tell, I don't see anything regarding controllers except the bundle sale. I buy a game for PC, I expect it to run on Keyboard and mouse. I don't buy Xbox games and expect it to run on my PC. If I buy a Xbox game I will be expected to have a controller."
Negative,No cloud saving.
Negative,Damn shame. Servers were taken down 3 MONTHS ago and have yet to return. Imagine locking all your other games to force players to strictly play your new title. Fix this stupid shit.
Negative,"After 400hours game play 350 only pvp i'm going to let my review here. I love the series. but they sold a hyped game.-- The Graphics are amazing, really like it..-- The combat system changed. New combos, weapon art. Is just loveable.. new game.. new mechanics.-- Bandai did a really bad move.. sending review copies to few streamers 30 days before the official release date. to hype even more. No respect for those who even pre-order the game.-- The game is not working proprely, many bugs, HACKERS, lag switchers. Developers don't care about it on pc version. since the game was made for consoles that have no way to hacker until this moment. i said HACKERS alredy? Oh yeah be sure you will encouter a lot. From Soft is not doing anything to control the Hacker rampart.-- Options that is builded in game dont work at like Cross-Region Matchmaking, even when Cross-Region Matchmaking OFF you still playing with chinese, australians and etc... It means they are going to lag.. or just killing you teleporting arround.  Option totaly usuless or maybe developers have no geographic classes. The game insist make me play vs chinese, korean and other countrys really far away.-- Game is totaly out of balance on pvp. Is to easy for the host keep rolling and sumoning infinite. Since the invader only have 7 estus vs total 21(Host can keep sumoning every phantom have 7 estus) is totaly unfair. the game should be fun for everyone, even for invaders. since the chance to sucess a invasion is less than 20%. ( i have 1600 pale tongues - 1000+ blue tongues on my 2 chracters  ((before you people say i'm crying about it.. just deal with that.. i'm probrably better than you)) -- Theres only 10 weapons in game worth to be used, most everything is really garbage. The current meta is arround a Hornet ring that increase 30% of your critical damage or you one shot people or you lose..-- The Game Lore is the poorest of the series. The game is absolutely easy. too many bonfires. Just not worth to keep replaying it..-- The Level designer is too linear. It changed from the previous Souls games.. so you always going to play the same linear path.. it makes the game even more borring.------ At the current moment i don't recomend to buy the game, even high end rigs have bad time with the gameMake sure next time from release a game.. to remember what they done here..."
Negative,Fix the servers
Negative,Do not play this game until FromSoft fixes a dangerous exploit discovered recently that could allow hackers to run programs within your computer (RCE). demand Fromsoft fix this ASAP!!
Negative,no servers no fun
Negative,no firekeeper feet
Negative,Keyboard unfriendly - all tooltips are gamepad based.
Negative,"Don't play online!!!! YOU WILL GET BANNED. Hackers are waiting in early areas of the game, summoning or invading as many new players as possible, and adding hacked items to their accounts to get people banned. I hope Bandai Namco didn't want any money from me ever again, because after something as shameful and inept as this hacking fiasco, they're not getting any."
Negative,"I recommend not buying.  After my very short time playing, PvP is just too easy.  It's just me parrying randoms.  PVE is alright tho."
Negative,"The game is filled with hackers that put items into your inventory that you cannot discard that will get you banned. The dev has done nothing to fix this still. Not worth getting if you want to play online,"
Negative,"4 hours in, Player invaded, lagged like hell. Soft banned for absolutly no reason at all. In all honesty, good game if you like Dark Souls but soft banning innocent players for no reason is messed up so i'm not going to waste my time with a real review. If I wanted to die all the time and generally repeat the same thing over and over I'd be playing World of Warcraft."
Negative,"The entire Dark Souls series on PC has been offline since 23.01.2022 due to an exploit. Bandai Namco promised a fix ""soon"", but as of 04.04.2022, we still haven't heard anything back. On the store pages for Dark Souls 1 Remastered and Dark Souls 2, multiplayer is still one of the advertised features in the descriptions. Bandai Namco is selling these games without telling people that the multiplayer is no longer available and there is no definite date for a fix."
Negative,"If you are going to play, play offline, because of Bandai's neglect on the pc port and secruity, hackers i nthe game have the ability to dump harmful shit on your PC that extends beyond the game. until they fix it, play offline."
Negative,"The game is broken, you can only play this game offline because if you play online, you might be invaded by a hacker who can auto-inject items into your inventory that causes the ban system to ban your account. The producers at Bandai and the devs Fromsoft have completely abandoned this game. It's only been 4 years, and they can't even do a simple patch to make things right. The game otherwise is a beautiful and fantastic game, but it's riddled with hackers trying to ruin the game."
Negative,"Off to pirate this as From Software decided im not allowed to continue playing online because they think i was cheating or more likely their history of useless PC ports now seems to recognize a 360 controller as a server-wide threat, asked for a refund as the product is no longer what i payed for and is ""unfit for the purpose of which it was sold for""Ive payed for the full game, not too be too annoyed but.... id play lords of the fallen if i wanted a solo experience, Spent 90% of my online as a blue phantom, now im banned from online. Please other users post youre negative experiences if you've had any its not fair on the dent of the community that just got shat on."
Negative,I hate this fucking game with all my god damn heart. I would never recommend this game to a friend the pvp is very shit. You never fight anyone with normal fucking ping. You will always be matched up with an invader from across the planet with 6000000000000 ping. Even though ThErE iS A sETTing to TURN OFF THE CROSS REGION PLAY. Only people who play this shit ass game are those who love other men. In long story short Dark Souls 3 is a shit game ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!                                                                                                                                                             ----------- FromSoftware
Negative,"who the hell thinks oh lets port a game to PC and show the original controller controls in the game tutorial. the laziness of this is beyond amazing, give me my money back. I refuse to pay for laziness and i refuse to play laziness."
Negative,No cloud saves even though all the other Dark Souls games do have cloud saves.
Negative,"Played the game, raged often, persevered and beat the game. As a result, I logged in a few days later to receive a ban as a gift. Get your shit together FromSoft."
Negative,fuck this game
Negative,"imagine shutting down all other DS online services to force people to buy and play Elden Ring, disgusting.. FROM you're ruining your own community !!"
Negative,Me bad at game so me no like
Negative,The removal of online play for the main Dark Souls series is the greatest tragedy in the history of gaming. Fuck FromSoft.
Negative,"Fromsoftware has decided to leave egregious vulnerabilities affecting save progression and more in this product after being alerted on the publisher level years in advance of exploits being widely spread. If the game sounds nice to you with 0 online functions get it i guess, just make sure to set it to boot in offline mode."
Negative,"Online servers were switched off over 100 days ago due to a security exploit and there's no indication from From if they will ever be switched on again. No messages, ghosts, bloodstains, PVP, Coop, a lot of key features are switched off now :("
Negative,"Keyboard and mouse are impossible to use, and i refuse to buy a xbox controller for 60 USD. Enjoyable until softban for using a controller emulator (X360CE) that literally makes the game playable.  Will update review if FROM adresses the community regarding banning players for playying the game normally.EDIT: 5/11/16To random people that see this review and find my word untrustworthy. I highly suggest browsing the net and looking for yourself, Bandai Namco/FROM literally state online in multiple outlets that they consider any code injection a breach of EULA and therfore bannable. Specifically including controller emulation. Thus the only recourse is to buy a 60 dollar xbox controller rather than use the controllers that most budget gamers already have. To reiterate, FROM / BN are BANNING people from the online elements (read ""a huge portion"") of the game for using off brand controllers with a controller emulator rather than an overpriced games for windows controller. They KNOW that thats all that said people have done (upon examining their accounts supposedly) and they just state to said people that ""no one has ever been un-banned once banned"".Thats shite customer service on top of shoddy programming, and I for one view that as an insult. If i could refund this shit i would. Instead, i muck through in solo play. Till they deside to ban me from that too for using a ps3 controller knock off."
Negative,"The multiplayer servers went down a bit before Elden Ring's release due to an exploit and they are STILL down.This is a great game and I've played through it several times, but the whole exploit thing sucks. I got three of my friends to buy this game about a week before the servers went down, so now we can't play our new game together. We decided to just wait, because From Software announced that they would start working on a patch once Elden Ring was out.But it's been months. Within a week of the exploit going public, there was already a fan-made patch for it, so it's not even a hard fix.The part that bothers me the most is that Elden Ring is the only souls game that currently has multiplayer, which is pushing more sales for it. If me and my friends want to play one of these games together, we either have to wait months for the exploit to be patched or buy yet another $60 game. Call me crazy, but I think From is avoiding patching it for the sake of profits.EDIT: The servers are back up. Took them long enough."
Negative,"Absolotely completely BROKEN!!! I will change my review when this dreadfull PC port is patched, but  they deserve a big thumbs down for stabbing their fans in the back like this!"
Negative,DO NOT BUY! Game filled with cheaters. They summon with no warnings and enter boss rooms! And if you buy it play it offline.
Negative,"Replayability of this game is really good,but at its core it's a lazy designed game.examples:- get summoned to help with boss. defeat boss. forced to watch cutscene because of host and then get send back to my game- magic pixels. almost always if you think your last hit should kill and you're almost out of stamina, magic pixel saves enemy. leaving you with no stamina- enemies get staggered randomly. just like with magic pixels they for some reason stop getting staggerd if you're about to run low on stamina and it's a chance for them to kill you.- Level-design: long route - big place - long route - big place - big route - small place.No story in leveldesign whatsoever. Just random routes through buildings, that make no sense. - leveling ""luck"" does barely increase chances for grinding- items to increase invasion. no item to increase chances for signs to summon, but a spell which might force you to level a certain stat."
Negative,"Not sure what I think about this game.  The fact it has so many options and interesting combinations seems very attractive, but from my view, and it will be very unpopular, the combat system is trash.  Very clunky and not at all enjoyable from my experience.  A game I have to do hours of research to understand the meta to have the best chance of playing as a new player alone is taxing, let alone the fact that the controls aren't very responsive at all.  It becomes frustrating quite quick.  As punishing of a game as this is, unless you are a masochist, I'd probably pass on this one.  Not one of those games you will sit down and enjoy for a few hours at a time."
Negative,"I would not recommend any of these games if you plan to play with friends. Invaders get way too much in their favor when it should be the other way around HEAVILY. They should have MAYBE 1-2 heal items or not be able to heal at all. Shouldn't be able to invade a new players game. There should be a tag that is associated with a new player that makes it so only other new players can invade new players games. I know all you purest shitbirds will come screaming ""just get gud"" or ""It's already not fair for the invaders"" blah blah blah. Firstly, just in general, there should be a setting that actually locks out invaders so you just play with your friends. Why have a password system if it's basically useless? Have it so you can set a password for invaders as well. Make it so they can't heal so damn much. FIX YOUR DAMN NETCODE IT'S TRASH. Among other things. I really want to like these games but right when I start having fun I get some neckbeard invader that has thousands of hours in the game that purposefully downgrades their gear because they know they can win against someone who just started playing the game. It's infuriating and definitely would be a reason I see a lot of people would stop playing before they actually get into enjoying it. Fix the netcode, put in a system that allows us to play with friends but blocks invaders, or just HEAVILY nerf invaders so it's a substantial uphill battle for them. They are there ruining your fun because ""haha lul get gud nerd I play this 5 year old game all day everyday to pwn noobs that just started the game haha"" Just do better please. If you guys added things like this your playerbase would increase drastically as I know several people that like the core of the game but absolutely loathe the invasion system. Again, call me a noob, tell me to get gud, whatever, I don't care about unwanted pvp in my games. If I wanna pvp I will play a game where that is all it is so it's actually balanced. Or on a pvp specific server for those games."
Negative,The game is so hardcore that you have to battle it for the controller to work before even creating a character.
Negative,"Stuck offline, no price reduction to reflect this. Been this way for 3 months"
Negative,"[Caution] Your account has been penalized. Well looks like they're starting to ban players who didn't cheat.  If you get hit by this ban you won't be able to play online with your friends.  Sent bandai namco an email, hopefully they'll resolve this soon.  Looked on reddit and seems like this will be a lengthy process.  Gameplay 11/10.Service - Meh.Edit 2.28.2018The reply from customer services sums up to this: can't do crap.  Everything is handled by Japan's server team and the American team is the middleman.  The solution is to delete your character and wait a month or two before playing again or make a family share account through steam and still start over again.This ban puts you in a separate server for suspected cheaters, screwing you if you want to play with your buddies or if you're innocent.  If you invade or get invaded by a hacker your data will be affected and you get banned.  There's no compensation, you're just starting over with a big F you. Since I bought this throught the humble bundle can't even expect a refund.  Thanks for reading my gripes, hopefully my bit of suffering will enlighten you to not purchase this awesome yet crappy game.Edit 3.21.2018Enjoyed a good three weeks playing on a family share account before getting banned running into a hacker.  Was looking forward to trying out the remastered version of Dark Souls 1, now I'm not going to bother wasting money on a game with crap customer support."
Negative,"While Souls 3 is mechanically sound in every respect and just as fun as prior entries, it fails to ignite a new sense of wonder in respect of its themes or enemy variety. The PC version is also prone to hangs, poor non-16:9 resolution support and some terrible netcode that has plagued the series from the get-go."
Negative,"My personal favorite Souls. Combat is slick, world is beautiful. DSIII is a true, worthy successor and ending to the Souls series. I've had so much fun and many good times online with random people, living in this world. IMO the DLC is very worth it, Ringed City being the actual ending of the story, if you will. Respect for Gael.Praise the sun, and don't you dare go hollow friendsedit: whatever they did, my game doesn't start anymore so thanks for that."
Negative,"There're no silver knight weapons, bad game."
Negative,"I mean, come on... PVE is fantastic, Pvp is just bull shit. Too many hackers and too many tryhard bullies who invade new players at sl20 with +15 estus flask, like wtf???"
Negative,"50 dolares por el juego ql, yo lo compre  20 dolares, bandai y la rctm"
Negative,"Please fix the multiplayer mode, my fingers are cramped farming those fucking covenant rewards."
Negative,This game is still down since over half a year... thanks..
Negative,bad game stuck at the second boss
Negative,"Gameplay is 10/10, great game however the fact that it runs like shit even on my high end gaming rig takes away from this...Optimization is is 3/10 at best. Frequent bugs/crashes. Bad console port.Wait till this is fixed, if it ever is."
Negative,"I love this game so much, but I cannot recommend it right now due to a major security vulnerability. If you want to play this game you should do so offline. Playing online could result in anything from hackers getting your account softbanned to exploiters fully bricking your PC or running unauthorized code on your machine. Great game but the developers need to fix this exploit asap. Still worth playing solo if you get the DLC on sale, ringed city is 10/10."
Negative,"Could never, ever connected to the server!!!  single game forever!!!! Free pirated players can even play with each other together, so what did I pay the money for??? Honored to be a victim of authorised offical paid game? Dumbass!？？永远无法登陆！！！永久单机！！！玩盗版的都能联机！！！所以我光荣的成为了一名正版游戏受害者？？？"
Negative,"Despite enjoying all of my time in game I can't really recommend this with the approach they take when restricting people from their game. I played the first couple days a few hours each in coop with my friend who I also bought the game for, and had no issues. We died to bosses, we died in invasions, we died on enemies we had previously beaten because we got overconfident, and basically we seemed right on track with the experience we expected of this game.Then on the third or fourth day, my main screen is flagged with ""INVALID GAME DATA"" has been detected and yatta yatta. I still don't know what the Invalid data was because it gave no indications as to what was actually invalid. Things I tried.* Deleting my current character with 16 hours invested. Annoying but okay. I continued playing online with a character from scratch, and my coop buddy helped me run through all the previous areas until we caught up again.*Installing game on another hard drive in case it was a hard disk problem on my end. My internet is slow, and it takes 10-15 hours to download, so this was my last resort. *Verifying integrity of game cache. Now it would seem to me if you get an error because ""INVALID GAME DATA"" this would be a pretty sure way to fix it. So I run this, and sure enough 1 file fails to validate. I'm thinking, ""Oh hey, here's my problem right here! Kinda douchebaggy to accude me of breaking their ToS because something didn't download right, but at least it's fixed now, and I don't have to worry."" Wrong.1 file fails to validate, and the game starts download 10.6 GB of data. The whole game is like 18GB, are you telling me a single file is that big? I felt it was bullcrap, but I let it do it's thing for the next 7 hours, and then when it totally finishes it slaps me with an error, ""Update File Corrupt""This is the reason I had to totally reinstall the game because there was absolutely no other choice now that my whole install was corrupted, and validating game files now resulted in it finishing in 1 second saying all files were validated, and hitting play resulted in downloading that same 10.6 GB of data across 7 hours which I did THREE times. to get the ""Update file corrupt"" problem again.So I reinstall the entire game, and wonder of wonders it works, and I start the game, and am met with ""YOU HAVE BEEN PENALIZED"" Are you serious From Soft? I can't help it your game broke. I carried on trying to believe it was my fault, but it's not. It's a bad system. After checking around this apparently means I'll be put in a matchmaking pool with other people who have been penalized. Which if it happens to everyone as easily as it did me, probly won't be so bad since I imagine just about everyone will have been penalized by now.The main reason this loss even affects me, is I have a coop buddy who I bought the game specifically to play through with, and we won't even be able to that since he isn't penalized(for now anyways.) If it weren't for coop with him I would just play offline since I have no interest in PVP. Normally when we're doing coop the two of us will get invaded by a single guy who kills us anyways, but we wasn't even mad, that's just part of the game. He's better than both of us so he wins 9/10 times.My problem comes from a total lack of transparency. It woulda been nice for them to tell me what this supposely ""Invalid data"" was so I could actually remove it and keep on playing.So overall, if you're gonna buy this game for any of the online features, I'd advise against it. The single player is pretty fun, though it's a lot more fun coop, but people can get treated unfairly a little too easily for my tastes."
Negative,"Buy this game for your console, not your PC. Multiplayer has been taken down on PC and has no fix date"
Negative,i hate my life now
Negative,hardest thing about dark souls 3 is autosave that drops 30fps sometimes on a gtx980 fix your shit
Negative,Soft banning me for no reason
Negative,no keyboard and mouse prompts :/
Negative,"Never done a review, by one thing pissed me so much i decided to do it.What is it? INVALID DATA message on my absolutley ordinary character when i'm half way through the game. Fuck you FROM."
Negative,Needs an anti-cheat.... hackers ruin this game for co-op.
Negative,"Numerous crashes and bugs that make you have to jump through hoops just to play the game. The game has already given me a BSOD not even an hour into playing. They fixed this bullshit in DS2 after the garbage state of the first one but now we're right back at it again.Fix your shitand if your game is crashing, try setting your lighting settings to low. It looks like shit but at least the thing fucking works."
Negative,"Well, I did it.  I've finished the final Dark Souls game.  This marks the end of my ongoing project to play through the entire series (or what exists of it on PC), in order.  I came into this endeavor with a moderate dislike for Dark Souls, failing to get more than a few hours into the first game, despite several attempts.  However, I'm pleased to report that after playing all of them through to completion, beating the DLC content, and defeating the optional bosses (i.e. finally managing to ""git good""), I've completely changed my mind.  I have cast off the shallow disdain I held for the Souls series when I was a casual...and replaced it with the implacable loathing of a connoisseur. Had Dark Souls 3 managed to truly revamp the combat system, instead of just making everyone attack faster, or if f it had bothered to fix the awful camera, instead of exploiting it for cheap deaths, then maybe I'd feel differently.Sadly, the series concludes with an entry that is essentially Dark Souls 1 fanfiction, repeating not only the themes, narrative structure, and level design of the original but even the actual levels themselves.  Furthermore, DS3 somehow manages to be significantly more linear and bland, with most areas being some flavor of disused castle/castle environs.Calling something ""Dark Souls 1, but slightly worse"" is about as backhanded a compliment as I can think of.  However, the reality is that neither this game, nor its nightmarishly bad predecessor improve enough about Dark Souls to justify their combined existence.  Unless you're a hardcore fan, maybe do yourself a favor and play  Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice instead."
Negative,"This is my favorite game however I cannot recommend it anymore. It's always been filled with bugs and exploits that From never cared to fix. The community has done more for fixing this game than From ever has. They wouldn't do anything about hackers and so the some in the community made a mod called blue sentinel that helped protect you from them. When the RCE exploit was discovered, those same modders from the community had a fix within a day. What does From do? Shut the servers down and they're still down for the entire trilogy nearly two months later."
Negative,"I can see why this game is considered to be great, but it was also a very frustrating experience for me, in large part by design. Despite all the bad I have to say about DS3, if I could have a ""maybe"" option, I'd pick that, because DS3 is obviously meant for some people out there.For context, I went a primarily-faith build, so I have decent exposure to both melee combat and spell-casting. It took me about 40 hours, finished the base game at level 90, I believe both of those metrics are about average. Not sure if I'll bother with the DLC, but my point is I finished the game, so my problems aren't because I didn't git gud.The TL;DR of this is that DS3 basically met my expectations: this game puts being difficult ahead of being fun.First, the good. The boss fights are fantastic, the only thing keeping me going. Absolutely not overhyped. The music was also fantastic, and the world-building and build diversity are good. If you enjoyed this game, you'll find a lot of different builds to try out.Now, onto what I didn't like. This will surely be subjective in large part, but these reasons are why I'm not going to replay DS3 or try other games in the series.The combat system here is the opposite of another game they made, Sekiro. Whereas Sekiro is very narrow but deep, DS3 is very wide and shallow. DS3 may have more replayability, but DS3's combat was so limited in comparison that I have no desire to replay by the time I was done. I found DS3's combat to be clunky and not enjoyable at all, and how my character controls is the biggest factor in determining my enjoyment of a game.The world, while cool in theory and lore, looked abysmal. It was too damn dark all the time. I strained my eyes whenever I played this, and turning up the brightness to fix it washed everything out. I get that DS3 is meant to be dark, but I've never felt such strain playing a game before.The RPG system is more a neutral than a con, but I'll talk about it here anyways. My character felt like crap until I got to about level 40. Over 1/3 of the time I played this, I didn't like my character. Sure, I started to like him later, but 15+ hours is a long time to think ""When am I going to actually like my own character?""The save points (bonfires) were a huge negative for me too. At a minimum, every boss should have an accessible save point nearby - if you're too concerned that makes the bosses too easy, make them harder, but it's not fun trying to learn a boss, dying, then spending 1-2 minutes running back, hoping you don't get hit along the way. The final boss was my favorite in part because I got to focus on just killing it, not doing some dumb trek back past the same 10 skeletons every time.Also, no cloud saves, so don't clean your computer without manually backing it up (lost a 10-hour save due to that).All in all, the Dark Souls series just isn't for me. I beat the whole game so I could make sure my issues weren't because I couldn't beat it, plus I 100%ed Sekiro (one of my favorite games ever now that I checked that out too). The biggest issues were the poor combat and frustrating checkpoints, both of those made me want to rush this game as fast as I could. It's still a great game, in spite of all the trash I talked, just know that it's not for everyone, not even for all hardcore gamers."
Negative,"Great game, downvoted until FromSoftware get their act together and bring the servers back online and fix them.(I mainly played SoulsBorne on Playstation before Elden Ring, thus the low playtime here on Steam)"
Negative,"Too much hackers, please fix those vulnerabilities.Otherwise game is the best game evar m8."
Negative,"fuck this, i shat on this game twice might do it againits still shit 37 hours later"
Negative,Got banned for no reason....please FROM SOFTWARE FIX YOUR ANTICHEAT
Negative,THANKS FROMSOFT for killing my favorite multiplayer game so I have to buy elden ring :)Ps. I'm not buying elden ring until the Dark Souls 3 servers are fixed.
Negative,I've been playing this game for a while now and it's good but I can't recommend it as From Software have completely neglected the player base. They said they'll fix it after Elden Ring got released and they didn't. It has been way too long and I bought this game for my brother so we could play online just for this bullshit. Don't buy this game until it's fixed.
Negative,"The game ran great up untill after i beat the tutorial boss, i hit that bonfire and as soon as i attempted to open that door my game instantly froze up and crashed. Whenever i reload that same character they dont seem to last long without the game crashing, but when i made a new character they did just fine untill i went to kill that boss and open that door again. If this bug is fixed i would recommend the game, untill then its a thumbs down."
Negative,"After playing through the game with different Characters and all kinds of playstyles (Ultragreatswords, Longswords and Magic) i can finally talk about the game.On the technical side there are some minor problems but nothing bad. The Game looks good with well made lighting and shadows. Textures are nothing special but do their job. The worst thing are the particle effects which looked better in DS2. Performance is average with 50-60 Fps on my PC (Nvidia geforce gtx 970, AMD FX 8320 3.50 Ghz processor, 16GB ram). Changing grafics options doesnt help with getting more frames so there is no need to lower it. The only part where i saw a change was with lighting. I got 3 more frames by setting it from High to Low.For M/K users. I tested the mouse and keyboard functionality only short but it works better than in previous titles. Mouse is still a bit to fast but at least everything is responsive. Only issue here is that you still get Gamepad prompts. But if you want to use a bow than i would say that K/M is the way to go.The basecombat is like you would expect from a souls game. You have light and heavy attacks, you can block and parry and you can dodge. But there are some additions to the combat. You can now charge your heavy attacks for more damage (and to trick your oponent) and there is the whole new stance ability which works by twohanding your weapon and pressing the ""parry"" button. Each Weapon and shield have a stance that does different things. Some Swords can use guardbreaking attacks while a Rapier hits the enemy with multiple fast attacks. Shields have 2 kinds of stance. The one that you would expect is the parry which works like in previous games. The other Shieldstance gives you the ability to use the stance of your Weapon without twohanding it.The thing where it gets ugly is with the balancing (im only talking about pve since im not interessted in pvp). In both Dark Souls 1 and 2 you could make all kinds of builds. Slow but hard hitting Tanks, fast and agile Glascannons, Spellswords, Paladins. But Dark Souls 3 has a big problem. There are only 2 Builds that are usable beyond New Game. And that is a fast hitting glascannon or a sorcery glascannon. The reason for that is very simple. The player has no poise no matter how good his armor is while normal enemies have poise (even though the Developers say it is working. It is not, they are lying for what ever reason).Because of that the player has no option to withstand an attack without getting stunned while the enemy will finish his attack even if you hit them during their animation. This makes slow Weapons completely useless against fast hitting foes and the only options are fast hitting weapons or sorcerys from far away. The game itself feels like it was supposed to be Bloodbourne 2 rather than another Dark Souls game."
Negative,"As a fan of the Souls Series, I was honestly really excited to buy Dark Souls III. However, as soon as I got it was I extremely dissapointed. Minutes after beating the first *lackluster* boss, the game decides to go on a crash frenzy. If you attack an enemy, CRASH. If you look towards the bonfire, CRASH. Even opening the door after the first boss, CRASH. I would say do not buy this game until they release a patch to fix the crashing issue. To add to the mix, thousands of innocent players are getting banned for no reason, being branded as hackers. So theres that. Get your shit together, FROMSOFT."
Negative,Since the game has been cut from online section. I've to not recommend it due to the huge chunk of the game that missing. At least just open the server FROM.
Negative,wheres my coop bro
Negative,"It's been three months, From. Bring back the servers."
Negative,"I could write a 5 pages essay on why this game is an absolute dissapointment, but why bother? i'm not spending more time than fromsoft took to balance and make the game.Between the abyssmal weapon balance, the repetitive and tired gameplay, the linearity, the samey boss fights, the wonky, untrusty hitboxes and the mediocre to horrendous netcode, i do not know what i dislike more.By the way, still reusing Demon Souls animations and assets is beyond shameful. You got a free pass with the armored core series since it was a super niche game and you were a very small development team at the day, from. I'm glad its over. This series needs to take a rest already.I'ts time to work on Otogi 3 instead, from software."
Negative,"Too buggy and poorly optimized to recommend and with random people getting banned for no reason.. If the game works great for you it won't for long or you're simply lucky.I do really enjoy the faster paced combat and weapon arts. Hate to say anything positive tbh considering my extreme level of disappointment with what happened at launch. For me, the problem is a memory leak issue with the game causing fps drop and freezes with others reporting this as well, game runs smooth (not DS2 perfect though) when I have no other program open on my comp.From Software needs to learn how to make games for PC. Dark Souls had a shit ton of problems at launch as well. You think they would have learned from their mistakes...I am playing and having fun with DS3 for the most part, although so far it is the worst in the series mainly due to small, lame, level design and Bloodbourne copied enemies, it is the most poorly optimized game on the planet atm.What a slap in the face overall, seriously. I'll never buy another From title for more than 10 bucks. Fool me once with DS2 and DS2.5, and again with DS3's beyond horrible launch...never again."
Negative,FIX YOUR SERVERS so we can do multiplayer
Negative,"A game that had potential but is an buggy and laggy mess, honestly dont know how they can sell this game for anything more than 20 euro. Pretty fun but is very disappointing performance."
Negative,"Servers are still not up since January. Can't recommend the game.Edit: This also causes the game to take a really long time to load, as it's trying to connect to the servers before failing. Absolute embarrassment, in my opinion."
Negative,"I bought this game in hope to play online with someone, together, as multiplayer, but Online was turned off and instead Elden ring is working without issue? Literally, fuck this, not going to come back in this kind of treatment. I bought myself a new PC and wanted to finally continue playing DS3 as it was working badly on my old laptop and what? Offline for over a month, all franchise except for Elden Ring? Screw this policy."
Negative,"Disliked for visibilityI wanted to get back to this game to try out the DLC content only to find out that the damn game does not support cloud saves. If that is deal breaker for you, you might want to pass on this one. It's still a pretty good game but be sure to backup your saves if you want to move to a new computer.I'm not so sure if I want to start from scratch again just to try out a few bosses"
Negative,Naked man with club stun locks me and i cant play :(
Negative,terrible support banned me for no reason and wont even respond
Negative,"hackers have ability to reset your game, play in offline mode instead"
Negative,"Obviously this isn’t an in depth review of the whole game but I had good reasons to discontinue playing after 2 hours and that’s what I am writing about. Another important thing to mention is that when talking about the story I don’t care about guessing what something might mean. In DkS you didn’t need to guess and interpret lore to understand the plot.Dark Souls 3 is basically the same game as last time with the plot again being about killing 4 great ones and linking the fire but possibly written even worse than DkS2. There are some changes here and there but they are too small to excuse a whole new game, you still do the same things you did in DkS and DkS2 but this time you aren’t given any motivation to keep going. I got a refund mainly because after 2 hours the game did nothing to get me invested. I enjoyed the combat but for that I can just play the first game instead of paying the full price for the new one that has just a few small improvements.From Intro to Firelink Shrine and beyondThe intro sounds like it is taken out of context. It is so vague and forgettable I had re watch it on youtube to be able to write something about it. In the end It doesn’t give much useful information, might as well not be there. By the time I got to Firelink Shrine all I knew was that some lords left their thrones and that someone brought me back from the dead and wants me to bring them back for some reason. In DkS intro gave me the backstory of the world and explained its current situation as well as the situation I am in and by the time I got to Firelink Shrine I had a clear objective and a reason to pursue it. In 2 hours DkS3 didn’t make one attempt to make me care for what is happening. The only possible reason to care I can think of is that the link of fire is threatened but then the last game made it clear that it happens over and over and fixing that doesn’t get us anywhere. Even if I was new to the series and didn’t know that I wouldn’t care because the game doesn’t explain how it is a bad thing.The Action and The RPGAs an RPG the game didn’t improve at all. There is still a choice of starting classes but there are no new ways to interact with the environment so in the end even if you want to play as a Cleric or a Thief the only way for you to advance is combat. And the combat didn’t change by much; it is still basically the same. There are some new moves that give some more options but they are just a slightly different way to do the same thing."
Negative,bad game the pc servers dont work and the devs dont fix it
Negative,"Not recommended, significant gameplay mechanics have been recently removed by the developer and FromSoftware refuses to update customers regarding changes to online play. If they remove online play they need to reduce the price. The developers specifically implemented online content as a gameplay feature only to remove them and provide paying customers no information regarding if or when they will be reimplemented."
Negative,"""DARK SOULS III has stopped working""""At the end of the previous session, Quit Game might not have been selected from the system menu. Please use Quit Game from the system menu when you wish to end your play session.Failure to end session with Quit Game may result in loss of progress.""""DARK SOULS III has stopped working"""
Negative,"The game is excellent but I can't recommend it in for 2 reasons:- The servers are down since several months, we don't know for how much time. They fixed the security vunerabilitie(s) swiftly for Elden Ring, but can't seem to do it in a few months for the others souls... So you'll essentially buy a downgrade version of the original game, without the player's messages and PVP- Since Elden Ring success, the price of the other souls games increased a bit (that's greedy, but whatever). But as of today 22/04/2022, I see that Dark Souls 3 is at 60€.... for a 6 years old game missing a good chunk of its content? Wtf? I really hope it's a bug...So yes, again, the game is excellent but I obviously can't recommend it in its current state"
Negative,"Fromsoft doesn't care about pc players so there's no cheat prevention. Backup your save regularly if you want to play this game because cheaters can do whatever they want.Edit: nowadays you can use the ""Blue Sentinel"" mod to protect your save and to kick cheaters (and even glitch abusers). You can find it on nexusmods. Please spread the word about it, ideally everyone should use it as it fixes what fromsoft didn't fix (including a major vulnerability that can potentially let actual hackers fiddle with your pc)."
Negative,I would very much like some online servers back. Elden ring is great and all but did you have to kill this games online for it?
Negative,It has been more than 3 months and servers are still down. Even though it is a great game I can't recommend it at this stage as having a jolly cooperation with your sunbro is a big part of the fun.
Negative,almost 400 hours in NG+4 invalid game data
Negative,"I love this game , but unfortunately I can't recommend it for pvp (pve in this game is amazing it's a 10/10). The state of pvp in 2022 is just very very very bad and infuriating, because 80% of the player base that remained are like a venom that course through the barely alive veins of this game. You will fight these ""amazing"" players that are 100% passive with a rotten ghru or pkcs or a dagger that will never attack first and just want you to attack first so they can outspace your attack and than punish it . And if you are like me a ""non-meta"" guy that uses  claymore, fg, red hilted halberd etc, you will have a bad time . Another problem is cheating/exploiting . For exploits we have (estus cancel/fap glitch/bow glitch/rkss cancel) that are all broken and give the user a massive advantage, and the cheating problem in this game is massive ( from ragehacks to closet cheating to ""quality of life"" cheating ) : ragehacks : i didn't find a lot of people that toggled against me , but a day I found a ""good"" (a parasite) player that ran ghru curved sword and I was on the verge of winning when he hard swaps to gundyr's , gets me with the wa. I was on the floor and he immediately goes into a second wa that gets me while I was still on the floor, and btw when he did the first wa I hit him with an r1 that did no damage for some reason. So here I will stop my little rant, and I'm sorry that I coudn't cover everything. If there smth important that I might have missed pls tell me in the comments."
Negative,"I'll keep this short. The game is awesome, but constant crashes and stability issues with several aspects of the game is ruining the experiance. This game isn't finished and I wouldn't recommend it before it is."
Negative,Its pretty disappointed that i lost my save after moving to new pc......
Negative,"Alright. WAS the best game ever to play offline: DON'TThe ""new"" TOS that they have now BANS you for playing offline with no internet and then getting back on, and that is EXTREMELY difficult when wifi cuts out or you have a huge problem with connection, which I did. In now, my account has been penalized for no reason, have not accepted or played with a cheater and taken anything and have played well before and never knew of this.Now I understand in some reasons, but this is WAY out of hand for people who have connection issues and manually get kicked off the internet, which is me, and suddenly having to come back penalized. Sorry, but I don't recommend this game anymore due to the fact of normally playing the game. Peace out, DS3, thanks for coming back, screw the person with your idea on this offline ban for ruining it for certain population of people."
Negative,"With the lack of online play and the patch not having arrived for a month now, I would not recommend this game. The game is good on its own but a chunk of the content is just missing, including the online contributions like blood stains and messages from other players. It adds a lot more to the game than you'd think, knowing you're not alone in your struggles. I hope the fix comes soon but I imagine the devs are more consumed with Elden Ring than anything else. It almost feels like they cut down on the support for Dark Souls 3 intentionally to bolster sales and support for Elden Ring. Seeing as it's been an entire month and Dark Souls 3 is still entirely offline, it sure as hell feels that way.Will change the review when the patch comes through, but can't in good faith recommend it in its current state."
Negative,every time i go into this game i get my ass handed to me by hackers how am i suppose to enjoy a game with full hackers i get though like 5 mins and get invaded and then a hacker blows up my entire screen (Not Joking) then the game fails and kicks me out of the game i can prove this via twitch videos and clips this game is unplayable for all of its gameplay and no offline mode is not a suitable answer for any of itif a game goes like this we should be issused a refund and i call out to all that have got this game to do the same
Negative,"this would be fine if I could get it to work, half the time when I boot it the game crashes. if by sheer luck I make it into the game then I am presented with a user interface menu system that is fuckin terribe."
Negative,shit game got banned for no reason i was playing with a friend and then stopped around 2018 or 19 and we came back to play it about 2 days ago and in the intro it says i have been banned? LIKE WTF
Negative,I figured they'd had enough practice by now fucking up the PC ports that this one would be functional. Nope.Guess I'm returning this and getting the 30fps PS4 version because of unplayable stuttering.
Negative,"I guess Elden Ring was the perfect cover for FromSoftware to completely hide from the multiplayer server issue and pretend it doesn't exist, yet receive very little backlash from the bulk of their community due to being distracted by ""shiny new thing."" Even if the servers suddenly got restored tomorrow it would still be pretty scummy of them to have left everyone in the dark for so long (February 9th being the last time they acknowledged it and the service being down since January 23rd), especially when it's the fault of FromSoftware's own typically incompetent approach to their PC ports - that the long time feature had to be temporarily removed in the first place.Yeah the game is fun and all, but honestly? If you wanna play the game right now just pirate it, as it's not worth your money due to it currently being an incomplete product by its own standards. Maybe that'll convince them to actually do something instead of a single cyberpunk style tweet.Edit: It took them 214 days to bring online functionality back..."
Negative,"I want half my money back. 6 months and still no online.Delay every time you want to play to still try and login.Edit: The online was fixed within 12 hours of posting this.Still no praises for BandieNamco or FromSoft, they have tainted their record as companies in my eyes with the last few shenanigans they have pulled. Downtime of this degree should never have happened in the first place. It's like the first thing taught in basic networking.PLUS, we are on PC, we don't need you to host others you morons. It's a form of offloading, it lasts forever, and costs you nothing, maybe look into it?"
Negative,"Let me start by saying that this is probably the best of the souls games.  I've played for over 30 hours so far and am on my second playthrough.  The mechanics and game overall are appropriately challenging and the settings are visually stunning. Unfortunately there is one serious drawback to this game and that's that the anti-cheat system in this game is atrocious.  A few days ago I was banned for absolutely no reason. I was given a warning message for invalid game data even though I had not used any sort of trainer or cheats.  Upon further investigation I found a large number of people who were banned just like me without real reason, thier theories being controller support or playing during server downtime.  Many of them have tried to contact Fromsoftware to no avail.Regardless of how many actual cheaters this punishes for even a single person to be unfairly banned from the online aspects of the game is unacceptable. When you pay $60.00 for a triple A game you expect to get the game and the entirety of its' fetures.  If you are looking to play this with friends I would suggest holding off until they sort out this mess."
Negative,You crash if you approach bonfires.How the fuck does that get past QA.
Negative,Being sold at full price despite online being disabled and From Software refuses to fix.
Negative,"Good game, but mods got me banned from multi. This game has some of the worst anticheat I've ever encountered, so for the 2 people who are going to buy the game after my review is posted I recommend avoiding that which would make the game better."
Negative,"Bought game, installed, had a hacker join me right after Firelink Shrine. Kicked them, restarted game, ""INVALID DATA DETECTED"" and was banned for playing the game regularly 5 days later. Anticheat is trash if it bans the victim and not the perpetrator. Can't even get a refund now, either."
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 was my first ever souls game, and so far it's left a bad taste in my mouth.  When i first saw footage of Dark Souls 3's gameplay i was sold. Previously i was put off from it due to the infamy the series has gained as being very difficult, and didnt wasnt to play a rage fest. But after playing Lords of The Fallen (which i picked up for free on xbox due to their games for gold program) i realized the fun in the challenge, that these types of games pose.   I decided not to preorder it because of the fact that many games nowadays are being sold with game altering bugs to the point of them being unplayable. Which is unfortunetly the case with Dark Souls 3. I foolishly bought the game on launch day without reading any reviews because i didnt want to spoil my first souls game. Calling myself foolish is actually very wrong because:NO GAME DEVELOPER/PUBLISHER SHOULD RELEASE AN UNPLAYABLE GAME.   If you are going to release an unfinished game why not as well make it early access, that is what it is there for. It's not like this managed to sneak past quality controll (do they even have that???) because there are hundreds if not thousands of unsatisfied players are having the same problems i am having, and i doubt that they are ok being swindled out of their cash by paying for a game that was SUPPOSED to be complete.  It makes it even worse that neither bandai namco nor from software have really acknowlaged the problem. Could this be considered false advertising, because what i bought did not resemble the playable game they showed in the trailers.  As of now my steam profile states that I have ""played"" this game for seven hours. Realisticly i only played for about four because of all the starting and restarting its made me do. I could have acomplished what i did in those sevn hours in about two if these problems had not existed. It also ruins the imersive feeling that the game has when you've seen the same cutsceene fourteen+ times!  Its like releasing buggy games is the industry standard now. A la Quantm Break, Batman, Assassins Creed, GTA 5's multiplayer, and the list goes on. When did the video game industry shift from entertainment to a cash grab? That they relaeased this game in its current state like this KNOWINGLY is absurd.  I will not be changing this review to a positive one, even if they manage to fix the game. This is my first review (i think), and my first Souls game, sucks that they both were negative, because it is a really fun game when you get it to work, and has amazing visuals and soundtrack. Also the enemies are very uniqe not just in styling but in they way they play, taking advantage of your mistakes and chaining combos. Im sad to leave this review but i do not recommend the game in its current state and no company should lie to their customers."
Negative,"Probably the most derivative of the souls games, it overly relies on past references to tell its ""story"". Combat is better than previous entries, but felt very stale at the point that this game released, especially when you consider that Bloodborne came out a year earlier and how dynamic, fun and visceral that game played vs how methodical, slow and punishing DS3 is against some enemies and Bosses (The problem is exacerbated tenfold in end game ares, and it's especially noticeable in the Ringed City DLC).I might have been looking too much into it, but even the game plot itself manifests the series fatigue.The world is physically and literally collapsing in on itself because it’s been through the same cycle that many times, It's so perfect, I feel it was an intentional message that From left that nobody noticed, or maybe people unconsciously did, but just chose to ignore it.I haven't even listed all my other issues with this game, like the complete disregard when it comes to balancing weapons and spells between PVP and PVE, the fact that magic is basically pointless, the fact that miracles are essentially a joke, the FP system that makes lower tier spells useless, how dominant quality straight-swords buids are vs literally everything else in PVE and how aggressively muted this game shaders and environments look, but this review could go on for far too long, I'll just say that overall, this game is the weakest of the From Soul-Likes as far as I see it and leave it at that."
Negative,Door Physics 10/10
Negative,"wack, play dark souls 2 instead"
Negative,"This game could be so incredibly wonderful. It has everything a souls game needs, to be a souls game one can love. The big problem I had/still have (and many other people, look it up), are stutters. Framerate drops from 60 to 40, and i have stutters for nearly 2 seconds. I wouldn't mind 40 fps, not at all. But with those nice stutters, the game is just not enjoyable.You can buy and play it, you may have luck and it runs well. Or, like in my case, not.I do not recommend it, due to the russian roulette you play with your fps.Thank you From, well done.(Yes, i tried EVERYTHING to make it work. I gave every ""fix"" I came across a try, nothing actually fixed it.)"
Negative,"As long as legit players keep getting banned from the game and hackers go out unpunished, my review will stay negative.Just wanted to have some fun playing with my friend because i kinda suck at this types of games untill some random chinese hacker summons me to his world and starts giving me items without even needing my acceptance. Just brute forcing players to accept this. So i ask.Why am i getting punished for this? Why do i need to create another character and start over? After all the pain in the ass i had to just progress in the game? No, no and no. I won´t create another character, it is the DEV´s job to prevent this issues and not punish new players for their incompetence of having a decent anti-cheat."
Negative,"I have no choice but to not recommend this game, because it may be a good game, but it's a garbage pc port. If you play with a controller it's acceptable, but that should not be a requirement for a PC game. The controls are extremely jank with mouse and keyboard, with problems such as your viewpoint being forcibly locked in place after certain attacks, temporarily locking onto enemies on it's own if you aren't using the lock-on feature, several actions that can't be rebound, (such as sprint, which seems locked to spacebar even if I want it on shift.) Not to mention that the instructions including all the menu options and tutorials exclusively show controller inputs, even if no controller is plugged in. All in all, this leads to lots of 'bullshit' deaths where it feels like you have no control of what's happening. Go pick this game up for PS4 instead, and pick up a copy of bloodbourne while you're at it to justify the buy if you need to buy a console to do that."
Negative,"I got a character to about soul level 100 ish and got the invalid save data message (soft ban).Deleted all characters to be sure.Days later I was penalized (hard banned) because of failiure to remove invalid data.Its a good thing I bought the season pass too huh?The game itself is good, but it sucks to be labled a cheater for nothing."
Negative,"Some people are a fan of the faster combat. I am not.It worked a lot better in bloodborne with the revised combat system, and was perfected in Sekiro.Dark souls 3(and Elden Ring) feel like a regression, where dodge rol spam and reflexion gets rewarded instead of positioning and reading the boss.Still a lot better than 2 and maybe worth a playtrough in a sale, but personally I'll stick to 1 and demons souls."
Negative,"Step 1: Download Dark Souls 3Step 2: Play until you get invaded by a dipshit who injects your save with whatever hacked item they wantStep 3: Get banned by shitty anti-cheat softwareStep 4: Create an Alt using family shareStep 5: Enjoy Fromsoft disabling family share after 4 years of DS3 being released because it 'curbs cheating'Step 6: Find a chair, a hook and a rope."

Negative,"Fuck.This.Boring,hard and clutchy controls..."
Negative,The multiplayer was stripped from the game!? It has crippled the otherwise great game which is now left broken.. This review will change to POSITIVE IF the MULTIPLAYER is FIXED!
Negative,"The servers are down since a lot time, horrible service."
Negative,"Если уж вы решите играть в эти помои то играйте хотя бы до оцейроса и оцелота, после этого вырубайте игру нах, хуже этого поноса человечество еше пока из себя не высрало. Бабадзаки решил что игру доделывать не надо, так что и я доигрывать в эту парашу не собираюсь. Сделай себе одолжение и не поддерживай таких убогих, бездарных, никчемных, безмозглых и отсталых разработчиков."
Negative,"Great game, but pvp is ruined beyond saving. Game is infested by ce users, and honestly not worth playing anymore. Shame that fromsoft didnt make a proper update for this game, fixing exploits and latency, now every virgin can one shot u with press of single button."
Negative,"I never enjoyed it. Never really saw what the big deal was. It either gangbangs you to death with like 5 enemies (only 2 of which you can barely fight without being stunlocked), or surprises you with big one-shot kills that you're just supposed to accept and then avoid next time."
Negative,"Alright people, I hope everyone's psyched for the release of Star Wars™ Episode VI! Here's the breakdown of what's new:So it's like a thousand years in the future since episode 5, and like a billion years since episode 4. Everyone died, yeah, it's been a long time. The force is now called ""The Fire Within."" And Jedi are called ""Ashen Ones,"" because it's just been so long. Isn't that cool? And it makes like, no sense at all. The force also basically doesn't exist, except for a status effect Luke gets in one scene, and as a simple excuse for him to do a bunch of jedi stuff. Sorry, ""Ashen One™"" stuff. Oh yeah, don't worry! Luke is back, and he's here to light the first flame again- I mean end the series! So is Yoda, Yoda's alive again and he's here to do the exact same thing he did in the last two movies, but it's in this one now. How are they back? Don't worry, it's just force stuff. I mean after the decision to make a third movie in a three-part trilogy, everyone got really tired and bored and we wanted to get it over with, so we cut a few corners on the story and the set design and the actors and the film budget and the deadlines especially. We also stole the story and the set design and the character arcs and the theme and the atmosphere and the bad guys and everything that happens from the first movie and Red Tails, our other movie that just came out. We really wanted to recreate that ""Gothic inspired"" mega architecture dream feel from that movie, and also the horrific body horror stuff since we were all still high off of it, and we also wanted to have a merger between Red Tails' fast paced, action packed, primal and fear-oriented design with Star Wars' methodical and decisive yet thrilling and satisfying storytelling and movie structure. Almost like we tried to mix two completely opposite gameplay styles and weapons- I mean story elements and structure, and broke the balance of everything, and we just kind of ended up calling it ""more intense, and faster."" And I mean completely opposite, Red Tails was literally created to completely juxtapose Star Wars and catch fans off guard. Eager to hear what you new fans think! (All the old fans left...)Anyway, guess what! Boba Fett's back too, everyone's favorite character! Only he's named Koba of Fett, and he doesn't have a daughter that has to kill him. His personality is also ELECTRIFIED!! and he's like three times as stupid, it's super funny! He loses his armor in a bet on Tattooine (Reusing and revisiting areas and ideas is super cool, isn't it?) and Luke has to get his armor back from Yoda, but he has to be careful not to pass over a bridge or enter the Death Star™ before he does, or Koba of Fett will die and not come back ever. Koba also now has a relationship with Jabba the Giant, I mean Jabba the Hutt, where he has to kill him cause he's gone crazy, and it's really emotional, but it was never set up. Like, ever, but you are supposed to feel something clearly, so do so, please.Anyway this one's not gonna be about the force - excuse me, ""The Fire Within™,"" or taking down the evil empire, or Luke confronting his father anymore. It's gonna be about Dexxter Jettster™ and his jedi training, to fight the Naboo, which became evil after Jar Jar invaded Coruscant and killed everyone there. Remember that one guy who could cast Force Judgement™? He ate him! Now he's a total tyrant and he's got two lightsabers, red and purple, like Revan, except he's just evil, not a kind of inbetween or anything with any depth or originality. And and a bunch of people are gonna call him a ""God Eater"" - Er, excuse me, a ""Senate Eater"" cause it sounds cool, even though by the second movie everyone had already forgotten about all the councilors (But who cares about the second movie, amirite??). And everyone in coruscant is oppressed and wretched, and they've got all this black goo all over them and despite being forced to live in freezing temperatures with black goo all over them by the evil tyrant who blocked out the sun, they try to kill Luke. He must save them despite themselves. Isn't that cool? That, and the big semi-relevant cathedral he goes to, and the completely irrelevant meme catacombs is gonna be about 90% of the movie, until the very end where we realized we were getting a little bit off track and we needed to get back to making a movie about Star Wars. So the final fight is between Luke and some guy we've never introduced or told you about before, but he DEFINITELY existed before this movie. What was his name... The Soul of Darth Maul! Yeah. He's basically a culmination of the will of everyone who's ever used the force before to do Ashen One ♥♥♥♥, even though they all wouldn't necessarily want to kill Luke or stop him from doing what he needs to do. Pretty cool, huh? No? Not enough? Well, um, um... How's this! How about we add in a ten minute video short where Luke fights through a citadel we've never mentioned before, and meets a bunch of bug guys that apparently - I mean TOTALLY existed since the beginning, and have been attuned to the same terrible curse humans have been suffering under, I mean they're totally attuned to the force, too? And Luke has to kill this guy named Darth Plagueis, who's death means the grateful end of the universe after all this time? But we only had a minute to get the fight over with. Oh, and you'll have to pay to see it, too. I'm talking like, 15 bucks. Oh, and we'll also use the canonical last words ever spoken in the whole universe to name drop another thing you'll have to pay for, where we essentially copied the Hoth planet from the first movie and put it in here piecemeal. (Well, it's from the second movie, but come on. The second movie sucked. It was basically the first movie anyway cause it was at the beginning of the second one.) That'll also be 15 bucks.Also, speaking of the second movie, it's not canon anymore. Despite it being an insanely depthful dive into the nature of the force and putting in effort to raise questions about the state of mankind and what lighting the first flame means, it was rushed beyond belief so it had pops and clicks in the recording and a rough release. Everyone hated it, despite in my opinion, being the best of the three (Oo, controversial opinion~). So it's been completely divorced from the game, except for when Luke finds Lando Calrissian's body and stares down at it for a few seconds with no comment before moving on. We thought we'd pay respects to something that's completely dead (except we're totally NOT! haha XD) For the same reason, Darth Vader isn't canon anymore, unfortunately. He was in the second movie, and we'd planned to put him in the third, but we'll just have him mentioned on something Obi Huan is reading while he's on the toilet, and not even by name, just so the second movie really isn't canon. Also everyone has a hastily written sob story and dies except Luke, and Luke's father is now Jar Jar. Enjoy the movie!"
Negative,"servers were taken down, and apparently the ability to save games has gone with it"
Negative,learn 2 netcode lmao
Negative,"The publisher shut down online play, and the game tries to connect for more than 30 seconds every single time you start the game until you disable online play."
Negative,When is multiplayer RCE going to be patched and turned back on? Elden Ring is already out.
Negative,Not Gex 3D
Negative,"I love this game so much. I Really do.. but i can't give it a positive review because of recent events.. Server have been down for about 3 months now and The games are still being advertised as co-op, but they aren't anymore. It seems as though the Devs are not going to keep the servers going, which, don't get me wrong i understand to some degree, but this game still has a big, active fan-base, so it doesn't make sense to shut the servers down.. unless.. they are doing it to make people buy and play Elden Ring.. The servers where shut down due to an exploit, but it was fixed very quickly.. why are the servers still down 3 months in? There has been NOTHING from the devs regarding this except ""servers won't be online until after the release of Elden Ring"" and it just seems scummy and sketchy.There are some absolutely ridiculous people commenting defending the devs, asking why people are still playing Dark Souls 3 when Elden Ring is out.. It's such a dumb comment because they are literally different games, with different achievements, bosses, multiplayer aspects and the maps are different. Just because a new game is released, it should force people to stop playing their older games. Stop saying these dumb things.It seems like once again, one of my favourite developers are just doing everything they can to make money, and screwing the consumer. I really hope this is not the case, but i can't give a positive until this is sorted out."
Negative,"Loved the DS series so much, I have them all here on Steam and even on my old X-box One! But with the servers down and not allowing for collaborative play, it really brings down the replay value and complete enjoyment of the franchise. If the servers were up and people were allowed to play collaboratively again, I would very much recommend DS3 and any of the DS games. But as it is, I must say stay away until the servers are back up.  Also in addition to this concern, the price tag of $59.99 is complete price gouging being a game that is now 6 years old give or take. Don't buy this unless there is a major sale and the servers are back up."
Negative,"No multiplayer for more than a month because vulnerability issue and no news when will they fix it or if they fix it at all. From the store they deleted it has multiplayer so I guess they don't plan to fix it soon.I haven't finished the DLC content so I wanted to finish it before I buy Elden Ring but I might wait with that purchase too. It has performance issues anyway. Please fix your games, thanks. We, as customers (or paypigs for some of the games), need to voice our displeasure if the game doesn't deliver what they promise. Please downvote the game if you are unsatisfied too because it's a great game but it's missing a vital part of it."
Negative,this game sucks my entire cock and balls I hate my life so fucking much
Negative,Extremely hard to play with friends because you get invaded every 5 minutes and have to restart. This completely ruins any fun in the game.
Negative,lost my 200hr new game +5 game save after the server crash
Negative,Dark Souls 1
Negative,not NEARLY as good as the second one.
Negative,The game is simply just to easy.......
Negative,"This is a good game, but it being over 8 years old and still costing 60$ is absurd. If it’s half off, I’d likely recommend it, but for the full sixty you can get a better quality game.. or two… or three."
Negative,bring back the servers
Negative,Today i got hacked by a random dude that just appeared at MY WORLD and started f*cking my character up and CASUALLY RESTARDES MY WHOLE WORLD TO THE VERY START. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS CRAP?!?!?! WHY IS NOBODY ANSWERING FOR THIS?! WHY CAN'T I CONTACT ANYONE NOT EVEN STEAM?!?!?! I CAN'T BELIEVE I JUST LOST HOURS OF MY TIME FOR A LIVELESS JACK*SS TO DUMP IT ALL.

Negative,Easier than a roblox obby
Negative,3 months servers are still down. Garbage ring pvp is up tho
Negative,"Just garbage, boss fights nice hard but thats good but that pvp that if i play with friends everybody can invade us every second just that you cannot play free but you are forced to pvp and there is nothing to do also another 1000 bullshit things in that game. Just dont buy it cancer not fun just pissed from it everytime"
Negative,BEWARE! Hacker has taken over this game. I play all of the dark souls series and have more hr on some of them if you count my Xbox days. I have 200hr in dark souls 3. The game is amazing and I only recommend this game in offline mode only. But I got hacked when  I was in the undead settlement and sent me to the very start. If you fight a hacker they will reset your save game and ruin your save game.  They might be able to do other things on your system but that is not confirmed. Overall if you only play offline mode only you are going still  love this game it might be my favorite game series of all time. If you still want to play online download the mod blue sentinels. It might help but I'm not entirely sure.Don't take my word.Evidence (go to YouTube and paste the title in.)Everything You Need To Know About The Ds3 NG+ CheatFamous Dark Souls Hacker Malcolm Reynolds Sends Twitch Streamers to NG+dark souls 3 hacker ruins our multiplayer saveDark Souls 3 Hacker Sends Me to NG+
Negative,"Game is the worst in the series, I wanted Dark Souls 3 not Bloodborne 2. Invasions are a literal pool with AIDS blood from which you cannot escape. Every 10 minutes you get another sweaty kid with a poison build and as soon as they realize you have pockets full of moss, they run off and hide behind enemies for 45 minutes. If this game was better, I'd actually have less playtime."
Negative,"I'm not finishing anything with poison swamp levels, fuck you"
Negative,Why tf is this game 80 dollars
Negative,ok where dlcs
Negative,The camera is the hardest boss in this game.
Negative,"Currently the game has a massive issue with hackers deleting characters, saves, and potentially harming your PC. Purchase later when fixed"
Negative,got soft banned:(
Negative,Cant rape curse rotted greatwood
Negative,"Overall was a challenge. The bosses were all unique and enjoyable to fight, although difficult at times. If you pay attention to the story of the game, that is also very interesting, especially the lore of the bosses.I do not recommend this game, however, for one specific reason. The Nameless King. If this mother fucker uses that stupid lightning attack that comes down in one frame one more time, I will [imagine something really bad, then imagine whats worse than that, cause if I say it this will get taken down.]Fuck you, you nameless piece of shit.Sincerely, Curlew"
Negative,Really good game -like top tier- but isn't accessible at all.-No keyboard icons-Online is full of hackers-Difficulty is not for every type of player. I don't say game should have easy mode(I think it can have if game tell you correctly.) but maybe game can tell what you can do . Like I didn't know you can spawn NPC for half of the game. It could tell you.-Probably all missions can be completed by just guessing  because things are just so complicated. I don't say it should have quest log or that kind of thing but it should make sense like killing area boss is cancelling or quest. How can I know that?
Negative,dark souls 2 lepsze
Negative,SERVER STATUS - Downfeeling down? all you need is a broken sword to help you love your life even more! not recommended for those with peanut allergies as you'll be eating a lot of D*cks
Negative,"The weakest of the three games in my opinion. Great for PVP, but the PVE is just not as enjoyable."
Negative,2 H A R D ;(
Negative,Dont buy until Family sharing is back up
Negative,worst souls game
Negative,preço tá absurdo
Negative,"So... this is a great game. Well made, well animated, well made... mostly everything. I thought it would be fun to play Co-op with my friend from poland and we could work our way through the game together. But lo and behold as a person invaded our game and decided to try and dump literally hundreds of items onto me somehow.  I ended up being the roughly 10% of people whom hackers end up fucking with. Now I have 15 +47 Two handed swords in my inventory/storage and a maxed out ashen flask.I thought this was cool at first. Understand I've never played any of the other Soul's games and I initially figured that the hacker was too idiotic to understand that hacking involves using the code to help yourself to win. He was an invader after all. He joined, dumped and then left, My friend and I had driven off a good number of invaders at that point so I was poorly ignorant to how this works. I bought it on sale, sure. But thirty bucks is thirty bucks.  Now after a bit of investigation about hackers online I realize that they have just fucked my save file. It is very likely that I will be flagged for hacking because I can't actually discard the items and the emote which is now stuck in my inventory. From what I've read I have to now jump through literal internet hoops to get these hacked items out of my game. I'm not die-hard, but I enjoyed what I played. I'm currently 16 hours in and now realizing I may now be given a ban because people can fuck up your shit at will. I have no saved footage, I'm not a streamer. All I have is the memory of me yelling at my friend if he see's this guy handing out items left and right and him eventually realizing that it was probably a hacker because english is his second language. He has much more experience in the game then I do.So now I am stuck with a dilemma. Do I go and intentionally download the CE, the Cheat engine and cheat my game in order to hope that DS3 see's I am not cheating, do I email them to let them know I didn't actually cheat but some guy who's name I didn't catch is framing me, do I take the ban and play on the hacker servers?I think I just wasted money, sadly, not because I ever intended to break the EULA, but because the company doesn't bother to update its cheat prevention. Even though I really enjoyed this game... Well...good luck getting me to buy another one of your games Bandai Namco. GG WP. Aren't you guys making pachinko machines now?"
Negative,"In the PVP scene, the game is filled with bugs and glitches that encourages scummy, illegitimate play. At the time of this review, there has been a very dangerous exploit were people can steal your data and install malware onto your pc by simply matching up with someone; essentially how a scam website would work. I was so close to dropping the game forever, but that  one security issue has had it for me; I won't be playing this anytime soon, unless if that exploit gets fixed."
Negative,Kings Field clone. garbage. Want my 500 hours back.
Negative,Fuck this game I hate my life because of this and I want to kill myself
Negative,customer supoort is so bad when u have problems in game
Negative,"Banned for freecam.Shitty PvP, no poise only hyperarmor. Shittiest magic in the serie."
Negative,"Get invaded and hacked by a player, only to be perma-banned and no way to appeal an unban? GG"
Negative,Bad game should not play
Negative,no cloud saves=no good review
Negative,bad game just want to play multi
Negative,I hate this shit
Negative,"In my opinion, this game is awesome. It can make you angry at times, but it's definitely worth it once you beat a boss. I finished this game in 25 hours.Pros:-Fun to figure out each level.-Hard but fun and rewarding gameplay.-Amazing music.-Cool old art style.-Option to use controller or keyboard, also nice to be able to change controls.-10/10 puns after every death.Cons:-NoneCan't think of any cons. SOOOOOO GOOD!"
Negative,"I'm gonna be honest with you here I gabe this game an honest try and I was just so upset at this game. there is no balance and there is no netcode, just watch iron pineaple or the fighterpl instead. this game has NO ONLINE PLAY, it is a LIE! you will be killed by enemies SO FAST! i have many hour on this gmae but i could not defeat one enemy,m because the online is SO BAD! and dont even get me started on the balence. armer is too strong and should be nerfed, it takes away player damage and for what? NO COST? and plus armor is among the easiest item to find in this game even in the first area 'the throne of the lord of darkness"" there is so much armor and it is incredibly high level, S rank or and all of the weapons do NO DAMAGE. you heard me right NO DAMAGE AT ALL. this is enickslusable for a game of this calibur, especaly after playing sekiro where you have so much damage and you can youse your sword to parry attacks and block intuitively. overall this game isgood but held back by rollback netcode and broken armor"
Negative,"Don't buy right now. Too expensive for an 8 year old game. $60 for the game plus another $20 for the dlc. Servers are down, even though they said it would be fixed after elden ring was launched, which is hilarious because modders have already fixed the issues with hackers.If you're looking at getting this in 2022 and beyond, buy it on sale. Nothing less than 50% off, and use the mod that allows for custom servers. It's a great game beyond the servers and the price.P.S. I have nothing against a new game being the they're at, but an 8 year old game being this price is too much. It reminds me of Activision."
Negative,"Dark Souls III could have been a great game if it weren't for the invasions.Playing offline is fine, but oh? What's that? You just want to play online with a friend? Well, have fun getting raped in the ass by unwanted invaders! Hmm? You don't want to get randomly invaded every 10 seconds? Too bad. You don't have a choice.You're thinking: ""Well, I got invaded, but hopefully they'll at least be honorable."" Nope, they never are. They'll just keep running away, using the NPC enemies as backup because they're too bad to fight you on their own. They'll heal 15 times and keep running.It's a lose-lose situation; either you'll die and get reset to the last bonfire without your ember, or you'll finally kill them, having lost all of your Estus Flasks and even worse, 30 minutes of your life. Honestly, how the invaders get any ""fun"" out of this is beyond me.Maybe if PvP was an option that you could toggle on or off it could be fun, but suddenly getting attacked by ""Lou Sassole"" while you and your friend are messing around 5 meters before the next unlit bonfire (which you can't light until the invader is gone, by the way) is agony.Playing with a friend should not turn an enjoyable game into suffering.Don't get me wrong it's a fun game, that is, until you get invaded...So, to all invaders I would like to say: Please, do the world a favor, and off yourselves."
Negative,stockholm syndromeupdate: i'm finally free

Negative,"I'd also call this game ""flawless masterpiece"" if I hadn't played all the souls games prior before this one ripped them off."
Negative,"I will start off by saying I am simply a casual, weekend gamer which was looking to delve into the story of the game rather then looking for a challenge. I found DS III very difficult to play and progress into the story-line as even on the lowest of difficulties the first boss fight is just incredibly hard. If you are like me, would totally not recommend."
Negative,Crap nothing more to say really
Negative,the dark souls of normalization

Negative,Its a dope game tho i fkin caracter starts to run auto out of nowhere and then stop sometimes. Happens all time? anyone know how to fix that shity thing? id really want to play the game but makes it impossible when u run auto
Negative,Honestly a great game until the their ban system when it actually does it's job ban people who haven't done anything. been banned for weeks yet I don't use cheat engine which I'm told is the main cause (didn't even know about it until after I was banned) yet there is nothing I can do.So yeah this game is amazing but their cheat detection is an absloute useless mess.
Negative,"Just wanna say DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON PC IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE ONLINE EXPERIENCE.I cannot recommend it if you expect to have fun online in it. The game has been plauged with cheaters for a long time but has stayed somewhat tolerable. However, now a script for cheat engine has been leaked which allows cheaters to get you banned and destroy your character. On top of that having clean backup will get you banned either way.Fromsoft's anti-cheat measure is a lazy, outdated embarassment that ironically works against the players it's meant to protect.HOWEVER, if you don't care about the online and just want the pure pve experience then go for it, just remember to play offline."

Negative,"After i finished Dark Souls on PS3 I finally decided to buy this game on PC to enjoy my widesceen : but the game keep crashing and is completely unstable.The 3440x1440 resolution does not work properly, you have to edit some files to get it working (http://www.wsgf.org/dr/dark-souls-iii/en), because without any of these fixes you can't just use the resolution that is shown in the options because it just won't work,it is bugged and the dev did not fix it. It is a shame for a PC portage.After a game of 1 hour. The game started to crash when i restarted it. It happens during the loading and it shows a blank white screen everytime: after a few seconds a popup shows a crash textbox.Then I reinstalled completely the game but it did not help, I also checked the files of the game from Steam and it did not help : Steam says my installation is correct, but it still always crash during the loading. I can't even play at 1920x1080 anymore after a complete reinstallation of the whole system Windows+DS3  (!).My config is not so special : Windows 8.1, Intel X5650 Workstation, GTX 1080.This portage is bad and contains bugs (the 3440x1440 option that does not work) and I regret I spent my money to buy this bad and cheap portage.As i said I have been able to play 1 hour in 3440x1440, before it broke the game when i relaunched the game. I feel vey disgusted.So I spend 65e for 1 hour of game. I asked the editor to give me my money back by explaining the crash that I experienced but they did not even send a message. If you have a widescreen save your money, because the game lies when it says it supports 3440x1440, in fact it contains bugs for pc users and the dev don't care about them."
Negative,[YOU HAVE BEEN PENALIZED]and this's not first time they ban players for no reason
Negative,"Massive security risk for your device due to increased hacking activityDo not buy/ do not play until fixedanyway, Praise the Sun!"
Negative,"Personally had lots of fun with it, while it lasted a few years back and re-visiting it from time to time. Lately I bought this game for my partner to coop through while waiting for Elden Ring. Then the online got taken down with a promise that it will be back up for ER release. It still did not come back, our co-op session effectively shut down. Now, even the Store page doesn't have multiplayer listed, no explanations given either. I'm mostly sad that my favorite game series gets the treatment it by no means deserves. The money must be tight at Bandai Namco if they cannot properly patch the game."
Negative,"This game (and the series alike) is very overrated. Every aspect of Dark Souls 3 is subpar and uninteresting. It's the epitome of ""A mile wide and an inch deep."" Everything it does is done to a far better degree by other RPGs. The combat: Nioh 2 and the Ninja Gaiden Sigma series are games which have similar weapon variety but much more depth to it's combat mechanics. The most interesting the combat can get in Dark Souls 3 is pressing the attack button or the roll button. Of course you can block (lol) or use the special ability of the weapon which will be most likely be useless except for some standout cases. The combat is sooooo boring and watered down compared to any other ""soulslike."" The spellcasting is also very lame since you have sacrifice your only resource of health in the game for it, and bosses in the late game actively discourage that playstyle anyway.The World is also really boring as well. For a game where every boss is a named character and all your companions have these mini arcs, FromSoft has a really hard time making me care about any of them. Out of all the characters I think I only really cared about 2 of the nonboss ones. The ending is also so entrenched in the bad world building that it makes it hard for me to care about what happened in this world. Some of the bosses are interesting but a lot of them are really uninspired and if you have any familiarity with this type of game, you should be able to beat them pretty quickly. The exploration and secrets are probably the only thing that I think Dark Souls does well, but still lacking compared to other RPGs with not even half the budget.The most impressive thing about Dark Souls is that it's able to have very bare bones and watered down versions of all of these mechanics in one single game. A mile wide but an inch deep."
Negative,"So I've played a lot of this. And it's weird, after all this time I still wouldn't really recommend it to most people. My first gripe is the difficulty, which even with over 70 hours of playtime under my belt I usually find more of a hindrance to my enjoyment than anything. It's dangerously close to ""be perfect or else you lose"", especially if you're any sort of caster. It definitely doubles down on the one-shot kills too, which I always thought just killed enjoyment. It's not so much enlivening and pulse-pounding to me as much as annoying and draining. And not only that, but when it should be most challenging, envigorating, and memorable near the end of the game, it just kind of peters out, reusing old enemies and ideas over and over again. Semi-SPOILER the last non-boss challenge in the game is just a bunch of the same knights and soldiers you were fighting in the first few hours of the game, only more of them and with higher stats. And that's after an entire area filled with nothing but reused enemies. Ick. END semi-SPOILER.Now the constant difficulty wouldn't be so bad if not for my second and main gripe, that the game is massively, massively linear compared to previous entries in the series. There aren't even a handful of meaningful branching paths. Which is sad, because that was one of the saving graces of the series for me. For Dark Souls 2 when people would say ""oh I don't want to play it, I don't like games to be that hard"", I could tell them that at any time there are 2 or 3 paths they could take instead of the one they're on, so if something is giving them trouble they can try something else out instead, then get stronger and come back. It keeps it fresh and lets you avoid the frustration of just being stuck on a really hard boss that you're fricking BORED or ticked off with but that you just can't seem to beat. Well that whole mechanic is gone, dead. It's no longer a metroidvania game like the first two. With a few exceptions there's nowhere to really explore except the area you're currently in at the moment. And actually, with only a single exception the places where you can take branching paths are secrets, not even part of the main game. It's just a straight line from beginning to end. For me, that's a huge disappointment, and seems pretty lazy when they've taken time to do that in the past.So I guess I'd recommend it if you're 100% only in it for the combat, which is excellent, and the difficulty. If you mainly wanted a metroidvania-style tough as nails exploration game like I did, like the second one was, with a criss-crossing critical path and the ability to make meaninful choices about where to go next and not just get spoon-fed areas and bosses in a linear fashion, this is not it. Disappointing, and not recommended unless you're a masochist or simply a lover of the combat.*Update: I had the urge to retry this since the Elden Ring trailer came out. My opinion hasn't changed. I don't understand why anyone feels compelled to spend their time playing this. I think I've been sick of grimdark settings for about 10 years now, too, that doesn't help. I didn't enjoy Sekiro, either. I think I'm just done with this guy's games. I hope everyone enjoys Elden Ring."
Negative,-Terrible pvp- two hit combos are bullshit- terrible dlc wepon balancing- overall terrible wepon balancing this game has a decent pve but its pvp is garbage. I want my money back from the season pass. if you want pvp from darksouls go and play darksouls 2. At least that game has had time to balance.
Negative,Its not BloodBorne
Negative,dis gaem iz shit
Negative,"If you have an AMD graphics card, do not buy this game right now since THE GRAPHICS AND FRAME RATE WILL JUST TANK. Also \[T]/"
Negative,"It's time to let the flame dieEpic conclusion to a great serie------Servers down for months, don't buy the game"
Negative,i bought game for ps4 but after playing 40 hours i was tired of 30fps and drops on ps4 so bought it on my pcand then dissapointing:1.no ultrawide support(i have some shitty black bars dunno why)2.games runs perfectly  but after some patch 1.06.1 what makes game freezzes from time to time for 1 sec .before that constant 60fps on ultra settings
Negative,"I want beyond all to be able to write a glowing recommendation for this (mostly) masterpiece of a game. The polish and world development are outstanding and the experience going through it two times already has been great, but now I'm at endgame PvP and the experience for me has been a complete mess. Almost every time I get summoned or invade into a game, the animations of all players are frozen and not playing out so everyone just glides around in a neutral pose so it is literally impossible to know what they're doing. Aside from that half of the covenants just do NOT work, at all. Any covenant that auto summons you to invade or protect someone(Which is 4 out of the 8) either work or do not work for people playing. It literally almost seems like down the middle half the player base can use these and the other half cannot, my friend gets summoned for Blue Sentinels all the time, I have played 66 hours without a single summon from any of the 4 covenants. They also ruined the flavour of a popular covenant from the last game and now it's just a carbon copy of Blue Sentinels instead of being about hunting sinners. Overall the game feels soooo good, but the online features and PvP just feel so broken right now.  Final Score: 7/10EDIT 4-20-16: Started a new character to play through again and so far the auto summon covenants do work, so I guess it's just luck of the draw on a per character basis. Hope they fix it soon, still upset the character I spent 70 hours on can wait hours and not get summoned.EDIT 4-22-16: New character was fun for awhile, was not aware of how exactly the weapon upgrade system and matchmaking works, stuck again with no action on auto summon covenants for deciding to upgrade my weapon all the way. Intuitive mechanics FROM. My opinion of the game is really dwindling because it takes so much research to have the best experience that an organic playthrough without using a walkthrough or wiki feels impossible.EDIT 4-27-16: 100%ed, got all the achievements done so obviously I enjoyed the game. That being said I hope they fix the animation glitch and redesign some of the covenants."
Negative,"Playing the game offline is great, easily one of the top games of 2016. Playing online is full of hackers and endless invasions with more and more systems to punish the world host and not the griefers.Not recommended for online play."
Negative,"Looks great, combat is fantastic, port is absolute garbage, after releasing 2 souls games on pc youd think they could at least try and bug test, but apparently getting to the first bonfire is too much work for them, at least on anything but knight. Not worth the money until its been patched like crazy, seriously From Software, get your shit together."
Negative,"I meet the minimum, there's no difference for me between 1650x1080 with med/high settings to 800x600 with lowest settings. First boss for some reason makes me freeze everytime he attacks.Update on review: Will try with a pc that meets recommended to see if it still freezes during combat:Some freezes that lasts for about 0,1 second so nothing mayor but it's really annoying when it happens but not often at all. Lighting on low to prevent crashes, so far running quite smooth.Since it doesn't work for the specs it says it should I cannot recommend it but if you have a high-end pc, it runs pretty well. I'd love to recommend it because it's really fun but sadly it needs to be better optimized and no crashing.A post about DkS3 ports: http://www.pcgamer.com/durantes-dark-souls-3-port-analysis/"
Negative,"The way the game is right now, its unplayable. Crashes everywhere! They need to fix this right away!"
Negative,PC version is just full of cheaters go console and do not deal with this.
Negative,Multiplayer servers closed = SCAM product
Negative,bruh this game hard lol
Negative,No online for almost a month now
Negative,Best Game Ever.No Cloud Saves...
Negative,"DO NOT BUY FOR PC. Start up the game for the first time, monitor out of range. Alt-enter to windowed mode and menus are in controller format. Been like this since day one PC release with no fix in site. So I begrudgingly grab out my Xbox controller and decide to play it that way. Final straw was playing and losing connection to the Dark Souls Network and getting kicked to menu, from single-player. Do yourself a favor and skip this lazy port to PC console game."
Negative,"The game could be very good.Unfortunately the publisher does nothing against hackers who ruin the game. On the contrary, you can even be banned yourself if a hacker joins the game and puts invalid items into your inventory without doing anything yourself. You cannot get rid of the items without hacking yourself. If you don't have a backup of your savegame, which you don't do if you don't know the problem, your savegame and all the time you invested is ruined. That ruined the whole game for me."
Negative,"This game is unplayable due to hackers. The game is amazing and I have loved it for years, but the online play (which includes co-op) is broken. Recently decided to pick it back up on PC and within the first zone ran into hacker after hacker. These hacks included teleporting mobs, making mobs invincible and so forth. Even had one hacker teleport the greatwood boss in an attempt to kill me, but the game instantly killed the boss as it was moved outside of the boss arena, locking me out of a specific covenant.Additionally, If you google this game to find information about the various exploits, in May of 2021 it was discovered that a new game exploit allows hackers to corrupt and delete your save file. Causing you to lose everything. In summary: DO NOT BUY."
Negative,"I personally enjoyed this game a lot, and I still do, but there are just way too many problems (major and minor) that seem to go overlooked for the longest time. While I understand that they want to completely forget Dark Souls 2's existence, they refuse to learn from the good that it did, while also completely getting rid of what made the original Dark Souls so popular; difficulty. Rolling is now based around spamming rather than timing, and considering the low cost, there's absolutely no drawback to mashing the roll button 20 times, as you'll regain your stamina within seconds. I could go on for hours over what's wrong with this game, but the most painful thing of all, though, is how they barely listen to their Western fans, almost always pandering to the East's. Even the Region Lock is essentially for Japan only, as there's only 2 real ""regions,"" Japan and Not Japan. Overall, I feel like they were more focused on releasing the game and getting the series over with (as well as pocketing all the gullible fans' money) rather than making the last game in a largely-beloved series the best one yet."
Negative,"Family sharing is disabled and all accounts are deleted... thanks Fromsoft for the information.But that is not enough for Fromsoftware:After 3 games they still use a P2P tunnel to connect the players with each other ... for this reason it is easy for hackers not to be detected by the anti-cheat system (if any exists).Hackers can do a lot to your game too :D- Break all your stuff.- Hackers can force stuff into your inventory.- Break your save-game.- Permanently ban you from online servers.- They can all do, like a Game Dev, cause they dont get banned from the Game ! :D I cant wait to see what Fromsoftware will do in Elden Ring."
Negative,Thank you for killing the game. I don't want to play this game after blocking steam share.
Negative,"SERVERS OFF, I WANT PVP"
Negative,"Fromsoft has completely abandoned the online of this title for the past half a year, with little to no communication by devs."
Negative,"Huge exploit is found and they just turn off the servers, can't seem to be bothered to communicate what's going on or and eta on a fix. Meanwhile modders had the exploit fixed in 24 hours and private servers are going up. This bodes well for Elden Ring right guys?"
Negative,"游戏很棒，但每天害怕自己被softban，我不能享受游戏。备份复制一个存档都不行，万一需要重装系统该怎么办呢？又要重新打吗？会累死人的，求游戏公司改进一下ban的制度吧，谢谢了！The game is great,I LOVE IT,but every day i am so fear of being softban that  I can't enjoy the game. The backup copy of a file will not work, if you need to reinstall the system,how to solve this problem? Do you like to play it again and again?  It will be tired to dead, so I ask for the game company to improve the ban system, thank you!"
Negative,"This is something of a sad thing to say, but I can't really recommend this game at it's current Price, or it's DLCs, not unless they're less than $30 at least.I'll try to describe in Detail why this game isn't very good, from both a PvP and a PvE aspect as best I can, so let's start with PvE.} Baser PvE enemies: In Dark Souls 3 PvE, the game at first, doesn't seem too different from many other games of an RPG Genre, very basic enemies staggered by your weapon, they don't have very powerful weapons or tools to defeat you with but you have to play careful or be overwhelmed, very fair and basic stuff, so it's not very much so worth getting into, what's really worth getting into is later-game, wherein enemies actually deal fair damage to you. In mid-game  enemies still try to overwhelm you, though now they move much faster and their weapon strikes are almost always faster than yours, this can lead to unfair fights wherein if you begin to get over-tasked, you may not be able to get away before getting killed in combat because you simply can't move or the enemies lash out at you far too quickly for you to heal, this can be frustrating to deal with at first if you're going through the game alone, however this problem can be solved if you simply bait them out one at a time. In late-game, though there is a mix of a few newer enemies, for some reason they simply re-use the exact same enemies you fought earlier, only harder hitting and maybe a new technique or 2, but otherwise pretty well the same, any tactic you used on the enemies at the beginning of the game, which makes it ridiculously easy to simply walk up to them and smash your Light-attack button because your swings will almost always knock them out of any of their attacks, the only reason you'd have to stop is to regain Stamina so you can repeatedly swing your weapon again. This truly baffles me, as in previous games, from the Souls Series, I have never seen re-use of enemies on this scale, and likely for good reason, so as to make you learn new tactics for each area and make them more memorable. It is also very apparent that the tactic you use to beat Beginning level enemies can also be used to beat almost every enemy up until Mid-Game where they begin to get faster than you.TL/DR: Enemies are somewhat poorly made PvE Bosses: The very coveted Dark Souls Bosses. The bosses for Dark Souls 3 are mostly well made, save for some exceptions, which can be quite the annoyance or completely disappointing. This shor bit is going to list off some poorly made Bosses, so skip reading this if you don't want to be spoiled, but know that it's roughly 45/55 on how I personally feel about Bosses. #1 Deacons of the Deep#2 High Lord Wolnir#3 Yhorm the GiantLastly, #4 Dancer of the Boreal Valley This is just something of a detailed list of bosses that were poorly done but were mandatory, if they weren't mandatory they wouldn't be worth mentioning in my opinion.TL/DR: 1/4 of bosses are badNumber of Bosses/Time to beat: Discussing the bosses also makes it apparent there are less bosses than the previous two Souls series games, With Dark Souls 2 having a bare minimum of 20-16 bosses if you use Shortcuts and skips and Dark souls 1 having 14 bosses if you use every shortcut and skip device available to you. This is another point Dark Souls 3 has against it, considering 4 of it's 13 are unimpressionable bosses, which isn't neccesarily something I can say about about the others in the previous games. This can also considerably reduce the time to beat the game.TL/DR: Less Bosses than previous games, thus making game quicker to beatPvE and Combat:Another thing worth mentioning is that many weapons in PvE are unviable, the only things you'll usually every need are a Dark Sword or an Ultra-Great weapon, using anything else is usually more of a challenge, and you'll often see this is usually what people are using when playing Co-Operativley or during Invasions. This removes a lot of personality from characters, because not many people will sacrifice personal taste for damage, though every weapon should be reasonably good.TL/DR: No good reason for PvE weapon varietyCo-Operataive play and Host Benefits: Lastly, Co-Operative play and Host Bonus's in Dark Souls 3 makes it ridiculously easy. In regards to summoning: Now, don't get me wrong, this is true in every Souls-Game, however in this one, every enemy except for some bosses can be VERY easily staggered, meaning that if you bring 2 or 3 extra players into your game, you can usually just carelessly swing your weapon with abandon, as any enemy that comes into contact with a hit will be unable to move until they recieve a second hit, letting your and your friends keep whacking it in an infinite cycle. If you haven't somehow managed to kill it and your summons haven't taken the aggresion from the enemy, you have a large plethora of Estus and lots of Rolls to be able to survive almost anything, along with a 25% health increase to help you survive more lethal attacks. This in totallity means you can simply mow down enemies with your pals and never think about attacking Human-Sized foes and makes you sloppy at fighting bosses because all you've likely had to do is spam light-attack and you'll likely beat most bosses by summoning too.TL/DR: Summoning+Being a Host makes game no challenge at all A few other short things:  Dark Souls 3 Re-uses a LOT of Assets from previous games.For some reason a some magics were added from previous games and others were not at all. Moving on to PvP  Invasions: In Dark Souls, there is a mechanic unique to it that you likely won't find in many other games, the ability to invade and combat people during their PvE experience. This being said, Dark Souls 3 has pretty well ruined this mechanic, with the previously mentioned Host Benefits and Co-Operative play and the ability to also stagger Invading players like regular enemies, this allows the Host and his phantoms to have an overwhelming advantage against invaders unless an invader uses only combat builds designed to kill other players in a single hit (Also known as Glass Cannons). Also in Dark Souls 3 was the inclusion of moving while using the healing item Estus, making it nearly impossible to punish another player who has run away and is currently healing because they can just walk out of punishments. With all this, there is no good reason to Invade in Dark Souls 3, it's literally been ruined to an almost unrecognizable degree, especially if you've played the previous Dark Souls games.TL/DR: They've Soiled It Duels : Duels in Dark Souls 3 are okay, though there's clear superiority in what weapons you should use, and Heavy armor is absolutely pointless.Now, I know there are some people who might be wondering what some above average things are about this game, so let me give you a brief summary of those: ~Dark Souls 3 Positives~  Soundtrack: By Jove, the Soundtrack is amazing, even for some of the lesser Bosses, it really gives you a feel for what you're fighting and puts you in the moment. Art: This one is a bit generalized, but I mean things like the armors, the Backgrounds and some areas, which clearly have a goodly bit of detail put into them, some of these clearly have had a lot of work put into them. Good Bosses: Now I spent a good paragraph listing off how I dislike some of the bosses in Dark Souls 3, but there are some VERY good bosses in this game, that will no doubt enamour you (Make sure to do hidden Bosses if you do get this game) Wrapping up I'd love to go into more detail about some of these things but reviews can only be so long, so I'll just tell you my final score for Dark Souls 3 is a 5/10 and with it's DLC it's a 6/10. Again, I recommend buying it when it's cheap on price, or if you just wanna say you beat Dark Souls"
Negative,"I actually held out a lot of hope for this game since Miyazaki was returning as one of the Game Directors, but I've never been so disappointed. For reference, I have played Dark Souls, Dark Souls II, and Bloodborne prior to this. I did not play Demon Souls or Scholar of the First Sin or any of the DkS2 DLC.This game is great in so many ways and improves on a lot of the features of previous Souls titles from crafting to unlocking spells, weapons, and other purchasables, and even brings the player back to a Dark Souls feel for combat and character control compared to Dark Souls 2, including the i-frames on dodge rolls not being nearly as few as they were in Dark Souls 2.All the praises I could give to Dark Souls 3 are unfortunately thrown out the window due to some critical flaws in the game's design. Let's start with some of your first experiences in the game...Minor Spoilers for the first boss fight, nothing story-related, but you've been warned.First boss, Iundex Gundyr - Pretty easy and very enjoyable first phase, really gives you hope for what the rest of the game offers. Second phase? Explodes into a giant black mess of goop that covers your entire screen and is near-impossible to read. I actually managed to beat him on my first try, but it required all estus flasks and I had a sliver of health left. This was a warning for how the game design policy had evolved, which I flatly ignored. I feel like I got pretty lucky getting away from that fight unscathed. It also helped that I started as a Warrior, so I had a decent health pool and good starting damage. My gf chose Deprived and struggled significantly more with the boss than I did.Early-Game Estus FlasksSo, they decided to carry over the DkS2 style of Estus Flasks, where you start the game with very few estus flasks, and it takes a while to build that amount up and certainly to, beyond that, make them effective with bone shards. I don't even want to imagine what it must be like as anyone who relies on FP because you also have to allot your estus flasks. Sounds like a great idea for late-game and PvP absolutely, but you're going to be very frustrated as many early zones feel like a game of attrition as you're trying to explore and collect all the items so you don't have to come back later after you're well past that area in the game to grab a few things that were probably more useful earlier in your playthrough.Especially with how much more damage enemies have started to do in DkS2 and DkS3, and many other BS things they added, your main concern should really be whether or not you can survive individual engagements or coordinated encouters such as ambushes, rather than worrying about your estus flask management in early zones. You will probably find yourself using homeward bones at least once in the first three zone before finding your next bonfire for the fear of losing all your soul progression.Enemy BS in a variety of formsLots of enemies have been designed to make the game unfair for you. While most people have a misconception about Dark Souls games, I recall Dark Souls 1 to be a refreshingly challenging experience. It was hard not because it was designed to be unfair, but because that kind of challenge was new to me. You're an undead fighting Kings, Dragons, and borderline Gods, you're supposed to hurt, but as my 5th grade teacher properly dichotimized the terms of ""hard"" and ""challenging,"" whenever someone would complain that something in the class was hard; Something that's ""challenging"" is by no means insurmountable, and something that is ""hard"" is not made to be broken, it's made to withstand every blow it takes.So, the first instance of some serious BS in the game is the black goop enemies you fight in the first zone, and occasionally further on in the game. Much like Iundex Gundyr, they take up your entire screen, but they also have massively wide arcs in their attacks and are near-impossible to read. Now, you can certainly kill these enemies before they explode into black gore and personified frustration, it was not something I was ever favorable enough to do, and some starting classes may have more difficulty than even I did in accomplishing this.Enemy Tracking is another great piece of BS they decided to exarcerbate in this iteration of the Dark Souls universe. Some bosses will share this trait as well, which is very disconcerting, but you'll notice a lot of enemies whose attacks will track your character during the entirety of the attack animation. This makes it very difficult to dodge or position yourself with dodge rolls or normal movement and is nothing less than artificial difficulty that will leave you tightening the grip on your controller every time you die to an enemy that will spin 180 degrees around towards the end of his attack animation to catch you after your dodge roll finished because you thought, as with every other Souls game, dodging early to gain a positional advantage and allowing yourself for a large enough window to punish enemies was the smart thing to do. Not in this game. You are forced to dodge roll as they complete their attacks, especially if you want to dodge the follow-ups which will also track you, and this makes your punish windows much smaller in this game for no logical reason other than to try and market the ""challenge"" of Dark Souls.Too Much Poise! A lot of zones will have some signature enemies that are made memorable for their challenge or unique mechanics. However, this neat concept is bastardized by making powerful or cool enemies, especially those with fast attacks and very little down-time between those attacks, have incredibly high poise. Even as an UltraGS user, I had difficulty poise-breaking a lot of enemies. One of the greatest examples of this are the Goat Monkey Fire Sorcerers in Demon Ruins. They can take a fully-charged R2 from the Profaned Greatsword and still retaliate without flinching.No Input-QueueingYup, no input-queueing. That's great, right? A step in the right direction for DkS3...except...it's not. Input-Queueing was actually insanely useful in previous Souls games. You just had to stop spamming and know that your character will do what you want it to. The importance of input-queueing actually exists in the reaction time it offers. Life or Death comes down to fractions of a second in Souls games, and input-queueing makes it so your input will activate at the next possible opportunity. As long as you know the game and trust your inputs and don't button-mash, you will be better than okay. In Dark Souls 3, removing input-queueing means you have to button-mash in order to react on the first possible frame. You know how you have to button-mash to get the roll or backstep at the bottom of a long fall to avoid the momentary stagger? Imagine doing that all the time on all bosses or enemies that combo you or poise-break you or knock you down, or...anything! It's very uncomfortable and, in my opinion and people may disagree, less skillful.Ironically, the only semblance of input-queueing is in dodgerolls. This was definitely one of the biggest peeves in Dark Souls 1, no pun intended, of anyone who played was the random dodgeroll. It's not quite as bad in this game, but if you try to dodgeroll an attack but get hit before the dodgeroll executes and are poise-broken, often times on boss fights, you stagger and then dodgeroll after the poise-break ends. This becomes a very huge problem because a lot of bosses in DkS3 are designed so that they combo in specific intervals to counter people who spam evade. The follow-ups last just long enough that they hit you after your dodgerolls ends if you dodge reflexively to being hit once. That is really smart and enjoyable gameplay, but when your dodge is queued after eating the first hit and you are forced into a ""reflexive dodge"" you didn't intend to perform, the boss gets 2 free hits of damage onto you, and then you could very well be dead."
Negative,Crash Souls 3 10/10 would crash again.Don't get this until they update. 5 hours of gameplay and the game crashes as soon as load any file so I most likely lost all of that. Pretty pissed off.
Negative,"game sucks, 1/10 fps"
Negative,"6 year old game still $60 and now with no servers, what a deal!"
Negative,if you dont have an xbox controller dont play this its so confusing on keyboard and its kind of rage inducing  to be very honest
Negative,Fucking atrocious console controls.From Software clearly haven't been near a computer.
Negative,"Fantastic game! Unfortunately the online community is filled with hackers, twinks and gank parties. I know some people enjoy this, but many will find the community and online aspect of this game to be comparable to an air bnb in Blighttown."
Negative,"I wish I could like this game more because I love the atmosphere/aesthetic and boss design but I feel like i'm forcing myself to play it. Run backs to bosses aren't fun and are just annoying. By the time I get to the boss im half health and getting hit through the fog gate by random enemies. I got to pontiff Sulyvahn and just didn't want to play the game anymore, the game wasn't hard, it was just frustrating. I feel like all the difficulty I was because of stupid things instead of bosses or hard areas. I understand why people like this game but compared to other fromsoft games like sekiro, bloodborne, and elden ring, i just had way less fun."
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 is an excellent game, 8.5/10 at least. But when you lose 20+ hours because some random parasite hacks your file and erases your progression, you can't recommend said game in good faith. Until this issue gets fixed, do not spend money on this game.Update: If you do buy/play this, play it offline or install the excellent Blue Sentinel mod from Nexus. That seems to counter the worst of it. Still not giving a thumbs up until the devs get off their butts (and I'm not holding my breath) and fix the issues themselves."
Negative,"There is no Power Stance like in DS2 and thus limiting the freedom of choosing which weapons you want to combine into a power stance, which for me was one of the best mechanic ever.Now you have like 2-3 set of weapons that are already combined which is also neat but doesn't give you as much freedom.else pretty solid game, still thumbsdown amk"
Negative,"Drivers are fully updated, windows fully updated. The game used to work on my PC (same hardware) and now it won't even launch. I get no support from the devs and this is why I am not gonna buy any of their games again."
Negative,6 year old game still $60 lmao
Negative,"lost all progress, steam does not support clouse save for Souls Trilogy!...."
Negative,Put the game on sale you greedy guts.
Negative,"Game wont let you play online if you have a bad graphics card, and if you do you're forced to look at the floor 24/7."
Negative,banned from online bc a hacker put an item in my inventory then killed me
Negative,"editing to a negative review, at this point the servers are just offline s[o they can pump elden ring numbers, they have now permanently damaged their fanbase for money, hooray."
Negative,"Multiplayer is broken and FromSoft has moved their workforce to Elden Ring.Aquire a 'free trial' to play the singleplayer if you must, don't buy it."
Negative,"this game is too artificially difficult, no skill involved whatsoever. you just run into the bosses death after death hoping from them to use an actual dodgeable pattern of attacks and then you win with 0 satisfaction. would not recommend to anyone besides wannabee e-sports teenagers"
Negative,"Great game but if you plan on playing with a wide screen be prepared for a lot of frustration.  Played for like 50 hours with no problems whatsoever at 3440x1440 ratio 21:9.  Then one day for no apparent reason the ratio changed resulting in black bars on the side.  I could not get it to change back.  I ended up having to mod the game which may end up in an online ban according to many people.  I often start the game with the black bars and have to quit, reload the mod and restart the game.  Like I said great game but I don't really want to play anymore having to deal with this hassle so frequently."
Negative,Worst port I've ever seen. Developers should feel ashamed to release this.
Negative,Cheater reset my progress the second they joined my game. Blue Sentinel mod was useless.
Negative,"21:9 Widescreen support broken on launch day patch. Don't bother purchasing this if you were planning on playing this game in 21:9 before some hack gets released, or they patch what they broke.Another sad day."
Negative,They have made an announcement on how the game would be playable after Elden ring was released and the game still does not have online mode.
Negative,"An eyecandy game with nice graphics, good looking particles, and smoke. Don't let that distract you from the problems that this game has: the input reading of the game is atrocious if you want to heal the enemies run to hit you, you need to run far away to heal yourself without getting hit in a cheap way. If you want to attack too bad the enemy will decide the same but will hit you first or ignore it an gulp all your estus flasks. Enemies do not get tired of spamming attacks, or sometimes there AI broke and don’t do nothing. They remove power stance and add input delay to the rolling BTW is atrocious. I don't know whose brilliant idea it was to add this to the game, to dodge you have to roll at least two or even three times to evade successfully (spam rolling). Don't let the graphics keep distracting you, the level design is regular and boring with mediocre enemy placement doesn't make you want to explore them just run to the boss fog, unlike the other games in the series. Most of the bosses in the base game are bad, I'll put the only good ones below without mentioning DLCs because they did a little better there: Old Demon King, Pontiff Sulyvahn, Dancer of the Boreal Valley, Champion Gundyr, Nameless King (Best), Soul of Cinder the rest are dog water. The casualization and playing safe destroyed the potential of this game without a doubt the most ""hollow"" dark souls of the trilogy by far. Better play Bloodborne, DS1, DS2, Elden Ring or even Sekiro.Graphics: 8/10 (Eyecandy particles and smoke)Story: 3/10 (recycled from ds1 and uninspiring,)World design: 4/10 (zzz...)OST or Soundtrack: 8/10 (very good.)Value: 2/10 (zzz...)Final Score: ★★★★★★☆☆☆☆ | Fine but only that. 6/10"
Negative,perdi meu save pq esses japones filho da puta não ligaram o cloud sync obg fromsoftware viados
Negative,My grandma died after this game...
Negative,Shitty game mechanics and enemies hitting through walls
Negative,"I can't recommend this game to anyone anymore. It was my favorite, I have over a thousand hours. From Software is just a disgusting example of not caring about their fans. They don't need me? I don't need them. No multiplayer is just boring. Do not waste your money."
Negative,give me multiplayer
Negative,fuck this game
Negative,My saves are gone.
Negative,too many souls
Negative,Imagine not fixing servers :/
Negative,"Pretty good concept, but it could have used more Tenchu mechanics."
Negative,"came for ornstein, left with dissapointment."
Negative,No multiplayer in a soul game.SOVLLESS
Negative,"Such a lazy rehash of Dark Souls 1 and Dark Souls 2 assets. Pretty boring exploration, some interesting bosses. Who bought this at full price? A lot of locations are best just ran through than interacted with since it's so tiresome.If you really want it, despite the online being down for a few months already - buy it with heavy discount."
Negative,"I love this game, but the anti-cheat is broken, if you buy this game please just play in offline, even co op is not safe as hackers can force illegal items into your inventory and get you banned and it happens frequently. Almost 200 hours down the drain. Not to mention twinks/smurfs can invade you with late game weapons and armour and grief you as a new player, in my experience these are the only people still left playing the game."
Negative,Dark souls three? More like dark souls poop and pee
Negative,"I tried to enjoy Dark Souls 3, I really did, as someone who had a good relationship with Dark Souls 1 and found Bloodborne to be one of my favorite games, possibly of all time. However, I just think DS3 is bad, in the end. The reasons are plentiful, but ultimately, I think the best way to portray WHY it's bad is that it utterly failed to improve upon the Dark Souls formula in almost any way, just adding more and bigger ""stuff."" Maybe this was a reaction to the reception of DS2, which I never played, but I heard that people thought it deviated a bit too much from what the hardcore fans really wanted...that's just what I heard, but it does seem to fit with what I see as the final product of DS3. Now, the reason why DS1 is a much better game, IMO, is that it was refreshing, different and timely. It had huge flaws, but there was just so many positive fundamental design choices that it became easier to forgive those flaws as you got deeper and deeper into the game. Bloodborne was again a refreshing take on what made Dark Souls so engaging, so again, the flaws could be overlooked because it was executed so well. DS3, however, feels very stale to me, which makes the continued existence of some of these game engine flaws much more problematic. For instance, here are some of the things that this Dark Souls engine is STILL doing all these years later:-Wonky, sometimes unresponsive controls-Barebones and buggy target lock -Ledge boundaries that are inaccurate, causing unexpected falling-Enemies can hit you through walls, while your wall strikes can stop your attacks-Jagged enemy animations that can be cancelled, with hit frames and hit boxes that are highly questionableThose are just pure engine issues, then there is enemy and game design:-Horribly cheap, incredibly frustrating, sometimes one-shot-kill enemies are not uncommon; often it feels as though these enemies can just do whatever they want, rules of game movement be damned-Everything is a duel; they just made enemies more obnoxious under the guise of being ""challenging""-Rarely felt like skill was the thing holding you back from success, that levels, gear, and luck were more important-Can resort to cheap tricks to get through difficult areasThat last one is particularly emblematic of the game as a whole for me; everything feels cheap. Enemies have more garbage, cheap moves that do a ton of damage than ever, and the player can be cheap about getting past them. I'm sure that there are many players who LOVE this; they will talk about how they wanted this all along, and say ""git gud,"" or whatever. But IMO, DS3 just amplifies the flaws of the original Dark Souls and doesn't get particularly creative about any of it. These things were sort of cute in DS1, they gave it character. It's not cute anymore, it's just obnoxious. Oh well, not for me I guess. UPDATE: I actually tried to push through and play with different builds to see if I was just missing something. Nope, the further along I got, the more this game actually revealed itself to be garbage. It's literally a broken game engine the way they implemented it. I suppose you can have fun with this game if you just get a kick out of exploiting a game, but if you actually want to just play it, like it seems like it wants you to, then there's pretty much no fun to be had. It's an insufferable slog."
Negative,Default controls are on console messing with pc players not allowing them to know what to do. Terrible it still isn;t patched even from other dark souls games
Negative,"Feels like a worse version of Dark Souls I, less connected and more linear. Soulless"
Negative,"FromSoft just removed family sharing for this game. Huge mistake. Now my friends who had to create another account and then share this game to their alt account because some hacker dropped them broken items, banning their accounts, cant even play with me. And theyre completely innocent. They didnt know any better, theyre new to the game. This was a bad move on FromSoft's end. Now we're all going to stop playing because we cant play together. I soon foresee the ""banned"" servers becoming the new vanilla servers as literally anyone could be banned from hackers breaking your character data that you cant do anything about."
Negative,"The game itself is one of the best games ever made. The issue is with the PC version and the lack of support from the developers. On May 12 or 13 they released a patch which has severely affected many, many PC players. It causes random 1 to 2 second freezing every 1 to 3 minutes. Why is this so bad? Well, the type of game that darks 3 is, it's a rhytm combat game. It basically means the combat is very fluid and quick, and you must react in in split seconds. The little freezes completely interrupt your flow and break the game. The bug being game breaking is one thing, but it's the lack of communication from whomever  is managing the game that makes it so terrible. FromSoft has broken their trust with me.I basically paid $60 for a paperweight hyperlink. The game itself is so unfun in it's current format, that it's essentially unplayable. I will never buy a brand new game from FromSoft. I will wait till it's onsale, months to a year after release. It's not worth it to me. Please vote with your wallet and do not support these publishers who neglect PC gamers."
Negative,"There are hundreds of weapons and spells and armour and rings to put on your fingers and liek 15 different stats to level up that all do different things. For me, this just constantly makes me wonder if I'm doing the right thing, instead of being able to enjoy the game. It really punishes you for not making a good ""build"" and has exceptions to lots of rules and you end up playing 80% of the time and googling the other 20%. There are also lots of characters to talk to and items and pick up in an exact order in random parts of the maps, even places where you've been before ages ago. And sometimes you should kill these NPCs and sometimes you shouldn't. More googling required. Also, if you ever look up how to beat certain bosses (and you will end up doing that), you'll probably find that everyone else on youtube has way more health than you, as well as better stamina and other stats, their weapons do way more damage, they have a better ""build"" and they had equipped better items, so the boss fight is easy for them and you won't learn much.To me, a game you have to google in order to play it properly and have any chance of completing....isn't a good game. I also completed it twice (on NG+) so no, I'm not just ""bad at the game"" :)Also, equip load above 70% causes the player to slow down when rolling - the game never explains this. More googling required instead of playing. Get over yourselves, devs."
Negative,"If you are not pad controller or Mechanical keyboard user(just better than membrane), never buy this shit system game. You have to know that this game isn't hard level. That is all of this seriously stupid system makes game harder.This stupid system is two type.1. Key input lag (membrane keyboard only)I don't know why it is happening. but near my friends and some of the people says when using membrane, sometimes hard key input lag occurs. when you press any key, It will work litte later. Even tihs problem is ramdom(I think using more than 2 key, for example press ↑+→+'X'. because control pad isn't using 3 order at one time.)2, Input queue(queuing of actions)When you press any key, and that action(key) can't running at that time, that action will start when it possible.It looks like convenient. but almost situation, that action isn't your want.Maybe you are hurry to evade, so type too many times. Or maybe you confused first actioon is over.This stupid system is most streesful system to make game harder, you have to know.. you have to memorize when fist motion will over, and always keep mind calm for double or more type.Lastly, I think when game's bulxxhit system makes game playing harder, That isn't hard level game.This game is Just bulxxhit incomplete game.Game system has to clear, controllable and always results are same by logical rule.This game isn't clear, controllable. Even irregularity lag."
Negative,"So far kind of a disappointment, I know I will still play it but the controls are sadly still shit. As well, the games already crashed and I keep getting issues with my player running in a particular direction until i press the key that causes it. Hopefully we'll get a hotfix for some of it :/ I do know though that the controls are never going to be optimized for computer, nor are they going to put in the extra hour to alter all the tutorial messages with the keys on the pc either."
Negative,juego de mierda no me gusto
Negative,"Fine setting, quirky yet responsive combat system, weird difficulty spikes.-1 for cultist toxic community around the series.Overrated."
Negative,Poopyyyy pc servers have been down for how long now smh
Negative,This game does not include PC control prompts. I don't know who makes a AAA title like this and expects EVERYONE to use controllers. I didn't play DS 2 because of this exact thing. It is total BS.
Negative,Fix the online.
Negative,ya grannyt bald headed and yo whole family bald
Negative,Every Attempt to play leads to my save vanishing the next time I play. Add steam cloud support and I'll change my mind.
Negative,Fuck Invading. This mechanic is literally so fucking dumb. There should be a way other than launching in offline mode to disable invading. I am just trying to enjoy the god dam game when this asshole keeps repeatadly invading me and its literally so god dam tilting.
Negative,"If you're a huge souls fan or havn't played any of the games, this game is something you should definitly nab at least on sale. Otherwise not so much.There's zero innovation. Zones are okay, but nothing exceptional to the older games, and some zones are just an annoyance. Bosses are roughly the same, you could like fighting them, but ultimatly you just learn their movesets and easilly dispatch of them eventually. The boss aldritch came close to being interesting, but was the same thing in the end. Balance is complete trash. Poison does 3 damage a tick, damage is all over the place, using gems on weapons sometimes has no effect or nerfs the weapon. PVP is trash again with no innovation on previous titles, and covenants managed to be the worst in the series. Weapons like greatswords have lower dps than alternatives, expose yourself more, and don't even have the best crit profiles. You can evade a greatsword user for five minutes in pvp just getting in their face and dodge rolling if you watch out for kicks and not take a single hit.If you want a themepark to kill some time in give it a go, but don't expect to be blown away."
Negative,loss of a huge chunk of my life in multiple saves on my family share you cunts have now stole from be after being unjust banned on this one and having family share now deactivated. you also did some rather sneaky small hat shareholder things when you only removed family share after steam sale.
Negative,Servers were down from February to August 2022.
Negative,Watch the boss spam attacks. Roll and do a pixel of damage. Proceed to roll 5 times to avoid boss spastic sweeps. Repeat. Every boss.
Negative,Servers still down with no updates other than a quiet removal of the multiplayer tag on steam.
Negative,"I like Dark Souls III, very much.But I cant launch the game now. It is not my responsability to find a way to play the game. This is the responsibility of the developers."
Negative,Hackers ruined this game. I've got a softban beacuse of a invalid iten i coudn't get rid of. i delete the caracter after the warning and still got banned
Negative,No controller support. keyboard doesnt work. cant get past fucking character creation screen because my mouse wont work. fix your game!
Negative,"They removed multiplayer months ago for some exploits within their servers and still haven't brought them back. Now, they removed the co-op tags from all Souls games as well. Normally I would recommend this game, but with how in the dark we are with the removal of co-op, and the very real likelyhood of servers never returning, I'd recommend picking up a different multiplayer game to play with a friend."
Negative,"THIS GAME IS GOOD, BUT MY REVIEW WILL STAY NEGATIVE AFTER FROM TOOK DOWN THE SERVERS ONE MONTH BEFORE THE RELEASE OF 'L'-DEN CRINGE AND RESTORED THEM EXACTLY SIX MONTHS AFTER THAT GARBAGE'S RELEASE.What a coincidence, huh?EAT SHIT, MIYAZAKI.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------WARNING: NO STEAM SAVES. ALWAYS BACKUP YOUR SAVEFILES SO YOU DON'T LOSE ALL YOUR PROGRESS. BEWARE OF ONLINE CHEATERS.This is simply one of the best aRPGs of this generation. Dark Souls has a special kind of charm that hooks you and compels you to keep progressing, exploring and leveling. The lore, the combat and locations are simply exquisite.It has a high difficulty, alright. Some things feel like bullshit, but you'll learn and git gud. You will grow with your character, and you'll love it.The Dark Souls games are a masterpiece. One of the few AAA modern titles made with soul.Oh, and play with a controller lol"
Negative,"It was almost perfect, but the design to force PvP when co-op, is this game's absolute biggest flaw and there's literally nothing you can do about it. There's plenty of sportive people out there, but there's a louder majority of toxic people that would simply call it me being salty, use the usual ""lol git gud lol y so salty"" etc.I only want to play with my friend and go through the game's world.I don't have a problem with PvP. For those that like it, by all means, go nuts, however if it has to interrupt and screw my PvE experience, then it's an awful design for those who simply do not want to PvP. I never had interest in PvP as over the internet, PvP has and will never be perfect over the internet. There will always be lag problems, and you're always forced to play and adapt in the moment you fight somebody. Yes, I'm quite salty with the game only for the fact of how PvP is designed to screw with people who don't want it.Every thread where people search for a way to not wanting to have PvP interrupt their PvE experience, it's met with dismissive comments of ""just dont ember"" or ""play offline""  with the follow up ""if u co-op, u have to pvp too"". Heard it all already, and I just hate it.I'd consider it a miracle if FromSoftware decides to change up a covenant that promotes co-op and blocks out invasions entirely. For anybody who is thinking to response with a work-around, unless it's a guaranteed co-op with no PvP invasions at all, don't bother.I like Dark Souls, and it's almost a perfect game, except for this one problem."
Negative,This game might be better with the recommended controller but KB+Mouse yields an unpleasant gaming experience.
Negative,Bloodborne 2 Dark Souls Edition
Negative,never follow the crowd blindly
Negative,The multiplayer servers were taken down 3 monthes ago and still no word if they will ever come back.
Negative,Servers down for quite a while now.  Can't recommend.
Negative,Gimmicks and exploits ruin the PVP experience
Negative,"Took multiplayer down in February to fix the servers. Stated it would return with Elden Ring's release. Radio silence since then and they've removed the information for multiplayer. As far as I know, it's not coming back and that's BS."
Negative,Price has since skyrocketed for a dying old game compared to when i had initial bought it years ago it now at base price costs more then what it did again for a old game no right or reason to account for inflation now when u have shit like remastered and fucking eldenring
Negative,"This is my Favorite game, but yet i do not recommend paying such an enormous amount of money for this.i will be adressing gameplay, story as well as multiplayer in this Review.the gameplay on its own is very smooth, definitely the best gameplay you can have out of the entire Souls Series, not only very rewarding, but also very punishing, which forces you to take a deep look into Stats/Builds as well as good Attack combo's.For the Story, it's aswell the best one out of the series (//OPINION) it lacks guidance, which can be a real Problem for people who like simpler games, i recommend to play this only, if you're dedicated enough, or atleast have 1 friend who knows where to go, when to go. There are alot of side quests which are all worth the effort, aswell as 3 Endings.For the Multiplayer, and this is why i do not recommend this game, as soon as you use an ember, which gives you an HP boost so its preferrable to some people, you have no control over the multiplayer anymore, Family share got removed, but recently added again thanks to the massive shitstorm, which does suck in my Opinion, i didnt get it at first as aswell i was banned by a hacker back in 2017, so i bought the game again, and then i realized how the hackers have vanished, now i paid good money for basically nothing.This game does not Provide any gameplay Server's which means it always works via P2P, causing enormous amount of lags, and desync's which is in no way fun to play. at some point people even appear invisible and untouchable for you or the host, which is really frustraiting. Regarding the Hackers, People can just oneshot you outta nowhere, break your entire armour and weapons, and basically completly corrupt your game files, which means, do not enter multiplayer in any means without a save backup. Hackers can get you banned by basically anything.This is what Frustrates me the most about this game, the Multiplayer is not Syncron at all, people kill your from 100 yards away or are invisible and alot of other massive problems thanks to P2P.This game is a nice experience on the story and PVE on its own, but it really sucks comming to any kind of Multiplayer, and is absolutely not worth this amount of money."
Negative,"They turned  off the servers because of some hack, then promised they'd be back up when Elden Ring released.Well, here we are 2 months later, and the multiplayer for DS3 still isn't back online! The single player works, but it takes forever to launch because you have to wait for the log-in attempt to time out, and there is no invasions or pvp. Fuck off and bring those servers back."
Negative,"Can't recommend the game right now as the PC servers have been offline for months.The game is ridiculously fun and addictive, but you gotta put your foot down."
Negative,"Still cannot connect to the Servers, and since they don't use the steam cloud for the savefiles, you would have to start over.If they would offer the ability to get your savefile without the online play, it wouldn't be that bad.But they don't.So here I am, bought the DLC and cannot acces it, because I would have to replaythe game in order to do so. All my progress gone for 3 Months and still no sign that it will ever come back.Only buy it, if you can get it for cheap, it's not worth full price. You have missing multiplayer features andif you have to reinstall your os, your progress will be gone.edit: 22.04.2022 - servers still down."
Negative,im the cemetery of ash
Negative,its goi wanna change my review because 80 FUCKING DOLLAR ????????????????? I bought the game brand new in 2016 and i didn't even pay that price. Like...wtf Fromsoft ????????
Negative,"Not on PC. Never again. Oh god the interface. Did they even load the game up? If they did were there screams of ""OH GOD WHAT HAVE WE DONE? ABORT!"""
Negative,"The games good, its just very aggravating if you don't have a controller, as the game was made for controller so if you plan on playing this game k&m i would not recommend it , otherwise the game is good (obviously the game is difficult its literally dark souls so expect raging as well)"
Negative,"This is not for someone who wants to experience a good story, or combat. If you want combat, get Monster Hunter, if you want good story play the Witcher 3.Combat is overhyped. People only like it because gameplay is hard. Its not good or realistic. Its crap compared to games with comabt with good animations."
Negative,"Lack of ultra wide resolution support. From technical stand point this game is absolute garbage.Bullshit mechanics, have problem? --> enjoy reading wikiBasically spam R1 until it dies. And game just stopped working."
Negative,"I will change this review the minute a patch goes out to fix this, but at the moment I crash every time I approach a bonfire. I also have constant frame drop which make gameplay very annoying even if I could play for more than 5 minutes without the game dying."
Negative,"After six months of waiting, game is back online, but still full of hackers so beware"
Negative,cant sex the fire keeper
Negative,"shit game, delete it."
Negative,No cloud save
Negative,"It's very simple: No servers, no fun"
Negative,This game is the definition of stress. I HATE it! >:(
Negative,"Good....but bought a online game with invasions, got an offline game without,"
Negative,"Recently, hackers started to easily spawn you and put hacked items in your inventory, corrupting your game files.It is extremely frustrating and makes the game almost impossible to play online. You should not buy the game if you are planning to play it online."
Negative,"With no cloud save function, this game is absolutely pointless. God forbid you must reformat a drive, your character is lost for the rest of time. If you spawn back your character the system will read it as cheating and ban you from all normal multiplayer usage. Do not waste your money on this game."
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 is an amazing game!The combat is fluid.The visuals are astonishing.The bosses are awesome.The soundtrack deserves an Emmy award.BUT, I can't reccomend the game as of today (02-05-2016 European calender) because of FromSoftwares stupid, retarded, and dumb anti-cheat system, that have banned thousands of innocent players that aren't even cheating.Otherwise I would give it 9,2/10."
Negative,"Great game, but with the exploit they're trying to fix before re-allowing multiplayer being less than a full line of code, as proven by the Blue Sentinel mod community, and the fact that it has taken them more than 4 months to fix it with no words to the community other than ""it'll come back up after elden ring"" which has already been out for months. At this point, either announce that the servers won't be coming back or fix the thing already; the modding community found a fix within a week. So yeah, if you want to enjoy the game with friends, don't waste your time or money, bandai seems to have decided that no, the community is not worth keeping updated on any progress, or even lack thereof."
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 Is pretty decent, Its an good game, BUT they messed up BADLY, when you can get stunlocked forever by RATS or Players using Longswords (stunlock you can't move whatever you do) And that poise literly does nothing. It ruins the fun of playing a sorcerer you can't cast your spell if you get hit BY ANYTHING, get hit by the weakest enemy in the game, CANCELED. Ruins it for Pyromancy, Sorceries, and Miracles. I really dislike this part of the game, other than that its a pretty decent game. Nothing compared to DS1 or even DS2. It just feels like Bloodborne 2 and not an Dark Souls game. I'm highly disepointed in FromSoftware."
Negative,good game I really enjoyed beating it and having fun with friends. 10/10 would play again
Negative,"no, not ever again"
Negative,Good Game Good PVEGood PVPShitty maintenance RCEWill give negative till it fixed
Negative,It's fun with friends but full of cheating invadersMy soap sign is down...
Negative,"Nearly six months later, and not one sign that From Software will bring back the multiplayer servers. Until they do, or if they ever do, I wouldn't recommend buying it."
Negative,Only 1 femboy
Negative,every time i load up the game i want to fling myself off a bridge
Negative,Bring back online
Negative,"No steam sync is absolutely not acceptable for a game like DS3.After about 30 hours of first time playthrough (Yes it might not be alot for many of you) I lost all my progress after a power outage and this resulted in corrupt game files.The first time feel is what makes these games so special, and starting over aint it.And no, this ISNT my fault whatsoever. Not a single player should go through manually backing up game files just because the developer opted in to not integrating steam cloud sync.The game is GREAT. However Dark Souls as a franchise is literally one of the LAST games on earth that you want to see your progress wiped off by some stupid game crash/power outage etc."
Negative,"Good morning everyone, as you can see I have lost 110 hours of my life and existence that NO ONE will be able to give me back, especially those from From Software/Bandai Namco from whom I was banned in my opinion unfairly. The main reasons are 3: 1. Apparently if your saves get corrupted (as happened to me), you cannot fix this problem in any way, not even by uninstalling the game or trying to use file verification.2. Obviously the game does not tell you how you can fix this problem, and if your game is not in English, you cannot in any way have a warning message or the actual ban message. So until that time you will be in the dark.3. Obviously a normal person should be able to seek recourse to this injustice being that this game full of tryharders but especially CHEATERS as can also be seen from the LIST OF KNIGHTS (Leaderboard of the game) who can do whatever they want undisturbed. Instead people who want to play the game and DLC (just put on discount and bought and especially NOT REFUNDABLE) with their friends for a problem for which I cannot know the reason but can only speculate being that I have never done anything that can be traced back to cheating or exploiting in my very short life.I highly recommend anyone who does not use the game in the LANGUAGE OF THE GODS ENGLISH to change the game language to English right away which will allow you to come to grips with any problems.I hope that this review of mine can help players who have been having problems and who want to face the world of Dark Souls 3.Kind regards and many good things to everyone.ITALIAN PARTBuongiorno a tutti, come potete vedere ho perso 110 ore della mia vita ed esistenza che NESSUNO potrà ridarmi indietro, Soprattutto quelli di From Software/Bandai Namco da cui sono stato bannato a mio avviso ingiustamente. Le motivazioni principali sono 3: 1. A quanto pare se i tuoi salvataggi si corrompono (come è successo a me), non puoi in alcun modo fixare questo problema, nemmeno disinstallando il gioco o cercando di utilizzare la verifica dei file.2. Ovviamente il gioco non ti spiega come poter risolvere questo problema e se il tuo gioco non è in Inglese, non potrete in alcun modo avere un messaggio di avvertimento o il messaggio vero e proprio del ban. Quindi fino a quel momento sarete al oscuro di tutto.3. Ovviamente una persona normale dovrebbe poter chiedere ricorso a questa ingiustizia essendo che questo gioco pieno di tryharder ma soprattutto CHEATER come si può notare anche dal ELENCO DEI CAVALIERI (Leaderboard del gioco) che possono fare quello che vogliono indisturbati invece le persone che voglio giocare il gioco e i DLC (appena messi in sconto e comprati e soprattutto NON RIMBORSABILI) con i propri amici per un problema per cui io non posso conoscere il motivo ma posso solamente ipotizzare essendo che non ho mai fatto niente che sia riconducibile a cheating o exploiting nella mia brevissima vita.Consiglio vivamente a chiunque non utilizzi il gioco nella LINGUA DEGLI DEI cioè L'INGLESE di cambiare subito la lingua di gioco in quella inglese che vi permetterà di venire a conoscenza di eventuali problemi.Spero che questa mia recensione possa aiutare i giocatori che hanno avuto problemi e che si voglio affacciare al mondo di Dark Souls 3.Cordiali Saluti e tante buone cose a tutti."
Negative,"Note: This is not strictly a negative review, but more about not being able to recommend the game.Dark Souls 3 is a hack and slash type of game with character building familiar from role playing games. This game is more difficult than many of it’s peers, but the difficulty is alleviated with frequent checkpoints and the possibility of freely leveling up your character, which requires some grinding, but nothing too much.The game’s strongest point is it’s atmosphere and abstract story that is told in a very shrouded way. Even though the graphics are quite average for an AAA-game, the world with it’s monuments and points of interest are sight to behold. What most pushes you forward in this game is the thrill to see new places and wondering what has happened to the so shrunken world around you. Exploration is possible due to levels that are nonlinear and are very well designed in general. Unfortunately Dark Souls 3’s weakest point is the combat, which is pretty much the core of everything. The whole package consists from two things: leveling up and gearing your character and fighting monsters and bosses. The role playing elements are done fine enough and there are different varieties to gear and arm your character and how to acculumate skill points, but the combat feels often unpolished to the point of frustration.In this game are three combat moves you never want or be able to use: The first is a kick move that needs way too precise timing with pressing two buttons at the same time to pull off. The second one is a dodging move by pressing one button, which is never advisable to use because you’ll just get hit. The third one is a backstabbing move which you perform behind an enemy, but it also requires way too precise movement and aim to be counted on. To add there is a jump you can utilize outside of combat which is horrendous to use, but is gladly almost never needed in the game.So you have three moves you can’t use and then you are left with swift attack, hard attack, blocking and dodge roll. These are all the moves you have in this something over 50 hour game that consist almost entirely from battling monsters. Pretty weak, huh? The dodge roll is what you need the most and will be spamming all the time in every fight you cannot breeze through with one hit, so no variety to be found in the fighting mechanics of this game.The frustraion part comes from enemies’ attacks that visually don’t get you, but you still take damage, and vice versa. Very often with regular enemies and in every boss fight you will encounter many hits that get you even though you clearly dodged them and hits that got you, but no damage is done to you. Maybe even more annoying is the fact when you perform a dodge roll, but it’s interrupted by an enemy hit: After your character rises up and you think you are in control again, then the protagonist does the roll and you usually suffer more damage from this. Sometimes your character won’t block, won’t use an item or won’t roll if you precisely do things in time. It seems you often have to do things a little bit early or a little bit late to make them work. Combat controls should be very tight and precise in a rather difficult game like this, but the case is they are unpolished and somewhat clunky.Then there are some technical issues like the camera blocking your view in some areas and especially with large monsters. If you can’t see anything, you cannot fight properly. The game may rarely crash, bugs occur, it has a framerate cap of 60, it has not many PC specific settings and looks quite outdated for a game released in 2016. The lighting and shadowing are poor and textures are often muddy, what together makes the game look very old sometimes. Tearing is a problem for players who would mitigate it with high refreshrate and don’t want to enable vertical synchronization. Audio is not very crisp or detailed and there is no hint of any good use of echo, positional audio or any clever modern enchantments. You need a controller to have any decent time, because controlling with keyboard and mouse is completely overlooked.In the end I had some memorable moments with this game and I completed it, but I honestly can’t warm-heartedly recommend this game, since the combat is mechanically so limited and has frustating issues what should have been ironed out, but it seems this game was more or less rushed out. The larger audience won’t like this game due to difficulty, but if you are into challenging hack and slash type of combat in a mysterious gray fading world, then you should try this out, hampering gameplay issues and poor techincal execution aside."
Negative,"My cchild logged on to play this game, he entered the Grand Archives and immediately had a seizure. #StopMiyazaki"
Negative,Love dark souls. beat all of them many many times on xbox. first time on pc hacker named Lucifer trolling me and my friend literally teleporting and unkillable. doesnt even block.just tanks all damage and kills you non stop on first level. not a good sign of things to come. im assuming they dont monitor this at all?Still playing because game is good but making a list of hackers they allow to play. assuming it will expand over timeLuciferCute VIGO
Negative,at this point i don't wanna believe that they wont bring back the severs and i think that they aren't cuz elden ring gave them an reason to permanently close the servers
Negative,"""Notice: Online play is currently not available for this product.""1,770 hours didn't come from speedrunning"
Negative,Too Easy. Please add sex thanks.

Negative,"Great game love the series, but I keep losing my characters because there are no cloud saves when I reinstall windows or you get hacked by malcom reynolds and need to delete my save file or else I'll get banned for ""cheating""."
Negative,"Not really worth all the money and time FromSoftware want from you. Music is AWESOME but combat system is clunky AF, some of the enemies have wierd animations, like turning 90 degrees in the middle of attack just because they already locked-on to you and you have no means to escape their attack/grab. Not to mention that they can attack you from behind the walls etc., because part of their weapon warp through it. All the time you fight not only with the enemies but also with the game itself. Kinda bummer."
Negative,"gtx 980, 4690k, low settings 15 fps... would lag again 10/10I updated the driver yesterday, fixed the problem, ran smoothly on max settings, today it lags again.gg wpupdate:On win10 the game works perfectly"
Negative,"In many ways, Dark Souls III is a blatant over-correction of its predecessor, in part for better but mostly for worse. DS2 was an ambitious undertaking that sought to add further depth to the Souls formula, but it ultimately fell apart due to extremely inconsistent areas and bosses (the massive scale didn't help), janky controls, and bewildering design decisions that aggravated the playing experience instead of adding to the difficulty in any meaningful way -- ADP determining estus drinking speed and invincibility frames while rolling, making the Fire Keeper the only way to level up, and so on. While a handful of these issues would stick around, DS3 did fortunately address some of the most egregious problems. However, there is a caveat: FromSoft did this by using their more acclaimed titles -- DS1 and Bloodborne specifically -- as a crutch for the lore and the gameplay respectively. The result is a title that lacks its own identity and often puts players at an unreasonable disadvantage due to mechanics that are ill-suited for the challenges on offer.Before I proceed any further, I want to make one thing abundantly clear: if you want to play Dark Souls III, it has to be for the gameplay. Flawed as that aspect is in its own right, there is still more than enough to it for someone to enjoy the game on that merit primarily. I say this because the story and lore are just about worthless. DS2, for all of its problems, is about as appropriate a sequel as you can get, as it takes the themes of the first installment in a worthwhile direction by emphasizing the undead curse as the central element of its setting's literal and metaphorical degradation. It had some references to DS1 (some egregious ones too, considering the Old Dragonslayer), but they were sparse enough so as to give the mere implication of a cycle, in the sense that Drangleic is either an iteration of Lordran that has become near unrecognizable with the passage of time, or a kingdom built on top of the ones before it. Its ideas did not always work, but the end product was still a respectable shot at something new.The same can not be said of DS3, a work that not only relies heavily on 1, but attempts to justify this by bringing the cyclical nature of the Age of Fire to the forefront, as if the endless NG+ of 1 did not already convey that idea. This redundancy is so ubiquitous that it harms many other important aspects of the game: locations and bosses are often rehashed from 1, if they're not outright recycled (Anor Londo is easily the most insulting case of this pandering), and the same can be said for most of the items, weapons, and armor pieces you will find. Rarely does the game ever explain why all these references are here, and when it does, the justification may well contradict DS1: if linking the First Flame means you stay alive and become a Lord of Cinder, doesn't that completely undermine Gwyn's sacrifice in 1? What about lore elements such as the pygmy lords or Gwyn's firstborn being a dragon sympathizer, both of which lack any real development and come off as nonsensical big twists for shock value? The most absurd incongruities aside, the game comes off as almost entirely devoid of creativity, and even when it does bring new ideas to the table, their intent is to look cool instead of adding to the themes of the series.On the flip side, the gameplay has more than its own share of flaws. In all honestly, DS3 easily has the best control scheme in the trilogy: as good as 1 already was in that regard, it still had some quirks (for one, Jump uses the same button as Roll), and those are absent here. The problem doesn't lie in the controls themselves, but in the fact that they're rarely appropriate for the enemies you face. As an attempt to live up to the Souls series' unfortunate reputation as ""the hardest game franchise ever"", 3 takes a page straight out of Bloodborne and elects to make most of its enemies hit faster and harder than ever before. Yes, you're a little faster than the previous games and you can roll more often, but your movement, your attacks, your weapons, and your spells work in just about the same way, and yet the game prioritizes speed through its challenges. Many builds that were once perfectly viable are now irrelevant: the absence of poise (a couple of frames when attacking with a handful of weapons is practically nothing) and the ability to fast roll with up to 70% equip load highly encourage rolling as your main defensive tool, whereas spells have been nerfed to oblivion so as to balance PvP, not to mention the absurd choice to make pyromancy reliant on Intelligence and Faith. In Dark Souls III, the most important thing to have is high DPS, meaning that weapons such as the Longsword are much more viable than most of your other options. Even if you go for an optimal build, mind you, enemies will still generally hit harder and faster than you can, and they get to have poise too. Add enemy mobs, high aggro ranges, multi-hit combos, and bosses with multiple phases (you can see some of Sekiro's worst boss design habits in Sister Friede's three-phase battle), and you're likely to find a few of these encounters unfair. The game as a whole is still doable, yes, and you can play in co-op quite easily thanks to many quality-of-life improvements to the multiplayer (albeit at the expense of its value as an extension of the setting as with the previous titles), but even if it's still doable, something has to be said for the fact that it leaves so little room for a less experienced player to bridge the gap between their skill and an area or boss' difficulty. Dark Souls, in spite of its advertising, is not that hard, and part of the reason why is that the player has many ways to adjust the difficulty. If they run out of flasks halfway through a section, they can kindle a bonfire to get more; if they can't stay alive long enough to beat a boss, they can level up or upgrade their weapon/armor. As with its predecessor, Dark Souls III further limits the player's ability to tweak the difficulty (to cite one example, you can't upgrade armor anymore), and this becomes aggravating when many of the options that it does offer are clearly inferior to the ""DPS and rolling"" meta. There has always been a gap between the least and most viable builds, but it has never been as wide as it is here. Once again, even if you play according to the meta, you are still generally at a bigger disadvantage than you would be in previous installments. Only a handful of encounters work in harmony with the game mechanics, and that is because their design takes much more from the Souls games than from Bloodborne (Slave Knight Gael, Champion Gundyr, and the Abyss Watchers, incidentally the three best bosses).Dark Souls III is mediocre, but most importantly, it's unnecessary: one can grow to appreciate the gameplay in spite of its flaws, but there is little to appreciate about levels, bosses, and lore that depend so much on a previous installment that they offer no real surprises of which to speak. Dark Souls II definitely had worse low points, but it also had interesting locales and a fair amount of satisfying bosses, some of which stand their own with the best from 1. At its peak, 3 is merely good, and just about everything it does well has been done better in the previous titles. While I have no particular inclination to play 2 or 3 again, I would find much more value in revisiting the former than I would the latter. I can only recommend DS3 to those who are desperate for more Dark Souls and/or interested in the gameplay alone."
Negative,cant ninja nflip
Negative,just got hacked
Negative,"LAG ISSUES (SOUTH EAST ASIA/OCEANIC/AUSTRALIA)Game has poor player experience when trying to play with other people online, if you live in South East Asia, Oceanic, Australia, due to lag and connection problems."
Negative,i hate it
Negative,Liked DS2 SOTFS a lot. This game is nice but there are cheaters everywhere. No way to play online.
Negative,I hate this game
Negative,"whoever made the camera angles in this game deserves to be fucking skinned alived and have every fucking bone in their body broken while being injected with cocaine so they have to experience every agonising second of torture. why the fuck am i looking so far down. why the fuck can i not lock on, but also look up why am i stuck with this shit fucking camera.... uninstalled rage quit broken monster and controller. and let's make kick the worst fucking button combination imaginable... forward and light attack = kick?!?!? stupid ass gooks thought this was a good idea wtf man fuck you and your slitted eyes cunt"
Negative,"I really want to like this game.It's just... not great.In my opinion it's the weakest of the souls series. The game has a lot of things that are designed to be annoying for the sake of difficulty. They're not like cleverly designed, just obnoxious.The game also moves a lot faster than previous souls games. It's so r1 spammy, even compared to the modern Elden Ring. If you haven't played this game, but you've played the others this game might be worth it on sale. If you're wanting a souls experience for the first time I would recommend Dark Souls Remastered or Elden Ring to start. Elden ring is brutally hard too, but the curve builds and the game is a masterpiece. DS1 is just the GOAT. Honestly, I'll probably put another 40 hours or so in this game because I'm mad about it. But it's my least favorite entry by a large margin."
Negative,"juego entero malo no me guardo nada de lo que llevaba, formatie mi pc y perdi todo"
Negative,It was fun while it lasted. GG servers.
Negative,A game I really wanted to enjoy but just couldn't.
Negative,"in the current state, the game is broken, some weapons are just cracked with insane reach and damage, poise system is disabled, and to top it all, many hackers playing which ruins pvp.besides the compaign being great, the online is still in pretty bad shape and fromsoftware is paying no attention whatsoever to correct it."
Negative,Do not buy any of Souls games until they give us back multiplayer. Without it it is just sad empty world not worth wasting your time and money on. Also this can happen to Elden Ring so would stay clear till they fix the issue
Negative,"I love this game and its single player experience is excellent, but let's not mince words here; do not play this game or any other From Software game online unless you are using a console device. I will be saying as much on my reviews of all other games I own from this company, including but not limited to:* Dark Souls Remastered* Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin* Dark Souls III* Elden RingThere has been an RCE (Remote code execution) exploit possible since the release of the Dark Souls games that can have potentially catastrophic effects for PC players. This has allegedly been addressed in private for several years by some parties directly to From Software (still looking for a good source on this one...), and From Software's response has seemingly been to avoid publicly addressing the issue (and apparently, not fixing it as evidenced by a later event) until  it was basically banging on their door as Elden Ring was right around the corner. Elden Ring's PvP servers have come online and remained online without a hitch, in spite of any potential issues that may arise.Even after From Software addresses this issue, this flagrant disregard for the trust of the PC userbase has made me wary of playing the games online. Get it on console. It's not worth losing hours of gameplay progress or having ACTUAL, SERIOUS CHANGES made to your computer.Elden Ring's servers are online, but to my limited understanding the servers of Dark Souls 1 Remastered, 2, and 3 have been down since January 2022. As of May 2022, the Elden Ring servers are online. I do not feel safe playing online on PC. Namely, it is that the other servers are currently down, which was the company's initial response once statements started being made publicly. That they have not been brought back online tells me that the issue either still exists or has been given a bandaid."
Negative,"For starter im a vet of the souls series. started with DS1 on 360 and then got DS2 and DS3 on pc. but the last 2 i got to play online with more work done to the PvP aspectIll be honest i love this game. Not as much as the the first one but i still love it!  I havent had any graphical problems nor have i had any major crashes, for the most part it runs extremly well and looks beautiful!!Graphics-----------------------------------8.5/10Gameplay Offline-----------------------7/10 (I prefer the invading of others, and jolly co-op) Gameplay Online (wo hackers)----9/10 Pc Controls-------------------------------- Work very well!Overall--------------------------------------8.5/10     The hackers ruin the fun for all...HOWEVER being flaged for having invalid data worried me. I was ask to promply remove any invalid data from my pc. I had no idea what was wrong i just got the game so then I unistalled the game completly and and reinstalled again the next day, no saves were kept everything was removed 100%. Well then i got the message as soon as I got on my DSIII again. Started to freak out a little, but then I thought maybe it was a warning that would go away as soon as the next update hit ( after all i did what was ask and removed any and all invalid data from my pc!) I was 100% correct that message disapeared! ALONG WITH MY ABILITY TO PLAY ONLINE.  As of right now there are people that are streaming themselfs hacking DSIII and getting others banned (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3m8yTM_F5Ho&ab_channel=AtreyusNinjaaa) Until fromsoft decides to come and fix this issue of insane hacking and banning of people who dont cheat, you should hold off on the purchase of this game.I will change review when banning/hacking issues have been resolved!"
Negative,"If it wasnt for the constant crashing and abysmal port, this game would be the pinacle of the Dark Souls Trilogy.A good method to prevent crashing, would be to just avoid any bonfires in the game, who needs them anyway?"
Negative,"I don't think I've written a review before, but buyer beware right now for this port.Constant crashing makes the port unplayable.The game seems good, but it's impossible to tell through the crashes.::EDIT for those who are curious about debugging::The following things do not help with crashes on my end:+Setting lighting to low+Character class+Wearing no equipment other than a weaponCrashes in places other than just around bonfires (during second boss fight, for example)My system:GTX770 4gig, latest driversi7-4790k (4.00GHz)16GB ramWindows 10, 64bitNever have had an issue with any other game."

Negative,No fixed multiplayer?CRINGE!
Negative,"The game isn't for everyone, definitely not for me. The only thing the game gave me is a headache."
Negative,"Another AAA game with a shitty launch. Buggy, Crashes.Don't waste your time until issues are resolved. Shame on From Software for allowing this game out."
Negative,FIX THE SHITY BUG!!!
Negative,"Do NOT play this game as of now!A new hack got leaked and this is serious!Just a few minute ago, a friend of mine got invaded in the Tomb of Carthus.I got kicked out of his world, and he was in NG+ at the beginning of the game.This is not acceptable for a so called 'AAA Title'Also, this is just the tip of the iceberg as you have to deal with items being hacked into your inventory, your stats perma-changed. A lot of this exploits can and will get you banned!And Namco doesn't check if you got hacked and revert the ban, meaning once you got banned, you stay banned in Dark Souls 3"
Negative,"if you want to play it by yourself it's fun. but if you play with friends it's unplayable, I don't care what the community says about how it's an integral part of the game it's not fun to be invaded the absolute instant My friend summons me and my other friend.there was 3 of us and every time we have been invaded it's by some prick using late game stuff that makes us unable to damage them we killed 1 out of 8 invaders we dealt with in one play session which was 2 hours.We after failing to kill an invader we spend the next 30 minutes grinding for an ember to TRY playing together again.The game has a joke of a multiplayer system but is a good game and I recommend playing the game just expect this sort of stuff when playing embered online or with friends."
Negative,"This one hurts to admit, but it's been downhill ever since the first one.I've tried playing this four separate times and each time I get bored/annoyed and quit earlier than the last try. Ambushes and tricks have always been a part of this game, but this game has a hard-on for it. Sometimes I can find them, sometimes they screw me over, each one makes me roll my eyes and wears on my patience. Bottom line is, it's not the fun kind of difficulty I've come to expect. This is just tedious. The first Dark Souls challenged and made me want to overcome. The second one I joined the Bell Keepers and PvPed so much I burned out before moving on with the game. This one I've tried again and again, and failed to find a reason to bother continuing.Dark Souls spawned a great genre, and now the newer games are overtaking this series, using the foundation it has laid to innovate and push the idea further. I guess it was inevitable in a way. Just kinda sucks to see..."
Negative,"Neutral. Mechanically it's a mess (poise, roll stamina costs, Carthus Rouge) and PvP is pretty bad (Astora GS rolling attack is not fixed after several months - it's unparriable and counts as a thrust attack). PvE is for the most part pretty good, but I'd pick Dark Souls 1 over it.also holy fuck they finally fixed the softbans"
Negative,"Although the online content is half of the game, fromsoft has no countermeasures against cheaters and does not even punish them. It's the same in ds1, in ds2, and so on in ds3.I can not expect fromsoft to get better. disappointed in them."
Negative,"Dark Souls is not good for PC players... it has console button hints.... I.E ' Press A to open"" ....Sorry but  'A' means turn left on a PC"

Negative,Disabled family sharing OMEGALUL
Negative,"Do NOT buy this game, people are getting banned for false positives due to ""Invalid game data""."
Negative,For an increase the price in RU region. I do not recommend buying this game.
Negative,"From Software are the laziest bunch of pretentious cunts on the face of the Earth. Piss poor PC port. No invasion toggle. No balance. And oh ya, you killed modding! Because you're cunts that can't take someone messing with your toys."
Negative,"New hacks have ruined this game for me, I haven't lost progress but my partner did, unfortunately we were not aware of the new NG+/reset hack, and did not create back up save files. Now their progress is lost, and I hardly even feel like playing because it's such a bummer. Fix it."
Negative,"Bandai Namco just didn't put in any effort to make this game playable on a PC.  Granted I'm still starting in the beginings of the game, but for the price it should have been properly ported over to the PC.  In game commands can only show up as X-box controls, and the key bindings can only be best described as bulky/akward.  There is no way to change the sprint command without affecting other in game actions.  Look it up online, there are forums filled with people asking how to kick, or perform other very basic actions.  It's just stupid simple things that show how much of an afterthought the PC market is to them.  I really wanted to like this game, and might be able to get past some of the issues, but my inital impression is Bandai Namco didn't even try to make this work well on a PC."
Negative,"Online hasn't worked in months and this game has some of the most frustrating moments of any Souls game I've experienced, to the point of not liking the game any more despite it being mostly great.Who knows maybe I wouldn't be as frustrated if I could summon someone for a fight or two, but for now, fuck this game."
Negative,"they removed the online so we buy Elden ring, fuck u fromsoft"
Negative,Suger kuk. Köp det inte. Detta spelet mår kackerlacka o dom som har gjort det har tappat livet i en bajspåse.
Negative,"I'm gonna keep this short. I mostly play Singleplayer. Positive Stuff    looks good    a lot of cool NPCs    nice designed bosses and landscapes    good performance (for me)    great audio design    no blighttown (at least i didn't find it yet) Negative Stuff     NO POISE (which sucks even in singleplayer)    wonky lock-on    insane auto-tracking    getting invaded by some dude who one-shots you with a throwing knife    too short (i didn't run through the game and explored a lot, and it still only took 20hrs)    multiplayer only works if it wants to    no real weapon progression (it takes a long time till you get a significant better weapon)It is a good game, it really is, but it desperatly needs some fixes (especially the piose one). In it's current state i think that the previous Souls-Games are better. So if you want this game, wait until the community fixes it, because i'm not sure if from-soft will do that.I'm gonna adjust this review if something gets fixed.I'm gonna play some DS1 now... Praise the Sun"
Negative,"Got banned for modding. Except i do not Mod the game. Reached out to Bandai Namco as i purchased the game with about 5 friends expecting to play online, as i am online restricted due to false claims. They denied my request claiming i still have modded characters/items etc. This is literally a fresh install of the game, i don't even have save files. I do own Vortex and mod some of my single player games, but DS3 is not even listed under manage on this. I want a refund and if i am not unbanned i will no longer support Bandai Namco. 4 of my friends have refunded the game due to poor service. Shame i love this game, terrible company."
Negative,Where is online?
Negative,Game for ds2 haters who literally can't fight more than 2 enemies at once
Negative,DS1 better fr fr fr no cap on god deadass
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 is a great game, and arguably has the best PVP scene out of the series.However, until FromSoft and Bandai get the servers brought back up I can't recommend this game.Planned obsolescence is the calculated act of making sure the existing version of a product will become dated or useless within a given time frame."
Negative,"Impossible to play in coop, I don't even know why it's in the tags.... More often than not (in our case 4 times out of 5) you will be invaded by someone 5 times more powerful than you are after 3-5 minutes of coop... It's an absolute nightmare, we won't continue playing for at least 3-4 years, when the game will be dead enough so we can play coop without always getting invaded."
Negative,"A game relying on quick reflexes and timing during combat. Users (including me) can confirm there is constant stuttering and the game freezes regularly since the last patch (App Version 1.04.1). This is not how you make a game hard, this is how you make it impossible to play and enjoy."
Negative,Ive played this game through multiple times.-And yes i really hate my Life-Also fuck the dlc
Negative,can't do it.
Negative,good game but they deleted the servers :/
Negative,u cant roll whilst running
Negative,"one of the greatest, elden ring lite"

Negative,"Major security flaw RCE (Remote Code Execution), when you get invaded or playing with random people in general, that is being around for some time and only got patched because it chould potentialy impact  the new release, Elden Ring, as it shares the same networking features. Through it, a hacker chould steal data, take control of your pc and even render it useless."
Negative,"The stuttering makes the game unplayable to me.  FPS drops (60FPS->3FPS->32FPS->60FPS->1FPS) seemingly random, even with a good computer, but very often when an enemy attacks.  Just got killed by two dogs because of them. Nice.  Multiplayer is broken as well."

Negative,"As a huge fan of DS series I enjoyed playing this one too. But I can't recommend it... There are enough positive reviews so I'm gonna focus on the downsides.First of all, If you haven't played any games in the series, obviously start with the first one. DS1 is awesome. If you have already played DS and liked it... then I guess this one is worth a try. Now, in my opinion, overall it is the most boring game in the series. DS3 encorouges players to spam roll and R1s instead of developing clever tactics of stamina usage (DS2 did it far better in my opinion). Level design is surprisingly linear compared to previous games. I don't know whether it's bad or not but DS3 overuses mere-exposure effect (PLING PLING PLONG). Ah, there is also the community... Well, I was lucky to play first 100h without any problems.  But now I am on the shadow server. And I don't know why. So, I guess no more DS3 for me."
Negative,Cheaters ruined online and you can never play with friends.Luckily I've only started a new save but it ruined my friend's first experience! The FIRST invasion was a hacker it's infested with cheaters that will ruined your entire save permanently and probably get you banned on the dark souls 3 servers with hacked items they forced on you.If the first invasion was a cheater i can't imagine how more there are...Why are people getting a broken game when they buy this.I purchased this game at full price and this is what you give me?We need private coop.Please learn from me and my friends experience and save yourself from these problems and go play offline.I'd give this game a bad review if i were you. Obviously they do not care what we want.Sad that you probably can never play with your friends again.... But HEY! At least you can play offline! And that's pretty fun i guess.
Negative,Don't buy if you want to play multiplayer. Looks like they aren't bringing it back. Single player is fun tho
Negative,This game sucks all you do is swing your gay ass sword like a twink
Negative,"No button prompts besides xbox display, I had to download a mod in order to show keyboard. How can you port without the simplest of GUI changes?"
Negative,"It is so fucking bad. do not play this ""Dark Souls"" Play dark souls 1 or 2Darksouls 3 is dogshit"
Negative,"this game should come with controller delivered to pc users.... because all tutorial is written in gibberish, you hve to sipher all controls from what like would mean lb which is like shift plus left mouse i still dont know if its true cuz all hour i been opening menu for controls to try to see what is what, i cant get through tutorial boss thats like 5 mins gameplay that took me 1 hour, how can i return this game? and get funded back?"
Negative,"Good game, but sadly I cannot recommend it. The anti-cheat system is atrocious and hackers can ban you from playing online by just hitting you. The anti-cheat system likely won't be fixed as the previous entries in the series has had similiar problems, and the developer has done little to nothing about it."
Negative,"way too hard for me, also i have the mental capacity of a 5 year old so that could explain it"
Negative,apparently this game is worth $10 for every year its been out
Negative,"DS3 is finely put together, and it's Dark Souls, which itself is enough for most people, and its allright. At the same time, I find DS3 the least interesting and appealing game of the whole series starting from Demons Souls. There are different arguements coming from different groups of people, each one saying their own version of why one DS game is better than all the others.Some say, online. Other say - sheer complexity of level design, yet another group of people will point out boss design (obviously, dudes in amor in DS2 etc).I belong to a group, who likes DS2 the most since, of course, DS1. A part of it has a lot to do with online, which the first one couldn't really provide at the time, and DS2 was much improved at this direction. Lots of armor and weapons, many styles to try and combine - idk, I haven't got through DS3, maybe the later is better in that regard. But somehow the most important for me, classic action/adventure/exploration-kind-of-guy, are locations.And of course DS2 locations weren't really even remotely as complex geometry and verticality -vise compared to what we have in this game, but somehow most of them were memorable and interesting. And here goes the usual Iron Keep counter-arguement. But Forrest of Fallen Giants, Shrine of Almana even the Drangleic Castle and many others - they all had their own feel, distinct look, secrets and a place in lore, that in combination with other aspects made you want to know more about it. And they stuck with you.And DS3 - which is my personal problem, I guess - is mostly a case of ""yet another"". Yet another abondoned city, yet another place where they've disposed of hollowed, yet another cathedral-like building, yet another catacombs etc etc etc.To an extent my problem comes from the visual department too, because most places in the game look dull and grey, and nothing stood out for me in their looks and their feel.On all the other fronts DS3 is basicaly a safe sequel, which mostly gives you more of the same  gameplay. Yep, there are some minor improvements here and there, some little new game mechanics, but there's no real progress, which doesn't help my situation.Each time I struggled to make myself play the game a little more, and I just couldn't bear it for more than an hour and a half at once."
Negative,Most overrated series of all time.  Keyboard/Mouse port is as terrible as usual.
Negative,"i am using a keyboard and a mouse, what's up with all the controller buttons? are you that lazy or are you just discriminating?"
Negative,no steam cloud save - watch out
Negative,The other Darksouls are better. Nothing but PVP arenas.
Negative,"Good game but I can't recommend it to anybody right now as multiplayer has been removed, which is such a big part of the game.  It is a shame as I came back to play this but it feels incomplete without player interactions and jolly cooperation."
Negative,"Dark Souls™ III: Prepare for Impressively Vague Patch Notes and Nonsensical Multiplayer Management!At the rate of how this game has been patching recently, I can't recommend it until it has reached it's final version for a clear verdict of a final and possibly perfect product.Yes, it's a great game and, if you love the previous games, this game is perfect (it hits every note almost perfectly); if you're in it for the single player, then, by all means, get this game!However, it's stupid having friends being banned and then unbanned for things they did not commit to doing and then having friends who are STILL banned for having been harrassed by the actual hackers who, MIND YOU, are still getting away with it! Some of these people are those who contributed to the wiki pages and guides for Dark Souls 3! This is including that all those involved in the production and management of this game still lack the senses to properly inform the audience and customers in relation to these issues. Like... Really? How are they fixing it? Adjust? Adjust what? Look, another innocent got banned, did you adjust for that to happen or did your adjusting do nothing?It is to the point that hackers are getting popular highlight in YouTube now with one of them having live streams - receiving money for having fun and for literally getting other people banned.I will change this review for when the time comes that the developers and publishers get their head straight for multiplayer as it's one of the core aspects of the game but, until then and especially for those coming for the multiplayer... NOT RECOMMENDED."
Negative,"> Be me> Play 100 fun hours with a positive review.> Leave the game feeling good with the time i spent in it, yes including all the retarded pvp shenanagins.  I played the game legit unlike many players i saw with world-size shrek faces and whatnot.> Get back on MANY months later to play with a friend> Game data supposedly invalid, 'online activity impeded'> Can't seem to be able to connect with my friend and play together> Delete all my saves, all game data (including roaming), fresh install> Sorry i guess we saved it on our servers that you're a naughty player> Gee thanks BandaiI think the phrase is something along the lines of; ""Go forth and multiply""?"
Negative,horrible port...all tooltips are still done as if u had a controller which makes things bulky af...so-so game if they had gotten the port right i guess
Negative,Will change rating when they fix multiplayer.
Negative,"Bosses are pretty hard for casual players. Also, it takes forever to go back and fight boss again whenever you die. This game is only for hardcore players"
Negative,It's OK. DLC randomly uninstalls itself.
Negative,"where do i begin?!?!?! NO bed of chaos, NO shrine of amana, NO adapdability, Ashen one drinks estus too fast, Bad Hitboxes.all in all dont buy this game unless because its 300 aed"
Negative,I'm a alpha silverback gorilla surrounded by beta cucks like yourself
Negative,Random flashes upon launching and is unplayable. DO NOT BUY TILL PATCH IS AVAILABLE.
Negative,dog5HIT game that never ever backs up your save to the cloud and wont even accept backups made through steam's propertiesi'll just stick with DS1
Negative,"It's a great game, but this initial release is riddled with technical issues. Wait for a price drop, or an optimization/bugfix patch, or for the inevitable ""All of the Game"" Edition. I'm leaving a negative review in solidarity with the people who got unjustly banned by malfunctioning cheat detection, though I was lucky enough for it to not happen to me.Back up your save files regularly and if you ever encounter a hacker online, alt+F4 out of the game and load your backup immediately."
Negative,This game is a console game that has added a few keyboard controls and mouse support. Its not a lot of fun on a PC
Negative,Game keeps crashing and theres no fix for it
Negative,"The gameplay is great, a step up from Dark Souls 2, but the crashing is a constant issue throughout the game.Always it crashes near bonfires and I'm now at lowest possible settings, still crashing. PVP is impossible if a bonfire is within 20 feet of your character. Also the ""Knight Fix"" is more of a might fix, but it won't solve your problems permanently. I am at the 4th boss fight and bonfires are still crashing it so this is a global bonfire issue. Your only saving grace is that there are so damn few of them that you can easily avoid them.What's got me concerned is Namco's lack of a response, not even an acknoledgement to the problem, so this might be a significant bug which will go unfixed."
Negative,"Dark Souls 1 and Demon's Souls were hard, Dark Souls 3 is pure cheapness to a level that the Turbo Tunnel from Battletoads looks easy. If you like completely unfair crap ranging from fighting hordes to fighting guys who would be good mid-game bosses in the starting area, get yourself sectioned and still avoid this load of tripe. In Dark/Demon's Souls if you were fighting more than 2-3 dudes you screwed up or they all went down in one hit. In DS3 you are either fighting 4-6 dudes who take multiple hits to bring down or guys who would be tricky for late-game characters who were plonked in the first stage. Dark Souls 1 had Black Knights dotted around the early zones, but they weren't mandatory, respawning, and there was only one in the zone. So avoid this big pile of cheap dog crap and just play Dark Souls 1 again or Demon's Souls. They are far FAR better and less full of raw cheapness. There is a difference between difficult and cheap, and DS3 worships cheapness with more fervor than any human could ever muster for their religion."
Negative,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
Negative,"Online doesn't work anymore, which makes some things much more obnoxious than they need to be. A shame too because otherwise I had lots of fun. ""Fun"" of course being dying horribly to lots of scary monsters until, eventually, managing to kill them. Hooray. Sadly I have to give this a negative because of that online bit, which makes leveling up certain covenants a MASSIVE pain in the ass without being able to engage in jolly co-operation. ;_;"
Negative,"I've tried my best to get into it, given it several attempts over a fairly long time-period, but cannot deal with the abomination that is the PC KB+M controls.- There are no PC button prompts, and you have to memorize what ""controller buttons"" map to the ""PC buttons"". Mostly just an annoyance, since there's only 10 buttons or so to remember, not that hard.- The camera is abysmal, there is extreme mouse acceleration, and often times the camera will fling around for no reason.- The 8 directional movement hinders gameplay. If they had any consideration for PC controls, they'd have added an option to use your mouse to orient the character, and have AD strafe.This game needs a strong controller only recommendation, because even though I'm sure it's technically possible to play with KB+M, it's so terribly implemented that it might as well not be there.Even if the game is great, not properly supporting the primary input methods for a platform it's releasing on, is enough to warrant a negative review.Finally, the framerate being locked to 60FPS is another annoyance, but at least it's not 30."
Negative,Just first impressions but is it really that hard to make the tutorials show the keyboard versions and or the playstation controls  because i cant use the xbox controls for shit and having to memorize every control  is pretty annoying to have to do as the first thing in the game
Negative,"Another poor console to PC port. I got the impression this was the better of the three Dark Souls.Playing on PC, with keyboard and mouse... first give away is that default bindings for Dash/Dodge, and Jump... two separate functions... are both bound to the Space bar.Movement with the mouse is actually quite good and fluid, the latency of the game accepting input from mouse buttons and keys pressed though... unacceptable.There's a difference between skill based timing and just poorly coded delays. The code flaws are not twitch friendly.Maybe this is a controller only title... if so, good luck to you. But if you give me an option for greater accuracy to use a mouse and keyboard and screw it up, prepare to be judged on that level.What little combat from low end enemies I encountered, in my limited time.. felt satisfying. I can see why this game is popular. But the first boss... spamming dodge and not actually triggering a dodge roll... stoopid.Two other horribly lazy port qualities. All tutorial/tip prompts are XBox controller based. Press X button to do this... Press A button to do this. The ingame menu is also labelled all with these directions... that's fine on XBox, but you ain't on XBox anymore.Try and quit from gameplay? You've got to go through the settings menu to the last tab to do it... and how does Quit work? Basically like resetting a console... load up logo screens, then the main menu comes up. Anyone that knows anything about games, not code, just games... that's SUPER LAZY.This is a very popular game, and the 3rd one around... yet still they put zero effort into showing some respect for the PC market. Just a shameless dash for cash relying on blind gamer fanboy praise.Other console games have been ported to PC properly... smoothly. Go to the top of the food chain and look at GTAV... console game through and through, and 100% playable on PC with a keyboard and mouse.. AND it plays well. There are quite a few others that have been ported nicely.Dark Souls 3, is not one of those titles. Just like the first two.Maybe this seems excessively harsh for so little time played? Yeah, maybe. But the input response was slow, which makes the combat feel slow, which then makes all the other flaws even more glaring.I for one refuse to support sloppy and/or broken console to PC ports. Like the first two Dark Souls.. Uninstall and ""Hide"" from my library, never to be played again. Too many better games out there on PC."
Negative,game to hard can't get past first boss
Negative,"boring graphics and gameplay, no interesting characters and its too easy for a dark souls game"
Negative,Server shutdown for a week and no response yet. That's disrespect to PC community.
Negative,Network has been off for a while and even now that it's back it keeps going back down.
Negative,At any other time i would absolutely recommend this game but currently there is a problem with rampant hackers invading and forcing items onto your character that will get you banned.Since the game is no longer being worked on/updated the multiplayer portion of the game will be unplayable due to these hackers.
Negative,"By the time DS3 was in development, FromSoft knew that their core audience were the hardcore gamer types, and so DS3 panders to them at the expense of everyone else. The mechanics have been set up in such a way that ""get good and dodge roll to victory"" is the only viable strategy:- Armor is meaningless, as long as you have something in each slot, it doesn't much matter exactly what you have- Poise might as well not exist (it only triggers on very specific heavy attacks)- Sorcery is garbage (so many things are resistant to it)- You can't upgrade armor (not that it would help even if you could)- Shields are almost worthless (you can block 2, maybe 3 attacks with a high-stability shield; you can dodge roll 7 times in a row with default stamina)- Most enemies and bosses come at you with ridiculously long combos, so you have to dodge roll or your guard gets broken- When your guard gets broken (even by kicks to your shield) you can now be riposted for extra humiliation- More enemies and bosses have grab attacks that are less telegraphed and have shorter windups compared to previous games- Many of the grab attacks enemies/bosses come with now involves very long lunging or dashing movements so simply getting out of melee range isn't enough; couple this with the very short windup and these attacks are unnecessarily hard to dodgeIn DS1 and DS2, some strategies were more optimal than others, perhaps, but you always had options. There were multiple viable ways to progress past any given roadblock.DS3 wants you to play it a very specific way, and if you don't want to learn how to dodge roll everything? Screw you.It's not even a terribly creative game because it's loaded front to back with references to the last two games (mostly DS1). And those references aren't creative; as soon as you see one start, you know exactly where it's going.The world design is also extremely linear. The only two times the path branches, the 'main' path will have a wall requiring you to beat the side path first in order to progress. Compare this to the 'hub and spoke' of DS2, or the deeply interconnected world of DS1 - it's another symptom of the designers wanting you to play the game in exactly one intended path.I prefer DS1 over DS2, but they're both good games. I cannot say the same of DS3, and I don't recommend it to anyone, except maybe people who enjoy speedrunning Souls games."
Negative,"Do not purchase this game until the servers are back, the game is not worth it without its online features.The servers are still down after two months of inactivity, proving that Bandai Namco and From Software don't care about the community of players that has supported them for many years."
Negative,A universally loved game...How am I in so much disagreement with almost everything?Have I become mad? Have the world? I feel fine but I look around...How anybody can think this game is good?It's a little disturbing.3/10 - A strange sensation in the air.
Negative,"Played the game for over 400 hours, faithfully never even installed cheat engine, despite ever use it. Got flagged as a hacker despite never hacking, and got banned for no reason while people who shoot pontiffs from a short bow continue to roam free. 10/10 working as intended."
Negative,"Is probably a great game, as is evident by the sheer number of positive reviews. However, this is not made for mouse & keyboard play, at all. Every tooltip in the game is for a controller, and playing this with M&K is an exercise in frustration. Navigating through menus is incredibly counter-intuitive, as pressing enter or spacebar does nothing in menus. Character creation was clunky as hell (cannot use mouse to drag sliders, pressing enter does not confirm your choices, etc.)Great game made incredibly frustrating by 0/10 console to pc port."
Negative,WHY IS THERE NO FORTNITE COLAB????? THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE I CANNOT COMPREHEND THE FACT I CANT PLAY AS SOUL OF CINDER IN FORTNITE 0/10 ADD CHUN LI AS A BOSS
Negative,"A horrible converstion to mouse and keyboard. From combat to menu interface, it is just awfull."
Negative,"Fantastic game, fuck fromsoft though. Took them 8~ months to turn the servers back on when the problem was already solved by some members of the community."
Negative,took me until dancer to realize i wasnt playing the newest mario kart installment
Negative,"The game is amazing, but there's a huge problem. Online servers have been down for half a year on all Dark Souls games."
Negative,"frame rate is terrible and dificult to play with due to trying to render ""fancey"" grahics. could have just stuck with graphics from ds1 or atleast took it easy on the graphics. graphics arnt everything and with playability at a minimum its making for a pretty shitty expierence so far. dont recommend this game unless you have a super high tier extra pricey computer set up."
Negative,"Ive got to say I love the souls series but From has completely abandoned this game for dead. The base game is good and all and playing through it a couple times is fun for a new player, but the longevity of the game pvp or co-op is horribly unbalanced. Its riddled with players who don't want to play the game for fun and only want to win - if that's you go for it. But be ready to use one of only a few types of weapons otherwise you'll end up on the receiving end of stunlock via a dagger that takes 1/4 your health per hit or a straightsword that does about the same. If From ever addresses these exploits id switch this recommendation but until then get it on sale and expect the fun to die with the end of the pve."
Negative,"DARK SOULS III IS AN AMAZING GAME!!! But, there is one glaring issue; about 3-4 days in of relentless grinding, my account recieved an error message stating that I was ""hacking""/""cheating"". Because of this error message, I could not summon anyone, or be summoned into anyone's world. It doesn't end there, however, because even after that my account became corrupt, and I was forced to restart all of my progress. What I am trying to say here is that Dark Souls III is an amazing game; the graphics are stunning, the frame rate is steady, and the gameplay is smooth, but it pains me to say that with issues that force you to restart all of your progress because of ""hackusations"", I cannot recommend this game to anyone(at least until this issue is resolved)."
Negative,"The game was unplayable (even after the patch)...at least for me. HUGE fluctuations in frame rate that averaged an abysmal 24 fps. I got to the first boss (which is amazingly fun by the way), drained half of his health..he switched forms then the frame rate dropped to 2 fps...YES..TWO FPS and crashed. This game is not optimized well for the PC and I cannot recommend buying it unless you have a $2,000 dollar rig or something with dual GPU's. Otherwise, the frame-rate will be worse than consoles. I refunded this game and got on a console instead.  DO NOT BUY."
Negative,Great game but I don't recommend it to bring awareness to as many people as possible. THIS GAME DOES NOT HAVE CLOUD SAVE ENABLED.I lost 20hrs of my progress reaching mid-game only for it to be all wiped out after PC reset because I thought it had cloud save like literally ALL OTHER FROMSOFT TITLES.(PS: Dark souls 2 Scholar of first sin does not have cloud save functionality either.)
Negative,Hell no!!! I can play DS2 SOTFS smoothly but only 4 in DS3 :(Y u do dis BDNC :(
Negative,TL;DR• Don't get this game for PvP.
Negative,Blogiausias game ever aš kada lošes
Negative,"I don't know about the game itself, but this port is so beyond horrible I couldn't bother to troubleshoot for an hour to play it. If you don't have a controller, don't buy this garbage."
Negative,Shit controller support
Negative,i got a doodoo in my butt and i don't know what to do
Negative,"In the current state of crash city I cannot recommend the game. Had to refund it as I crashed every time I got to the first bonfire, no matter what class.Haven't even seen the first boss because of this."
Negative,"Terrible conversion to PC, was designed for console.  They did not adjust the tutorial to to describe proper controls, so you're left figuring that out for yourself.  The controls feel like the clumsy conversion that they are, an afterthought, not a careful design.  The game play is therefore not intuitive.  I purchased both II and III on a bundled deal, both were the same waste of time.  If you're on a console it might be a great game, skip it if you are PC gamer."
Negative,"Crashes between once every 3 hours and once every 5 minutes. Spent 2 weeks trying to figure out why. No one knows, everyone just complains about the issue. I meet all of the Steam Recommended system requirements exactly. If the game didnt crash it'd be a top recommendation."
Negative,"I tried. I really tried to like this game. I've played and beaten Dark Souls 1, 2, and Bloodborne. But this is by far the worst of the Soulsborne games I've played.Updated after many more hours: Made it to final boss and started DLC. Completed Ashes DLC and working on Ringed City. Still a terrible Soulsborne game."
Negative,"Yeah this is one of FromSoft's worsts. You might've heard someone say Ds3 has the best boss fights in the series. Which is undoubtedly true, there's few bosses in any other game that are worth writing home about. What they don't tell you however is that the boss fights are almost all it has going for it. Watch anyone playing this game and you're bound to see them just sprint through the whole area. There might not be a single good area in the whole game. Colors are incredibly sparse, for aesthetic purposes yes but it makes for a very dull experience. I hope you like grey. Nearly every enemy in the game is also like a mini boss for some reason. Imagine if all the enemies in Stormveil Castle were  Crucible Knights but they were still placed like regular enemies.You'd be forgiven for not realizing it if this is your first soulsborne but a disturbing majority of the game is just fanservice. I hope you like going ""oh it's firelink again"" or ""oh it's another shrine handmaiden"" or ""wow there's gwyndolin"" because you'll be having these moments to an annoying degree. Think if every area had its own Patches/Moonlight Greatsword. It's almost thematic how soulless the game feels compared to its predecessors considering the dying state of the world lol.Dark Souls 3 is also railroaded to hell and back. Ds1 has one of the most impressive and interconnected maps of all time, Ds2 was like a 12-pronged fork that you spawn in the middle of, Ds3 is literally a hallway. This is not a world to get lost and explore in, this is a guided tour.Lastly, the multiplayer. Ds3 gets praised a lot for removing the ""jank"" from controlling your character but I actually think it works in the game's detriment, at least for PvP (which is crazy because the PvP scene here is also the most active). You're so incredibly agile that trying to hit someone with any sort of spell or strength weapon is hopeless, and stamina management has become such a non-issue so you'll frequently find people spamming rolls with little to no consequence. PvP in Ds3 is absolute garbage.If you want to play this game, play it after you've played a couple of the other soulsbornes. Definitely DON'T buy this game at full price. Lord help us if they ever force Miyazaki to crank out sequels again, serialization is the bane of all video games."
Negative,Give us bloodborne
Negative,I give up....
Negative,游戏是好游戏但是我们需要云存档We need cloud archiving
Negative,"boring, repetitive gameplay, poor leveling and optimisation, no active players so impossible to progress in key areas. disgusting this is still for sale for full price with no active players. incompetence from support as they actively admit they do not know what they are doing and cannot talk directly with the server team. game is full of NEETs and presumably prison inmates who have nothing to do for years at a time other than grind. grind grind grind. grind grind grind. boring. boring. boring."
Negative,Anyone who gives this game a positive rating is a fanboy with no sense of what a well made game is. The first MAJOR issue is the keybindings. They were made for a controller and there is no ( I MEAN NO) translation of the keys to keyboard. That is just lazy when porting from console to PC.
Negative,I haven't played this game for long but at first glance from the amount of hype it has received it was a huge dissapointment.Not only that but the developers could not be bothered to bind the keys for PC properly or even change the default Xbox keys to actual PC keys. They quite literally ported it by the looks of it without touching a single thing.Would hugely not recommend this game.
Negative,"Broken hitboxes, permanently losing souls built into the game, enemies that spam insane amounts of attacks without any sort of cooldown, can't roll into a run, non-existent storytelling, PvP infested with twinks (low level character, end game weapons), and the worst online latency I have ever seen in a videogame."
Negative,"Game got hacked by a blue sentinel and they damaged my save files, please read more about this here as this exploit can cause permanent damage to your PC: https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/n1235k/potential_pc_security_exploit_spreading/I was having a lot of fun with this game, but would not recommend it with this big of a security issue.  I sincerely hope that nobody else has to experience this and would honestly recommend uninstalling the game preemptively to keep your PC safe."
Negative,"Well, I am a PC gamer and do not own a console which makes playing this game impossible (for me) as there is no way I can figure out how to change the default console controller to keyboard and mouse. Oh sure, you can go into settings and change the key binding, but to save the save changes you need to use a controller...just bizarre.I am completely dumbfounded as to how to get this game to work with a keyboard and mouse and I so wanted to play it. Oh well, as the saying goes ""it's just a game"" so I gather I will request a refund."
Negative,"Blatant hacker problem the Dev is doing nothing about, ruined our game. Would be a good game without that."
Negative,"Amazing game, but fromsoftware fix the damn security risk..."
Negative,stupid fucking game
Negative,Review negative until servers are back
Negative,"The aspect ratio at 1920x1080 is fucked for me, just like the first and second game, making me play at the penultimate resolution, at least on the second game it was eventually fixed, don't even know about the first one, since i used dsfix for that, as soon that is fixed on this game i will at least remove this review.Edit: Played a little less than 2 hour by now, really good game, vastly better start than Dark Souls 2, just a little weird, killed a mini-boss and boss, first 1 hour without dieing, then got killed 4 times by a naked npc with a katana, but it is great."
Negative,"Cheaters will force to put shit in your inventory, you will die and die and die without knowing why, ah also you will have to delete the pg, this game doesnt deserve a good review until it gets a proper anti-cheat.STAY AWAY THIS GAME IS A CHEATER-FEST"
Negative,"It is a great game, but the hackers are out of control.  I have to look at a hacker warning every time I start the game, but nothing gets done about all the cheaters on DS and DS3.  I was recently invaded playing DS3, and as soon as it happened my computer glitched and I immediately started with the same character on new game +.  I had only killed one Lord of Cinder.  Such bs."
Negative,"Couldn't motivate myself to finish this one. It just lacks a certain something that Dark Souls 1 had. The world is almost entirely linear, so you'll largely be left with only one path to follow, which in turn makes it less of an RPG and more of just an action game. The bosses are more annoying - not necessarily harder, the difficulty is about the same, just annoying - than in the first game. An example would be Crystal Sage, who has magic resist through the roof, seemingly only to annoy you for choosing a sorcerer. That's not hard, it just means it takes much longer to grind him down.The quest mechanics are poorly thought out. I'd like to see anyone finish more than maybe one NPC quest playing this blind - the triggers don't make much sense, or are placed so you'll only ever come across them accidentally if not following a guide.This has also lost a certain ""groundedness"" that the first game had. Let me give you an example; if you meet a humanoid enemy with a sword, in the first game he'd likely to have regular sword attacks, maybe some acrobatics. In this one, said enemy might anime-fly into the air and dive at you. Not jump, fly. You cannot, in other words, predict an enemy's attacks by their visual design at all. It sounds like a weird complaint, but the amount of information how an enemy looked communicated in the first was pretty good!Sure the combat is still perfectly fine and all, and the graphics are pretty good, but... I'd not spend money on this, unless desperate for more Dark Souls. Maybe on a steep sale?"
Negative,"600+ hours I really wanted to like dark souls 3.    Sadly as it stands now it has nothing on offer that isn't present in other souls games. Hell, the other souls games pulled much of what Dark Souls 3 does better. It's a shame truly seeing as Dark Souls 3 seems to be a mishmash of improvements from other games put into one: You can use multiple consumables at a time, the menu can be brought in and out of focus to give you a better look at your character, the menu flows and controls smooth as ever and is rather intuitive, you can walk around while doing guestures, and you can cancel the guestures at anytime with a simple roll or backstep. However, where the game succeeds in accessibility and general flow it loses in replayability and balance.     The games balance specifically in terms of pvp is rather lack luster compared to other entries. Many weapons in similar classes have the same or similar movesets with only one or two different movesets being shared in classes. This turns the balance and competitive nature of the game into a simple game of, ""What swings fastest, has the most range, and does the msot damage."" The most comon meta weapons used are as follows: Carthus Curved Sword, Gargoyle Flame Spear, Hollowslayer Greatsword, Yhorm's Great Machete, Astora's Greatsword, and Washing Pole. These are the staple 'meta' weapons mostly due to their consistent ability to deal damage with relatively low skill needed.    ""So what?"" I hear you say. The weapons for pvp aren't balanced, ""I don't play these games for the pvp anyways"" , fair point and while those weapon restrictions might not diminish your enjoyment of the game as a whole, the lack of replayability will. Both Dark Souls 1 and Dark Souls 2 had thought up solutions to the problem of the game getting boring after your first playthrough. Afterall, you keep all your weapons when you go into NG+ and most enemies in the first few NG's don't put up much of a fight. In Dark Souls 1 the solution was the Gravelords, a pvp covenant that would, when triggered, would add red phantom enemies into the players world and a random summon sign of a Gravelord. The player Affected by the covenant would have to kill a Gravelord in order to reset their world. This idea expanded into being the default state of NG's in Dark Souls 2. Enemy Placement would be changed slightly and red phantom variants would appear through the world, not ground breaking but it kept things interesting and the player on their toes.    With the lackluster balance, poor replayability, and From's inability to communicate with their own community. Dark Souls 3 is just a game I can't reasonably recommend to people. If you want an enjoyable pve experience Dark Souls 1 or Bloodborne are your best bet. For an enjoyable and varried pvp experience I'd highly recommend Dark Souls 2 (I have 1000 hours worth of gameplay in Dark Souls 2 if that's an indicator.) If you do wish to buy the game, I'd suggest waiting for a sale of 30 dollars maximum, as that is about how much the game is worth."
Negative,"Beside all the fps drop and the fact that I need to play with a 800x600 resolution in some areas (I don't even got a shitty pc, I can play The Division @720p without any fps issue, so yeah ? wtf ?)This game is just a medley of Dark Souls 1 and 2, simply a nice copy paste of amors, weapons, mobs, areas, movesets...And don't get me wrong I'm a big fan of the souls series (especialy Dark Souls 1 of course...) but this game feels empty in the end, basicaly a Dark Souls (Bloodborne Remix) and that sucks =/I'm sure it's not that hard to understand that I played with weapons / armors for more than 100hours in the first games and I don't necessary want to play with the same weapons and armors in the new game ! ;) (or kill the same bosses / mobs)Oh and btw I really can't recommend it now since the multiplayer coop is kinda broken and well.. I'm sure I'm not the only one with fps issues (I hope...)The End of the mighty Dark Souls serie guys.Praise the sun though !"
Negative,I'd like to say i can thumbs up this game but if i had of known that the whole HUD layout would be console buttons i wouldn't of bothered buying it. As fun as it looks i can't get my head around not being able to change the HUD to Keyboard config. This was a game breaker for me unfortunately not knowing any PC controls and having to continuously check the key binds in settings to try figure it out.. and all game hints being displayed with console controls - and before anyone comments ''just plug in a controller'' I don't actually own a console controller so that isn't an option for me.
Negative,"you know when i look back and think of the disaster batman arkham knight had and then look at this. . . i feel like team behind batman put more effort into optimization and bug fixes on pc port. fromsoft delayed the game 3 weeks what did they do during that time? sit with their thumbs up their asses? did no one test the port before and did no one think maybe there was some work. i see some reviews that say its sad that they will have hit to their reputation due to negative reviews on bad launch and i say they deserve that at this point, if i buy a bike and find out its wheels fall off every 3 minutes and then the guys who sold it say ""oh yeah we forgot to test it, just wait few days we get it right"" that would not be accepted by customers and would leave mark. i hope that due to this hit fromsoft realises they should actually do some work on their games instead of throwing it out as a buggy crashy mess.once this game goes out of its current early access state it currently is in i see if i change my review."
Negative,"I have platinum for DS3 on PS4 so game time for PC is not an accurate representation of my actual experience with the game. Overall it's an okay souls PvE game but the PvP atm is just bad, so bad that I don't think they can fix it even with DLCs and patches because the problem is not specific weapons but the game mechanics. People like to complain about poise (and they're justified most of the time) but the most serious problem is rolls being too cheap. The reason meta weapons all have one or two relatively fast attacks is that it's just much much easier to roll catch and if you can't roll catch you can't do shit in PvP, both in invasions and duels.It's the end of the series, and they fucked up the one thing that'll keep people playing for years, just so some newcomers can have a slightly better PvE experience.10/10 WORKING AS INTENDED."
Negative,lead achievement designer better watch out(good game)
Negative,"This game had so much potential, i was looking forward to it sooo much. And it was quite enjoyable, for the first few days.....After hitting the ""Dancer"" boss the game decided i was no longer allowed to have summons come into my fight. Since then i have had countless attempts at bringing them in but they dont get the option to come through the door.I'm still able to help other people do their fights, but im completely locked out from having help.I could get past the blatant artificial difficulty in some areas, with mobs that basically 1 shot you.But this is too much, they did a patch earlier today to ""balance"" some weapons, where is the patch to fix the fucking awful connectivity so i can play my damn game with my friends?And dont even get me started on the people who cant play the game because it constantly crashes, where is there fix? Nowhere thats where...I'll change my review to positive when these issues are fixed.TLDR: if you plan on playing this game with a friend, dont buy it. you cant."
Negative,"I played through ng+7 and have been playing pvp for the past few weeks when I got the ""invalid data"" message but continued to play thinking they would find out that I wasn't cheating and never have cheated but as of today I ""have been penalized"". Thanks alot bamco."
Negative,"Pvp Explanation: Bug of infinite giant seeds, if you invade all enemies will attack you, and you will fight 2 phantoms, the host, and the world. Like always in dark souls, pvp shit.Pve Explanation: Error 404 Difficult Not Found, only nerft tanks, buff mages to instakill bosses, cant upgrade armors, and cannot do a lot of things that in 1 and 2 yes...So 0."
Negative,"roll spamming (10+ rolls)way too fast estus flask and general gameplaystagger everything. the faster your weapon, the betterit's basically ""rush the enemy and hit him first""10hit+ combos by enemies->no poise, shit pvpmap design might have more shortcuts, still the most linear in terms of game progressionNG+ is pointless, no replayabilityds2 sotfs had the best pvp and I prefer the ""be patient"" gameplay it had.ds1 and bloodborne lovers might like this, ds2 sotfs lovers probably won't."
Negative,"And while it gets along pretty well with dark souls philosophy, it is ruined at every possible aspect Castrated - whole game is just running through a long corridor and fight. No map interactions, no enemy interactions - nothing. Massive downgrade from dark souls 2. It feels like this game is a moneycow so they had to make it safe keeping the ""only important"" thing - the souls formula Map design - not only castrated in terms of features, but also visually. If you don't like color grey then you'll find this game pretty boring  Leveling - it's like elden ring but instead of vigor you level stamina Enemies - I can't stress enough how much this game sucks balls here. Absolutely the gankiest souls game there is,  everything is screaming at you and you can't even run away as many enemies now run faster than you do.  Bosses - Gundyr, Nameless king and soul of cinder. Maybe dragonslayer armor. These are the only actual bossfights you will have. Leader by the number of gimmick bossfights and the rest is basically rng-based.  Weapons - while I really want to say this game made progress at least here - no, fuсk me, all those special weapons with cool alt attacks do dogsh*t damage and you'll spam R2 R1 anyway.I don't know what people like about it. It maybe got faster, but at expense of every feature that previous games had."
Negative,"Mid at best when compared to previous games, first of all the world building is awful, you must teleport from a bonfire to a new zone instead of exploring paths yourself like DS1 and DS2 and it feels like a straight hallway, it even recycles zones from DS1 and somehow made them smaller (don't tell excuses like ""muuuh  eons have passed between ds1 and ds3""), optional zones are small af too except for smouldering lakeBosses that use sword have the same ""slash slash slashy slash"" pattern, good thing Nameless King uses a spear so it's the only boss that uses a weapon and it doesn't feel like a copypasteAll the game is roll roll and roll, pvp is roll roll and roll, it tries to be bloodborne so bad it just can't A massive grind for covenant ring and spells, even if you manage to get 40 items through pvp (tongues and vertebras), and solar medals with co-op you still have to grind 1% 70 items cause the online doesn't work at all with those covenants at all (ig it was more active back in the day, but still no need to put such lower drop rates so low if the item quantity is that high) DLCs are short af for their price, funny how people hate DS2 for enemy placement then painted world of ariandel's wolfs part gets in, the boss is very fun tho, ringed city was a bit better mostly for Gael boss fightI will never get how people say DS3 is the best soul and never will"
Negative,"Update in 2022: Fromsoft has show their true face and opinion on the PC community - aka. shit on us. A gamebreaking bug that players knew the solution to for YEARS has been reported and the servers were taken down until Elden Ring Release, which had the same bug but literally fixed at launch. Now, instead of fixing it for DS1, DS2 and DS3 they left it at online servers.As a Dark Souls fan, i ask you, pirate this game instead of paying for it. Only thing the illegal version didin't have was online, now this official version is literally equal to a illegal copy. Thanks, hackers and more importantly fromsoftware for not fixing your shit game."
Negative,still 2 ez
Negative,ya no tiene multiplayer
Negative,Fromsoft took their servers down to funnel people into their new game. See what becoming a staple in the industry does? Elden ring sucked too.
Negative,Games good bandai can fuck themselves
Negative,This game sucks dick
Negative,Not be nice to noob. I died many times because of other players and the boss and monster and bug. I hate this game and I hate myself
Negative,Shame they had to come up with the fake Dark souls servers issue. This is a great game and it deserves to be played online.
Negative,"this game was so bad i blocked my gf of 3 years after the first boss. next day i called into work and told the manger that the next day i would be robbing the store and when he asked why i said it was because of dark souls 3... when i got to work my manager was dead with a note next to him saying"" dark souls 3 is shit"""
Negative,"You know what kills the joy of playing this game? Trying to play it with friends while online - an invader that has to show his big dick invading Undead Settlement with a Crucifix of the Mad King, bunch of fagass cheaters early game... This is just bullshit. The Game is amazing - the community is a big pile of rotting testicles.For anyone who is planning to play in a jolly cooperation - there are way better titles to do so, the toxicicty of invaders latched onto one position or part of the DS3 world will drive you nuts, you will constantly see 2-3 nicknames repeatedly showing at your game on the same spot and same time. Not everyone has to be good in PvP and the creators didn't do anything to prevent the spoilage of the PvE content - more over they made a penalty point system for trying to avoid invasions via shutting down the game (that includes power shortages and sudden dissconnections) - and gave you one in like 14 hour chance to reset that via the way of white butthole. Perfect system. If you want to enjoy the game as it is - never EVER turn on online mode.You made a claw that lets more people into the game - why not make an item that prevents invasions for those who want to enjoy the game with friends? Would that make it less difficult? Neither for me as a veteran or for my newcommer friends."

Negative,idk does not even compare to dark souls 1 and kinda baddid not receive it for free
Negative,"The game is good, the sever is suck.Too many connection errors, and now I cant see signs, invade or be invaded.Please fix it!"
Negative,$30 for this 7 year old game is absurd.  I got this for 25 bucks 3 years ago!
Negative,"Hackers have taken over online unfortunately, games pretty good alone, but for that I cannot give it a good rating"
Negative,"I've played this game for 5 hours, banging my head against the first boss, I'm clearly doing something fundamentally wrong, and the videos and forums talking about how to beat him obvs hasn't helped. I suck at this game."
Negative,"What really sets this game appart from the other 2 is it's absolutely awful and unispired enemy design. Just about every enemy has mad flailing for attacks and several enemies have animation cancling some of which ignore hitstun completely making the machinics of the game an abitrary mess. Every area is dominated by boring humanoid type enemies that make for huge lack in variety and not a single place sticks out as memorable because of this. On top of that, dozens of assets were reused from the previous games making this simply a rehash of a lot of old content."
Negative,"Cannot recommend this game only because of the stuttering issues. I have a gtx 780 ti graphics card with 32gb of ram and other good components. Anytime I get into a fight or just plain run around, The game stutters really badly (Freezes for 1 second) and then continues on to do it again. I get perfect 60 fps and no other game has done this. This almost makes the game unplayable for me, and is so frustrating because I have looked online for a fix for hours and have tried litterally everything. Garbage port from a console."
Negative,"I cannot recommend this game to anyone who hasn't gotten it yet.... The multiplayer community has lost all of it's honor and fairness. I remember when i first played Dark Souls games, i loved the invasions because they were a test of the skills i had learned during my game, but now there are only 5v1 and tag teamers or hackers. It is sad because i love the series, but i am ashamed that the pvp has gone so bad.  There is a place in the late game where there is an honorable battlearena, but until that there is no point of invading anymore!"
Negative,Got banned from online because my internet went down for a few seconds.Game of the year.
Negative,"The fu.cking servers are down!!! And FromSoftware is doing nothing about it, this cra.p now is no different than a cracked version"
Negative,This game does NOT have Steam cloud support ...just that
Negative,Combat focused on rolling. I don't understand how people ring joy from this.
Negative,Played for 96 hours . After having troubles with my pc i had to format everything for the 3rd time so i had to reinstall it and boom i lost everything. I literally therw 96 hours in the trash . Welcome to dark souls 3 prepare to lose your life ....Cough Cough .... Files
Negative,"Constant stuttering, borderline unplayable.  FPS is fine but the game stutters every few momnets.  Don't buy just yet, wait for a fix.i7-2600K @ 3.4GHzGTX97016GB RAMWindows 10 Pro"
Negative,"A disappointinly linear game with poor balancing, a very short campaign, and watered-down mechanics that promotes running from enemies over fighting them. If you're a long-term fan of the Souls franchise, you could squeeze some enjoyment out of all the shameless fanservice (such as some areas being completely recycled from previous games without it making sense lorewise), but if you're new to the series you should check out Dark Souls 1 (for the worldbuilding) or Dark Souls 2 (for the gameplay) instead.Some important points:-PvP invasions prioritize co-oping players, ruining the experience for both parties.-The Poise system has been removed, making big cool-looking weapons much less useful, especially in PvP.-Item infusions has been split up in a myriad of different types and must be unlocked separately, most of which make the weapons WEAKER overall.-One area is reused three times as separate areas with no changes to layout (Firelink Shrine, Untended Graves and Kiln of the First Flame).-The advanced high-poly rendering shenanigans makes the game run poorly even on high-end machines, especially in multiplayer.-The Ashes of Ariandel DLC is much shorter than the three DLCs made for DS2 with a mere two bosses, and nothing suggests the second will be any better.-The overall game design prioritizes punishing the player over putting up a challenge to overcome, with ambushing enemies lacking sound cues and several areas presenting several new enemies at once so that it's not possible to learn their patterns in a safe environment.-The emphasis on running away makes cheap tactics in PvP matches way too rewarding.I've played around 80 hours of this game but wished I'd stopped at 10."
Negative,"Great singleplayer game, but the multiplayer functionality, at least for cooperative multiplayer, is terrible.A friend and I got this game thinking that it would be an interesting multiplayer game. However, in order to even get multiplayer going, you must first beat the initial boss. Of course, having no prior Dark Souls experience, defeating the first boss took us quite some time, over 2 hours. After we both beat the boss, we figured out where to go so that we may begin attempting multiplayer. Once we were able to set up multiplayer, we quickly found out that when one player is a ""phantom""(Meaning that they have joined another player's session), they cannot interact with the environment much, other than attacking enemies, and that the ""phantom"" leaves the game after death or completion of the level, which means a lot of souls have to be spent in order to keep the ""phantom"" in the game, especially early on.Basically, the ""phantom"" is merely assisting the other player and benefits almost not at all by doing so, making the game quite dull. At least I have another singleplayer game now... I guess.Overall, I only do not recommend this game for those looking for a cooperative multiplayer experience, for those looking for a nice singleplayer game, feel free to ignore this review."
Negative,They disabled family sharing.
Negative,La verdad una poronga. Ni gastes plata en esta pelotudez que se le ocurrio a un japo virgo.
Negative,don't do free levels kids
Negative,i spent my money on a game that as soon as i load into my character it crashes.. ive played 4 hours then it randomly starting happening an its really pissing me off. fix it now
Negative,It's not as good as Dark Souls II and you can't change my mind.
Negative,The laziest port I have ever seen dont bother play at all unless you use an xbox controller.
Negative,"This is one of my all time favorite games, unfortunately their creators are a bunch of dimwitted mongoloids. I, along with a LOT of other people that have never cheated, have been ""penalized"" for cheating and had all of their characters deleted and online capabilities restricted. They don't allow cloud saving on steam and then ban you for their own incompetent systems. GG."
Negative,way to go From / Bandai - giving this game a negative review for the antics you pull - I can understand if you offer no discount for Elden Ring but seriously? DS1 a DECADE old game for 40 bucks? and no discount whatsoever during any Steam sale ever (Bandai or recent one Steam Autumn). At this rate you are beginning to stray into a hated publisher for me. thanks but no thanks. Giving my hard earned dollar to other publishers.
Negative,company could inclyde synchoning saves in steam12 / 10 fuck this game
Negative,"You can't play online anymore which is a big part of the dark souls experience, no sign of when or if the servers will ever be fixed, shame."
Negative,cant play online for some reason please fix
Negative,I dont like it
Negative,Hackers are not banned permanently. After some time u will get unbanned and can cheat once again. Then gen ban again and keep reapeting the cycle.
Negative,game is literally made just to make people suffer
Negative,"Lastest patch (1.04.1) trashed the game, producing random crashes and intesifying freezes and stuttering to the point of being unplayable. This is a widely recognized issue in the Steam DS3 forums and From refuses to do anything to fix this.GG From"
Negative,"Honestly, it's just too jank.  I know it's supposed to be punishing, and that's not my issue.  About 50% of my deaths are due to bad controls and sloppy mechanics.  Imagine: you die to your aim magically dropping off the enemy only to make you lunge off a cliff.  Then get to clear all of the same trash you just cleared for 10 minutes, then you get screwed by something else like arrows that fly through their enemies or firebombs that for some reason throw directly at your own feet and you lose everything.  Sometimes, hours of work lost because of bad implementation.  That, to me, is bad design.  Your time is worth more than this.  I know mine is! Uninstall."
Negative,"The combat system is so annoying and bad... SW Jedi Knight 1 was 300 percent better and more natural.this Playstation camera / movement / engine pissed me so much that I never want to play this again, even though I gave it another try.Yes, it really is impressive / the graphics and the world and so... but this HUGE Playstation movement engine nobody dared to work on for PC is so fucking big disappointment..."
Negative,"This game offers good gameplay, fantastic graphic and interesting story. However, the levels are punishing. Enemies(except low levels) are extremely hard to defeat due to their continuous attacks, high damage output and, sometimes, pin-point accuracy. If you're a casual player and looking for a game to relax, you'll get nothing but rage and frustration from this game."
Negative,"I love this game but I can't recommend it until the game gets patched or something. I've played the first 15 hours with absolutely no issues, bugs, or crashing at all. It ran at a constant 60fps and looked and played lovely. I only started having issues when I reached the second bonfire at the Road of Sacrifice. I literally cannot load there or the game completly crashes. No one has any real fixes for the issue, I've tried them all the possible one that players have come up with. No help from FromSoftware, they don't even seem to have acknowledged this crashing issue that multitudes of people have had. I'd love to continue to ""git gud"" but I can't really progress for fear my game is gonna keep crashing over and over (which could make me banned from online play!!). 10/10 game but 1/10 port"
Negative,"It's ok, but it's not as good as it could have been. If it's your first Souls game, you'll still like it though.The gameplay is much faster paced and the bosses are ridiculously tanky as if it's Bloodborne, not methodical like Dark Souls. Shields are pointless since you can roll 20 times before running out of stamina.Too many poison swamps! The game is too linear, you can choose from two branches every now and then but you can't go too far out of the way. The whole game looks grey, and all the armour looks the same. The bosses are all pretty cool, but not every boss needed phases.There's no build variety since most stuff is locked away in the linear late game, weapon arts are mostly generic, no power stancing, armour and vitality don't matter since poise is non-existent, all the rings barely have any effect, magic is too weak, most covenants are pointless or broken.Co-op with friends is finally easy, but invasions are next to impossible because of infinite rolls, infinite seeds, infinite summons, but only 5 talismans. PvP is still a phantom range lagfest anyway.First DLC is short and meh except the final boss, second DLC is pretty good and has a few great bosses."
Negative,"constant crashing, freezing and stuttering, game simply does not want to be played on a PC"
Negative,"Servers been down for months, no word from Fromsoft either. This game now just feels........Hollow.Probably want to wait to buy."

Negative,"use mods once, never play online again. very cool, go fuck urself"
Negative,"I'm surprised I haven't reviewed Dark Souls III, considering my strong feelings on it. There will be spoilers.TL;DR: Good action-rpg, bad Dark Souls.DS3 is a huge disappointment and a horrible ""Dark Souls"" game. That is not to say that DS3 is a bad game in itself. In fact, it's pretty fun and can offer good challenge, it doesn't have any game-breaking issues, enemy designs are fine, game doesn't suffer from hitbox issues that plagued DS2 nearly as much (though it still does have bad hitboxes in a lot of places). If you are simply looking for a fun action-rpg, then DS3 is a great choice. However, overall gameplay in it barely feels like Dark Souls, and is much closer to Bloodborne.The story in the game is yet another repeat of linking the fire theme. This is pretty funny to me since I still remember how people were very annoyed with the fact that DS2's story was a rehash of the original, with the player being forced to kill 4 great beings, and yet DS3 does more or less the same thing, but everyone was fine with it. The amount of fan pandering and overall fanservice in the game is also off the charts. Half the time playing it I felt like developers were constantly trying to get me to feel something by constantly throwing stuff from the first game at me and saying ""hey hey remember that character / area / covenant / boss"". This can work in a few places, but not when the entire game is like that.Level and world design are a mixed bag. On one hand, level design itself is pretty good. Levels are pretty big and open and offer shortcuts and different challenges, with Cathedral of the Deep probably being one of my favorite levels in the entire series with its level design. However, the world itself is incredibly linear. Unless you try to kill the Dancer of the Boreal Valley first, which is quite a challenge at low levels due to her attacks mostly one-shotting you in the beginning, game progresses in a linear manner. When you hear that you have to kill lords of cinder, you'd imagine that game would probably allow you to choose to fight them in any order you like. However, instead the game forces you to kill Abyss Watchers first, then locks the access to Irithyll until you have done Cathedral of the Deep, and only in Irithyll does it give you a choice of either going after Aldrich or Yhorm first. You might say ""but you just mentioned that you can kill Dancer early and get access to a different area"", however, you can't actually kill the lords of cinder that reside in the castle, since access to the archives is blocked until you kill all the other lords. As the result, your progress through the game is likely to be more or less the same every time, which is horrible for replayability of it. Technically, you can access the Ashes of Ariandel DLC as early as Cathedral of the Deep, but it's considered a late game area and not the ""intended"" way to go. Not to mention that doing DLC doesn't actually progress the main story.The gameplay is where my main issues with DS3 lie. Dark Souls III has the worst build variety of all souls games to date. Dark Souls 1 allowed you to make pretty much any build and, with the exception of a few areas or bosses, it would work. Dark Souls 2 expanded on that by making crossbows and bows much more useful and adding power stance, which further expanded your choices. Dark Souls 3 however has the worst build diversity by far, and developers clearly intended for the player to be a dodge-reliant fast hitting character, with every other build coming with huge tradeoffs. Magic has been nerfed into the ground and is pretty much useless due to requiring mana, which is replenished by the same estus that you use to heal, and due to stronger spells not really being worth it most of the time due to the amount of mana they require. Most people respond to that by saying that magic starts getting better after you increase your intelligence to ~60 or so, but by that point you'll be at more or less halfway point of the game. Magic can be useful as a tool in addition to your melee build, but a pure sorcerer has never felt as weak as it is in here. Bows and Crossbows now come with a limit of 99 arrows / bolts that replenish from your storage at bonfires, which limits your options severely, and the game's overall faster pace makes using them unpractical. You can carry and use different types of ammunition, but it's still worse than it was in the past. The nerfs to poise also make tanking builds impractical and more of a self-imposed challenge. They are not as bad as magic and can be fun and viable at times, but they are completely outclassed by dodge-heavy builds with fast weapons. Blocking attacks, especially from bosses, is also no longer a reliable way of avoiding damage at all. This has been an issue in DS2 as well, but in DS3 shields might as well not exist at all. There are some good additions to gameplay, namely, weapons now have ""weapon arts"", special techniques that can be utilized with specific weapons. For example, daggers allow you to use quickstep, which allow you to quickly move around foes, straight swords can break the opponents guard, katanas can either do a lunging attack or a parry from Iaido stance, etc. These moves also utilize mana bar, so it's not absent for people who don't use magic at all either. I am also not a fan of how embers and leveling up works. When you are embered, you gain additional HP and can summon people / be invaded. This is fine and I like the health reduction mechanic, however, problem is the same as in DS2: you can reach the boss fog and then pop an ember to become human, summon people and go kill the boss without any danger of being invaded. Leveling is annoying because of the same issue DS2 had: game constantly forces you to return to the Firelink Shrine to level up at a specific NPC.The music is also a mixed bag. On one hand, the tracks in the game are very good and much more memorable than the mediocre soundtrack of DS2, which is interesting since it was made by the same person. However, the tracks are also very similar to each other. Most of the tracks are grandiose orchestral pieces with choir singing along. While this is of course an oversimplification and might imply that the soundtrack is bad (which it isn't at all), all I'm saying is that the soundtrack ends up very repetitive. There are some tracks that stand out from the rest, such as Deacons of the Deep, Dancer of the Boreal Valley, Abyss Watchers, but for the most part they are very samey. Each track is not that bad on its own, but when entire game is pretty much nothing but grandiose orchestral performances, it all starts to blur together. In fact, you can open the soundtrack yourself:  , and randomly click in the middle of each song. Chances are, they'll start blurring together really fast, especially songs towards late game. Graphics and style are fine for the most part, I don't have any issues with those.While this review might come off as very negative, this is simply because I'm focusing on how much the game, in my opinion, fails as a Dark Souls I sequel. This doesn't mean that the game itself is bad, but for me personally it was a huge disappointment. DLC is fine if you get the season pass. Ashes of Ariandel is very short and doesn't have much going for it except for the fight against Sister Friede, but Ringed City is pretty good both in terms of length and quality. The gameplay complaints were aimed strictly at the PvE experience with occasional invasions, not at the PvP-focused experience with constant dueling and such."
Negative,worse than 2
Negative,Bring online back you filthy goblins!
Negative,"I don't like this game. Simultaneously linear and non-linear, wandering places is not fun because you get ganked by 18 mutant rat monsters with as much health as a boss."
Negative,"Unplayable at the minimum requirements. Even with all settings low, 1024x720 I got <10fps in the tutorial zone. Crap port to be honest."
Negative,Servers died long ago wont come back
Negative,Servers still down
Negative,"Another disapointing port from a company who doesnt give 2 shits about the minority they neglected for 3 weeks managing to surpass the god aweful port of Dark Souls: Prepare to Die. Being a giant fan of the souls series, this event has sadly not detered me from playing this game, untill further fixes are implemented i have to rate it a 5fps/10"
Negative,"Softbanned for loading clean savegames... You can also be banned for picking up items dropped by other players in pvp. Even worse, the game will not tell you that you are banned if you are not playing in english.Plus, laggy multiplayer."
Negative,Best time i ever had playing with friends pvp other stuff. After sometime playing i got softbanned by cheater forcing items into my eq so i created alt account played there for 800 hours today i wanted to play some ds 3 i noticed i cant play it forces me to steam store i restared steam nothing worked i cheacked checked internet for solvation i found information about ds 3 disabled family sharing so i lost 800hours of my life i cant get it back only option is to spend second time money to buy the game again. This change will kill comunity that is slowly dying and only thing saving it was community  who was making mods PvP improvnets now you cant play without a risk of getting banned on main account.I recomend buying the game for new players but beware ds 3 will be not the same game anymore.I m sorry for my bad english i hope you will forgive me. :p
Negative,"game was pretty good. played back in 2016 on other platform. But you should not spend any money buying this game. Why?Because 8 years old game still with 60$ price tag without steam ""cloud saving"" feature. Basically people like me buys game on steam to have this kind of useful features. But bandai namco & from software decided not to add any steam cloud saving. Because this would cost them some extra bucks. They don't wanna spend a little extra for that feature for players. But they like to keep the price tag at 60$ even after 8 fucking years. Yes with sale they still charges 42$ for a 8 year old game without steam cloud saving feature -_- this is outrageous"
Negative,"game looks like it was made in unity engine with ported assets stretching from dark souls 1 and animations from demon souls (released 2009). everything has this weird greasy look to it making this game look unfinished and gross. the enemies are all two trick ponies that spam attacks and are very easy to kill if you just wait for them to stop sperging (dont worry they fixed this in elden ring so that they just read your inputs lol).level design is boring, ugly with scenes that don't come across as making sense in the slightest. miyazaki has this fetish in ds3 with pasting these rock balls everywhere or making giant cliff faces composed entirely of these objects. if you have played dark souls 1 you have already played this one, there is nowhere in this game you haven't already been besides this one area that actually has a blue sky in it. people who say this game looks good prioritize lighting effects and desaturated unity engine gfx. the game feels like a giant asset dump of unfinished and unreleased graphic designs mashed into a giant conglomerate of random zones and enemies with zero correlation. there is no semblance of a story, nor did they even attempt to create one, there's just random item descriptions with vague concept ideas hence nobody really cares or should. they just put in whatever they could, gave it 60 fps, ported in some assets from earlier games and called it dark souls 3. the fact that people rate this higher than dark souls 2 is beyond me, as they didn't even try to create something new in this or even try to finish the game. this feels like it was made in less than a year and it probably was.gameplay wise the rings are all terrible and provide minor buffs, the weapons are all boring with 3 categories (straight swords, greatswords, halberds) making up 99% of the pvp, with losers offhanding thrusting swords or other roll catching 2 frame attack weapons for maximizing button mashing after doing running attacks for 15 minutes straight. all the armors are useless once again as they don't actually reduce damage at all, nor provide poise (its a useless stat that doesn't do anything at all). you can't invade people unless they have a phantom, the arena is full of min/maxing tards that can't do anything except parry bait, running attack and offhand weapon switching so they're all automatically terrible and you're wasting your time trying to prove your better; its like trying to prove that you're better at fighting against a guy using a shotgun by trying to kill him with a knife, you might actually be better using a knife than he is but he's got a fucking shotgun, you can't really defend against a shotgun with a knife. sure he might slip up and miss after a very long time and you can close in and kill him, but that's entirely dependent on whether he screws up, it's pointless all together and you shouldn't be trying this encounter at all. if you're trying to PVP in this game honestly like it's some honorable duel between two people using greatswords and axes, you're going to run into this comparison very quickly when you realize how easy it is to abuse the hitboxes of certain weapons.the bosses are extremely boring and easy; and the game is really short. all upgrade materials are sparse for some reason and you have to spend hours grinding for a 50 point damage increase. souls are also sparse and lacking, creating some artificial sense of longevity. people that loved this game hated dark souls 2 for the same reason. they just wanted to play the same easy dark souls 1, with some extra goodies created in an art studio after 10 minutes mixed with some random new flashy spells. they didn't want any semblence of a story, they just wanted to r1 r1 straight sword another 10 foot tall lanky guy who spins around, then fight a big fat tard boss that can't turn around in less than 40 seconds. they didn't want new mechanics, interesting story, new animations or new zones. they just wanted to play the same game again; and after bloodborne everyone thought about just how good a new dark souls game would look if they applied a FRACTION of the amount of effort they put into that title. turns out, they literally did apply a FRACTION of the amount of effort into this one, and this is what you get, a game they didn't want to make but were forced to, same as elden ring. the only plus I will give this game is that it lets you cut most of the bullshit and kill the dancer pretty early, allowing you to ""farm"" for upgrade materials pretty early on and not dragging on the game for hours longer.this game is the souls equivalent of a marvel movie: very shallow, looks like dirt shit, isn't attempting to be anything new, was made in less than a year, and is extremely boring and forgettable. this entire game looks the same, feels the same, and is worth a lot less money than its price tag for how short it is. this game was released in 2016 you're paying 60 dollars for this over 6 years later, and that's not even counting the DLC."

Negative,"Multiplayer doesn't work anymore, FromSoft took the servers down because of a bug, instead of fixing it.They've also removed the multiplayer tag from the store page, so it's not likely they'll come back. I like the game but this is lazy and disingenuous, specially since a lot of people enjoyed playing online."
Negative,"Its a fun game a bit rage inducing but still fun. The problem is the co-op in this game, when I put down the co-op mark so my friend can add me to his lobby someone else added me and I was forced to join a cheaters lobby where they glitched out my game where there was a infinite death loop. I eventually got out of the loop and tried to join my friend in a different location but then again someone added me and caused the my game to break and forced me to reinstall the game. As of writing this review I am reinstalling the game but just having something this gamebreaking in the game ruins the experience. Other than that the game is very fun but I cant give it a good review otherwise."
Negative,"Unfortunately, the weakest entry of the three Dark Souls titles.If you are new to the series, and have never had hands on experience with Dark Souls - DS3 will tide you over, as it's a thematically rich experience to journey through.As someone who's followed the series since the Demon's Souls days, and got invested after playing Dark Souls 1, I've watched and experienced the many twists and turns the games have taken over the years, to fulfil the ""What makes Dark Souls"" niche.This is a view that, as a whole, absolutely differs per person - so this will mostly be a summary of the game itself + a few general tidbits.- Mechanics introduced in DS2, got outright murdered in DS3; notably, they have reverted your left hand, back to an offhand akin to DS1. No more power stancing, or 2 movesets at a time by wielding a weapon in each hand.- Invasions/CO-OP is counterintuitive; if you wish to enjoy this game with company, especially assuming that your co-op partner, or 1 person in the group is new to the game, and you plan to escort them through their own, well-paced experience - Good luck. Your world will be bumped into a priority queue for being invaded. People who tend to invade usually have a somewhat decent or solid grasp of the combat mechanics - it doesn't sound terrible at first for the multiple zones you'll encounter this, but soon the tedious nature of it all kicks in. It isn't just one invader. The moment you may get done vanquishing your first guest, 2 more take his place. I understand why this may have been done, but it unfortunately discourages any means of cooperative play, if it's anyones first experience, and they're not down for playing on nightmare difficulty.On the flip side, your incentive for invading can be equally problematic, as you'll usually end up in a world with a host accompanied by 2 or more power houses by default, though the outcome and whether this is a problem, varies depending on who you are. I won't go into what it does to your resources.- It somehow manages to have some of the most bland tilesets of the 3 games.DS2 has some very random tilesets, with little effort made to bring them together, but at the very least, I enjoyed the zone-esque approach of A-to-B-retrieve, that the game went for. DS3 feels like a mesh of snakes, that takes you to a bunch of environements, that are mostly connected via caves, doors and flight, but despite being so vast and relatively lively, it also feels like nothing is going on at the same time, once you've cleared the areas boss, you're done. There's nearly no reason to re-venture the grounds, unless you ignored or couldn't reach an item of sorts. In brief, I didn't feel as if I could care, or be excited about a new area in DS3, the same way DS1 & DS2 managed to pull off with their unique teams.It's a shame they didn't mesh the teams that worked on the first title and DS2/SotFS - an ultimate mish mash of the quality mechanics and feel of DS2, with everything that made Dark Souls hit the good feels with fire in DS1.DS2 highlighted the poor qualities of DS1, and improved them, mechanically. It fell short in the field of atmosphere that DS1 provided, but ultimately ended up being the better playing title.DS3 mostly comes straight out the door from DS1, adds a couple new mechanics, but fosters nothing memorable or useful from DS2 - so you get a very hit or miss title where, if DS1 blew you away, and you want something else similar to it - DS3 may sate your needs.But if you enjoyed both the first, second & additional second title, you may feel the areas in which DS3 lacks, more likely than someone who was heavily in favour of the jank, unintuitive nature of DS1, rubbed and polished in DS3."
Negative,"game is boring as shit and they knew the only way to make it enjoyable is to play a mod co-op with a friend. knowing this they had a sale, waited for it to end, and then disabled family share.now you've got a modded save file with dozens of hours and you were just starting to enjoy the game but uh oh the family share was disabled and the sale ""conveniently"" ended.obvious ploy to get modders (not even cheaters) to buy your game again at full price."
Negative,"I like this game a lot, but I'm leaving a negative review for the recent update preventing library family sharing.Taste my petty revenge!"
Negative,Ban is coolLearn to be ban
Negative,Overpriced at 80 bucks and no cloud saves...But amazing on every other aspect.
Negative,fix your servers.
Negative,"I would have loved this game if my controllers worked for it. I load up game in steam living room mode, start game and contoller not working. I troubleshot this issue for several hours before giving up. Was using DS4 - Playstation 4 controller - xbox controller driversWorks on all other games. Not this one."
Negative,"Not used to negative reviews, but keyboard and mouse is almost impossible to use and the developers didn't even bothered to give instructions for keyboard on screen instructions. Only playable with controller."
Negative,"Bloodborne 2 Dark Souls 3 is an odd title.It sells itself as a souls game, but it doesn't really feel like one, and I think that's my issue with it.The big change to note in Dark Souls 3 from the rest of the franchise is the pacing of the combat. Enemies are fast, faster than they've ever been, sometimes even faster than they were in Bloodborne. The player character has also sped up, but not anywhere near the same degree. It's very noticeable that you're just at a plain disadvantage, and it doesn't feel good.The visual design of the game is rather drab. It feels like they were going for realistic graphics, but everything has a weird plastic appearance to it. There's also some incredibly bad texture work in areas, I'm talking N64 levels,. The game definitely has some truly beautiful displays, but in 8 out of 10 cases it's sort of unpleasant to look at.The sound design suffers too in a similar way. Usually it's fine, and some of boss tracks in particular are stunning, but there are a good number of sound effects that just feel low quality.The level design in the game ranges from good to tragic. The levels are generally ok, and none of it is great, but you'll often find yourself in a situation where you wonder ""Is that a bonfire I see 50 feet from the bonfire I'm standing at?"" and the answer is ""Yes."" The game is sort of just silly with this kind of thing. However, I want to note one big problem I do have with the levels: holes. There are a LOT of holes in which you can see beneath the map. Sometimes things were just placed poorly, other times there something else clearly needed to be placed. Bricks just not fitting together or walls having gaps that shouldn't be there.. There are enough of these instances that you don't have to go looking to notice them.The world interconnectivity is where I start to take a real issue with the levels. There are a couple branching paths here and there, but they block things off with a magic wall, teleport you instead of connecting the world, and spawn a key only when an objective has been met. It's all very lazy and in no way reflects the self-direction of the player that these games are praised for.Dark Souls 3 is a tragic story. It's very clear that it's development was on the backburner while the main focus was on Bloodborne, and it hurts. The lack of polish, even after all the game's post-release patches, is very evident."
Negative,"This game turned me off in 20 minutes. And it is not the gameplay or the looks of the game that turned me off.It's the FACT that you REQUIRE A CONTROLLER to do alot of things in the game. They do not tell you how to do anything except by controller. With the exception of the basic moves, you can't effectively use a keyboard/mouse. Something as simple as a kick cannot be mapped to a keyboard/mouse.It's disappointing that this is nothing more than a bad console port."
Negative,"Control hints are for a controller despite me not having one connected (or owning one for that matter) and menu navigation following some sort of console logic (had to Alt+F4 since how to exit isn't obvious!). This is not a port, they just made the console game run on pc. better get a refund for this!!"

Negative,I have to admire how Dark Souls 3 doesn't have steam cloud support but the original PC release of Dark Souls 1  does.
Negative,The servers should have stayed dead
Negative,The solo play seems fun but if you ever want to have fun with others dont wast money on this.  The online element is worse than trash and unplayable with hackers destroying your experience as i am assuming the developer intended.
Negative,"Could be a good game, if they properly optimized it for pc. Roughly half of the online play I've been in involves at least one player moving without animations,or all of the enemy animations being broken due to online play."
Negative,"very expensive for all the trouble your gona buy yourself , no pc support you even see xbox butons on your display instead of keyboard , no launch options for steam in case they messed up optimizing, resolution problems for some users, and ALOT of issues not mentioned here, over the top FPS / stutering issues in more than half the game / crashes common thing in this game it seems. they braught back there flaws from the earlier game meaning they didnt fix anything nor do they intend to. customer support tells you we take care of the americ/as and canada but will deliver your feedback (2 pages long feedback point by point) and i live in asia :) in the cover zone,,even if i lived on the moon you would be compeled to answer. will not speak of ingame feeling but i as a calm person who already has an earlier product of this developer  was frustrated because of the above and people not doing their job from years back ,one which people pay for.FIX your product. i will certainly not buy anything you make as it sure was a very bad move from my part with Dark souls 3."

Negative,"It's almost 2017 and the game still crashes on PC. I love this game for consoles and have beaten it several times on them, but the port for PC is just pathetic. My game will crash to the point is freezes my entire $1400 computer and I have to force it to restart. I've looked everywhere for a fix but there's no solution in sight. Save your money and don't buy their garbage pc version. Play this beautiful game on a console ( even though consoles are ****)My PC Specs: Intel Core i5 - 6600k 2 x 8 GB RAM DDR4 2400Geforce GTX 1070 1TB SSD"
Negative,"From Software have failed to do something about the hacker problem plagueing this game for so long, and have now disabled steam family sharing, thus now if a hacker forcefully gives you a modded item you will be permanently banned and have no other way to play anymore. Bandai have now destroyed their game with this irresponsible and ridiculous decision"
Negative,"This game is so good and i keep playing it. if you want to know why i give a negative review because of some problems that they didn't fixed in this 5 years and in many aspects not good as previous games.AlsoGraphics has lots of improvement and art design done well.Great music.Bosses looks so cooler.Good side quests.Very nice voice acting.has more than 2 endings.Covenants that really work.Multiplayer is not dead.Dark Firelink shrine which i think is vision of not link the fire is, was good idea.ButGame not optimized well they wrote at least you must have a GTX 750ti to run this game on low graphics on native resolution but on even 720p resolution you can't reach more than 50 fps on most of the areas in other hand left area before lord of cinder that bonfires before ringed city i had 20-30 fps and 30-35 fps on 800.600 resolution...Long boss fights, every boss has 2 phases and some of them in any phase has different HP bar and in a DlC a boss had 3 phase lol. Actually they can be easy but Time is your enemy when the fights take too long you lose your more Control on battle. I hoped they make it hard in other aspect not on time.Magic (pyromancy-sorcery-miracle) is useless in pvp.No soul memory system. sometime you see a guy invade you and kill with dagger in 2 hits...Most of the bosses have more than 5-hit combo if you made a mistake you mostly die.Normal enemies like hollow solider or lotheric knights and .... they looks like have infinite stamina if you receive any damage they keep hitting rapidly.Bonfires are so close or they are so far and kinda impossible for normal players to reach and only experienced players know it is better to speedrun to a far bonfire. Look at second bonfire of ringed city distance to the third.The first thing is that DS3 doesn’t have as many viable builds as many players would like, decreasing the quality of its re-playability significantly, the DLC largely fixed this with many good weapons, but it’s nowhere near as good as DS2 in this particular way. Most of weapons in a same type like the great swords and ultra great swords have same combos.Sometimes i expect they forgot to design this game for dexterity.After passing he lotheric castle any most of normal enemies deals more damage than bosses...No poisoned crossbow trap in chests.DS3 removes Hexes.DS3 adds the worst fashion souls.DS3 ruins magic making it drawn your entire stamina bar.DS3 cast magics so slow in a fast-paced game.DS3 removed blue eye orb and add sinners.Ancient Wyvern was a joke. A massive joke.Repair powder is joke, equipments won't get broken.Toxic works as poison???Old iron demon has a combo that if you get far make a circle of fire and it get closer to him and no way to rolling or passing it without receivnig damage.No Bonfire Ascetics.Blue Sentinels and Blades of the Darkmoon doing the same and counting towards the same rewards.And something may be Good or BadFast-paced gameplay, now everything happen faster like rolling, sword play and ectIf i wanted to choose i liked DS2 physics or Lords of the fallen i'm not good too much in fast-paced games but you might like this depends on you...Overall: 8/10"
Negative,"This is like the normiefied version of dark souls mixed with a little of bloodborne. Kinda shit, but also kinda fun, but still shit."
Negative,"Random crashes and huge FPS drops/freezing up when picking up items and autosaving.I have a GTX 970, so my PC is not the problem."
Negative,"Decent game enjoyed the campaign, make sure you go the correct build. Multiplayers gobshite and the devolopers have a cocky attitude and trope of fanboys to back them up to sort it out. Buggy, Laggy and full of wankers. Dark souls 3 EveryoneP.S I have beaten it."
Negative,"While I would normally recommend this game, the fact that it seems like online play is going to stay disabled forever deters me from straight up recommending it. It is still a fun game, but without summons or PvP, forgive my language but it's a bit hollow. Such a same to see FromSoft's work squandered."
Negative,"Good game. Sadly ruined for people like me who get motion sickness from narrow field of view. There is no option to change it either and they ban people for using mods to fix graphical errors or adjust cameras. I keep playing it because I like the game itself but the narrow field of view keeps making me motion sick and give me headaches. Really makes it hard to give this game a recommend when I know there are people who will not even be able to play it because of the very narrow field of view. It was made for a tv, they never adjusted it for a PC, I don't think the devs even know how to do it. Next time just put in a field of view option, seriously, how hard can it be in this modern day of pc gaming."
Negative,"Stun lock.The poise system from previous Dark Souls games is completely gone. Instead, your ""poise"" is a bonus added to your hyperarmor frames, as I understand it. Meaning a heavy armoured knight is as easy to knock down as any priest.They tried to make bosses way more epic than previous games by giving them huge combos; Gael, Friede, and Soul of Cinder. Now they have these unnatural stamina requirements to either evade or block their relentless attacks. NPC enemies are compensated for their abhorrent PVP AI with massive health bars and damage output, even to the point that some NPCs do more damage than final bosses."
Negative,Will definatly be changing this to a thumbs up as soon as they can fix the crashes. System meets or exceedes all recommended settings and crashing about every 2-3 minutes. I cant even get thru the first area since as soon as I spend any time near a bonfire I CTD. So for right now go back to DS2 and enjoy that while they work this out. I am hoping they will have it fixed by the weekend so I can get some good time in but tired of banging my head against a wall from a silly bug.
Negative,Minimum is currently incorrect i have a gtx 960 and i3 4150 and with everthing on low or off I can get 60fps 10% of the time mostly at 50-55fps but some areas are somehow worse than 30fps. Not well optimized at all PLEASE WAIT unless you have monster rig this game will eat your computer up!!
Negative,The game's anti-cheat system is allowing hackers to get other players banned.Avoid purchasing this game until the problem is fixed.
Negative,No servers :)))
Negative,Don't buy it for PvP unless you think you're good enough to do 3v1s.P.S. Rapiers are fucking shit.
Negative,"No 21:9, no g-sync, and 60fps cap....... This game feels worse than a Microsoft UWP gameI think we are living in 2016........ aren't we?"
Negative,"Ive been playing this game for a while, enjoying the pve and pvp. But all of a sudden it says i've been penalized, I don't know why and I dont know how to fix it."
Negative,You are better off with DS1 or DS2. This game's PVP is pretty lackluster and magic is very weak.
Negative,"nearly a week without multiplayer servers, will keep this review negative until this is fixedotherwise, the game is fantastic."
Negative,"I love FromSoft games, I also love this one. However, at this point the game at low level is 'get invaded by BMing griever, die, repeat.'. So, unless you want to just run solo as a hollow or run with no internet. I dont waste your money. The good news is a lot of this cant happen in Elden Ring. yay."
Negative,"I've bounced back and forth with this game for a bit where sometimes I hate it and other times I just like it. When my character is new sometimes the new start can be fun but I am very quickly reminded how tedious this game can be. The vast majority of the enemies are not challenging but rather an annoyance. It starts to feel like they are just there to slow you down rather than being a fun fight. I've gotten really tired of running through the same areas in souls games. I'm tired of Poisoned swamps, of reused characters, or art assets being copy pasted it's just getting boring guys. None of the enviorments feel fresh to me, it just feels like a big ol copy of the previous souls games and that isn't fun.Add onto that the people who are getting flagged for cheating without good reason as well as the crashes that people keep experiencing and I have a very hard time recommending this game. I try to think ""What in this would justify the price?"" and I can't think of anything.Granted as I say that i've noticed that i'm at 108 hours already with the game not even being out for two weeks. One would think that would mean the game is enjoyable. To a certain extent it is but usually i've treated the game as a background thing, something to do with my hands while I listen to a podcast or something. When I sit there without something something else going on I am bored out of my mind. Same thing with Civilization when I don't have something else going.In brief , the game is kind of boring, it is not anywhere near as hard as people make it out to be if you have a good shield, the art is lazy, the locations are boring, the anti-cheat is banning people without reason, the magic is pretty damn weak ( save for pyromancy) and it's just more of the same. So I guess if you really want more dark souls there is that. If I hadn't had a friend  buy it for me I think I would be a lot angrier than I am now.Oh I almost forgot, the pope outfit is a saving grace in this game."
Negative,"I tried... I truly did, but I just don't get it.How did this game become a genre unto itself - ""Souls-like"" - whooooo!No - I'll pass.While this game has its charms, gameplay-wise, I personally wouldn't rank it over the likes of The Reckoning - which was, to me, more enjoyable, and possessed more fluid and accurate combat system. I get it, some people like to die a lot in the games they play - and that too has its charm. But for me, lifetime gamer, understanding that the point of the game is to kill you easily, I look for, and only think of, timing. I, myself, probably didn't die as much as most (truthfully, I didn't die once, not even at the first Boss). But what I did experience was lethargy.With an open-world, story-rich, character building experience like The Witcher 3 out there, I fail to understand what made this worthy of its own moniker, ""Souls-like"".... For me, The Witcher 3 set a bar far more worthy than this glorified dungeon crawler.Apologies: I understand how loyalists take it personal when their fav is critiqued harshly; but this title is not - I REPEAT - IS NOT the 'creme-de-la-creme':The graphics aren't polished enough (especially for such an acclaimed and AAA-priced title)It feels lethargic and desolate (because the world feels empty somehow)The movement is clunky-feeling, and the program's desire to control the camera adds to that clumsiness (and this auto-reset feature [that you cannot disable, btw] I surmise was a component they kept in order to make it ""difficult""....smh).The menu navigation is old-school and also is not fluid, and....I can go on, but I won't. Bottom line: For me, this was not immersive, it only made me sleepy; it was not difficult (just always be ready to feint an attack, before whatever enemy goes into a 3 strike attack, then hit); the camera controls suck; the character controls are stiff and goofy..... It was just a huge disappointment.Amalur: The ReckoningWitcher 3Skyrim, and others have this game beat by a long shot and are far more worthy of their own 'Tag'.(""Souls-like"" - gimme a break.)EDIT: (I don't know why my hours aren't updating... anyhow....) One last mention: Horizon Zero Dawn.... What a beautiful and immersive experience! While it doesn't bring anything new to the genre per se, it does incorporate all the best elements of an RPG decently well, and also manages to remain captivating, in both lure and visuals. Though DS may have an alright lure, journeying through its ""boards"" feel very desolate. Anyway just wanted to recognize another TRULY OPEN WORLD game who's polishing far exceeds that of the DS ilk.... Now... it's time for a refund."
Negative,this game was really good and fun up until it stopped launching on steam for me.  steam doe not want to fix there stuff.
Negative,its not garfeild karts its the badest game aver 1/5
Negative,fix your motherfucker servers.
Negative,"Yall need to do better about these hackers, crazy its been 3 whole days!"
Negative,"Dark Souls III has to be my favorite game of all time. That being said I hate to give it a negative review. Currently on steam I refuse to review this game positively. After less than 50 hours total I have encountered at least 15 or 20 so hackers, I wish I were exaggerating. I hate to see the game in this state but it is close to unplayable. I guess the only real reason to buy this on steam is either for mods or if you don't have a console."
Negative,"If you don't have an amazing PC and internet connect, trust me, don't even bother playing online. The lag and frame rate loss can be unbelievably awful even in the single player if you only meet the minimum system requirements. sometimes you and enemies will trade blows from 20 feet away which is always hilarious. Combat on the whole is much more twichy and frantic than DS1, hit boxes are still as awful as they've always been though. So between the awful hitboxes and awful lag it's anyones guess whether that attack that looked like it missed will actually.If you own a super computer, knock yourself out, if you don't, not worth even trying"
Negative,"45 hours played and most the way through the Tombs of Carthus on my play through, some hacker invades and wipes my Save into New Game+ and now all my progress is lost.Looking on various Reddit posts this is something that can happen and folks recommend a 3rd party mod, FROMSOFT you need to patch your game.https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/n1235k/potential_pc_security_exploit_spreading/Other than my Save history being deleted, I love this game. But for now I wouldn't bother buying or playing it until (if) it's fixed."
Negative,"Pros:-Clean looking, a step forward from previous games-Movement, controls and fighting hold great accuracy-A few bosses hold great difficulty-""off da railz"" feeling compared to previous DS games-Artwork is VERY impressive.Cons:-Developer neglect on many, many issues; primarily nondescript operations.-Lack of ""built-in"" lore-Immersion was lacking for me.  NPCs and enemies felt empty and unmemorable (outside of a few bosses)-Stats system not fully functional-You might as well run around naked; armor system is lacking-""Co-op"" system shoddy at best-Factions unmemorable and lacking in impact.  Invaders get a huge advantage 90% of the time.-Reused areas that offered no real value to the lore-In my opinion, this was the weakest DS game even compared to demon souls.  Difficulty was not on par with expectations on the non pvp side.  -Hackers are rampant and bypass any detection, ruining gameplay.  Non-hackers get bans, thinning the pool increasing chances of getting invaded by a hacker.  Conclusion: The game felt like a series of mini games to me.  In prior games, areas were truly defining, immersive and memorable.  Most bosses felt like empty player checks.  The game does provide a certain level of difficulty, but not at the same level as prior games.  I would only recommend this game to someone who has not played the previous games or just can't stay away from the DS series."
Negative,"Have never played this game and bought it to play with my partner. Turns out the servers are down, no LAN play or anything so it will just be sitting in my library. Please let me know if the multiplayer ever comes back. Not recommending simply because the reason I got this game, I'm unable to do."
Negative,GAME HAS AN EXPLOIT THAT LETS MALICIOUS PEOPLE GET IN YOUR COMPUTER WITH MULTIPLAYER!DO NOT USE MULTIPLAYER UNTIL THERE IS A PATCH THAT FIXES IT.I will change my review when it is fixed. Thank you and be aware!
Negative,"Screw fan boys, a ""Hard Game"" does not equal a good game. If you make content you release to the masses is based on the premise, that the customer must have participated in the past content, you have failed. This fact is true with every medium... Comic books, Movies and Video Games. Never played Dark Souls one or two, thus making a steep learning curve right off the bat. This game would be fantastic if I was a die hard fan boy who enjoyed their past games. But unfortunately I am a new player, no rose color glasses, no ambition to complete a came that could care less about communicating. If you are a fan, this is your game. if you are new to the series, best to stay away and spend the money on something else."
Negative,"im not having fun.i never was.im dissapointed with this game. darksouls1 and 2 were fun but 3? no. i never feel like ive progressed, the map flow is terrable, you cant upgrade armor so you are spongey no matter what, the combat feels jagged and forced, getting souls to level up is always a hassle because nothing wants to drop over 1000 and its never worth the effort, the controls are unresponsive more often than any other souls game and sometimes just go off on their own doing things without your imput the new focus points system needs some major tweaking, the pvp is worse than ever now EVERY hit is a delayed hit, the effects of your stats are garbage especally scaling so you never do enough damage to reliably take down foes in your leveled area, ive encountered NO memorable characters or bosses unique to this game, they tore the story to pieced, and no matter how har i try i just cant get into the game. i said if darksouls3 had these problems i would be done with fromsoft and here we are so im done. darksouls4,bloodborn2,deamon's souls2 i dont care what they call it im not buying it. unless they make some major changes with the coming patches and dlc."
Negative,Fix the servers and you'll get a thumbs up
Negative,"Couldn't suck Sister Friede's toes mid-fight, the worst greatest game."
Negative,worth buying when servers are fixed from an issue that the community fixed in like two weeks lol
Negative,Not a game for me.
Negative,I ran into a brazilian online
Negative,"Its a great game, honestly most of the bosses are fun, and the areas are a lot of fun to exploreHowever, the community... Jesus christ, the community might be one of the most toxic communities I've ever experienced in my life. That's why I'm giving it a thumbs down. Cus of the community. Its crazy how toxic they are, I asked for help on a boss, and they recommended me parrying, I've never used a shield and I said I can't do that, after trying to do so, then they made me feel like a clown because I'm not listening to their advice, while their advice does nothing."
Negative,"The enemies just spam attacks... again! you'll win against a boss if you play enough but it won't be skill; it'll be luck! The last hit determines whether you win or not, which depends on whetherthe boss will spam his attacks insistently.... I'm looking at you Pontiff!"
Negative,"Unspeakably unoptimized. Game is effectively unplayable on minimum settings, although this computer is perfectly capable of running DSII on max. Somehow they STILL haven't figured out how to include PC icons instead of Xbox button in the UI.Shame on me for expecting FROM to have figured out how to port a game by now. Third time clearly was not the charm.Now I guess I'll just have to wait for a community patch to make the game playable, just like the last two."
Negative,bring back multiplayer.
Negative,"poorly ported for PC, all instructions are for a controller, and the menu does have all actions for rebinding"
Negative,A dark souls game without multiplayer? It feels like half the game is missing.
Negative,SERVERS FUCKING DOWN! FIX THIS SHITSHOW NOW!
Negative,its okay !
Negative,"DONT BUY if you want to play multiplayer its fucking shit, you need some gemstones, and some ambers, multiplayer is 1/10"
Negative,"Got all of the achievements, used to be a huge Soulsbrone fan. Soulsborne is overrated in 2021. Community isn't that great nor alive. It's still fun if you like a challenge, but just because you like soulsborne games doesn't make you a hotshot"
Negative,"Very negative review. The game is currently unplayable online.I was hoping that the latest update would save Dark Souls 3 on PC, unfortunately this is not the case because I only play with lagging players, Why? PvP is no fun because my opponents now all have 500+ms lag relative to me, it is impossible to win against an opponent who has mastered the ""ultra instinct"". My punch has no right to touch the opponent when he is dealing damage from the other end of the map, after all it is no different from cheating. And there is no crappy internet because I relative to a summoned friend have a ping of 50+ms. Can't you add a system to the game that doesn't allow you to play with people who have a ping greater than 200ms? Blocking individual players completely doesn't work because I have the impression that I would have to block all players from other continents and that's not an option.Bardzo negatywna ocena. Gra obecnie jest nie grywalna po sieci.Miałem nadzieje że ostatnia aktualizacja uratuje Dark Souls 3 na PC, niestety tak nie jest bo gram tylko z lagującymi graczami, Dlaczego? PvP nie stanowi żadnej przyjemności bo moi wszyscy przeciwnicy teraz mają względem mnie 500+ms opóźnienia, nie da się wygrać z przeciwnikiem który opanował ""ultra instinct"". Mój cios niema prawa dotknąć oponenta kiedy on zadaje obrażenia z drugiego końca mapy, przecież niczym to się nie różni od oszukiwania. I nie niema gównianego Internetu bo ja względem przyzwanego przyjaciela mam ping 50+ms. Nie można dodać do gry systemu który nie pozwala grać z osobami mającymi ping większy niż 200ms?? Blokowanie poszczególnych graczy kompletnie nie działa bo mam wrażenie że musiał bym zblokować wszystkich graczy z innych kontynentów a to nie jest wyjście."
Negative,"If you like Dark souls then this is still better than Dark souls 2 (especially for PC/without a controller). The UI isn't bad either. It's also very beautiful.So, the reason I don't recommend this is that it's a complete mess as it is.People are getting soft banned for absolutely nothing or things they can't even help (like getting invaded by a hacker). There is no poise implemented even though there should be (if you are familiar, you know, if not, it's like a stagger resistance), enemies on the other hand have plenty of poise.Speaking of the devils; The biggest problem is that all enemies have unlimited stamina/Focus points (mana), so they can bomb you with special attacks and spells all day long. Add to this that the game is more blood bourne-like in that enemies hit VERY hard and the forementioned poise bug. In other words enemies can ""turtle"" behind their great tower shields all day (unlimited stamina/hyper stamina regen).Dark souls is known for being extremly hard but a dedicated player-base usually call it ""fair"". This does not hold true for this game. The Dark souls series (like many games) has always suffered from ""artifical difficulty"" but never has it been so prominent as in this. They have quite literally given every gameplay advantage to NPCs and stripped players of the few scraps that made the game playable. In all a very beautiful game BUT when gameplay is your biggest selling point in a game you can't afford to fail as hard as Fromsoft has. If they fix the MANY issues with the game it could be a decent note to end the series with. If not; It's a sad and sloppy way to say goodbye to a very dedicated fan-base."
Negative,"I don't want to play it anymore.I just can't.Not only because it's perfomance is just ass, but also because...It's a dissapointment shit.I'm a huge Souls nut and i've waited for this sequel.I love DS2 so much, hell, it's my favourite in Dark series (And probably Souls series, but not SoulsBorne because i haven't played BB).And what did i get in DS3?A huge step back and a huge mark of Miyazaki.This game is just complete reusing of everything that was before WITHOUT improvements and new good stuff from DS2 and WITH a lot of retkons and stupid shit.But most of all, it just not fun to play anymore.Especially considering bosses.Almost none of them bring any challenge at all, and they're just so boring in themself.Weapon arts is an interesting idea that was implemented like shit as an afterthought.All new rings are G A R B A G E that doesn't work. Hell, even old rings stopped working properly. (RIP Flynn)And what can i say about good 'ol From patches that ruin e v e r y t h i n g?*sigh*I hate this game.I hate Miyazaki for being a dick.And i'm just dissapointed.Hell, Salt and Sanctuary, being a shameless ripoff of fist DS, was much better than this game.It's just sad.To hell with you, Dark Souls.Let's just hope that Nioh will be a new frontier.p.s.Though, i must admit, Dark Souls 3 is probably the prettiest and the most beautiful and best visual design wise game in the series, right after Demon's (again, i haven't played Bloodborne)p.p.sI haven't said anything about pvp because EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT THAT ALREADY, i don't have to repeat that again."
Negative,This game does not have my Consent!
Negative,this shit is overrated trash
Negative,Good game overall. Not my first Souls game but first one played on the PC.My biggest issues have to be that the game is pretty tough to play with a mouse and keyboard. Pretty much required to have a controller to play.The other is how the whole hacking/banning stuff is being handled. I've read more than enough stories to make me worried. Essentially it comes down to even if you aren't the one hacking but pick up a weapon from a hacker or get hit with a weapon from them (which gives you souls) you will be the one banned. That makes complete sense.If you are playing offline obviously that wont be an issue but that's no fun.
Negative,This game is garbage
Negative,i am bad at this game so it sucks.
Negative,lost all my characters bruh fml
Negative,Armor management is awful in comparison to previous games.
Negative,"Bloodborne engine with armors and fanservice is Dark Souls 3. The PvE is very good, and I recommend you to buy it if you enjoy the series and want to play alone or with friends, but it's not my favorite part of the series. The PvP is the worst of the DS series and full of glitch abusers, makes me miss DS1 lagstabs. With this game I was a refugee from DS1 and 2 PvP, looking for enjoyment that i'll never get again."
Negative,"I am a huge fan of the series and they are truly epic games. With The Ringed City DLC right around the corner, From Software claiming it to be the last addition to the souls series, I thought I'd let curious people know what they're getting into. Everyone else can review how awesome souls games are, Im just going to talk about performance. DS3 does not perform well. Go on over to the Technical Support page and you will see over 5000 unanswered comments in regards to performance issues and other problems. Dating from release to today (March 25th). In response, the Developer posted the minimum and recommended system specs. You can submit additional information to the customer support team. However that was posted nearly a year ago now at launch and the performance issues have not been improved on.Additionally, the patch for the upcoming dlc has created a random bug that will generate a text pop up and boot you to the main menu. My specs are i5-4590 3.30GHz 8GB RAM GTX 970 Windows 10 64 bit. I cannot run this at 1080p/60fps ANYWHERE in game. If you have similar specs, expect to play between 40-60fps in the more optimized areas. Inb4 the nay-sayers, Believe me, I have tried it all to improve my experience.I hope this helps you make an informed decision on whether or not this game will run to your expectations. I love it, but I cannot recommend it based on the performance. Thanks for reading."
Negative,bought for multiplayer. multiplayer down
Negative,Great game but be wary of purchase until the devs fix the RCE exploit currently in all the dark souls titles.
Negative,Tips and menus for controller buttons? Really? Non-pc friendly.
Negative,"After playing most every souls game, I have come to a conclusion.This is the worst one.There is next to no challenege in this game. it holds your hand throughout the entire game, and gives you easy and uncreative bosses. They have, and i hate to say it, dumbed down the game for more casual players. Even DaSII is better due to its amazing NG+ experaince, with different weapons and spells to get, and RED PHANTOMS. DaS is by far still the best game in the series due to its unapologetic difficulty and not giving you a free fucking boss victory (minus ceaseless, and Im looking at you Yhorm). All in all, dont buy this game unless you are a souls fanatic like I am, then realize the older games are so much betterBuy DaS I instead its so much better"
Negative,"Sadly, this game is bad; do not listen to the soul fanatics. All Souls games, Dark Souls 1-2-3, Demon Souls, and Elden Ring, have something that is called delayed dodge. Your character reacts 0.25 seconds after you press the dodge button, even if you press it quickly.This will destroy all your reactions in other games. You think you are improving in other games when you play Souls games, but you aren't. Souls games give you stupid reactions, like having to roll into a monster instead of rolling from it.The game has invincibility frames, which do not exist in other action games, so you will only be good at this kind of games, and if you do not become crazy on the clunky bad control like me, then go ahead.People who say git gud defend a terrible control. No action games except Souls games have this delay, and that is because the devs have done this on purpose to make the game harder. In reality, you trick yourself into believing you will be better at games playing this crap. Every time I play Dragon's Dogma and returned to these crappy genres called Souls games, I have to learn EVERYTHING again. Just skip these bad games and focus on games where the controller works.I can not recommend this, the world is fantastic, but the controller will just make you angry."
Negative,"Dark souls 3 is the worst game in the series and it saddens me. I got into soulsborne games through Elden Ring and decided to play the games in order. Dark souls 1 had an amazing soundtrack and interesting world and map and made me actually speak to the npcs simply because I wanted to know more.Dark souls 2 different but good with things such as, Best dlc, best boss in the series (Ivory king), powerstancing, pvp and Aldia was very interesting.Then I get to Dark Souls 3 the game I always see and hear about. Unspoiled I went in expecting the best game in the series. In the start I believed in that. Ludex was great. And vordt made me feel like I'm playing Dark Souls 1 again with how amazing his OST was. But then it came.Curse-rotted tree terrible boss that shows way to little on how it works I think anyone that doesn't look it up will think you must hit the egg cluster in the middle and just die forever to the horrendous hand, Abyss watchers gimmick boss that kills itself, Crystal sage a trash boss that spawns 2000 projectiles at the same time, Deacons of the deep dissapointing boss that is just there and sucks if you are a early caster/Piercing weapon, The skeleton guy who died so fast I don't even remember his name you either killed him instantly or he instantly killed you, Demon king lazy reskin of DS1 taurus demon with the move set of Fire sage.At this point I was terrified.I was thinking to myself it must get better from here. I finally reach the door of Yhorm the cool boss in all the promotional material and I was thinking to myself he must be great. Realise he needs a specific weapon to be killed and all hope is lost. It's a gimmick boss that dies in 5 hits and you can even roll while attack...My soul was crushed 90 dollars robbed from me for the biggest piece of shit I've ever played. The amount of reskined and reused assets is insane. Andre, Demon king, Ornstein (For the third time) and apperently an insane amount of assets and voices and animations we're also reused but that's smaller stuff.Somehow I got myself to keep playing and finally pontiff a good boss I was so happy and then the second phase happened it's the laziest shit I've seen mediocre I thought but better then bad. So I push on and great Gwyndolin who spams 200000 spells at you. They really had to take the worst boss from DS1. I just run at him until he dies. Kill him and get teleported back to Lothric and instantly accidently kill Emma because somehow this game has the worst M+K support in the series with you constantly randomly swinging while using menus. And I don't even care after I fight Dancer. Hands down the best boss so far. Finally feel some enjoyment in the game and feel more sad killing him then happy. I push on run into Cyrus or what ever his name was with the worst hitbox in all of fromsoftware history I don't know how anyone thought you would be able to dodge that rush attack so I give up and find the other bosses. And once again I was happy with Ornstein 3 until second phase came and it's a wait simulator where you wait for the butterfly's to attack so you can finally go in and fight him again unless you wanna risk dying instantly to one of their attacks making it into a wait simulator.This is only the bosses.This game has the worst map easily. Why is it a straight line? And why is the line so thick? All the other games were claustrophobic corners until now and then you play this game with so many pointless wide spaces. And the biggest offender is the worst DLC I've played in my life Painting of arms or whatever. God, the most pointless open world bullshit I've seen. So much running in the middle of no where when all the bosses sit in the back. Not to mention to get to the first important boss you have to run across the entire map. Go through a invisible wall and into an arena that just looks like a shit pile to pull a lever. And what do you get the worst boss I've fought in my life. A boss with 3 health bars, A gimmick and a gank and I must ask how? How did we get these duo bosses from the greatness of Ornstein and Smough.This game suffers from every boss being a gimmick that makes it insanely easy or insanely annoying. I don't think I ever died to a boss if it wasn't a gimmick. For example the gay ass Nukes from the butterfly's in the Third Ornstein fight. I was constantly running away from him so I can just check if they are charging anything so I don't just take 90% damage from the projectiles.Aside from all my complaining if you are able to get through this pile of negatives it still has it's share of good.Best tutorial boss (Ludex), The most spectacle in any of the games, Some great bosses such as Nameless king, Vordt, Boreal Dancer and Champion Gundyr, some of the most fun weapons in the series ex Farron Greatsword and better looking bosses then DS2.It's sad to see a game with so much potential wasted.I can't say it's worth the money it's easily the shortest game in the series while costing 2x more. And the older games give the dlc for free. And you will also be able to play half of this game but better since half the assets are just taken from the old games. Buying Ds1 + Ds2 gives 4 dlc's for free which are vastly better for the same price as DS3 + the dlc."
Negative,Just lost my save with 130 hours in it. Also just found out that Dark Souls/Steam doesn't back up your save. gg
Negative,Game is actually pretty good. However servers went down and are still down after being promised to be worked on after Elden Ring's release. Unplayable. Do not buy until fixed.
Negative,no online function
Negative,This game sucks and I love it
Negative,"Can't reccoment the game until they fix the brunt of the issues facing it, (Hacking, various annoying bugs) . Which is a shame, because the gameplay is absolutely phenomenal."
Negative,Controller is required for this one. It runs very jenkily on mouse/kb.
Negative,I do enjoy this game but only play it if you hate being happy
Negative,A RCE exploit is possible in the online mode which is a massive security flaw and can allow people to infect you're pc with maleware if you play online. From and Bandai have been warned and have done nothing to fix it. If you do play do so offline or wait for the blue sentinel mod to release their own patch.
Negative,"Yet another console port to PC.  Garbage!  Game couldn't even handle my screen resolution of 2560x1080, locked at 60 FPS, graphics, ran at MAX and it looked outdated.  All the controls tips are set to a controller for xBOX when I prefer keyboard/mouse.  Had to go in and figure out which keys were what.  Piss poor camera angles, even though you control it with the mouse, it would spiral when in battle or in a tight location.Why there are so many likes when this is a piss poor port I can't fathom.  Oh well, plenty of other games to enjoy...Such a shame as I was really interested in this one."
Negative,"Its been around 2 months since offical servers went down due to an RCE exploit? Bandai said they would fix it would be fixed by/After the release of Elden RIng.Elden Ring released 5 weeks ago? Its pretty obvious at this point that this is a scummy practice to get more buyers for ER. Although I myself have purchased ER. I don't condone this behavior and will be leaving a negative review for the fact that they can fuck us over anytime they feel like with this bs. who knows, this shit could also happen in Elden Ring."
Negative,"Dark Souls III is a mixed bag at the moment. On a design level, the game is great. On a technical level however... it's pretty bad. That shouldn't be surprising given that this is a FromSoftware game, but they've outdone themselves this time in a number of ways.   Performance isn't great on a lot of rigs, especially lower-end ones. Stuttering and frame drops are quite common, though there have been a few optimizations since launch (or so it seems).   Script kiddies are still a thing, of course, but they aren't as common as recent coverage of this issue may imply. The bigger issue on the multiplayer side of things is the current softban system. Script kiddies have acquired hacks which can alter your save files and give your character souls or change them in various ways. This triggers the automatic softban system, which has banned many innocent players already, and will likely ban more before the issue is resolved though the system seems to do very litte against players who are actually using cheats/hacks. FromSoft have at least been looking into the issue, although so far the only hotfix introduced even more stuttering into the game, and has since been reverted for that reason.   Auto-summon covenants, such as the Blades of the Darkmoon, Farron Watchdogs, etc, have been all but broken since the launch of the game. The issue seems to be linked to account age, of all things. It seems that using a family share account resolves the issue, indicating that newer accounts are much more likely to see action than older ones. There is still no official fix for the issue however.   And now, there appears to be a new bug to top it all off. Players have, over the past week or so, been finding themselves unable to play online, without any connection issues or ban notifications. The issue reportedly affects all platforms, and renders players unable to participate in multiplayer. So far this seems to affect multiplayer with random players, as well as passworded summoning sessions with friends.   If you have a decent rig, and only plan on playing single-player, then it may still be worth picking up, despite all of these issues. If you're mainly interested in multiplayer or co-op with a friend, then now is not a good time to buy in. It's tough to recommend this game while it has so many glaring issues."
Negative,"Banned for using ""Souls Unsqueezed"" to allow to run in windowed mode. Absolutely amazing that in 2018 a game can't run in borderless windowed without additional steps.Bandai Namco are very ban heavy, using archaic anti-cheat tech with no real way of appealing it."
Negative,"Got triggered by awful translation and shameful fing port to pc without proper adaption and optionsMaybe will get back to game and change my mind, but there is such evident laziness that i got triggered!"
Negative,"Servers are still down, FROM has abandoned fixing this game."
Negative,I LOVE THIS GAME
Negative,no cloud saving
Negative,Where are my servers?!?!?!?!? You have turned off the mulitplayer and done nothing about it! What's going on?!
Negative,This game feels like a chore rather than a game. Fun is missing.
Negative,Put a lot of time in. The game itself is pretty fun. But the support staff is terrible. Softbanned legitimate players. As much as I've enjoyed the Souls series. I hope another dev team takes up the mantle and does a better job. FROM has failed us.
Negative,Bring back family share! I can't believe after 3 years the last DLC was released Fromsoft decided to remove family sharing. They just split the community in the worst possible way. So many innocent players just lost access to a game they love and for no good reason.
Negative,The online aspects of the game do not work. This leaves it at a 8/10 instead of the 9/10 I paid for.
Negative,PC Servers are down - You're a fraud!
Negative,"Doesnt support family sharing.Bad company, greedy for money, no longer supporting this game.Don't buy this if you have any expectations."
Negative,"this game is just like DS2, not hard at all, just annoying as fuck."
Negative,has brought me nothing but anger and miserysaying dark souls 3 is fun is like putting your balls in a super heated vice and saying it's a soothing and therapeutic experience
Negative,"From Software can't fix their servers so they disabled them entirely. Now, you don't have the multiplayer and you must wait a minute before playing because the game is trying to connect to the server."
Negative,"Empty Promises from fromsoftware, i doubt servers would come back up and thats sad, ""Due to the time required to set up proper testing enviorments, online services for DARK SOULS series on PC will not resume until after the release of ELDEN RING"" its almost been 2 months... disappointing empty promises"
Negative,"An offline mod called ""Cinders Mod"" was recommended by the prominent youtuber FightinCowboy. It's a mod that rebalances the game and enables different ways to play the game. After a long break, I turned on Dark Souls 3, forgetting that I hadn't uninstalled Cinders mod. When I saw that it was still present, I promptly deleted the character. FromSoftware however notified me that ""Invalid data remains on my account and I have been penalized, restricting online play."" Their ""penalizations"" are in fact a permanent ban. I contacted customer support and they told me that once all invalid data was removed it would be reviewed and the penalization would be lifted. This is not the case however. I deleted all characters, uninstalled and reinstalled the game, and still the penalty remains 4 months later. I cannot recommend FromSoftware games due to the way they treat their fans. I'd even buy a new license for the game to play it if that were an option but as it is, they'd rather not have me or my money."
Negative,"First off. I find the PvP aspect of this game to be immensely disappointing. The matching of player lvls is clumsy as in it's non existent. You will be ganked over and over and over and over and over and over when the kids are let out of school.The game is pretty good, I enjoy the game play a lot, the graphics are amazing and the story is great. I think the multiplayer tag should be removed, I feel it's misleading, I probably would have avoided the game had I known about the mass world arena PvP fest with no level matching. I wanted a multiplayer not this... still, once the children go to bed, it's a fairly ok game! Pros: Great graphics, amazing story, the combat is great once you get used to it!Cons: The other players."
Negative,"As much as i liked the original dark souls on the xbox 360, and as much as i like the dark souls franchise in general, i cannot recommend any of them on PC, as the devs and publisher seem to not care about the very rampant hacker issue that plagues these games, the most heinous of which is the fact that hackers can now forcefully inject items into your inventory at any point when you're summoned or invaded, and not only ruin your save, but almost assures that you are banned from online play as well, on top of the fact that you can only appeal a ban once, if you get banned again, you're done, no more online for you. I bought this game specifically to interact with the community and play online. I've had the game for 5 days now, and was already banned, and i got this on sale. for the love of all that is holy do NOT buy this game at full price, it is just simply not worth the money if the developers cannot implement a reasonable anticheat that doesn't actively work against legit users. I wish i could refund this game but sadly it took 7 hours just to realize the first time that this was a giant issue."
Negative,Could not really get into. I like npcs and quests in my RPGs i guess.
Negative,It's 2016 and theres no support for ultrawide monitors...I'll give thumps up when it's fixed
Negative,coundlt get past frist boss i dont like :(
Negative,tianjin explosion hilarious
Negative,"I read ""Full controller support"" up there, but that's just a lie. It won't work with DS4 no matter what driver you use. As of now the game is not playable so I can't recommend it."
Negative,"Would I recommend the game for new players? Yes. It's a good starting point if you want to play the series backwards.Would I recommend it to hardcore, Demons' Souls/Dark Souls players? No. It was tuned down so much... and some solutions...I've finished the game in far under 20 hours while exploring nearly every corner of it, failing some quests but not caring much. Exploring entire maps. And there's just so much wrong with what it became. DS 1 felt like a very, very giant, open world filled with intersections between maps. DS 3 doesn't give that feeling anymore, to a point it hurts me actually. You are given a feeling that you've got a choice, I mean if you're good you can kill Dancer instantly and go to castle at once right? Except you will get murdelized by high-end monsters. But in end, any side-areas you enter, you enter once and leave them for good unless a quest orders you otherwise. Smouldering Caves? Went there once, gotten everything I needed, never returned again. This was never a case of DS1, I kept travelling past all the maps.Difficulty? Far, far below expected. Out of 18 bosses (if I count it right) I've had issues with only 4 using my PVP focused build. Ever tried beating Seath or Four Kings using a bleed/backstab dex dagger build in DS 1? No? Try it, tell me how it went. It is a challenge. And don't get me started on Orstein... but here? I understand I used greatsword+shield, but still no boss took me more than 3 tries solo (except the ones mentioned) and I think at least 8 died at first try. Where's difficulty in that? Especially that you can summon an army of sun-praising fantoms nowadays.Then there's the fact that a lot of mechanics that allowed for build customization around armors and poise were overhauled to a point in which you are nearly forced to resign from playing certain builds. (Staggerlocking Havel armor with a mediocre-enchanted Katana pays its respects...)There's a lot I could go into detail which I didn't like and which I did, but it would take a long time.Pro:- Locations design (graphical)- Music- Immersion- You are dead- Weaps/spells variety- CovenantsCons:- Low difficulty- Locations design (technical aspect)- Invade PVP design- Poise- Simple enemies- Bonfires next to each other...?- LORE! - with capital letters and exclamation point intended.I guess I'll keep playing since it has people online, but the game was turned into low learning curve production for masses, where many cry when they die. Here's an update for you: It's Dark Souls. The game which originally got famous for it's insane difficulty level and real challenges it presented. This part is much easier than the originals, so get over yourselves and play the game which was originally ALL about dying and nobody complained <3Good luck and stay away from Ferrus woods if you don't want to meet up~"
Negative,the souls were too dark ):
Negative,"IF THE GAME HAS STORY THAT IS DETRIMENTAL TO THE CORE GAmePLAY, I REFUSE TO PLAY IT. I DON'T NEED TO LIVE SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE. MINE IS PLENTY INTERESTING ENOUGH."
Negative,"This game crashes every time I try to play it. It worked for 3 hours one night with no problems, now it regularly crashes my whole PC. Buyer beware. I have tried several fixes to no avail, and have found many other people have the same problem."
Negative,"This game is good, don't get me wrong, the PvE is great and very fun and addicting, but if you're someone like me and mostly play for the PvP I do not recommend this game, the PvP is rarely fun because this games community just destroyed it. The previous 2 games were ok with the PvP and it wasn't too bad, but now it's gotten to the point where there is no enjoyment for me. This games adjustment to combat speed has benefited those pesky R1 spammers to the point where almost everybody does it, PvP has been completely ruined for me, but that's just what i think about the PvP, maybe you don't/won't have as bad luck with me and invade the same kind of person constantly. They seem to have just given up on this game in my opinion in terms of PvP, it is very unbalanced and just overall trash. And don't even get me started on the amount of bugs in this game, I know this game was only just released a while ago but there are some bugs I doubt will ever be patched. There is plenty more to say, but I'm mostly posting this just to give those PvPers a heads up on this game's PvP."
Negative,0/10 no sexual relations with the fire keeper. This has ruined my 2 hours of playtime.
Negative,"didnt even get a temp ban for first offense, straight to perma ban. Lovin it"
Negative,I cant hit enemies and enemies cant hit me i hope there is a way to fix this problem.
Negative,Terrible port... Controls are shit and tell you wrong things on screen as if you are on a console like a peasant. Also your save file is stored locally so everyone who plays online just edits their file with a trainer to cheat and be unkillable.
Negative,"Family sharing is turned off so if some hacker decides to mess with your game, you can get banned and can't get around it. FROMSOFT and Bandai do nothing about wrongful bans.I don't know whether they are incompetent or just trying to destroy the community"
Negative,"Played it for 45 minutes.Game looks amazing.Game plays horribly on PC without a controller.I'm sure it's a great story but it is impossible to play unless you have the console version or a controller.  No tutorial, just hints which reference controller buttons like ""Left Trigger Button"" or ""A button"" instead of the keyboard key that it is bound to.  Looking up keybindings does not help.  Felt like the game was telling me I needed an XBOX controller to play.Got so frustrated with controls I never want to play this game again."
Negative,"My background: I completed DS1 and DS2 twice each, never played BB (don’t own a PS). I nearly completed DS3 in 2018, got stuck on Midir before linking the fire (i.e., before finalizing the NG). Recently, I’ve gone for a second playthrough and quitted right after beating the Nameless King.For me, DS3 was a disappointing and frustrating experience overall. Here’s the list of my gripes:- Poise is turned off for the player. Even the most basic hollow soldier can stunlock you to death.- Shields are useless, because rolling is much cheaper (in terms of stamina) and gives you an opportunity to reposition on top of that.- Armor is useless.- Longswords/katanas are infinitely better in PvE than any other weapon types. You just don’t want to switch to a GS/UGS after getting used to fast, decently damaging swings of a one-handed sword.- Non-gimmick bosses are fast paced, they have unlimited stamina, erratic attack patterns, and often multiple health bars. This is not bad per se. However, combined with the problems listed above, it gives you a typical DS3 boss fight: stick to the enemy, roll 10 times, poke 1 time, roll 10 times, poke 1 time, rinse and repeat. If a mistake happens, you’re likely boned (with like 70-80% Estus left). Attacks and moves of a boss can be memorized after 2 or 3 tries. Then you learn nothing, you just pray to RNGesus that patterns will be more forgiving next time. This is everything but fun for me. I guess, this is what happens when BB concepts are inserted inconsistently into a DS environment. I miss slow-paced, thoughtful and strategic boss battles of DS1 and DS2, where you considered positioning, used arena layout, chose between rolls and shield blocks, altered your loadout, etc.- The world design is super-linear. In DS1, there was a beautifully intertwined world with alternative paths. In DS2, there were many (although, linear and dead-end) paths starting from Majula.- Tons of re-used location concepts from DS1: a ruined castle wall, some boney catacombs, an annoying swamp, a big library, a painted snowy world, some fiery underworld, an Anor Londo style palace/city. It’s an uninspired safe play from the developers.I can’t recommend this game given that DS1 and DS2 exist. I don’t approve of the direction Souls games are going."
Negative,"The game would be very enjoyable if not for these ""minor"" inconveniences /s:- Constant game freezes or crashes  (the game and Nvidia drivers apparently don't work well together unless you downgrade to 6 months old drivers - I have a gtx 1070 and the only way to prevent this is to play in windowed mode) REALLY!?- If you want to experience the joys of co-op online play, be warned that half the time you get summoned to help another player, you won't be able to pass the fog gate to the boss room- The game is full of bugs, glitches and other exploits which FROM Software is unable to fix since the game's release. I'm not talking about using the Cheat Engine in offline mode, I'm talking about things that have been around all the time in online play like tumblebuffing, item/soul duping, using the cheat engine to get unfair advantages over other online players (yes, the occasional soft ban is NOT an efficient method to remove blatant cheating), etc- PvP in this game is FLAWED. There are ONLY 2 regions to play from - Japan and the rest of the world. Now imagine playing in the arena versus someone who is 12000 km away from you (Europe - Latin America), as is happening to me usually several times a day. Playing with a 250+ ping difference is NOT an enjoyable user experience. - FROM Software/BAMCO has one of the WORST customer services I have ever encountered in an online game. They won't give a damn about your problems. There's even a good possibility you will get soft banned if you never used cheats/exploits. If you're experiencing frequent crashes, it might corrupt your game files, which in turn seems like they were edited and will result in a ban. Fix your damn game, FROM Software!For reasons stated above, I do not recommend buying this faulty product unless these issues are fixed in a timely manner, which is highly unlikely."
Negative,"Spoilers below. I'm definitely not hardcore, but I've probably put in 500-1000 hours across all 3 games over the years. DS3 is the most disappointing of the trilogy. For the most part, it's just ""more souls content"". Do not buy this game at full price.I'm not sure where to start... maybe with the fact that literally over half of the bosses are humanoid melee fights? I'm being generous here and not counting a few like NK. My point is that it really feels like they didn't even try to come up with the memorable and creative bosses that they made in previous games. Don't get me wrong; the bosses in DS3 are challenging and you'll die a lot before you get the hang of it (this is definitely a Dark Souls game), however, the challenge is mostly ""let's give the boss a phase 2 where they attack really fast or you have to dodge some dark projectile"". It's boring. This is in contrast to say DS1, where you not only had bosses of all kinds with different mechanics (a few sucked, of course), but a lot of the bosses had strong emotional appeal due to the rich lore, like Sif and Artorias. Granted, there are a few exceptions here, mostly Gael and NK. I found DS2 was worse than DS1 as well, but they had a much richer diversity of bosses than DS3. DS2 had a much higher proportion of generic bosses, but, in fairness, they eclipse 1 and 3 in total boss count, with a number of quasi-mini-filler bosses.And, I think that the bosses are representative of the conclusion; they didn't even try to be creative or innovative at all with this game. They churned this game out much quicker than the other 2, as they wanted to grab some money and wrap up the series.Another example: the world-space. Firstly, a lot of it is ripped from the first game (either directly, like Anor Londo, Demon Ruins, or as a reminiscent copy, like High Wall + Settlement <-> Undead Bergs, Road + Farron <-> Darkroot Gardens + Royal Wood, Smouldering Lake <-> Ash Lake, and more). And look, maybe some of it is fine, as the point of DS3 is to wrap up the series, and the overall theme (including the DLC) sort of mocks the futility of the age of Fire, so they needed some contrast to show the decay. Granting that, they copied locations from DS2 as well, and the connectedness and sheer magic of DS1 is gone. I felt like clapping upon seeing the Demon Ruins as I got near Nito in DS1. The whole thing was so innovative. DS3 had a nice vista of Anor Londo, and a nice view from the top of Lothric castle, but the locations are still small, very linear in progression, and derivative. DS2 did not have the same magic as DS1 for me and the world-space was not well-connected, but they made a serious attempt to make interesting and original locations. A lot of the locations in DS2 are still memorable.And, I think that's a great differentiator here. DS2, even though it failed in some ways, really tried to branch off the original and build on the original game. DS3 just said ""screw it, let's rip from 1""....which segues me into the story. It's the same as DS1 and DS2. You kill 4 bosses which unlocks the bad guy. But, whereas DS2 echoed DS1 while having its own fully fleshed and unique story (albeit, it wasn't as interesting as DS1), DS3 opts to either directly copy DS1 in most aspects while just having less lore overall. The 4 bosses in DS3 play a pivotal role in the story as they do in DS1 (not emphasized as much in DS2), however, they're horribly motivated. Abyss Watchers are a rip of 4 Kings/Artorias with no interesting story. Yhorm/Profaned Capital is mostly an afterthought. Lothric is a little better but not much. Aldritch might be the exception. But it doesn't hold a candle to DS1: in particular, the Witch of Izalith (say what you will about Lost Izalith and Bed of Chaos, the story was very compelling), Nito, and Seath leading up to Gwyn were quite rich in lore. Meanwhile, comparing to Gwyn, the final boss of DS3 has 0 lore (rather, it's a vague philosophical idea with copied boss mechanics), and then we just link the flame again (or don't, again).  What a massive letdown.The one DS3 did right in this regard was The Ringed City. We should forget that the Soul of Cinder + Flame Ending never happened. This was a perfect ending. They really did a good job here. The falsely preserved city, the pygmies locked away by Gwyn, hiding the dried out, fragmented blood of the Dark soul, and two humans/undead killing each other to paint a new preserved world, ironically destroying what's been preserved in the process, when only dust remains at the end of fire. Really raises a lot of interesting philosophical thoughts and insights in the same way that the first game did. And, if we pretend Gael was the final boss, he was top notch.Despite that, that's mostly the only positive. There are only a few other things to mention. The only cool weapons and armor in the game are ripped from prior games. The mechanics are *mostly* the same. The only real noticeable change in gameplay to me was decreasing the ratio of area to bonfire, which definitely casualized the game significantly and I have mixed opinions on.In conclusion, I'd say of course it's worth a (few) playthrough(s) if you're a Souls fan, but I'd say it's definitely NOT worth the price they're charging ($60-85). It wasn't even worth that at release. DS3 felt like a money grab, rather than a labor of love like DS1 (and mostly DS2) did."
Negative,Dark Souls 3 Can Be Used To Hack Your Computer:
Negative,Won't run a full resolution on my curved monitor all I get a a window in the middle.  UI feels like keyboard and mouse were second thoughts.  Very much a console port?
Negative,Legendary Game Giving it's 9/10 The Invade System is Really dumb and annoying when you play with friends and you get killed by some assholeThat wants to ruin your gameplay Great Game Tho...
Negative,Couldn't beat the tutorial too hard would not reccomend...
Negative,"This game starts in console mode. I play on a computer. I can use no items, only attack (not strong attack), dodge and movement. Until its fixed, I'm unable to play, and cannot recommend this."
Negative,"The game is amazing and looks good...but it suffers from major porting problems and malfunctions.My freshly installed and updated copy of Windows 7 has suffered more than 30 blue screens of death by now, and judging by what the reddit forums say, I'm not the only one.Despite the advertising about how ""60 FPS"" would be stable on PC, many areas are indeed NOT stable and will drop. Even using the right monitor with the right settings does not prevent flickering sometimes, online play is laggy and filled to the brim with bugs, the most ""funny"" being other players not being able to perform any animation on your screen while they clearly are and are also able to see that on their screen.My suggestion is simple: if you really have to buy this game on PC, wait for a patch. If you own a console, ditch the PC release and buy a console copy which will run at 30 fps, sure, but won't freeze your system or cause major flickering.Also, these being the first days after release, the game is heavily unbalanced towards the player, and demands having a higher level than you have to progress, even if you farmed for hours.Scarce resources and absence of a bonefire ascetic item make leveling weapons a pain, since past the +3 mark it will be nearly impossible to upgrade a secondary or tertiary weapon.Long story short: do you mind playing a game that could hurt your PC, is yet unbalanced and has poor online support and no cloud sync? If the answer is no go ahead and try your luck, if the answer is yes you should try a console retail copy or just wait a month or two for From to actually do their job."
Negative,Ashen One does not blink.
Negative,"A lot of chater, and fromsoft doesn't care report player didn't help anything"
Negative,"Fan Service III is fun to play. But:-It is so busy referencing past titles and Berserk that it forgets its own lore (No, \""time is convoluted\"" is not a valid argument). There\'s no excuse to having to read a manga to understand a non-related game.-Almost no improvement over old problems, with the addition of Bloodborne\'s. Worst camera problems of the series, same absurd compenetrations, enemies with frantic combos.-Half of the Covenants are useless or broken.-Hybrid builds are mostly unusable. Magic builds vary from decent to terrible. 90% of weapons scale with Strenght and Dexterity only, so you might have access to almost every weapon investing just in those two.-Some things have been clearly cut (since they don\'t make sense right now) to be included in future DLC\'s.-Developers were so busy making distance from Dark Souls 2, they forgot its good points. Even lore references are a bitch slap.In conclusion, don\'t be deluded like those who pray every Miyazaki move. They insult \""games that come out every year\"" when the biggest -good- change here is decent graphics. They\'re just gaming hipsters. Do yourself a favour and buy the definitive edition with patches and DLCs included at least."
Negative,"The worst console port I've ever seen- Clunky controls and combat. Controls on a keyboard don't even work half the time- Terrible graphics- Bad UI which is also broken, It shows you controller icons when using a keyboard and mouse, why? Lazy programming."
Negative,this ganeis dogshit
Negative,"I quite enjoy this game, but I cannot in good conscience give it a positive review until a major issue is fixed.Back on February 10th, the developers posted an announcement stating they were aware of an issue which was preventing online services for this game, and stated that online services will not resume until the release of Elden Ring on February 25th.  They also stated that they would be making an announcement as soon as the schedule is determined for resuming online services.  As of writing this review, it is April 7th, the issue has not only not been fixed, but no schedule for when it will be fixed has been made either.  Until we at least receive a schedule of when it will be fixed, this review will remain negative."
Negative,He hit me with the baby :(
Negative,If you play online you'll be banned for hacking. Just the way it is
Negative,"As it stands, Dark Souls 3 is unplayable for me due to frate-rate issues. The game keeps logging me offline due to low frame-rate."
Negative,until they fix the fucking fame drops for fucks sake
Negative,a poor pc port
Negative,literally unplayablekeeps stuttering for no reason
Negative,"""Ironically Hollow"" is how I'd describe the last addition to the Dark Souls series.Sure you do the same old thing, gotta link that fire...and that's it. In the last games it had truly memorable and landscape where the Lore was easy to tease out without excessive digging to at the very least have a general feel.In this final incarnation there are very forgettable characters and unfortunately no lore to speak of..Where would Hollow apply then?In short, the Games combat mechanics are solid and functional.  Not quite the same as the last games but it works.But that's just it.  There's only the gameplay, there's only the combat.  There is no true gratification for completion of a Goal in this game, only relief it's done..There's no lore, items or real NPC's to call it's own, just borrowed assets and a disgusting excess of fanservice for the first game.I feel nothing for my character or his intereactions.  There's only 2 NPC's in the entire game I give a half-shit about and only one of them is original to this game alone instead of a fanservice Clone.PvE (Player versus environment) works fine and is simply enough.  A few enemies and placements feel utterly unfair and/or cheap with either excessive numbers or limitless attacks.  But overall it is manageable with a little practice and memorization to the point of triviality.  However, PvP (Player versus Player) has always been one of the bigger selling points of these games and here is one of the biggest shortcomming of this Game.  If you invade the game has slanted victory to the side of the Host as it should be, but they went much too far.  The invader will have a 30% reduction of thier max hp when entering someones world (this i'm fine with), yet the more Phantoms a Host has the more priority they have to be invaded.  If you're alone you can go hours without seeing a single invader unless you find a red sign(willing invasion) and call them in.  Even then only one Invader can enter a Hosts world when they can have upward of 4 friendlies without opening up the chance for a second hostile phantom.This is without mentioning an item that turns all enemies on the map hostile towards the invader.  Or the fact the invader must retrieve thier Souls from the location they died in the other world.  PvP just feels so empty and frustrating.  80% of the time you'll be fighting a 3v1 Battle which stunts one of the most important aspects of the Dark souls series, replayability.  Even in PvE there is virtually no replayability, you can beat the game hundreds of times.  With each defeat of the final boss you can enter a NG+ where the enmies gain slightly more health and damage.  But that's it...you can find rings that are improved versions of lesser ones, but that only stretches to NG+2 before hitting a cap when the upgraded Rings themselves offer little benefit over the base ones.Once you've played through the game once, that's it, there's nothing else left to see...Even when the DLC drops I have no intention of returning unless it is absolutely phenominal.  I regret buying the Season Pass.I understand Miyazaki (The founder and crator of the Souls series) wanted it to end here, but it shouldn't feel that way..I've followed the series since Demons Souls was brought to North America by Atlas.  I've loved the series as a whole and played thousands of hours in it.  Yet just as the first flame is dying, this game lacks a spark.  It's just a husk, and I feel nothing but disappointment in how it is ending..With that said, I can't recommend this game.  Yes, I played hundreds of hours in it, but that should only make my point stronger.  Very little of all that time was I genuinely enjoying myself instead of struggling to find something to like in a series that has been a part of my life for almost a decade.Much like the Warrior of Firelink Shrine and his DS3 clone.  I'm simply...Crestfallen."
Negative,DANCER EASIEST BOSS IN GAME SO EASY NOT EVEN WORTH PLAYING.

Negative,"extremely overrated, if you like souls genre buy this on a deep discount, its 6/10 overall"
Negative,decide to play game after long timeinstall gamelog into serverbanneduninstall game
Negative,"Everything is working as intended here.Wait no, not anymore. Fuck."
Negative,"The combat in this game is not at all what I expected. It's not tight, responsive, and clear cut. It's wonky, clunky, clumsy, and completely undecipherable. I found it impossible to figure out why I would under the exact same set of circumstances be able to dodge one time and get hit another. And I feel like most people (fanboys) confuse a game that is hard and bullshit with one that is actually good and challenging. This game isn't a challenge, it's cheap. Refunded."
Negative,"Fromsoftware either doesn't care about what made them famous or incompetent. Waited over 4 months for the servers to come back online. Now that Elden Ring is out everyone forgot about the servers, and FS has no reason to patch the old games. Great game ruined by neglect."
Negative,"An amazing feat in game design, there is nothing else like Dark Souls right now. A modern game that's actually about overcomming challenges the developers have laid out, instead of just interactive movies.There are a few rough edges, some of the covenants probably don't work as intended and generally the PvP matchmaking is a bit wonky. Also long standing fans of the franchise will not find almost anything new in DS3 which is surprisingly disappointing in a Hidetaka Miyazaki title. But apart from that the game is worth every penny.EDIT: Changing my review, alas. Looking back the game doesn't stand the test of time. Compared to previous Miyazaki titles it feels lazy, phoned in and overly by-the-numbers. It'll probably be a blast on the first playthrough (that's why my initial positive review) but it has very low replayability, due to the incredibly phoned in NG+. The addons show a bit more care and interest on the part of the devs, especially the last one. Overall though it feels as if From, instead of pouring everything into their last Souls game, chose to meet the most basic requirements for a Souls game with the least amount of effort, time and money. Damn shame."
Negative,"The game is good and I've played through on console multiple times, but the state of online play on pc is fundamentally broken and it's no longer being maintained as of several years ago. Given that souls games are usually at their best when they're always online, If you have the option, get the game on console, or expect to have a bad time. If you absolutely have to play online, use the blue sentinels mod and read up on some of the exploits to know what you're getting yourself into. Fromsoft still charging full price for a game this deep in the gutter is pretty sad, especially for something i otherwise have nothing but good things to say about."
Negative,"If you're only interested in PvE and jolly cooperation with friends, you will likely enjoy this game and its many faults might not affect you to the point of souring your experience.If you're interested in PvP as an invader, you would be better served continuing to play DaS:PtD.Ultimately, the game is better than DaS2, but not by a significant margin and it still exhibits many of the same fundamental faults.If you want the intended DarkSouls experience, buy DaS:PtD; if you want a diluted jolly coop circlejerk, you may consider buying DaS3.No cloud saves, game is officially dead."
Negative,Just play dark souls 2
Negative,why the fuck did I used to like this dogshit it's terrible
Negative,Game keeps crashing after the first boss. when i try to open the door it causes it to crash i have un-installed and reinstalled it many times. cant believe i wasted $60. they need to fix that immeditally.
Negative,Some people can't just git gud even after the many hours you've put in this game(yes I'm talking about myself)Edit; I finally got gud;)
Negative,Game crashes on startup. Cannot be played. No fixes so far; doubtful whether a patch will provide a solution.Current score 0/10.
Negative,"It would be a good game if it didn't have so many issues. Crashes and random studdering abound, at times leaving the game unplayable. It gets worse if I try to utilize any online aspects. If they fixed these issues, it would be a good game. Until then, its not worth it.Edit: The issues have been fixed, and I would now recommend this game! I enjoyed it quite thoroughly, and I plan on playing through more than once.Second Edit: The new expansion crashes so much, that it is now unplayable for me. I can't recommend a game I can't play."
Negative,"[]This is the latest game in a series of several games. And it will surely take your breath away and rise both anger and happiness. First of all the game itself is very poorly balanced.Some areas are packed with invaders while others are empty. Many places contains foes that spam attack rather then being fun to fight, due to lacking tactic and poor programmed A.I.Former games motivated you with a breath taking story and marvellous music. And don´t get me wrong Dark souls 3 has amazing music , but it lacks so much in story.To gain story or lore, you gain a piece of armour and read the information to it. Dark souls 3 lacks this and so much more. It does not pull you in and make you want to try again like previous games.For me it wasn't a fun gaming experience , it frustrated me with constant hackers, invasions you just can´t win and absolutely no motivation to go on my journey. Dark souls 1 told you a story of a undead sent in a journey to rekindle the flame, and Dark souls 2 which was to easy grasped me with a story . This game made me want to quite.Here is why you would avoid online gameplay: You get invaded at some locations over and over again, and also struggle with hard foes.People hack, a lot and many invaders are so overpowered and handle hits like a iron wall.The creators don´t care about you at all. Because of xenophobia? They instead punish legit players.Avioid this game if you want more then what it can give. But if you want to “read” a bad book with rattraps on random pages which punishes you for turning the page.Buy it. But don´t expect any help from the help desk. They don´t care."
Negative,"just ok, The negatives:the game gets repetitive after the first lord of cinderthe multiplayer sucks dick although the idea behind it is greatthe servers maybe as well run of the uPlay servers like a another terrible game 'For Honor'for a story game only one characters story was interesting and worth following up on (Anri of Astora)the quests are well made but nothing happens if you do it pretty much no loot or real achievementR1 equals OP, the combat tries to make you think it's smart but it's just a Spam, some weapons are op that make you go through the game on 9 hoursIt's not hardPositives:The art style is greatThe level design is my favourite in any game but Dark souls 1"
Negative,"Dark Souls 1 better.P.S.: I will do that review more correct later(because my english not very good).UPD:Worst pvp, cuz only r1 fight are bad. PvE for the casuals, very ez.Dark souls 1 v 2.0, WutFace. Fist can bully you even if you are on havel's armor.Hyper armor now looks stupid cuz you don't need skill if you wanna use hyper armor.Bad estus, actually bad estus. Dks3 hates invaders and love pve guys :thinking: .And last words about DLC.... 16k hp boss on ng, wut? that's worst boss on dark souls games."
Negative,"Como removeram as tags, a review ficará negativa até consertarem o multiplayer."
Negative,Game was not cheap and i can't beat the first boss.
Negative,this one still chugs balls and everyone you invade alt f4's on you
Negative,Worst controls I ever seen on a game by Keyboard & Mouse.
Negative,"The bosses are probably the best (as a whole) in the whole From lineup - but the areas are incredibly lackluster. Not to mention, there is no multiplayer currently (ongoing for 2 months now) and no updates from the dev team. The achievements are probably the most tedious in all of the games. Getting covenant items takes just hours and hours of killing the same 2-3 enemies over and over again. Repeat that 4 times."
Negative,"kendinize bir iyilik yapın ve bu siktiğimin oyununu lütfen oynamayın. sigara gibidir, arkadaş ortamında güzel gidiyor diye başlarsın sonra bağımlı olur öfke krizi geçirir kafayı yersin. alt+f4 attığında giden tek şeyinin vaktin olduğunu anlarsın.iradem orospu gibi bükülmez diyorsan al azar azar oyna, bilen arkadaşın yoksa yine alma."
Negative,"There is an option unlike the previous souls games in the series to not progress to new game after completing the final boss. I was on the second DLC and wanted to complete it so I chose the option to NG later. You can do so at the Firelink Shrine bonfire at any time. I was invading people for fun and on about the fourth one after just having completed the final boss the game randomly rolled the opening cinematic and went to NG. I was upset, but not wholly enraged. I still needed my sage ring + 2 among other ring upgrades from the next playthroughs. So, upon reaching Firelink Shrine and placing Gundyrs coiled sword into place I reached a hard locked game breaking glitch that, though rare, traps your current character and you must start over anew. I researched a decent bit seeing if anyone else experienced the glitch where you cannot travel to High Wall of Lothric and were trapped at the shrine. It turned out that many different threads had been posted in different intervals throughout the years with the same broken glitch. Honestly, DS2 is GOATED. Did nobody play test a hard lock at the start of the game? It can occur first playthrough or the 5th. The game is trash. If you want to go waste 70 hours and have materials and fully upgraded items for a build only to have to start fresh because you beat the game, then you go right ahead. Myself, however, am finding it hard to find the drive to start over with the possibility of never seeing NG or NG+ and having to coin toss 10's of hours of my life to the RNG of buggy programming. Don't waste your time."
Negative,"IF you do not meet the minimum required specs for this game then I'd think twice about buying this on PC. I made it through the first ""journey"" but with a handful of fustrating moments because my machine is a bit outdated (the only outdated part being my GTX 660). The performance issues translated into stuttering in the game, or the game freezing for seconds at the time typically at the entrances and exits of new areas. This complication sometimes makes easy encounters with mobs or other players particularly hard. I was still able to play through the game, but I wish I had a more polished experience and slightly regret the decision of getting this of PC. If you want a consistent experience I'd definitely point you in the direction of a console version of the game if you own one."
Negative,Absolute dog*&^% port. What the hell is wrong with FROMSOFTWARE.
Negative,Too many cheaters
Negative,My two acc have been send back to Cemetary Ash by stupid hacker. This just ruined whole of your time and hard work. Just uninstalled it today.
Negative,I got hacked and lost 20hours of gameplay. I wanna say I sacrificed my entire life saving on this game and I was  left empty.
Negative,If you are new to this game be sure to get the Sentinel Mod before making your first character. Before Bandai takes action on cheaters and save ruiners thats the situation...
Negative,Game is currently witnessing Network Vulnerability May/2021. Please play offline or look this issue up before you play.
Negative,"If you want to see other concerns that I may share, see the criticism of others. My true annoyance with the game is the poor new game + system. I don't want to rely on pvp to experience something slightly new. Dark souls 2 was far better in that regard and while this game is designed beautifully, it lacks polish is several areas that become noticeable around the new game + run (atleast they did for me).Thanks for taking the time to read this :)"
Negative,After 25 hrs into the game a hacker invaded me and i lost all my progress. I even got lucky because the hacker could fuck up my whole pc.  I can not belive that after all this years the developers did not fix this hack and that it is even possible for something like this to exist. Shame on them. Dont buy the game until they fixed that exploit
Negative,"The game itself is fine but there are hackers who can erase your entire game progress simply through online co-op. Despite many ways to solve this problem (dedicated server, cloud save, etc.) FromSoftware just isn't doing jackshit about it. If you like to have all your hours wasted in a second, go ahead."
Negative,"Lovely Game but I wouldn't recommend buying nor playing it these days. Not possible to play online nor co-op. You either get invated by a way too overpowered enemy wanting just to own fresh spawns ( f.e. invades with lightning weapons on the high wall, etc. ) , or get invaded by hackers that corrupt your safe file. So it's just possible to play offline and with that it's definitely just half the fun. Sad to see that such a great game is just ruined by twats......"
Negative,"Got my game reset by a hacker that invaded my world, if you ever play this game remember to make backups often."
Negative,"the game has been in an unacceptable condition for years now, thanks to script kiddies and the anticheat's failure to keep them at bay. i'd suggest playing on console and not on pc"
Negative,Full of Smurfs invading low level areas with end game gear because they need the advantage against new players.
Negative,"Soft banned for picking up an item from a random guy, even after deleting the character save, Nice work guys, Really good job :)"
Negative,I can't pass the firts boss :(
Negative,"Just got almost 50 hours of tears and effort deleted in 5 seconds by a hacker that could somehow affect my progression (threwn into ng+ while I was in Archdragon peak, all happened on stream) without any way to restore my save. Would not recommend to anyone if they don't plan to either play offline or with Blue Sentinel, or alternatively manually backup their save after each session."
Negative,"The first Dark Souls game was a masterpiece. The second is the game I played the most, and I loved it despite the community thinking it was bad. And finally, the third I have mixed feelings with.I played Dark Souls 1 a couple of times and enjoyed it, and still enjoy it every time I boot it up. Dark Souls 2 I played for more than a few times, and spent probably almost a thosand hour playing. But with Dark Souls 3, after beating it twice, every time I boot it up, I exit after couple of minutes. All builds are quite boring. The only really viable ones are luck and quality builds. Using any other builds than these, you might as well pick up a broken straight sword. ""Oh, but magic is fun"", no it isn't. As a magic caster, the only magic that will be usefull to you are buffs, with a few exceptions where you can cheese bosses from a far. And as a magic caster you only get the good spells in the very end of the game, and magic doesn't start to scale well until very high levels either. As for melee builds, It doesn't matter if you go strenght or dexterity anymore. Most weapons have same dexterity as strenght damage scaling, and if they don't you can just infuse it so that it begins to scale with what you want. ""The greatsword is a very large weapon, wieldable only by those with inhuman strenght"", nope. Just infuse it with sharp gem and go dexterity instead. Boring. Bosses... Pretty disappointing to be honest. Not much more to say other than that."
Negative,If you havent played the previous games. You should. THEN play this game. you will have the full scope of things and give a proper opinion. If you want a casual experience then toally pick this up. if you want a game that can get you hooked play the first one at least.
Negative,"Great game. Amazing game. One of my favorite games. Unfortunately, hackers can instantly take away all your progress for just being online. It looks like no one is going to do anything about it (so far). AND the exploit could open YOUR COMPUTER up to being hacked (info stolen, computer bricked). Only play in offline mode."
Negative,"Dark Souls is my fav game series of all time. I played them all and they are all amazing. So theres nothing wrong with the game. The problem is the players. Not only do they use cheats to invade you and kill you. Thats fine. Whats worse they use hacks to permanently destroy your characters. Only thing left to do is delete the character or to also use hacks to get it back. So if you want to play online i recommend you to buy a console and play on it. Losing days worth of progress because some 12 year old has found a cheat engine is not worth it imo. And NO bandai cant and/or wont restore your progress. And they told me in their mail, if I would use a save file to restore my character it would be banned from online play. Gee thanks"
Negative,Most boring pvp in entire series
Negative,I lost my save file 80% into the game. never playing again. gg.
Negative,Play this game and you will finally understand how other people dont rage at games.
Negative,"Between getting banned for no reason, glitching through the map every 2 hrs, and having the save file for my new character crash and become irreparably corrupted, there's a pretty fun game here. Hope you get to play it"
Negative,"good luck invading and having 10,000 phantoms ram your cornhole at once"
Negative,"Here is just one single problem with Dark Souls 3. Just one problem, out of many.Here's my essay on blue phantoms.In order to be summoned as a blue phantom, whose role is to defeat invaders in the worlds of embered host players, there are some ridiculous conditions which must be met. First of all, in order to be summoned as a blue phantom, the host must equip the Way of the Blue covenant item and be invaded. Sounds simple doesn't it? How could this possibly be flawed?Let's explain why this, as a concept, just does not work reliably (if at all for the majority of players). Let's look at the Way of the Blue covenant, and how it is absolutely required for any players hoping to be summoned as blue phantoms in to a hosts world and collect covenant items to rank up their covenant level.To obtain the Way of the Blue covenant item you must speak to Emma in the chapel in Lothric, near the first real boss of the game. Talking to Emma for the first time nets you the item used to proceed past the first boss. You then need to speak to her a second time to receive the Way of the Blue covenant item.Just from this we can see that we have an issue here. The covenant is partially missable (the reason why I say partially is because if you miss it at the start of the game, you are more or less guaranteed to obtain it towards the end of it when she dies and you have to speak to her as she is dying to proceed to the next part of the game). This right here creates an issue for all players wanting to be summoned as blue phantoms. It won't be missable to many players, but still a significant number which will ultimately affect the multiplayer portion of the game.I will have to post the rest of this in the comments due to the nonsensical low character limit for Steam reviews."
Negative,"Bad Checkpoint Simulator: IIIDie and have to run back to the same area again, and have to pick up your experience/currency again. It just becomes a case of having the willpower to be bothered to hold sprint in a direction for 2-3 mins again. Bought this game to play co-op with a friend. Three games in and co-op is so clunky. You can't progress together- you just progress one person who can then only use the fire shrines if you leave, to get their pots back, travel and level up. If you die they have to summon you again. If they die they have to summon you again. CAN'T OPT OUT OF INVASIONS:During solo play if you have an 'ember' buff, you can get invaded by other players. (you can play offline as solo) Would probably ONLY recommend this game for solo players.If you manage to 4D chess into co-op with your friends, you open yourself up to invasions. You can lock co-op with a password, but invaders can still join regardless. Why is this an issue? You just started the game. The invader is a stupidly high level twink built for PVP. They can't be hit because of the sudden huge latency when they join, and if you do hit them you barely do any damage. They have much more experience in in-game combat mechanics, so you don't really stand a chance. This happens SO often , it makes the learning curve of the game horrible and almost unplayable.Bosses and combat are fun, but bad checkpoints, clunky co-op mechanics and laggy invasions make it really awkward for me. I'll probably complete it then not play it again.Even though I have this many hours, they're spent starting another character, because I want to try a new build, beginning the process of leveling and finding the spells, and giving up, because it's so tedious.This game takes things like Talent trees, game invites via Steam (or other), checkpoints, and throws them away. The game isn't difficult either, you can run 2h STR builds and 3 shot bigger enemies, the only reason it feels difficult, is because the learning curve time is lengthened by having to reach the same area over and over, if you die.Playing as a magic user or DEX user is randomly complete aids when compared to picking the biggest weapon you can find and putting points in STR.Magic users randomly need DEX, which doesn't benefit you in any other way than increasing your spell cast speed. It's never clear by how much, and you also need other stats for HP and carry weight. The aesthetic and combat system carry this game so heavily, but the leveling, co-op, vague/pointless story and awful checkpoint system make it a chore.Enemies have extremely weird hitboxes on attacks, give off no information on whether you can stunlock them with your combos or not, and make weapons where you can roll 100x and do one fast attack at a time best. Anything else is just trial and error, trying to do combos and a poise stat on enemies that you can't see result in you taking damage.They can also attack through walls..."
Negative,Servers not functional.
Negative,Controls dont show for computer users. This game is literally made for the consoles. The movement feels really snappy and not smooth. and the textures look botched around the edges dont buy this game if you dont want to tear your hair out trying to understand how to even use half the shit if you use computer.
Negative,"Purchased this game to play Co-Operatively, Co-Op features appear to have since been removed from the product and Steam store description. No update appears to have been provided by developers, but Steam store description has been quietly updated to remove reference to Co-Op features the game was sold with."
Negative,EVER SINCE I STARTED PLAYING THIS GAME MY INSOMNIA HAS GOTTEN WORSE COINCIDENSE? I THINK NOT
Negative,Not being able to play multiplayer is a deal breaker for me unfortunately. I wish I knew before I got the game that it was going to be permanent it seems.
Negative,"Don't review often.. but the servers have been down while they milk elden ring. Yeh, I'm a huge fan, but I cannot recommend this product honestly. And yes, I'm playing elden ring..."
Negative,"Fix Servers, if I wanted to play Offline i'd go outside. ):<"
Negative,"Got softbanned despite not cheatingThanks, fromsoft"
Negative,"This game looks nice and that's it, there is nothing else good about this game you should just play dark souls 1 and 2 and forget this one."
Negative,Don't fight these
Negative,"I recently completed the game minus Midir, which was more about fighting the shitty camera and RNG nature of his moveset than the actual boss. The good of DSIII would be the atmosphere, the set pieces and the music. The firelink shrine theme is possibly one of the better pieces of game music I've heard.The bad is kind of everything else. Too many ""gotcha"" moments like 1HKO boss moves and the majority of chests were mimics. Too many enemies with large sweeping arcs and jump attacks that close distance instantly. It's like they knew Artorias was a good fight so they just copied that mechanic without knowing what made it a good to begin with. Then on top of that they buffed the shit out of boss HP/resistance. Most of the late game fights and DLC bosses were not enjoyable and felt like a slog. Demon Prince/Midir being the worst offenders. On top of ruining what made DS enjoyable, they just copy/pasted so much from the first game it felt like I was playing ""Member Dark Souls?"""
Negative,well.. in this age every new game have some serious bugs and shity optimizationthis one is no exceptionim conctantly having crashes near bonfires
Negative,"Not as good as the former two. Tries to be Bloodborne while ignoring what made Bloodborne great. Poise is dead, the covenants are more or less all the same, and they still haven't fixed the issue of people abusing the cheat engine online during PvP. Grab it on sale, if anything."
Negative,This game suitable to play on console. Not suggest playing on pc.
Negative,Hack fraud game devs took 6 months to flip the server switch back on LOL
Negative,"Buggiest game I've ever had the pleasure of playing. I LOVE THIS GAME, but holy crap from soft, fix your shit"
Negative,"pretty shit game, a real snoozefest. boring as hell"
Negative,unfriendly to non-controller-gamers
Negative,ewwwwww so hard
Negative,Control camera character ? ever heard of this ?this game is a perfect example of a triple fail the the well know 3Cs that all gamedesigner should learn about before designing any game at all.
Negative,Enjoyed this game for many years. Roughly 3500 hours on PS4 and PC combined. My primary account was banned by hackers so my only option was to remake my builds on a family share account. Now the hackers have won. I can only recommend this game in offline only mode now for PC.
Negative,"Overall a great game but the unnecssary bans are ruining this game. Invasions need an option to turn on or off bc if you get invaded by a hacker your account will get flagged! Players are banned for nothing! I can only speculate it was being forced to play with a hacked invader that triggered my friends account to get the ban. Good job Bandai Namco for handling the problem...6/9/16 updateUpdating on my experience of the game. Still no change to my friends account being flagged as hacker account. This is absolutely the most frustrating gaming experience I have ever encountered. My friend did the whole report thing to the appropiate representative in his region to unflag his account, but doesn't look hopefully bc we reported it early May!6/22/16Finally my friends account was unflagged as a hacker after many weeks of waiting. We enjoyed the 2 days we were able to play togehter before his account got flagged as a hacker again. He isn't a hacker! T_T"
Negative,gets boring too fastfromsoft needs to step up their game for me to buy another game from them
Negative,Good game but cant go online anymore. they took it down months ago. prolly never comming back.
Negative,Dark Souls 2 is better.
Negative,"Imagine Miyazaki underwent a lobotomy making a new game, this is it."
Negative,dark souls I reskinned with very good roll mechanics.UP DATE: still dark souls I reskinned
Negative,"Cons:- Enemy tracking, endless stamina, endless combos and ridiculous movesets- Your reach vs. PVE-enemy reach- Forgettable bosses (compared to earlier games)- The random mechanic named ""Poise""- Defense & Absorbtion- Horrible community and their stupid catchphrases- You can parry a HUGE FUCKING GREATHAMMER with a little katanaProbably worst in the series."
Negative,"4 frustrating things for me right now:Auto lock-on does not exist, causing some awkward stabbing the ground that is right next to mob's foot.Doing a shitty kick when i try to move and attack and another weired skill that occur randomly, can't change skill combo keyHit space bar, fails, boss hits me, staggers, without pressing space again my char does a roll, waste my stamina and time.And the WORST, Trying to quit game have to back to menu have to see company logo then have to press a key to log in then have to wait for server to response JUST TO QUIT THE DAMN GAME.This is my first time playing a dark souls game so im a massive noob, but when i hear people say ""oh its so hard you'll get really salty"" i think that 50% of the difficulty and salt comes from the game being made so INCONVENIENT.This is just a early review though, but i doubt that the 4 points i ranted about will change, i'll just have to ""git gud"" and get used to the game's INCONVENIENCE.CONCLUSIONdon't buy this game if you are inpatient, even if u are good at playing games."
Negative,"I've choose to give a „no” - answering if I recommend it or not. On medium and powerfull sistems the game have a bad PC port, poor frame rate and a lot of crashes on desktop. The game needs a patch to offer the opportunity for all players to enjoy the experience in the game. Otherwise, the game looks fantastic, the world is beautiful, and the challenges are quite matching. I conclude and say that I wish that the money invested in this game to be fully worthwhile, even though the game can be refunded as a last resort.Therefore - the answer will remain „No”Later edit on the last patch:Maybe is not so bad.. update 2.0_2017 :)"
Negative,"Bugsouls IIINew day, new bugy sht. First day - sudden fps falling, second - suddenly game crashes, third - models of fantoms looks just like chess figures, just sliding on the ground.This game was more important for me, than for developers. Shame on you!UPD: Oh, after 15 minutes of last appcrash. Infinite loading when try to translocate between bonfires. My butt is on fire and reason is not hardcore gameplay.UPD: After 20-30 crashes game, at a five day, is just doesn't launches, black screen.From software. I. HATE. YOU."
Negative,"EDIT 2022: i'm so fucking glad they killed th servers. all FROM cucks have to suffer.The latest entry of the most overrated IP ever existed.Don't get me wrong, this could have been a good game, but it relies too heavily on making the player life too hard while performing most banal tasks.Armor is barely a thing through all the game. The heaviest armor often grants you nothing more than an 1 additional hit before dying.Poise has been reworked to be non-existent unless you use heavier weapons to perform some attacks.Having 1000/1300 health points is nearly worthless, since many late enemies can 2-shot you.Mastering the parry system requires dedication, is no longer natural like DS1most ""weapon arts"" are worthless in PvEfarming covenant currencies is a total PITA, nolifer worthy.the ""optional"" PvP aspect is beyond crap in general, held hostage by ultra-veteran tryhardsseriously, stay away from any online aspect of the game; it's not worth it.Now, the title of most annoying aspect of this series is held by its community.Fanatical people gatekeeps and backseats the game 24/7/365, booing every attempt to criticize even the most trivial aspects of the saga and/or everyone who doesn't think like a member of their hivemind.Its people love to claim to be superior to anyone, just because they can master their niche game."
Negative,Love the game.Only disliking due to the current state of affairs between Fromsoft and Cheaters/Hackers getting innocents punished with their current banning system.
Negative,dont do it pvp was a mistake
Negative,"Broken poise system.Terrible performance.Players with no animations when summoned.In short,Fix your game FailSoftware"
Negative,"I do not support review bombing, but in this case it's fair.Multiplayer is an integral part of the series, so removing it made the game incomplete.It's kinda sad news for me, because I couldn't play it to the end earlier.Now I'm stuck mid-game with no way to invade or get invaded. Game feels dead.Don't buy it."
Negative,"TL;DR -  If you want the game for the PvE and don't care about online I highly recommend the game. I personally don't have any performance problems except for a few frame drops every now and then. If you want it for online wait until it gets fixed.Dark Souls 3 is a fun game ruined by terrible online. And I'm not talking about lag or anything like that, I'm talking about the complete garbage anticheat that bans people that haven't done anything. The problems with covenants is another story and I personally don't think it's too bad because you can farm the covenant items (although very slowly), but the big one is the anticheat.So in case you aren't aware by now, the way this game detects somebody that cheats is very...unclear. All you get is a message that says ""invalid game data detected"". What does this mean? Who knows. It could be a mod, it could be a program that let's you use your controller of choice, or absolutely nothing at all. Even completely reinstalling your game won't help you after you see this message. You're fucked. Enjoy only being able to play online with other cheaters which, funnily enough, will soon have just as many legit players as those who haven't been flagged!Also, there has been word that the developement team is aware of the issue with the anticheat sucking ass and the cheating problem in general but lets be real here. This is FromSoft. Don't expect a fix any time soon. I wouldn't be surprised if it happens after a whole year and requires you to purchase the game again with very few changes for another 60USD (or your regional equivalent) with a ridiculous name like Dark Souls 3: Remembrance of the Embered King.Even if they do fix this I doubt the people that are banned will be unbanned. That's what happened with Dark Souls 2 and I am willing to assume that it will happen again. This is the FromSoft way. They refuse to be reasoned with. And since I think most people will use the online features at some point I would suggest just avoiding the game unless you plan on not touching online at all. If you do go online just be aware that you run the risk of getting flagged by being invaded by some guy that is cheating that can get your account flagged (yes, the people that actually cheat can get legit players banned), which will lead to an eventual ban. I personally have not been given a warning message or banned but I don't need that know how bullshit this is. Fix your game FromSoft."
Negative,"Since everyone keeps praising how good this game is, I will list all the problems this game has and leave out the good things.For anyone who isn't a casual player, this game is not hard by any means. The difficulty often comes from the fact that many of the bosses are so large that you can't see what they are doing half the time. (Iudex Gundyr 2nd phase, Curse-Rotted Greatwood, High Lord Wolnir, Yhorm the Giant) and sometimes boss hitboxes are inconsistent, especially when you are under or behind the boss. I counted about 30 deaths to all 15 or 16 bosses I killed. 2 deaths per boss on average is nothing compared to many other games with boss fights. I went with the default character, class and equipment most of the game. Halfway through I switched my sword and upgraded it, but that was all I did. No summons, and I didn't even need to think about tactics in this game.The camera messes with you, so most of the time I didn't lock on to enemies, and went with the free camera.Not sure who thought it was a great idea for the game to remember what button you pressed 1.5 seconds ago. For example, when pressing dodge at the start of the attack animation, the game still remembers that button press, and then dodges after the animation ends. Controls as a whole do not feel responsive, compared to most other games, even other ""souls-like"" games. Can't even cancel these long animations, which is the #1 reason of getting hit.There is little to no depth to combat and no need for tactics. You can beat every encounter with the same exact way. Dodge and hit. The only thing you need to change is when to dodge and hit. Yes there is parry and block, but parrying is a gimmick, and blocking just makes this game even easier than it already is.This game has a bad PC port. Can't recommend using mouse and keyboard since From Software did not properly implement support for it. I had not used a controller for 8 years, and had to relearn just to play this game. Mouse sensitivity even with the lowest setting is way too high. All info texts are made for controller, so good luck remembering the controls, since you need to go to the menu to look which button does what.Multiplayer for this game is just bad. This is the only game in history where playing with your friends makes the game worse. When playing alone and having ember effect, I get invaded maybe once every 3 hours. When I tried with my friend at the start of the game, we got invaded every 20 mins. This invasion BS combined with the fact that there is a hacker problem in this game. The hackers can delete your save file and get you permabanned, among other things."
Negative,"I have played a handful of Souls-likes even though the genre isn't my favorite, and DS3 just isn't up to par even for its time. I respect that some people live for this game, but even if I was really into this genre/style of game I would not recommend it. Remnant: From the Ashes builds upon the formula in a great way and includes a much better co-op experience that I would highly recommend over this one.Moving past the problems that most people have with souls-likes into specifically what is wrong with Dark Souls 3 in comparison to other games in its own genre:Input Buffering: this is really the biggest issue for me, and if this were handled like any other normal action game I could give DS3 a recommendation despite my other qualms. For a game based around precision and timing having such a long input buffer (3+ seconds) makes no sense. It completely takes control of your character away when you are a few milliseconds late on a dodge then after your character is done being staggered he stands to his feet then rolls from the dodge that you tried to do before the attack that downed you. At the end of the game I even was using the Murakumo and fell off an edge because I quickly double tapped LT, which used a heavy attack that took 2-3 seconds, then immediately followed up with the same exact attack even though I had not pressed any buttons in that time. A friend and I tested this for several different weapons and it occurred for many of them, reinforcing that this is a design choice and programmed functionality.Co-Op jank: Frustrating co-op play is standard for the genre, but it doesn't have to be. There is no co-op progress, you must do everything twice if you want to progress concurrently with a friend. Remnant easily does away with this jank, and any co op game as early as Borderlands 1 shows it is easy to do. The way the summon system is implemented paired with my next point is a huge detriment to DS3 that could easily be avoided.Invasions and Embers: Both of these things on their own would be a fine mechanic that furthers the punishing nature of the game, but being unable to turn off invasions and simultaneously losing the ability to play co-op when you are killed in an invasion removes control from players, limiting the already cumbersome feature of co-op play. The very first time I was able to go into co-op, my experienced friend joins on a new character and we take 5 steps and are invaded by a high level opponent invading people in the starting zone. This style of harassment is rewarded by the system, and to have it be uncapped by level letting end game players grief noobs reaches a level of idiocy in design that I have not seen since tripping in super smash.My other issues such as enemies striking through objects even though you cannot, and the decoupling of several stats pale in comparison to my main issues above, and I would never recommend this game to anyone since there are much better soulslikes that give the same experience with much more enjoyment."
Negative,"Righty let me start talking about my love hate relationship with this mess of a game, this is coming from an avid Bloodborne fan that tries to keep things from an objective point of view, I can't guarantee I wont be biased but tough luck, expect me to pull out some comparisons buckos.The combat feels rather more fluid than the previous dark souls games, however it shorts itself with how limitted the weapons feel how they have no ""weight"" to them, most weapons having very basic movesets and hit like wet noodles sometimes. Oh is that the Farron greatsword with a cool moveset? Too bad, mr. ParryGod6969 can easily deflect that with his tinfoil shield.Subjectively, shields are rather dumb. They enforce this turtling element on enemies and players which just causes the illusion of difficulty of waiting for someone to attack. Bloodborne's lack of shields and encouragement of parrying, though easier to perform, creates a more fun, fluid and faster gameplay.The FP bar is the biggest mistake FromSoft ever introduced.Parrying is a mess in this game since the game doesn't exactly telegraph what can and cannot be parried - tried to parry cucks with Zweihander and failed everytime, until I fucking searched up on the WIKI that you can't parry any of the attacks - so you mostly end up flailing your shield awkwardly blocking an attack to then get combo'd and stunlocked by an enemy or invader. Backstabs feel cheap, easy and unrewarding, in Bloodborne you have to charge a heavy in order to get a visceral attack.Balancing is fucking non-existent, unupgraded dark hand can destroy practically any enemy, a lot of weapons you'd think would be powerful actually suck massive schlong so you're ended up using meta weapons. The lack of poise is pretty shit, makes heavier armor pointless other than fashion and most rings are useless, so you end up mostly running Havel's ring, ring of favor, hornet ring and any other thing that's probably considered meta, at least some of the more considerably less effective runes in Bloodborne have some use to them.Gems are pointless and the resources are more so, when running boss or special weapons you cant infuse gems so what's the point? Bloodborne consistently had you use only 1 resource and the gems could be applied to anything and were more versatile then adding a bit of scaling.This is where shit really just goes downhill. Dead ends leading to nowhere, rooms you open with nothing inside and artificial difficulty at it's finest.Not a single zone in this game has peaked my interest, I'm happy to say I hate practically ALL of them. Launching a new character and going to Lothric always give me that sense of the dreaded ""well fuck this place again"" compared to the breath of fresh air I get everytime I appear in Yharnam in Bloodborne. By the time you'd reach the swamp you would want to bash your brains out with how confusing and much of a drag it might be to a new player and probably not even try to go through the pain that is Smouldering Lake. At least the Nightmare Frontier in Bloodborne was left as an optional area to do.Enemies mostly end up being not hard, just time wasting, especially shielded knights in Lothric and Irithyll. There is nothing hard about waiting for an enemy to attack and stop using their shield, you cant break through it without draining your stamina unless you have a UGS, at least Silver and Black knights are considerably more aggressive and more bearable to fight than just waiting for a Lothric spear knight to do another shitty shield bash for you to dodge or get stunlocked on. Some enemies are pointlessly infuriating and annoying, big example are the stupid goo piles in Anal Londo or Smouldering lake, abysmally large health pools with a pointless grab attack that is only harmful to your summon. Enemies sometimes either end up comboing you infinitely or sitting back as if watching a movie, so the AI is pretty much random whether it wants to do anything or not due to the lack of attack patterns. Shielded Pontiff knights are a fucking great example; either they charge at you so you can actually kill the damn thing or end up backing up constantly into a wall idling. Whilst some enemies in Bloodborne did this, they didn't back up against the same wall for 2 minutes straight for a small experiment.Let me get the good ones out of the way;Abyss WatchersDragonslayer ArmourVordtBoth Gundyr'sSoul of CinderDancerThese fights are probably the only ones you could probably remember to be fun to fight against, and the most memorable ones despite their issues. Most of the other bosses just end up being not hard to fight just time wasting and annoying, painfully difficult and unrewarding or just severely underwhelming.Getting the good stuff out of the way we'll start with Gundyr, the first boss of the game being an excellent beginner boss visually and in general being a good fight, well telegraphed attacks and never tries to bulshit you with stunlocks and one shots.  Champion Gundyr is a good chance to reflect on what you have learned from playing the game up to his fight, more prepared and a fucking excellent rematch.Vordt is just good, cool soundtrack and amazing visuals as usual.Abyss Watchers is probably the most universally liked fight, and I can see why. They don't feel cheap and bullshit, they're difficult yet fun to pitch yourself against. Closest thing I feel to fighting these guys is Maria from the Bloodborne Old Hunters DLC, and the second phase cutscene does bring flashbacks to Ludwig's own second phase...but why actually fight them when you can just cheese them by stunlocking them with the Black Knight Greatsword?? :omegalul:While you usually face off the Dancer later on in the game, you can technically face her off really early and BOI is she a fucking tough cookie, even later on her fight will have to struggle internally pushing you to almost have a mental breakdown thanks to your fragile mental state, and beating her will give you the biggest erection and scream you'll ever have in your life. Her difficulty mainly revolves around how unpredictable she is with her moveset rather than how much damage she deals or how aggressive she is, im contradicting myself here but fuck you beating her felt like I lifted off an entire truck off my shoulders.Dragonslayer Armour is good, nothing much about that other than his difficulty comes from big dick damage.As for the bad apples, Curserotted Greatwood is an example of one of the many bad fights in the game, not necessarily hard, but just annoying to deal with, hitting sacks and dodging simple attacks and then 2 shotting an arm, Wolnir too feels cheap, easy and can be done without a single estus flask, Deacons of the Deep are a joke, just a typical add fight, Old Demon King feels like a rehash of many past bosses FromSoft made, Yhorm is just.. sad, a wasted fight, and everything else feels just like a blur.It's garbage. It really is.The net code is bad, invaders are shit, covenants even more shit, summons get one shotted to shit and dare I say how awful is the large part of the community with the ""get gud"" mentality. Invaders end up usually being pests, either killing you or you killing them, an occassional bad player who you feel bad about because he clearly doesn't know the game, a hacker who cares or the good guy who actually doesn't make running through Irithyll or Crucifixtion Woods a living hell (shoutout to Brotron 9000.)TL:DR, this isn't a bad game necessarily, but if you want an introduction to FromSoft games, get yourself DS1 or a ps4 for Bloodborne."
Negative,"This may be a good game, but it is not for everyone.The game is made for console and extremely unfriendly for PC players.As for game experience goes, as PC player who try to play with controller, adds more into how 90% of the game is pathfinding and running back after death. 10% of the game is chance to do actual combat. Using mouse can be glitchy, making it unreliable. Boss is extremely easy compared to the path to get there. Mobs hit through walls, whereas you cannot. Enemy arrow go through other mobs and hits player. There is an option to kick in the game, but made extremely hard to use for some reason, unable to change key to simply kick. Autolock only work if very close in proximity."

Negative,"I haven't played other From Software games but till I play another one, this is the worst game I have ever played."
Negative,trashinb4: git gudwhy would i git gud if gitting gud isnt fun
Negative,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the game. Bought the dlcs a year later and reinstalled it. Only to realise there are no cloud saves and now I've lost 60 hours of progress :(I really don't understand how FromSoft prices this higher than Elden Ring when it doesn't even support cloud saves. I've literally never had to worry about that until now"
Negative,"This is probably the most depressing review I have made thus far and it brings me no joy. I have to say I love Dark Souls, I have over 300 hours in Dark Souls 2 and around 100 hours in Dark Souls and yet I could not bring myself to like this game... Well, that is not true, I still like the core that is Dark Souls, but it felt to me as if the gameplay is shifting for a different audience.I think I do not like this game because it does not reward patience and measured approach as in the previous games, the enemies have harder to predict attack patterns, they are much faster and they have infinite stamina in that they are attacking constantly. Which encourages you to attack first and stunlock enemies. You can say that Dark Souls 2 had some hard to predict attack patterns as well (Heide Knights), but with higher speed it is even more blatant in here. This can be very obvious when using parry, since there is a same parry animation as in Dark Souls 2, where it is slightly delayed than in Dark Souls you have to parry a little bit earlier. However since the attack animation is faster than in Dark Souls 2 sometimes you have to predict when the enemy will attack to successfully parry. Maybe it is my fault that my reflexes are not as they used to be and I have actually read in some interviews that players are responding positively to this type of combat, but this is not a game for me. In the same interview I have also read that it is supposed to be high risk/high reward type of gameplay, but I feel that high risk/high reward was actually done much better in previous games, while this one encourages a ceratin way of playing.TLDR: I do not like the highpaced combat, feel as if this is a downgrade over previous games."
Negative,"I really enjoyed Dark Souls 2 and Dark Souls 3.They're very unique and great games.I could write about the lore. The writing is GREAT!What is the problem?Cheaters.They can ruin your save files, hack into your PC, or even just take away all the joy from this game.You can play offline, but many fun features of this game were meant for multiplayer, stuff like factions, co-op, boss fighting with helpers or invasions to make people angry.Those things are fun, but cheaters dominate the game. It's impossible to play it, plus I read the news about full control exploit, so ...The studio even ignored the problem! The people who discovered it (or 1 person was it?) reported it to them. They didn't even bother to thank them and take care of it!This game is dead. I wanted to play Elden Ring but I am highly skeptical because of all of this.It was a fun game and not too difficult (dark souls 2 was more difficult tbh), but it becomes repeatable and cheaters destroy all the purpose of playing it."
Negative,Servers down for a long time
Negative,Servers still down and absolutely no ETA of when it'll be fixed. Not worth the price.
Negative,Couldn't fuck the Nameless King
Negative,"made for consoles not pc controls hello?(like tf is lb or rb etc),(hope that elden ring will have key maps)unresponsive bitch"
Negative,the second boss is too hard
Negative,i want to die
Negative,Not a fan of Fromsoftware; They seem to focus entirely on combat and nothing else ever gets enough explanation or logic. Corpse runs are shit and losing experience due to invaders who are WAY over-leveled is the extra salt I didn't ask for.
Negative,"The positives:Hands down one of the most detailed and breathtaking games visually. I was taken aback at how amazing each enemy design was, each massive area was just epic in terms of scale and beauty. I would find myself lost in these worlds for hours just looking and admiring the level of detail put into the world.Ran well. Didn't have any stuttering or clipping issues. Crashed once but the issue was on my end of things. The negatives:The story...The story...? Well, yes there is a story. A veritable buffet. It's in the locations, the items, the NPC's you find. It's there you just need to find it. Or just read the story that's conveniently found on a few websites here and there. I was hoping personally that a game this visually amazing would have a lot more lore in game to find. Hell I wouldn't even mind text logs found in a *Cough* library in game. But I couldn't find a more direct line of story. Which isn't the worst thing in the world. Hell I prefer games that don't force story in my face. But I had to go a lot more out of my way than I expected to receive context for why I was doing what I was doing.The camera. Please. I want to keep it locked on the enemy. I don't want to look way randomly. No, I don't want the camera to get jealous when an enemy traps me in a corner and teleport to look away from the enemy. Camera. Camera please.And of course the real killer for me, the controls. For all intents and purposes it works....fine I guess. It's as realistic I can expect it to be. Thankfully you can increase your stats and wear armor so you can roll decently well. If not enjoy being open to most every attack when you roll. But I can't help but feel that I'm not playing with the right build on a lot of the enemies when I only do paltry damage compared to their mighty 2 hit kills. I can guess at the number of times I made a single mistake in a boss fight and just died because of it. I enjoy a challenge now and then, but this is a bit much at times. With a bit more polish I would've enjoyed the combat in this much more. I believe the main cause of this being the staggering amount of weapons and spells you can use. No way it can be adequately balanced. Especially seeing the sorcery builds online that kill most bosses in 3-4 hits. So there definitely needs to be some tweaking done there. Sekiro was much better in regards to combat because of this very reason I believe.I only did 2 of the endings before I found myself dreading another playthrough. And that's when I leaned on the decision to stop. When the game stops being fun you should stop playing, naturally.The game was gifted to me, and while I'm thankful for it, I think a gift is where it should stay at. At most I would spend 10 dollars just for the environment alone. But for getting the story and lore? I can watch several videos on the subject and get as much if not more enjoyment from watching others expound on the game."
Negative,"Absolute shit of a game. Got this game on sale for 15 dubs and refunded it because of how much dog water this game is. Imagine buying this for 60$ !! robbery! this game is not worth playing for free.1-Fps locked at 60 fps , i get massive screen tearing with modern hardware (5900x/3080ti/240hz gsync monitors VRR) 2-Game looks half assed on pc and looks like it belongs on console, there is xbox controls all over the menu, cant exit to desktop."
Negative,Worst Xbox to PC port you've ever seen. All the 'tutorial' is in Xbox language still. Press b. Press right trigger.Buy an Xbox controller if you want to play it.
Negative,It was way too hard and grindy instead of fun.
Negative,"When u play for 14 hours on a character and bandi namco makes u delete it for finding ""illegal items"" on it. Have never modded or hacked the game. This is bs"
Negative,bc kyu bnana tha itna hard
Negative,this game is sweaty and yes i have beaten all of the bosses
Negative,"Shit co op, spent 30 mins just trying to play, it works, then someone comes to kill me and i can't get it to work again after hours of trying. uninstalled right after, shit port, shit game, shit co op 1/10"
Negative,"Just play Dark Souls 1 or 2 instead. This isn't super hard or anything, it just feels like a chore and it seems like it's pandering. Also feels slightly dumbed down. I don't know, I really tried to enjoy this game but I instead played both the previous games."
Negative,Action aspect and boss design is good BUT I hate those illusory walls. Invisible bridge ... joke ... and those quests ... I mean ... without internet you have close to no chance to complete any questline here ... This was my first souls game I have played and I nave no intentions to play another.
Negative,"One of the worst console ports I have ever played. Coop with a friend worked for 30 seconds until we got crashed by some random, then never worked again."
Negative,"Pretty bad, much worse than dark souls 1 and 2, i would not recommend the base game at all. I didnt try the dlc though but i will probably skip it."
Negative,"bad game, died a lot"
Negative,I cant play this game and after 5.5 hours of trying and not managing to getting passed the first boss.
Negative,lost 1 pvp match = pvp is shit
Negative,"WTF, one day I wanted to play and turns out my character flipped gender from female to male.DS2 is still better GFYS!"
Negative,only get it if you have trouble falling asleep
Negative,very hard game cant kill first boss
Negative,"Garbage Game, Devs clearly do not care for the people that play this game. -I have now played the game more and beat the whole thing, and this game still sucks terribly.Updated 3/16/2023: I've currently played through the game 4 times and have beaten more SweatLords and NeckBeards than i can even count. Once you get up to a high enough level(200+) the game is dead. If you're lucky you'll end up having a 1v1 with the same guy until one of you gets bored, then it's back to waiting for more than 30-60 minutes at a time no matter where you try to invade or get invaded. This game in my opinion is STILL terrible and only worth playing if you enjoy an extremely frustrating and challenging experience. BTW this game is nowhere near worth $60 after all the times the servers have gotten shut down for weeks/months at a time as well as the fact that this game is extremely unfriendly to all new-players."
Negative,its so bad. dont play.
Negative,I died. Bad game.
Negative,give my friends back
Negative,Terrible interface on PC.  Unplayable with keyboard and mouse.   it had great reviews but it was absurd how hard it was to try to play on PC.   several actions were mapped to spacebar and trying to remap them looks like it works but then doesnt change.   This is the first game ive ever request a refund for.  it took 30 minutes to figure how to quit and i think i just killed it in task manager.
Negative,"Not worth it, support team is god awful. Started the game up for the first time on PC (Already beaten it a few times on PS4) and not even into avatar creation and I get the YOU CANT PLAY ONLINE CAUSE INVALID GAME DATA! You have been penalized!So...I'm like...wtf? I just started the game up and auto get this message?? So I reinstall thinking I had a corrupted file or something, same message. Contacted support, they told me their ""server team"" saw I was using changed game data to give myself an advantage online. My response was a little heated as I had just fucking started the game up and auto got this message. In short, don't buy this game on PC, they just wanna fuck you.I did find out what caused it though in the end. Riot's shitty ass Valorant ""anticheat"" apparently registers as a hack for some games. Be careful and fuck off Riot (and FROM Software, fuck these guys too.)"
Negative,"Don't get me wrong, I consider this game to be a masterpiece of game design. But be aware that the PC version has a MASSIVE hacker problem. Currently, if you play online hackers are able to inject hacked items into character inventories, and this will cause you to be banned by the games own automated anti-cheat software within a week, even if you immediately delete the character. You can appeal the ban, but it will take close to a month and if it happens a 2nd time it will be permanent. Unless you want to spend a lot of time dealing with third party guard dog software or risk losing all online features, I highly recommend playing the console version instead. And I do highly recommend the game itself."
Negative,"My time on this game is way overblown as I leave my computer on all the time, so Im not really sure how long it took, but during quarantine it's easy to lose track of time.Overall, I did enjoy the game but as I got towards the end I was getting tired of the games design and some of the boss and enemy design decisions started getting on my nerves. I know some of these are put in to keep the players on their toes, but eh, it has it's place but DS3 seems to be littered with these decisions. I actually purchased this to see what all the ""Dark Souls is difficult"" talk was about, but on a personal note, I can't say I'd play this again and if I did recommend it to someone, it would be with significant warning.Things I LikedThe ambiance is fantastic and I loved the general feel of the world. The enemies, bosses, and characters all matched perfectly and really made you feel like you were in a dying world. One of the bosses quotes ""This place is our grave, and you can rest here too, if you like."" is so chilling and perfectly defines what this game is about. The enemy variation in this game is fantastic as each level has multiple types, each with different attack patterns, abilities, etc and it really keeps the levels interesting.The weapon designs are awesome and the leveling system feels very fair as the game tends to naturally level you up correctly as you progress. Yes, you could just farm and become OP, but I didn't see a need for that whereas in other games the leveling can be pretty terrible.The combat is pretty visceral and the weapons sound fantastic. I finished my game with a +10 Ultra Great Sword and the sound of that thing hitting an enemy, or even the ground never got old.What I Didn't LikeProgressing Through The LevelsOnce you go through the first few levels you'll understand how to go about ALL the levels. For me, I would move out a little to see all of the games ""surprises"" then go back and heal, which resets the level, and then move out a little further to find out more tricks because my god they are everywhere. This game will have enemies drop from ceilings, pop out of walls behind you, or send out swarms of enemies to impede forward progress so you essentially need to memorize where all of these what I call ""gimmicks"" are before you progress so you have enough HP and Estus (health potions) to fight the levels boss(es). Then, once you find the boss location, it's a matter of running through all of the enemies and slam your head into the boss as many times as it takes to defeat them.GimmicksIll probably get a lot of flack for this, but this was my biggest gripe with this game. Many of the design decisions seemed to revolve around irritating the players versus progressing the story, levels, characters, or even bosses.  For example: The bosses have 2 or 3 stages where the first stage tends be to fairly straightforward but then they all have a second infinite stamina hyper aggressive second stage --- shoot laser beams, grow huge appendages, multiply, etc. I also felt like a lot of them had cheap mechanics that again, were more to irritate the player than to make them interesting. For example many bosses have attack timings or delayed attacks specifically designed to bait out roles, that if you role too early (or too late), will result in 1/2 your health bar being wiped away. Another example is enemies placed specifically to prevent run throughs (to the bosses) where you can tell an enemy was specifically programmed (jutting out from behind a wall, significantly faster than the other enemies) to interrupt running by just the first time. The last example Ill give is in the rafters in the cathedral level, where they place a knight with a crossbow that has enough power to knock you off to your death if it hits you from a slight angle. The game is littered with these gimmicks so it essentially forces the player to memorize a level's tricks as well as the boss's tricks to complete.Story, Character, Boss DepthI haven't played the other souls games, but this one does almost nothing to make me care about any of the characters, story, or bosses in general (I played the Witcher 3 over Christmas, which was a master class in story telling, character development, and world building). I've read some of the wiki articles but overall, I feel the game just lacks a lot of story telling depth. The game really could have done a fantastic job of using the levels and NPCs to really develop the world far beyond what the fantastic scenery and environment do for it. But hey, maybe that's not what they were going for.Final thoughtsI get why people like this game (and others similar to it), as it does have a lot of depth in the build paths, character creation and development (your character). The game is definitely difficult and the player must be keenly aware of their surroundings at all times, and yes, it does feel awesome to finally beat a boss through practice and trial and error that you've lost to more than enough times (f'in Pontiff). But, I feel the game could have done so much more with the world and stories than what it did, and what it did do, felt so ""Hollow."" This coupled with the general boss design and enemy layout design, I can't say I'd give a profound yes to a friend about playing this."
Negative,"Now my opinion might be different since this isn't the typical type of game I play (and I didn't play it for very long because you can only play 2 hours before being unable to refund games) but none the less there are some things I want to point out.First of all and probably the most obvious the controls, or the lack of them.There are no PC/Computer controls ANYWHERE, you have to look it up or else you have no idea, and some of them don't even go over everything. There's also the fact that the PC controls that do exist are not great.I have to right click to get a menu (that still has controller buttons) to exit or something else.It's incredibly clunky and it doesn't make sense for a game with such a high price tag to be on steam if you only know 5 controls on your own, if even that.Then there is obviously the difficulty, how it's completely unfair, and how the hell are you supposed to get a feeling for the game in 2 hours when the first boos probably takes at least 10 esspecially if you've never played a game like this before.(They also had this sale before the summer sale which was 75% off, then when the Summer sale started the price was exactly the same?)I'd say MAYBE get it on a sale, though once again the 2 hours are going to be really pressing, but only do it if you're up for one heck of a challenge and you've played (difficult) games like these before or you're a Souls fan I guess, though you probably already have this if so.It's slow, not my type of game, but I won't discourage you from buying/playing it if YOU so desire."
Negative,"im not even kidding. this game looks so f..kin cool. but seriously, its the 3rd dark souls released. i can understand having keybinding and general game play issues in the first one, but still? come on. seriously, if your going to release a game on steam, at least make it work as one would expect a pc game would."
Negative,"Game will no longer launch, goes to white screen and then crashes. I've tried all of the dumb suggestions out there on the internet and have reinstalled 3 times on 2 different drives, restarted steam and computer, updated drivers, messed with Nvidia control panel and the closest I ever got was the game freezing on the EULA. Game is a spaghetti coded mess."

Negative,"Dark Souls, I like you.  I really do.  I've played from Demon's Souls all the way up until now (on varying consoles).Dark Souls II was mediocre at best, but the feel of the original game is back in all it's charm here.  The areas are great, the enemies are what you would expect, bosses are fun and engaging....but I can't recommend you.I'm not mad...I'm just...disappointed.The last 30 or so hours of my playtime have been devoted, more or less, devoted to PVP.  I can't tell what's more annoying - the hitbox that sometimes spans your entire screen and then onto the floor or the ineffectiveness of covenants.  Blades, Faithful, Watchdogs...doesn't matter...I can idle for five hours (glad I was playing other games in the background) with one of them and not be summoned a single time.  However, I'm public enemy number one when invading, dear god I've never seen so many Blades and Blue phantoms in my life.There's no point in writing long reviews, people will buy what they find interesting anyway.  TL;DR - Demon's Souls is the respected father.Dark Souls is the oldest son that everyone loves.Dark Souls II is the middle child that nobody really knows what to do with.Dark Souls III is the youngest child that everyone had high hopes for, but he can't live up to."
Negative,"Its the sequel to Dark Souls 1 that many[including me] have been waiting for. However in a torn state.Problem is its massive unbalances in PVP. You'll run into T-posed players who'll just stand frozen and hit you. Invaders are horribly outnumbered, and are punished severly.R1 spamming is greater than ever, poise is dead, estus chugging has amplified (no longer punishable), roll spam. Ultra greatswords have insane hyper-armor that make them completely immune to interruptions.PVP is what keeps me around for Souls-games and currently its full of frustration and issues. For the most part. If you want less cancerous PVP, go play DS1.I'll retract my current opinion when the issues this game faces have been resolved, doesn't necessarily have to be all of them.About the PVE... its not DS1 2.0. I don't mind the less connected world. Lots of ambushes (DS2 tier of bad). World design is top notch (great seeing quality of this magnitude after DS2). Lovely animations from DS1, albeit reworked to a small degree. Great soundtrack. Color variety among the levels seem to be lacking, everything looks desaturated.PVE is alright, not many qualms about it. I don't stick around for PVE though."
Negative,its alwys disconnect in online mode :(
Negative,"Crashing bug again and again, sucks!Welcome you to the Desert of the Real PC world !"
Negative,"Despite not having the best computer, I can still run many games newer games on the highest, to next to highest settings. I have EVERYTHING turned down to either Low or Off with Dark Souls 3, and although it looks worse than most new games I've played, the frame rate is often times horrid, I constantly crash, cannot play online (kicks me for low frame rate and kicks me to the main menu. really, you can't just log me off online? you have to completely drop me out of the game? I don't even want to summon anyone, I just want to read/leave notes ffs), and the intial loading screen into the game takes about 3-5 minutes to complete loading. Very poorly optimized. Would not recommend until this is fixed."
Negative,"The game is constantly crashing (day 2 of realease)I have a decent rig, and i could play the game for about 1 hour, or 2. After that my game crashes even on first load. It loads then crashes. I have a AMD FX 6300 and a Asus 750 Ti OC. Overclock on both (cpu to 4100). I just don't know what to do ... I tried the set the lighting to low (and the virtual memory ""fix"", and the knight as the character ""fix"", and wearing a helm at all times ""fix"") And everything to low for that matter, which didn't improve framerates AT ALL . How does that work? I'm also running windows 8.1 if that's relevant. All NVIDIA drivers are up to date. This is so disappointing..., i was waiting for this realease so much but the crashes on load are just murder. ... Is it too late to get a refund? I pains me but i cannot recommend this game on PC. It's just terrible performance wise and compatibility wise. Feelsbadman"
Negative,This game has crashed more 50 times now In the first experiment
Negative,"I am plagued by non-stop game crashes as well as hard freezing my PC. My save file became corrupted and lost. FORM software, like every other Japanese developer, seem to be incapable of releasing a quality PC port."
Negative,Game doesn't even run for me
Negative,"FIX THE BONFIRE BUG! I have already tried lowering the lighting settings, unequipping my shield seems to help as well, but now I find myself unable to play the game at all, because I am saved at a bonfire, the last 15 attempts to start my game have gone from loading screen to an almost immediate crash,  I have to give this game a broken/10."
Negative,"Can't play cause of random crashes. Shortest game session was 5 seconds, longest up to 30 minutes.A big latdown to see such a low quality port after great DS2 PC version.Guess i'll refund it and go for PS4 version - its better to be able to play in 30fps than not being able to play at all."
Negative,controller doesnt work
Negative,too many crashes... one would think the devs would do better than this....
Negative,"Crashes when loading the game, better wait until the bugs are patched out, otherwise a big positive revieuw"
Negative,Not Dark Souls 2
Negative,"At least half my time in this game was spent trying to get it to stop crashing. I give up. The amount of troubleshooting this game requires to become stable just isn't worth it. Don't get me wrong, it's a great game. But this port is absolute garbage. I've found a seemingly endless amount of posts on various forums complaining about these problems and a concrete solution is nowhere in sight. As a result, the game just isn't worth purchasing in its current state. So unless you have the magic combination of hardware required in order for this game to not crash, steer clear."
Negative,"Massive Security Vulnerability. Potentially everyone who played a souls game or the Elden ring beta could have had their pc hacked, banking details stolen, passwords compromised, etc. From Software pretended like this wasn't a thing despite multiple reports and finally started to take action once a white hat got sick of them doing nothing and exposed this vulnerability on a livestream. FromSoftware has handled this very poorly, is dragging their heels, is not transparent about what is occuring and as a result I do not believe people should support them at this time."
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 being the easiest of the Dark Souls games is pretty terrible and boring.They tried to make it more like bloodborne as dark souls but it failed by turning into bloodborne but as dark souls. It is not ""hard but fair"" like they try to make it out to be. It is just a trip down memory lane with copy and pasted maps from other dark souls games. Combat is pretty screwed up most of the time with some kind of networking problem on pvp. When my sword hits a player they will often not receive damage until after the second or third time I have physically hit them. The invasions last forever with everyone having a ton of estus and it seems invasions suck for the invaders and those being invaded.  Invaders deal with a huge amount of nerfs and when they invade they are put into people's worlds that summoned phantoms first above all. Sometimes as an invader it can be 1vs4 and it is totally possible for them to be hundreds of levels above you since summoned as a phantom . So if you plan on trying to play with a friend, expect every 20 seconds to 2 minutes to be invaded. It wasn't unusual for me to die as a phantom after an invasion and immediately be invaded in my own world. Lothric castle is the first place you can go to start playing with your friends and also it seems the most invaded place with people that have end game gear to kill you as you try to navigate through the maps. Now I understand that people can argue it is totally fair with all the nerfs to go through the whole game as a level 15 character and get endgame gear to invade first time players. Sounds totally fair, because it is the ""dark souls player experience"". I love invasions in dks 2 it was fun and there was a challenge because phantoms couldn't  use estus during an invasion, it was more fair and more fun for everyone. But this beginning of the game invasion spam when you are just trying to play with a friend or just happen to be embered is stupid. You might have better luck soloing this area or be doomed to everybody and their momma trying to kill you.   My final frustrations with this game are the gimmick and trick combat policy, bosses not playing by the games own rules and how there is not really help at all on direction. The reason this is the easiest of the Dark Souls games is because you can pretty much cheese every boss and if you know the trick to the gimmick then you can basically beat the game without even trying. BUT if you don't know the trick, then it  screams and takes a big hot fudge monkey on your face . It doesn't reward you for doing something right, it just punishes you until you guess the trick or look up the trick. I also gotta say, it is super cool to fight multiple enemies, or even just one that have unlimited stamina and do 3-8 hit combos that not only shield break you but break your poise no matter what armor you wear (poise is broken). That means once one hits you, it is possible for everyone else around you to put their combos in. Bosses not playing by the games own rules blows my mind away. The bosses usually have an insta kill attack that can pop out at different times, some bosses do them when at 5% health. They can swing and completely miss you while you are behind them and still get hit, through your shield. Sometimes the game just decides that you die instantly when they miss or walking through the fog gate and hit with an AOE that hits 80% of the map (Old demon king boss). Finally, it is dumb how difficult it is navigating through some places and knowing why you are supposed to be there are unless you google it. It's not a hard game,  getting gud just means you found out the tricks online or by yourself . DKS 2 is way better, the third was supposed to fix the new features and tune them, not add on a bunch of things that they have zero interest in improving and go "" oh well, it's the last dark souls anyways so I'll just not care as the game developer about keeping a player base by area  banning phantoms and invasions (all multiplayer functions in that area) after the player beats a boss  lawl moniesss haha"" Isn't that great? I'd say that is pretty smart, you wouldn't want customers who buy your products to keep playing your games for multiplayer. Various videos circulating youtube on why it is a bad and dying game. I suggest stick to the other dark souls games, this one is just a joke."
Negative,"Game has a random chance of crashing every time I kill an enemy in the starting area. Will see if changing the settings around fixes it since I am already playing as the Knight. (which many say fixes the crashing in the first area.) Will change review once game works without crashing. ;w;EDIT: Lowering lighting quality to low helped until I tried to leave the first boss area, which just instantly crashed my game.EDIT 2: after 2 hours of messing around with the settings, I managed to open the first door in the game without crashing. But now every time I kill an enemy the game consistently crashes. This wonderful game experience has now become absolutely unplayable for me.-Lowering lighting to low, using Knight as a starting class, and turning off/downgrading some of the settings does seem to fix the game for a good percentage of the people suffering crashes. Other than that, I've got nothing :/Really this isn't a massive issue to get salty over because the majority of players don't have this issue, but enough players do have this issue to the point that From Software should have caught it. And really, it isn't just the crashing. It's the glitches and the occasional mechanic that fails to work properly that gives the impression that From didn't really spend as much time playing their own game as they should have, even if that may not be the case.Especially after the first two Souls games had issues with both of their releases on PC. It just seems odd that a group with a history successful and amazing game worlds would create a game with these issues. Although I've no idea what the crashing computers all have in common, if you have an excellent gaming computer, I doubt that you'll have any issues with the game. That being said, I'd recommend looking up the glitches online or waiting for the April 18 patch to see if you think it'd be a good idea to buy the game.Or just....buy it for a console system."
Negative,It would have been nice to know that this game was never ported properly to PC before I purchased. Controls & instructions are all displayed in xbox controller format - there's no way to fix this from what I gather.
Negative,"For me personally, this game was a waste of time. Progression is painstakingly slow, 3 steps forward, 2 steps back. And when you finish the game, it ended in a very unsatisfying manor. It didn't justify the 90+ hours I've poured into this game. If time is valuable to you, maybe give this one a miss."
Negative,"If you buy these games for the online aspect, do not that at the moment or possibly ever. FromSoft is a typical successful gaming company run by the usual lazy people in this industry, so one of the key aspects might never work on PC without private servers because they keep reusing the same stupid engine and didn't notice a vulnerability in over 10 years. They said a fix is ""pending"" over 4 days ago. When someone contacted them about it, they didn't have an estimate of when it would be fixed. This RCE exploit affects all Souls games, btw. It's just harder to do on consoles right now, but you can bet that will change sooner or later.I get the reuse of assets, animations, etc. I somewhat get the shameless plagiarism of Berserk, but how the hell can you reuse something that has such fundamental issues and not notice it for this long? And all this would have been somewhat excusable if they hadn't been contacted about this issue over 8 months ago. Their response? It was essentially ""we don't care, go away."" Shameful.Edit: Servers were ""fixed"" after months of doing nothing, down again in less than a week. What a joke of a company."
Negative,"the keyboard and mouse controls for this game are HORRID!, to many actions bound to a single key assignment etc,"
Negative,"Servers are so bad you cant play multiplayer, the whole multiplayer part just doesnt exist"
Negative,lost my save lolcrashes like a lil bitch
Negative,no steam cloud support;apart from that 10/10
Negative,Servers are back on.
Negative,! this game is TOO HARD i QUIT
Negative,"PC controls suck.  At the very least, they could have had the tutorial reflect keyboard controls, instead of Xbox.Played 1 hour, paid $60.  Just not enjoying it."
Negative,NO MULTIPLAYER ! Cuz FROMS*ITWARE wants your money for elden ring.
Negative,Doesn't support 21:9 or 144hz...
Negative,"love the game, but don't buy it until they fix the online problem. I'd instead borrow a free copy from an alternate source since it provides the same exact experience as this game does in it's current state"
Negative,"Si eres de Argentina NO COMPRAR. La gente de BANDAI NAMCO tiene que saber que si ponen precios absurdos por sus juegos, la comunidad NO LOS COMPRA. Nosotros imponemos las reglas, esto no tiene que ser consola 2 donde la gente compra los juegos por €80 y se les cobra por el online. Si todos nos unimos quizás podamos solucionar esta situación y recuerden: UN JUEGO DE 2016 NO VALE LO MISMO QUE UNO DE 2021 esto no es nintendo donde la gente sigue pagando precio completo por juego de hace 10 años.

Negative,"DISCLAIMER: this review is specifically written in the context that this game is essentially the fifth in it's franchise, and the third one on PC.Bullet points:+ Beautiful graphics and art direction, environments are incredibly detailed and often even dynamic, and the design of many enemies is jaw-dropping.+ Great bossfights, a big step up from Dark Souls II, this one puts real effort into having interesting bossfights, even if some of them come off feeling gimmicky.+ Fast, and infrequent loading screens- Stale combat which struggles to come up with new mechanics and fails to fix problems that exist since Demon's Souls- Lazy level design, while the world itself is beautiful, most of the levels use very similar structures and gameplay concepts (like having to run through a level while an enemy in the distance shoots projectiles at you, hope you like doing that 'cuz it's what you do in 8 out of 10 levels in this game). Levels also suffer from being too big to be fun or memorable- Uninspired story and lore, this game rehashes the same plot from the first and second game yet again, if that's not going through the motions i don't know what is, the lore is also either poorly thought out, or recycling of old ideas.- Technical issues, similar to Nier Automata, certain GPUs have serious issues running this game, even though they easily surpass the requirements- Ashes of Ariandel DLC is awful, it's short, it's lazy, its boring, and it's easy. it is the exact opposite of the Ringed City DLC.- Bloodborne influence, while Bloodborne itself is a very good game, a lot of design mentalities have been carried over from that game to this one, which, taking into account the difference in mechanics and tone, gives Dark Souls III a strange feeling, like it's lost in a limbo between the first Dark Souls and Bloodborne.- Promises unfulfilled, many early interviews promised a drastic change in structure to previews games, things like placing your own bonfires in the world, different ways of interacting with other players, and more, but none of that is in the game, and only traces can be found of these systems deep in the game files.At the end, all we are left with is same old stale dark souls yet again, only this time this is the actual end, and what a sad end to this franchise it is.Dark Souls 1 was right, no matter how hard you try, you can't keep relighting the same flame forever, all you will get is seeing how, slowly and painfully, it dies away."
Negative,"Had a copy gifted to me so my friends and I could all play together. ""Detected FPS issue"" has me sitting listening to my friends be absolutely lost in this game while I sit and wait for a fix. Even as a game I got for free, was not worth the money."
Negative,servers have been down for 7 months now i will never buy a game from these fucking idiots again
Negative,This is not a PC game this is a console game that took a wrong turn. No effort at all has been made to make this a PC game. not even mapping keyboard keys to any logical place. Had to make a refund request for this one.
Negative,Looked fun but i cant get past the first boss
Negative,POS is broken
Negative,"This game promotes racism. I played with two other players, now I say the n word multiple times in the same sentence."
Negative,watered down version of previous souls games
Negative,Fucked up regional price
Negative,Fuck you devs for not giving us a thought out pc port. give me my controls thoughtfully
Negative,"The game is not worth 60 bucks without the multiplayer part. And since Elden Ring is out for almost 2 months now with servers up and running (barely functional though most of the time), I'm guessing they're not interested in fixing the issue for this 6 year old game which they are nonetheless still selling for full price. Meh."
Negative,"Dark Souls III is certainly better than Dark Souls II in almost all regards except one: Combat.The imperfect and apparently rushed melding of Bloodbourne and Dark Souls combat led to a system that is a chore to get through. A system where nothing except the speed or quantity of attacks matters since there is no poise, but, unlike in BB, also no recourse like quickstepping or parrying from a distance. For the first time in the series, you actually can die without doing anything wrong yourself."
Negative,"First off, it's definitely got a lotta core gameplay upgrades from the first game, for example:>holding a direction on the d-pad to auto-revert to the first item equipped in said slot>better dodge-rolling while locked-on and circling a target>being able to burn multiple souls all at onceI've never played the second, so the standard I have to compare this game to is only the first one the trilogy; however, with that said this still feels a bit too derivative of the first game in terms of its themes and storytelling to the point that I don't believe this game could legitimately stand as its own product without having the pedigree of the series itself backing it up.A lot of the areas do look cool, but they don't feel cool playing, especially places like Farron Keep with environments that poison and slow movement.At that point and even beyond I feel like the game is more intent on providing unnecessary difficulty ramps, like pushing the player to fight upwards of 5+ enemies at once despite the game's fighting mechanics clearly favoring methodical one-on-one battles.Stuff like that make you rather wanna turn it off and go back to play the first one despite how flawed it was.As a game it's honestly not that bad, and pretty satisfying at times, even. But looking at it as its own product I cannot recommend it unless you already have a prior investment towards the series, because you're especially not going to be able to invest yourself within the narrative and the world around you just from this alone."
Negative,"I care about my friends, therefore would not recommend."
Negative,"Its a no from me, i'm all ready losing my hair and would like to keep some for as long as possible. Could also be i'm just kak in this game.:)"
Negative,Go live your life.
Negative,"Crashing like crazy, will change my rating after it gets fixed."
Negative,Cant change controll's from Xbox to K&M or PS4 that's just sad...
Negative,"Quite frankly, I don't think Dark Souls 3 is that bad of a game. The first playthrough in singleplayer was a hell of a lot of fun and I was very excited about it at the time. But everything after my first playthrough has just been a disappointment. * There is no replayability to be found in New Game Plus, unlike Dark Souls 2 it is the EXACT same experience, just with your build carried over, and the difficulty hike is laughable. The only new thing is + versions of rings, which as a result makes going through the entirety of NG++ a highly important thing in PvP whether you want to play the campaign three times in a row or not. * But you shouldn't want to, quite frankly, because the PvP is just not fun. Dark Souls 2's PvP was a blast, I have nearly 400 hours put into Dark Souls 2 as a result. But in Dark Souls 3 it's regressed in so many ways, it's not funny. I'm pretty much done with it, I don't want to play any more of it at this point.* Magic is less fun. There are fewer spells, and offensive magic is incredibly underpowered and basically pointless in PvP. Dark Magic has just been retconned to hell and has as much presence as it did in Dark Souls 1. * The game on the current patch version (1.04.1) has real stutter issues UNIVERSALLY, every player seems to have them (myself included). * The game's cheat protection is still very flawed, and prevents community fixes like PvP Watchdog by Eur0pa and other mods from being developed while contributing little.* There is a reduced selection of weapons compared to Dark Souls 2 and many weapons are completely unviable in PvP, whereas almost any weapon could be viable in Dark Souls 2.* The covenants in the game are uninspired and some don't even work. I've not been summoned once for the blue sentinels or the darkmoon blades throughout my entire time with the game and the only alternative to getting the rewards involves a multitude of hours of soul-numbing farming.* The game rehashes Dark Souls 1's content far too much, while dismissing Dark Souls 2 almost entirely.* It also has almost no original memorable NPCs, the only memorable NPCs in the game are straight from Dark Souls 1. The NPC questlines are also another level of convoluted, they take the cryptic nature of the souls series too far.* One of Dark Souls 2's main criticisms was the regressed level design, relying on bonfire warping instead of intricate shortcut based interconnected levels. While Dark Souls 3 makes much more sense geographically, the level design suffers from the same issue. Memorable shortcuts are countable on one hand. * Power stancing has been ditched, making dual-wielding any weapons other than the pre-designed dual-wielded weapons completely useless. While a few of the special dual-wielded weapons are quite cool, they do nothing that couldn't've been done with power stancing left in place. * The game also seems strangely cpu-reliant. My framerate is sub-60 in a lot of areas on an i5 4690k @ 4.5GHz and a Sapphire Tri-X R9 290, and turning down the graphics from maximum to minimum has little-to-no effect on my framerate. I think my cpu should be perfectly powerful enough to run the game at 60 frames per second, but what do I know.All in all, there's a rant for you. If you're a souls fan no doubt you've already bought this game. And if you intend to make this game your first Dark Souls experience, I imagine you'd have a lot of fun with it as I did during my first playthrough. So I don't think this review will be useful for a lot of people. But I still wanted to write it, if anything just to vent my frustrations with the game somewhere."
Negative,"Edit: My responses to comments are located in the comments. Sorry for the inconvience!I really don't want to write this review. I really really want to give this game the ol' thumbs up. But I just can'tDark Souls 3 is, suprisingly enough, the third game in From Soft's Dark Souls series. It takes the dark fantasy themes from the pervious games and puts them into a whole new world, with the callbacks to the past you would expect after Dark Souls 2.Interestingly enough, this is the first Dark Souls game I finished without taking a break. I stll haven't completed Dark Souls 1, and only finished Dark Souls 2 after taking a long multi month break. I find the gameplay in the Souls series to get dull fast, where each fight breaks down to roll-parry-hit-repeat. I do love the visuals, sound, and story of the games, which keep drawing me back. Dark Souls 3 is by far the prettiest of the 3, being the most recent. I can spend time just walking around, trying on different armors to see how they look. The music is as great as I have come to expect from a From Soft game, and the sounds of the swords and spells are the familiar ones from the pervious games.The areas are also well designed, a mixture of seemingly realistic architecture mixed with challenging gameplay. In particular, the Cathedral of the Deep was exceedingly well done, reminging me of the Undead Burg from Dark Souls 1. Enemies are placed intelligently, as if they actually live in and defend their areas, and you can often use the terrain to our advantage if you stop to look and think about it, which is a boon to a filthy casual like myself.Unfortunantly, beyond aesthetics, Dark Souls 3 left me dissapointed. I won't rant about the poor balance or the lack of poise, others have talked about that at length. Magic is still bad and bleed is insane, frostbite is impossible to afflict and worthless. These are all problems with the game. I want to talk about something different, because you can read about those anywhere. Dark Souls 3 felt very repetitive to me. Every area seemed to break down into a normal enemy, a ranged enemy, a caster enemy, a tank enemy, and some sort of miniboss enemy. Outside of bosses, each area felt like a reskin with the difficulty amped up. Now I know that thats not exactly true, but its extremely close. I never had to vary to tactics to the enemy or switch my resistances; I also never had to use the status resist or purge items. There were a few very small areas that were different - the Consumed King's Garden comes to mind - but they were very small and easilly missed. The sheer power of some weapons relative to others also stagnated my build (I beat the game as a pure faith caster spamming the upgraded Gnaw spell) to the point where I never upgraded my equipment beyond cosmetic changes after I was about halfway through.Bosses are the highlight of the Souls series, and Dark Souls 3 did not dissapoint. Each boss looks and sounded amazing, boss areas were well done and bonfires were placed close enough that nothing felt like a slog. Unfortunantly, after discovering the strategy to each boss, the fights were trivialized. I never felt that my ability to execute a strategy was being tested, and high health bars only slowed the process down. By the time I reached the final boss, he couldn't even reach me to land a hit before my extremely high damage brought him down.The true nail in this game's coffin to me is From Soft themselves. I am going to put in a link to the official path notes for an update.http://i.imgur.com/XFB3OvK.jpg?1Yeah. This is inexcusable. This patch came out when the majority of the community was complaing about the dark sword and the estoc, but neither of those weapons were touched. From Soft has repeatedly shown that they do not listen to the community and do not know how to balance this game. I wanted to like it so bad, but From has ruined any joy I could get from this game by my knowing that they made it. I do not own, and do not intend to own, the Ashes of Ariandel DLC content for this game. Please watch a playthough of the DLC if you plan to purchase it. After months of work, it takes only 2-3 hours to finish. I don't want to discuss the DLC more, because this review is not about the DLC. I mention it only to show that From Soft is not the developer I used to love. I would not reccomend purchasing this game if for no other reason then to show that you do not support the direction they are going. I personally will not be buying another From Soft game.Overall, I rate this game one thumb down. Dark Souls 3 is an ok game tied down by poor design and even poorer support."
Negative,please fix the framerate issues FROM SOFT
Negative,"I play video games for enjoyment. I don't have tonnes of time to waste on a game like this. I've died on the tutorial boss for 1/2 an hour now, and I've lost total interest. I'm not raging at the screen or cursing my gaming skills. It's just plain boring. And harder than a game needs to be. Sure, maybe this game is supposed to be hard, but if I can't even beat the tutorial, I know the rest of the game is not going to be enjoyable at all. I get my challenges elsewhere in life. If you like video game challeges, this is probably for you. If you like to play for fun,  or have a spouse kids and job like me, and don't want to play a game for hours while accomplishing nothing (relatively speaking), don't play this game.Hopefully next months humble game is more worthwhile.For the record this is the first review I've made of a game in 12 years of being on steam. So that says how strongly this game sucks to me."
Negative,god awful if the game is not randomly crashing when i go near a bonefire (tried turning lighting down) which i should not have too with sli titan x pascals then its trying to exit the game that will compeletly lock the my pc up this is stupid what is it with from and there awful attempt at pc versions its just discusting
Negative,i would wait to download till the bugs are fixed and it stops random crashing
Negative,endless loading screen fix your f...ing game
Negative,"-6 crashes in just under an hour (I did find an alleged fix-Lighting to low, so far no more crashes)-It's 2016 and the game still won't recognize mouse's buttons-No borderless window mode-Still no keyboard buttons, really? How many games must you make to get it into that thick skull of yours that not everyone plays with a controller?-Who thought it was a good idea to make the character creation so laggy? It's fine when tending to rather large things like body size etc, but I'm honestly having a hard time seeing any difference after changing nearly all nose settings because of the laggy character's head that MOVES forward and backwards as if to create some sort of immersion. Do you think that us-gamers really go ""Wow! The character creation is so fing awesome because my character has a mini seizure and I can't see any changes because of it!""-Other than that, seems like a regular, good Dark Souls game, seems more difficult than the last one."
Negative,"i shouldnt buy this game. 1 month ago they said system requirements that is acceptable with me. And nearly the day the game is released, they have changed it become so fucking high for me. Now i cant play this."
Negative,"game currently crashes randomly every 10 minutes or so, black screen and comp freeze, currently unplayable"
Negative,Game crashes right after the first bonefire. Dont waste your money.
Negative,Game crashes to desktop seconds after creating a character. Tried everything I can think of to fix it.
Negative,"2 hours in and the game has crashed everytime i try to open the doors after the first boss, before that it crashed a few times after i would reach a bonfire. I have a custom PC that runs everything on ultra, and everything is up to date, yet this game crashes more than the Diablo 3 launch >.<It looked like a good game, but as it stands right now, it is unplayable.Edit: I even tried setting everything to low, still crashes when i open that door after the first boss. -_-"
Negative,"Crashed and took Steam with it the first time I ran it. Subsequent runs work but it refuses to see my Steam Controller, despite Valve's video about using the controller with DS3. Not sure why I expected FROM to finally do a good job on a PC port."
Negative,"Dark Souls 3: Prepare to Crash EditionDon't buy it now, wait a month for patches to come out.Edit 1:So, I managed to get my game running by setting the Lightning to Low, and got far into the game. But then, the game decided to crash, and now the game immediately crash whenever I load my save.Great job Bamco.Edit 2:Apparently my crashes were caused by the game changing the lightning setting back from Low to High by itself... So now everytime I launch the game, I need to check my graphic setting."
Negative,"Too low fps, can't play. I could play DS2 at max resolution perfectly.Will change this post when it is fixed."
Negative,"Game is a little to ""challenging"" for me. I like a challenge, but dying 50 times in the first 20 mins of the game just isn't fun, That aside, I still dont see the hype."
Negative,i have a problem every time i lit the first bonfire the game crashes idk if it is because a graphic setting or its the game
Negative,No updates or anything since 2017 for this game. Cheaters are all around in this game. Used to be good at its time. Dont bother buying it unless for the pve. However 0/10 for pvp.
Negative,Looks good but controls are awkward for keyboard and mouse users.
Negative,"I'm actually quite envious anyone even gets to the title screen. My game crashes without it even starting, yet i'd already logged in 15 minutes of gameplay. Refunded, nothing more i can do. Don't have a ps4 or xbox one..... here comes the waiting all over again"
Negative,"I am sure it is a great game and will be spectacular but YET another game where it has not been thoroughly tested on pc. Dare I say consoles are the future hopefully not another batman on our hands here! I do not have a lot of faith when you pre load the game only to wait until another update goes on and still a lot experiencing crashing. I have a 980 card and it crashes so poorly optimized springs to mind. Getting somewhat tired of the "" my game works fine so lets all be happy"". They have had plenty of time to get this game hyped and released properly however sadly lacking on the latter."
Negative,"We've waited years for the next Souls Game, especially after they decided to let Sony milk Bloodborne and leave the PC community high and dry. Now we finally get a new Souls game, and the damn thing is unplayable. I can run the graphics fine, my rig is more than capable, but the crashes have made the game impossible to play. Literally, like clockwork, same crash, same location.How is this acceptable? We paid good money, and this is what we get? When a patch goes out, I'll change this review when I can ACTUALLY PLAY THE GAMEEDIT: Well, figured out how to progress. I had to kill myself. Whatever bug had me locked apparently tied to being in Cinder Form. If that continues to be an issue I will be pissed, but for now I can play. Switching my review to positive as the game itself is VERY fun.EDIT: Nevermind, I was wrong. Crashes kept occuring. Sure, I could progress past that point, but then every 5-10 minutes, another crash. Game is a mess right now, do not buy until it's fixed."
Negative,"cant recommend it if you are using keybord and mouse.i have played through Dark souls remastered and had a fun time with it.i put it off becouse of how hard it was supposed to be, the only boss fight i hade troble with was Ornstein and Smough, i dont know if I out leveled the dlc bosses but didnt give me to much troble - soul lvl 99 hade black knight sword +5, but what i realy found difficulte was the world - think i died more to fail rolls of clifs and taking a wrong turn or trying to figure out where to go next.So i thouge i would give darksouls 3 shot - played 6 hours and i cant take anymore the camera keeps getting me kill when you fight the camera more then the enemys and the keybinds shows as controller when using keybord and mouse, it just felt like its a waste of time when its the camera thats in control of you winning or losing a fight.the pc port just seems like they phoned it in or they didnt care - atlest with the controlls for pc - just not worth my time and cant recommend it if you use keybord and mousegonna try and refund it. while i wait for it im gonna play Dark souls remastered new game+"
Negative,Kinda overrated to be honest... but hey nothing wrong with liking to kill hardcore bosses all day :D
Negative,"Very hard game, play only if you're a masochist."
Negative,worst game iv'e ever played in my life 0\10
Negative,FUCK THIS GMAE I HAD ASTROKE
Negative,"This game fucking sucks (August 14, 2020)EDIT: Alright replayed this during Dec 2023 and it's worse than I remember. There really was nothing worth returning to experience."
Negative,STR builds no longer viable.
Negative,"It is unfortune that i have to write this review, because some elements of this game were fun; however, the co-op part of the game doesnt have an overlay so u can talk to people in game, and the usage of magic is next to worthless. All and all, this game gets 3 out of 10 stars."
Negative,"I'd reccomend this game to anyone who wanted to be mad at themselves for not being good enough for a task. The worst part is the community. Whenever someone's out there asking for help, the toxicity of the public would usually reply with something such as ""git gud"". I strongly urge anyone to stay away from this game. If you want to go through rage, anger, and fight unfair bosses like the Abyss Watchers over and over and over again, step right up, but don't say I did not warn you first.(lol)"
Negative,"EDIT: Game is currently filled with cheaters.Pvp is mostly stunlocking your opponent and parrying pretty trash. The higher your ping is the easier it it is for you, you can instakill people by standing still.Pve content is easy, but cool bosses."
Negative,No propper keyboard support.
Negative,It's not very good.
Negative,this game sucks big peepee
Negative,"Terrible experience on PC with Keyboard & Mouse only. They ported it really badly for the PC, don't buy it if you plan to use Keyboard/Mouse."
Negative,this game is like putting a toothpick in ur urethra and then miyazaki comes and tells you youre a bitch
Negative,im legit afraid of this game
Negative,if you dont like this kind of game this will not change your mind. I literally cannot make progress. if you die over and over you lose access to experience points and its just a never ending cycle unless you stop and just play the game exactly correctly. i have dexterity problems with my hands and there is no option for any kind of accessibility. the few times i made forward progress provided zero satisfaction. everyone is a fallow sack of shit and the world is unbearable. fuck this game and the whole series.
Negative,"Don't get me wrong. The game irtself is excellent and I'm getting it for PS4. But the PC version crashes every 5 minutes, and as we all know the Keyboard and Mouse setup is once again total garbage that makes a Souls type of difficulty completely unplayable.As for controllers, you need a proper XBox wired controller for this, whether One or 360. PS4 controller requires an emulator (DS4Tool recommended to not have to worry about multiple controller detections and spinning camera). I think it's incredibly lazy to not develop a proper control scheme for the PC version, instead relying on people to pay extra for a controller (which by NO Means is something a PC player would necessarily own).So by all means, get this game for XBOne or PS4, but DO NOT buy this for PC/Steam (if only because of the constant crashes, since you can workaround the controller issue - in fact with DS4Tool my PS4 controller worked very nicely)."
Negative,"Everything looks like its running at 60 fps but playing back at 24fps so its all smooth but slow as hell with a 2+ second delay. I thought it was my machine, but Dark Souls III auto detected me onto high settings, and I know myself that it can fulfill more than the minimum described. Even then I changed to low settings and nothing changes but now everything looks like shit. Light glitches all over the place, looks kind of like lightinings going off every couple seconds, and the shaders glitch in and out on certain terrain objects (grass tufts especially).I want to play this game, but it doesn't seem to want to be played which, for a student who just shelled £40 buying it, is really irritating.EDITIf I could give it another thumbs down, I would. I'm not sure what happened but the game is stook in a boot loop, even after reinstalling it. Thanks guys, now I can't even play your shitty running game if I wanted to, which I do...a lot."
Negative,"I really tried to like this game. I played through Bloodborne and loved it because it was challenging but fair. This game is infinitely more difficult than Bloodborne and is borderline unplayable. The parry system is incredibly vague and inconsistent, as are enemy hitboxes. It is less about avoiding enemy attacks and more about avoiding the several feet of air around their weapon when it strikes. The lock-on system is also pretty rough. After killing an enemy, you remain forcibly locked on to them throughout their death animation, leaving you open to attacks. The enemies in Bloodborne were aggressive, but nowhere near as aggressive as the enemies in this game, which makes it incredibly frustrating when the game systems constantly sabotage the player. Super disappointing."
Negative,"It shows me buttom prompts for controller, which would not be a problem... if i weren't playing with mouse+keyboard."
Negative,I WISH I COULD REFUND THIS
Negative,"I hate this game! Every other action game sucks compared to this, I finished it 3 times during this week. What am I supposed to do  now?"
Negative,"não tem steam cloud, aí qualquer bosta q acontecer na memoria do seu computador, vc vai perder todos os saves"
Negative,No cloud save.
Negative,It's the 21st century - you should be able to generate button prompts for keyboard+mouse layout by now... i'm not buying a game for pc to play with an xbox controller..
Negative,"I have a laundry list of reasons not to like this game, but I'll sum it up with this:Bad PvP design, especially compared to DS2.Linear area progression structure prevents subsequent playthroughs from having variety.Stat setup that biases the player towards using Raw enchants and stacking HP/Stamina."
Negative,"This would be a good game if it wasn't interrupted every 15 minutes by an invasion that literally cannot be stopped. I do not care to get good at PVP so I can enjoy the PVE, and the game doesn't give you a choice. Want to play with your friends? Nope, screw you, you get to get invaded and die to another player and have to go recover your souls because we said so. I am uninstalling to go play something more worth my time. Yes I understand that PVP is a big part of this game, and I don't want it to be removed, but let the players who want to play it as a PVE co-op adventure game do so, not requiring us to die every time a player invades."
Negative,hope u like the color grey
Negative,"A degen fucking game which only waste's your limited time on this planet. Not recommended for any sane, and life having person who wants to get any pussy in his lifetime."
Negative,makes me want to die
Negative,i bought this years ago at launch for $69.99 Canadian and now its somehow $79.99 canadian years later. WTF
Negative,dull beyond dull
Negative,"the pc port is fucking awful and an embarassment, I can´t play anymore because my screen flickers and I know theres a way to fix this, but I dont undertand how AND it shouldnt be my jod to fix this"
Negative,"Easy game, I killed first boss. Stepped to next area, got invaded and the invader sent me to NG+So... I technically beat the game?"
Negative,"It appears as if they abandoned the servers to save a few bucks. This game used to be amazing and I was really looking forward to the PC experience when I bought it. Inflating the price and charging so much for a 7 year old game with more than half of the fun removed, just because Elden Ring is doing so well, is absolutely slimy!Too bad I had some misplaced faith in the devs to fix the bug and reopen the servers in a reasonable amount of time and missed the return window. Waste of money, not even close to worth it. Just watch Elden Ring videos on YouTube for free."
Negative,"Worst experience I've had with a game yet. I played 12 hours of this game. I enjoyed it, was having a blast. Beat the Deacons and it made me consume an ember, which allowed others to invade. Then, Flipper the hacker decided to invade, hack my game and send my level 40 to a new game plus. I was in the catacombs and was sent right back to the beginning. Yup. that's what you pay for folks. To whoever that is, Fuck you. I want my money back this has to be a sick joke. Don't buy this garbage game."
Negative,"The controls and camera in this game are absolute dogshit. The hardest part of this game is dealing with the camera angles always fucking you over at the exact wrong time. Every time I kill an enemy my camera locks into a 360 around my character and I am unable to stop it until the game's shitty code decides I'm ready to have control of my camera again. There are many other glitches and bugs, but that alone makes this game unplayable. The combat is not smooth at all. For some reason my guy keeps randomly locking into a kick animation during fights when I'm not even touching wasd keys. If I attempt to dodge an attack and I time it wrong, my character will dodge after the attack has hit me and put me on the ground and I've then stood up, which after all that time allows the boss to hit me again which is a death sentence. An enemy's attack should break my attempted dodge animation, not wait until I've been hit, put on the ground, then stand back up, then continue the buffered dodge animation. This is only one example of how buffered command animations absolutely screw you over in this game. It's not because it's hard, it's because the game is coded poorly. I would not ever recommend this game to anyone."
Negative,8 hours...I'm so trash I can't get past the first boss (Iudex Gundyr). I hate it here mom.
Negative,"if you like your stable mental health and value your peripherals, do not play this game."
Negative,"Let me start off by saying this is a great game. Honestly, the world and lore painted in this game is unlike anything else. That being said, I've been following this game since infancy and From still havent addressed regional play or done much to deal with the hackers. I'd dare say dealing with hackers has only gotten worse over the years. This isn't the first iteration of dark souls nor any souls borne game so why hasn't anything been done? Being able to get banned when hackers drop you items or modify your files is stupid; invasion balance on top of the fact its being more and more common to invade into a world with or by hackers really kills this game. These points may not seem related but in my experience 80% of the hackers I run into are from a very specific country, one I shouldn't even be connecting to to begin with. The fact that cross region play only applies to Japan? Fix it."
Negative,absolutely fucking bullshit customer support. so I never liked the dark souls series to begin with. But it started to grow on me. A friend bought me this game as a gift so he could play it with me. I made my character and we began playing. a couple weeks go by and this is where things went south. one day I logged on to play with said friend and before I even Joined his game I noticed every single stat i had was maxed. this obviously wasn't normal. I then decided that something was wrong and chose to erase the game file and start over. no big deal as I was getting used to the game remembered that i needed to do to get back to where i was. after i hit the main menu I received a message saying I have been penalized. then to make things worse My friend could no longer join me. I only played the game for the co op. after searching I found out it was a ban and contacted customer support only to be told I violated some EULA thing and my account was perma-banned. WHAT THE FUCK? something that wasn't even my fault ruined the entire experience for me. I guess what I'm saying is if your willing to run into a bug and get banned for it then by all means waste your money on this game. I could never recommend a game that the devs blame the player for something that wasn't their fault. The game was OK until this happened.
Negative,"It's a good game but it brings almost nothing new to the table same bosses, same areas, it's like I'm playing DS1 again but with better graphics and a worse map. Underwhelming."
Negative,my quivering butthole couldn't handle this game.
Negative,"i did try to like this game, seriously. but i just end up always comparing it to dark souls 2 and i seriously loved ds2. (you might not understand my pros/cons if you didn't play ds2) tldr at the endwhat i didn't like:1- no bonfire ascetic. this was seriously one of the best feature from dark souls 2. why do i need to restart from the start just to rekill the boss i liked? i cleared the first zone so many time that i'm sick of seeing and doing it -.-2- chest? no it's not a chest it's a damned micmic. whats the point when 90% of the chest are actually micmic? there's no surprise anymore. i never got caught by a micmic even once in ds3, while in ds2 (about 10% of chest were micmic) got me everytime 3- probably one of the most ragequit point: 2 zone in particuliar are so ""well"" hidden that there's no way in hell you will find them without checking on internet (small spoiler ahead) pray next to a random statue (seriously?!) kill a npc that gave an important item (what?)3- some monster are ridiculously hard while other are easy... -cough dog cough- probably died more from dog than any other monster4- miracle are so bad... you can't spam them like you used to do in ds2, just imposible. and the damage from lightning spear is horrible until end game5- invasion can be so stupid sometime (more like the people invading) they will do all in their power to kill you, even the most idiotic/coward thing you can imagine6- mana estus (potion). skill should have been using stamina like ds 27- stats/build feel plain. i created many character and there's not one i could say ""yeah this is the one, i like my character"". removed a stats i liked very much (adaptabiity) and instead added luck8- vitality is underwhelming. for one, poise is broken. two, each stats give 1.0 of equip load and when you finish the game you are around level 90 (which doesn't offer much stats) while in ds2 vitality gave 1.5 of equip load and you finished the game at level 2209- (yes there's more) no freedom with dual sword. you can't dual any sword you want anymore like ds2 which could bring awesome combo. dual sword are made dual and you deal with it cause there's isn't a tons of them.there's a lot more i could say but the rest are just minor detailswhat i like:1- armor/texture design and graphic overall2- weapon animation & skill, especially the quick draw from katana3- the challenge different boss offeredtldr: if like me you loved ds2 and hesitating to buy ds3 then don'tif you like souls serie overall and didn't particularly like ds2, go aheadif you are new to souls serie, i'd recommand starting elsewhere because the difficulty is quite higher than other souls game"
Negative,"This game, is not recommended to be purchased, yet only if they do not update it-----UPDATE-----the makers of the darksouls franchise published this game as the last of the series, however i think that the first of the series is still the best game."
Negative,"Pretty good concept, but it could have used more Tenchu mechanics."
Negative,"Starting out this seems to be my favorite of the dark souls games. You have to be a bit more aggressive it seems. It aslo seems that I just spent a crap ton of money on a Game that CRASHES randomly ALL THE TIME. I dont have minimum specs, I exceed for sure. I have played about 100 minutes of gameplay and had easily 20+ crashes. This is comeplete bull to  Market a game that clearly is'nt ready for play. Im seriously thinking about returning this Hunk of ####."
Negative,there was no sex
Negative,wxpected this to be hard dissapointed beat it easy gonna have to play something thats a challenge unlike this shit
Negative,I suck ass at this game fuck it.
Negative,"Multiplayer is working again now, so you can feel free to read my rant or ignore it.Bought the game years ago to play it with my friends. We've never got the time to actually play it together until now, but it seems that the multiplayer is not working, most likely because of Elden Ring, but who knows for sure. Thanks FromSoftware, it seems I will be playing the game alone.I know that the game is designed to ""hate you"" but this goes a bit too far.Anyway, putting everything aside this game is not as punishing as the previous ones.I guess that most of the people have the game already anyway, but if you consider buying it you might better just fulfill their wish and skip this game and buy Elden Ring instead."
Negative,"Bull shit souls 3 sums it up, a regular mob even alone is more dangerous than a Heir of Fire or a Lord of Cinder (aka Abyss watchers and the others), and that should tell you how much sense this game makes. This game is filled with areas that are pure bull shit just to make you die more and make your life hard for no reason, the ""git gud"" mentality is just as much of a bullshit as the community it developed and the other games it sadly inspired. ""git gud"" losses it's point and meaning when the camera and rng works against you, this you can clearly see if you watch the ""souls-like"" veterans who die as well to random bullshit be that from the opponent they face or other sources. If you want proof, just look up how many have bought the game vs how many have finished it, and that should tell you all you need to know.The weapons in the game are also a joke, there are a few that scale with your attributes but so far, most don't scale, this includes the weapons that you would get from the solus of the bosses defeated.Graphics and soundtrack 10/10Gameplay 3/10"
Negative,Not getting an aneurysm trying to beat it.
Negative,"I only play this game a lot because of my horrible completionist personality. I look back on my times in this game and even including after I've beaten a hard boss, I've never really enjoyed this game enough to justify a ""Yes"" vote on it."
Negative,"you need a walkthrough to get the most out of the story in this game, same with the other souls games. otherwise you're just playing a shallow monster killing game with the difficulty cranked up. it does that well though but all the storylines and consequences are so fucking veiled that it's hard to enjoy without looking at a walkthrough every time you cleared an area..."
Negative,engine capped to 60fps fuck you
Negative,"DS 1 and 2 was good, but the third part is just recycled shit from from software. DLCs are better than the original game but thats the only positive thing I can say about DS 3"
Negative,"5 souls games, and we're still waiting for a proprer netcode..."
Negative,"Hacker exploits beware, not buying elden ring until its safe"
Negative,"My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game's PvP gave me cancer anyway."
Negative,"FPS makes the game unplayable. INTERNET FIXA lot of people are reporting low frame rates in Dark Souls 3 even with hardware that is above minimal requirements. Some have gone as far as to test the game at 800x600 resolution with low settings and still their FPS wouldn't improve.This looks like a problem with the PC port and should be patched in a future update,I have a high end computer with 16 gigs ram and can play games like skyrim, Dragon age, Black desert online all on max settings... I can't play this game at all even if i turn down the game to minimum settings in windowed, BEWARE BEFORE BUYING"
Negative,"Rolling is too powerful, fast weapons are the only viable builds, and poise only works when you're mid swing. I love darksouls, and while this title has a lot of polish and fun moments, the issues above may seem minor, but actually monumentally destroy the experience for a seasoned player, making ds3 the weakest of the series.Won't recommend until the problems are fixed. (so never)"
Negative,"I'll be breaking this review up into two sections, Single-Player and Multi-player. Although, take this review with a grain of salt due to the fact I may be favoring the earlier games, but do keep in mind the amount of time I've put into this game.Single-PlayerThe Single-Player is one of the most enjoyable but frustrating experiences you'll have in gaming. The boss fights are wonderfully designed to give you a challenging but rewarding fight that makes you actually have to learn the patterns and ways the boss fights. The areas around the game give a sense of progression and allow you to see more of the world you're in. Oh yeah also, lore.Multi-Player:Out of these two segments I'd have to give Multi-Player a worse rating. The PvP is an utter mess at the moment due to the fact instead of using the usual ""poise"" system From Software has completely disabled it and instead uses a newer but less reliable ""hyper armor"" system, to put it simply, Greatswords Ultra Greatswords anything similar to it are unstaggerable on most of their move sets except for some exceptions but weapons such as Straight Swords are unable to get any unstaggerable frames making using a Greatsword more meta and makes a fight where its a Greatsword V.S Straight Sword horribly unbalanced and the hyper armor system could use some reworking. Beside PvP the online community is mostly helpful and people will put their signs down in-front of boss rooms if you need help just like any over souls game.If From Software makes any positive changes to the new hyper armor system or just general PvP improvements I will edit this review and take the new changes into account."
Negative,"yeah okay I see how it iswhen DS2 throws in lame DS1 fanservice and has a load of dudes in armor for bosses it's a terrible sequelbut when DS3 drowns you in that lame fanservice with no original ideas and has loads of boring samey bosses that, despite aesthetic differences, play the exact same, IT'S GREEEAAAAAT"
Negative,Man this game blows so hard.
Negative,Its ok its not as hard to beat as ppl will have you belive yet still fun Now the reason for me not recommending it is because it is not worth 70$ not even close
Negative,Fuck this horseshit
Negative,"Unplayable as of nowFirst crashed when i fought two enemies at once and hit a wall by accident, fought the first boss with no problemsTried opening the door and i crashed 3 times in a row. After a dozen or so tries i finally made it to firelink and crashed just walking around.I'm well past the reccomended settings and everything was set to low. Plz fix your game From.Besides that it was regular soulsy fun, 10/10 if it wasn't crashing on me and shitting all over my chest"
Negative,"I am a huge fun a Dark soul, and I am so excited about this one. However, it crashed so many times during the game. My friend has same problem. I cannot even enjoy the game right now, so pissed off. PLz, someone tell me what is going on, and how to fix it. Thankyou very much"
Negative,"This game is fucking shit sauce on my computer the game dosent work properly when I try to play it and it is slowing down my PC and it is fucking annoying when i actually do want to play it, it slows the shit down and it pisses me off they release this pile of bullshit to fucking early for PC and I would recomend the first or second dark souls cause this shit sux"
Negative,"Having seen this game and the high acclaim recieved from a variety of crititcs, I cannot in good faith, reccomend anyone to play this game at this current time due to the downright awful framerate and awful,frequent crashes players are experiencing.Having dropped a hefty sum on this game including the season pass, it's an awful shame the ""Bamco"" team released a game with so many problems.The real sad part is due to the lack of actual solutions given by the company, players have banded together in an attempt to offer fixes for all the problems one experiences in the game at this point in time such as the currently infamous bonfire crashing.The irony is, had I not picked the Knight class as I did in Dark Souls II, my gaming experience would have been significantly worse due to the associated crashes with the lighting effects.Overall, while the game was a dissapointment upon release, we can only hope the issues are patches as soon as possible with performance improvements."
Negative,when i got the game i expected a little bit of frame rate lag but when i hit play on the menu my comuter crashed and went to windows xp so i had to turn it off externaly because my mouse icon dissapired. i tryed to open it over and over for a whole hour without getting any game play. before you choose to buy this game on PC I recommend waiting for lots of bug fixes and not waste £40 (or however many dollars in the US) on this game.
Negative,"Obviously this game is one of the biggest games of our time. The fact however, that you can't integrate a proper controls settings for PC players is just utterly stupid. Like, I've never had something piss me off like this. It's about the little things, bugs; not a problem really, glitches; annoying but part of any game. This game seems more like a money grab for PC players since they can't even cater a proper keyboard and mouse binding system. Its hysterical. Shame on these developers."
Negative,wack and boring
Negative,"I hate children. Wow, wow--*anything* happens. Pardon me while I get drunk. Fuck."
Negative,Roll Spam simulator
Negative,"Before I write my review of the game, I just want to say that the negative review doesn't go towards the game itself, but towards ♥♥♥♥♥♥ publisher bandai namco. ♥♥♥♥ you namco, I bought the game so I should be able to play it wherever I want, even if I use GeforceNOW, but you just had to ask for it to be removed.Dark souls 3, ah yes, the dankest soul game. One of my personal favourite games. I enjoy everything from the hidden lore, gameplay mechanics (be it obsucred or not), the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, pvp, boss battles, area design, enemies. This game is basically just the greatest porn in my opinion.If you're not a game journalist level gamer, you will enjoy this game a lot. You will easily sink 60h+ as long as you don't spend 4 hours on the first boss of the game and quit after as many people do.This game allows you to play it in any way u like. Wanna be a mage? Go for it. A warrior with a big ♥♥♥ sword? Griffith here I come. A naked guy throwing poop and poison daggers at players? ♥♥♥♥ yeah, why not.Combat: 9/10Absolutely the most fair Souls game in the series. As long as you have a good memory and get used to rolling around it won't be that hard, but it will still remain challenging due to different dodging times for each enemy.Weapon combat feels good, nothing too crazy, but you won't see x600 hit combos as this game is all about managing your green stamina bar.Magic combat is also decent enough, whilst spells take a while to cast, and don't deal crazy amount of damage (except Great Soul Dregs, damn, that spell be crazy man, easily 2.5k dmg on dark enemies at sl 50 kekw) but it allows you to clear some troublesome enemies from a range. But it won 't allow you to outright cheese the game since your mana is limited. A good mechanic nevertheless, very fun, very good for pvp.The only reason I'm giving 9/10 is that Miyazaki hid poise inside the chest under Rosaria's bed, and because bows are big suck.Graphics: 10/10♥♥♥♥ing stunning. Take a screenshot at pontiff arena (also known as gonk city) with the moon and you'll see what I'm on about.PvP 10/1010/10 would twink and spank ganks again.Music 10/10Music in this game is so great, Amadeus Mozart probably makes remixes of the boss music in the afterlife. Sometimes when i play other games and there's a boss fight, I will turn off the sound, go to youtube, put any dark souls 3 boss music, then enjoy a true fightReplayability 10/10U can always figure out a different build, a different style to play the game (speedrun, no hit, no death, no weapons, etc) in order to keep it fresh.Map Design 9/10Whilst linear, map design is really good, with enemies and traps placed in good places that will keep the game possible to be played without ever getting hit whilst still keeping the game very challenging for the average joe. There's also a ton of items to be discovered, which each offer a different perspective into the lore, just read their description.Lore 10/10If you bring a little crab into the catacombs the legendary crab merchant will appear. Trust me. DEEPEST LORE.NPCs Voice and Lines 10/10Ashen one, I serve thee ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)But yeah, this game is too good for this world, I would write more but I'm bored, gonna go order a pizza. Also take note that my hours don't reflect my actual hours in game, I played this game mostly on ps4. Don't forget to indulge in jolly co operation my fellow friends, but don't get too mad if you get invaded and killed. Just try to enjoy every aspect of the game, even the frustrating situations, kapish?"
Negative,Enough for this game too many Hacker!!
Negative,"This review isn't about the actual content within the game. It's simply unplayable as is due to horrible FPS drops/stuttering, and random crashes. I literally cannot move inside of the firelink area without the game crashing. Immediate refund and buying it on PS4"
Negative,"This review is conditional, and very much depends on what you value from a Souls game.As a huge fan of all the SoulsBorne games, this one is by far the weakest link. It's beautiful, plays well, and has some great moments, but the world design and story are huge letdowns. The game feels like it lost it's spark and doesn't have anything new or interesting to say. So much of the game is just rehashes of what came before.Also, the DLC is the first that FROM has put out that has not been outstanding. It's fine, don't get me wrong, but DS1, DS2 and Bloodborne all had what I would consider to be the best DLC in the industry. This falls far short of those."
Negative,"It's difficult and online is the worst sh1t I have ever seen, you have to write something on the ground to ''summon'' the friend you would like to play and if he dies, you have to go ALL the way to the guy that sells white stone thingy so you can go write text on ground and summon your friend again. recommend for people that like challenges but playing with a friend you can forget it, have fun writing name on ground 1000 times back and forth. stupid."
Negative,"they disabled family sharing. no more fun with friends without worrying about getting banned because the devs didn't bother to put in an anti cheat that actually works. so yeah, if you want to play this online find some mods that will help fight hackers. and yes, f**k you bandai namco."
Negative,"It's been a year and the multiplayer is still broken, and most improvements made in DSII got taken out of this game for some reasonI would recommend it if it ever got fixed"
Negative,"wierd camera , controller keys only ,"
Negative,more expensive than elden ring and half as good
Negative,"I tried to play with my friends some Dark Souls 3 :D. It was a lovely spring evening. The weather was warm and we were having fun playing some Dark Souls 3 :D. Then we got invaded by a player. He seemed a bit overpowered and he managed to kill us all. We were sad but we decided to get better at the game. :) Then we got invaded by another overleveled player. Ok we tried to fight him but again we lsot because we were at the beggining of the game. After 10 minutes we were invaded by another and then by another and then i decided to uninstall this shit game and play something that is close to being fair. Not to mention that all the virgins that invaded us, also used emotes after killing opponents that had 100 levels under them. Great game mechanic bandai namco, great invade system, Thank god there are not many virgins who abuse the invade sistem :))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))"
Negative,"Something happened with my game, which required me to completely uninstall my game and delete my save game data because the game was giving me warning that I had irregular data. I lost only (_ONLY_) twelve hours because of this, but  being threatened by a developer because errors in their game, while constantly being plagued by people in multiplayer who are clearly cheating (invincibility, unlimited estrus flasks, weapons far outside of the ""SL"" range) is beyond frustrating and clear evidence of heavy handed tactics like this which punish legitimate players, while not stopping harmful players.It's the worst of both worlds."
Negative,servers are shit i hatte this game fuck fromsoft
Negative,F*ck you Sekiro.
Negative,"one of the worts games i have ever played, stupid shitty bosses are impossible and there is nothing actually enjoyable about the game. Controls are some of the worst i have ever seen. This game was made for console and should be left there. Didnt even bother to change the controls for pc which is sad and depressing"
Negative,"ABSOLUTELY the worst of the dark souls games.The game's visuals are nice. That's about it. The story is contrived and doesn't follow it's own rules, the gameplay is the most uninspired of any of the games. I'd argue this is the most uninspired fromsoft game altogether.If you think hitboxes from some enemies in ds2 were bad, well this game basically picks the same issue, and gives it to half the roster of bosses in the main game (incase you didn't realize it, it's the fire. The fire visuals they use are never as large as the hitboxes they're connected to, so even thought the attack may clearly miss you, if there's any fire there, well you better hope you're a mile away otherwise the game will just randomly decide ""fuck you. you still get hit""). Take away the only saving grace from ds1 and 2, poise, and you get to enjoy getting stunlocked if you so much as get sneezed on. You can get ""super armor"" but that involves specific attacks with specific weapons and specifically relies on you trying to trade damage... in a game in which enemies do so much damage at times that you literally CANNNOT TRADE. You trade, you die. That's always been the case in previous ones, it's the case here too, and yet some weapons specifically RELY on you trading. This pretty much means instead of being able to pick how you wanted to play? yeah instead those weapons are for pvp only. don't you dare use them for the main gameplay loop.Instead of doing anything original with the theme, nearly everything is just copy-catting ds1, which after how much stuff ds2 copy-catted ds1, that's shocking that they were able to copy-cat even harder.tl:dr. anything good about ds1 or 2? throw it all out the window. this game lumps up the absolute WORST of both games, and shoves them together, and fromsoft fans eat it up like it's gold. I've played demon's souls, dark souls, dark souls 2, sekiro, bloodborne, you name it. This. is without a doubt. the worst."
Negative,"This game is basically a test to see if you can push buttons fast.  There isn't really anything else to the game besides figuring out how to push buttons at just the right time.  It should state plainly that it is designed 100% around a console controller.  Even if you use keyboard and mouse, all the help tips and menu choices use and reference a controller.  The story is barely there.  A tired, drug out continuation of the previous fantasy dystopia.Literally, the most disappointing game I have ever purchased in my life and I used to QA for Sierra Online so that should tell you something."
Negative,great game but it FUCKING DOESNT HAVE STEAM CLOUD SYNC! I bought a new pc and formatted the old one thinking like any other game my save files would transfer over cloud. they dont.
Negative,Worst control that I ever seen. Unplayable shit.
Negative,"Waste of time, money and space on my hard drive."
Negative,"tried playing with pokemon mod once, now banned from normal online forever. online maintenance is a lie.for those who will get upset, yes i realise i should have put starting to offline as a standard but the fact that thats even necesary is annoying too"
Negative,"I prefer a game I can actually survive.  I use a pc and a mouse and prefer difficulty setting options.  You can't raise levels if you can't keep souls...but if you prefer to play a game that is hard with no way to adjust the challenge, good luck.  I am moving on $60 dollars later."
Negative,"Dark Souls III is good, but not without it's problems, and ultimately better games exist, even among ""soulslikes,"" as we've come to call action games with slow, precise combat, weapon variety, and large bosses, among other things.The game can sometimes have issues running on even lower graphics settings, though this will vary by computer. I have a fairly decent setup and it still drops frames sometimes. If you're new to PC gaming, you'll want to check somewhere online if your computer can run it or go in expecting frame drops. Other than that, new players will have a solid action experience that may be frustrating but is generally well-designed and fulfilling. If you've never played a souls game before, don't worry about it, this is a fine starting point for the series.That said, returning players will probably have some issues with the game. There are numerous quality-of-life issues that you might find frustrating, like menus force-closing after using items, or not properly explaining what weapon infusions do within the game. The FP system is handled a little awkwardly, and that some skills use durability and others use FP can sometimes feel confusing. There's no option to choose whether a shield will parry or use a weapon skill when L2 is pressed, and lots of weapon skills are worthless in PvE, PvP, or both. Magic and ranged weapons still haven't really been balanced for. Oh, and poise. Poise only works on heavy weapons during certain frames of certain attack animations, and is entirely gone on light builds. The only thing poise is good for is tanking through hits while swinging a greatweapon, which many players will find frustrating, especially those fond of dexterity builds. Good ideas from previous games are dropped for no clear reason, like Power Stance from DS2 and infusion gems from Bloodborne. Ultimately, the game plays like Dark Souls 1 with better rolling and warping, but without the structured level design. Fans of the series will probably enjoy it, and should definitely get it while it's on sale.But, there are better games out there. I'm not going to include a full review for it here, but Nioh is a much more solid ""soulslike"" game with deeper and more complex combat options, that handles magic much better and has a much more enjoyable and coherent story. If you like the action of Dark Souls, I highly recommend you get Nioh instead of 3, if you're pressed for cash. TL;DR: It's a fine game, but you're better off waiting for a sale, and even better off getting Bloodborne (if you own a PS4) or Nioh for a similar, but much better game. I wish I had an option between ""recommend"" and ""don't."""
Negative,"Local Lord of Sunlight continues to ruin literally everything.Edit: After playing through NG+2 in order to get all the rings for the Dark Soul achievement, I have changed my mind and now despise this game. If you genuinely think this is a good game, you are a genuine low-IQ smoothbrain and don't deserve to be alive. If Dark Souls 2 is bad game design, this one is a good example of lazy game design. Everything about this game other than the music and the graphics feels like somebody just pulled stuffout of a hat, threw it in another hat, shook it around, and dumped it out and went ""ehhh, good enough, the morons that buy this game will be too busy posting about how good it is on reddit and going 'woah, is that a hecking DS1 referencerino? EPIC DUDE LMAO' to care anyway"".In conclusion, dude there is no good Souls game they're all fucking overhyped deal with it."
Negative,"BANDAI NAMCO HAS NO IDEA HOW TO RUN SERVERS Every single game they have the servers are trash like dang GET HELP SEEK HELP Get DR Phil to code it for you at this time like dang. Pirate warriors 4 has online thats hanging on by a thread and dont get me started on Shinobi strikers. Everything else? DEAD, DOESNT WORK, or SHUT DOWN. LIKE GET HELP YALL HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU ARE DOIINNNGGG"
Negative,"I would love to play the game, sadly it does not work with dualshock 4 and it is really unplayable on keyboard/mouse. Ended up getting a refund, but I would just prefer the game to work really."
Negative,It's a good game .
Negative,"No cloud save, had to get a new hard drive and lost my save right before fighting what I'm pretty sure was the last boss.  I'm not sure if there's an excuse for them not to have cloud save in this day of gaming."
Negative,"piece of fucking shit, i get angry so fast in this shit ask me again in about 10 hours"
Negative,"A great game, but I would not recommend it to others looking to pvp. There're hackers around every turn who ruin the experience! NO way to report them, so you're constantly getting hit by the same hackers over and over again! If you want to have fun just learn how to hack yourself!"
Negative,"You should think when your game that gets invaded, its bacially ""your rules"" hence you're the host so your ping etc. nope wrong, the worse connection you got as invader the more advantage you get, game gets laggy for the host cant track the extreme laggy invader, cant hit them either. but they hit you just fine, suddently you're backstapped by a guy who instantly moves from infront of you to your back. WTF Fromsoft? PvP in this game is so much trash, when somone has a high ping. add a ping filter Fromsoft?"
Negative,"I don't like this game, its better than most but not the best, its good at the start of the game and then it drops off at farron keep or after the curse rotted wood. the best boss was champion Gundyr for me at least, there were some other good to decent bosses, but most of the other ones are terrible because they don't stop attacking almost becoming a turn based game. I loved DS1 and DS2, but the amount of DS1 areas/references. Take reviews with a lot of thought, because most of them lie about stuff like the fact that this game is the gankiest in the series like Irithyll and Archdragon peak, and nobody seems to notice, because this game doesn't require as much skill because you're character gets more cardio than you'll ever get while playing through this game because running is the most viable strategy for every area. it looks like shit too, it looks like plastic. not for me at all."
Negative,"I love the game and the style of it. Its hard but that is what makes it worth it. The only problem i have with it is the pc version isnt equip for the pc. The info is still the controller buttons, the keybindings is horrid. Even if you change the keybindings to work with the mouse and keyboard the actions doesnt always do what its suppose to. Like the kick. Sometimes i lunge and sometimes it does the kick. That is the only reason for putting me off playing it. I dont own a controller and im not going to buy a controller just to play it.So if you have a controller do yourself a favour and play it. But if not dont bother unless you like to rage."
Negative,i cant even start the game... crast at the 1st sec...
Negative,Game Too Easy
Negative,- Poise doesn't work at all- armor is practically uselessFromsoft does it again!
Negative,Not as good as dark souls 2
Negative,"The last time I checked I was buying a Dark Souls game, not Bloodborne. Oh wait, at least Bloodborne supports cloud saves, unlike this game. It's 2017 for fuck's sake."
Negative,cant get past the first boss ik ik skill issue
Negative,"PvP in this game is utterly destroyed by the lack of dedicated servers. For single player, it's enjoyable and well crafted, however it has the weakest campaign of all the souls games, and borrows heavily from DS:1 which was far superior."
Negative,"Dark Souls III have been praised as a video game classic, but it is by no means a perfect game, and the faults of this game are often overlooked due to the status of it being a Dark Souls game, with any complaints regarding game design receiving an answer of just ""git gud"".The bad: Despite the popularity and this being 3rd Dark Souls game, the port is still something that should be shameful in 2016. All guide controls displayed are with controller visualizations. Not PC user friendly. Obviously the game is recommended to be played with a controller, but if you release a game on a PC, you should presume that a lot of people will be playing with a mouse & keyboard. The actual movement is better than the previous Dark Souls games, but still often feels clunky/ slippery, which is especially noticeable where where one imprecise move or unintentional slip means your death. I fell like, for a game so unforgiving, this should be the most important thing to get right. A lot of cheap feeling ""jump-scares"" that is almost like the Dark Souls trademark, but in connection with the clunky/ slipper movement, makes your character do all the wrong things like slipping off the cliff, being stuck or unable to properly evade attacks etc. Haven't seen a more annoying implementation of an online co-op version to play with your friend. Beating bosses in co-op is too easy comparing to solo. The cheaters invading player worlds and their impact on ""infecting"" innocent players with many hours with ridiculous amounts of gems or items that gets them soft-banned are countless. The lack of any direction in the maps makes you wander around the different locations sometimes for hours, trying to find the next necessary piece for advancing the story. I understand that the game is ""hardcore"" but this, in my opinion, doesn't make the playing experience better for anyone.The good: Lore and Atmosphere like no other game Diversity of bosses and their move-sets The challenge is somewhat rewarding, but, personally, most of the time I feel ""wow, I'm glad this shit-show is finally over"" and not ""omg, what an amazing boss fight this was""."
Negative,"One of the worst game experiences of my life. Not worth the $8 i paid for it. So incredibly unsatisfying in every way. Makes you want to go to bed.Tried again in 2022, it is just as bad if not worse then I remember. Time to remove this garbage from my library."
Negative,"Pvp = Garbage netcode,phantom range,cheaters,glitch users,one shot riposte."
Negative,decently fun game but the unpolished gray tone visuals get horrible to look at for hours on end.
Negative,The video game equivalent of euthanizing a healthy puppy.
Negative,bought this game to play with my friend. but the co op systemet is shit so the game is shit
Negative,Bring back multiplayer!!!!
Negative,it's shitEdit: It's still shit.. got banned because of hackers dumping items on my corpse.. fuck this geim
Negative,"I have beat monster hunter world so I thought I would give this a try. I have not enjoyed it so far. In monster hunter world, learning monsters attacks and safe zones is pretty fun and straight forward. In this game, it is chore. I'll probably give it another try in the future."
Negative,"I love the game but, I will not even get to finish it with friends due to pvp required.  I purchased thinking I could co-op with friends and have some peaceful fun but, you always get invaded. I am fighting monsters I do not even l know how to kill and people join doing things I have no idea how to counter which just ruins the game when trying to casually play through the content.Wish there was a non pvp co-op version."
Negative,"Tonnes of fun, best souls game yet... except for the constant crashing. This need immediate fixing."
Negative,Terrible inavasion mechanic. Good luck having fun when an asshole that's a higher rank comes and destroys your game.
Negative,it's like a video game but with malware for netcode
Negative,sell it for £20!   not got £40 Graphics
Negative,"Garbage game, garbage optimization is that I bought the most regret to buy the LJ game does not explain"
Negative,I hate this game
Negative,Game totally unplayable in On-line mode as soon as the game starts it returns to menu stating that framerate it to low for on-line play. Considering I have high end gaming PC with 16GB ram and NVidia GX780 I don't think I should be getting any issues with low framerates. In off-line mode the game plays however the graphics quality appears to be poor even when running at the games highest graphics settings.I tried playing the game using mouse and keyboard on my PC and found it almost impossible to play even after remapping the keys to a more comfortable layout. I've even tried it with an xBox controller connected to my pc and found this didn't work that well.After 90 mins of play I have still to get past the first boss for the tutorial / graveyard area of the game! My advice Avoid if possible.
Negative,"Had a good run, got a boss down to 1/3rd health.  Never got back to that boss again... If you like the challenge and you're a ""hard R gameR"" then you'll probably enjoy this.  But I didn't.  Souls games aren't for me, I suppose."
Negative,"Camera is always against the player walls is against the playerand i am pretty sure the developers are against the playerone of those game that i completed,but rarely enjoy the journey of it.you fight something small the camera will look all the way down and spins, you fight something big the camera looks all the way up and spins, you get close to a wall the camera spins.worst part of the game, enemies and npc's are not restricted in mechanics as the players are;                         >Enemies do not have stamina therefore can spam unlimited attacks.                       >Enemies do not have ""Focus Points""(mana) and can spam any magic so long as not interrupted.                       >Enemies are not mitigated by objects and can attack through them,example: you can lure an enemy to the tightest hallway and he would swing his gigantic weapon with ease meanwhile a player swing something as tiny as a dagger and it will be prevented by a wall.                       >Enemies do not have any Cool Down on the skill they use and can just spam it over and over.                       >Enemy tracking is ridiculous, some enemies are designed to stick to you regardless if they see you or not whether you are invisible or not some enemies are programed to chase you until their skill connect or you dodge it then they just suddenly start  running back to their position if you are invisible some enemies will follow you they wont attack but they just stick to you like a magnet they should have just not add invisibility if they cant even program it to properly work. Enemy Projectile magnetism, this is the dumbest mechanic they give to enemies, where magic and arrows even thrown object like bombs follow the player, meanwhile if an enemy even move 1 frame to the left or right even an a Giant arrow from a GreatBow can miss.most of the time sidesteping is pointless unless you are running sideways or dodging, projectile will hit you if you just sidestep which feel like an intentional punishment to players.Enemy speed: honestly feels way to unbalanced against the player, an enemy can 1 hand a giant heavy weapon and swing it like a stick without limit at ridiculous speed, meanwhile if you do the same not only you will be swinging it with very slow-motion animation you can only swing it once or twice due to a stamina limitation.AND I DO NOT THINK THIS WAS MEANT FOR DESKTOP, they dint even bother to properly put a UI for keyboard and mouse."
Negative,DOesn't exit to desktop when you ragequit
Negative,game fungame challenging10/10
Negative,I am a boomer. Start playing with Dark Souls I and 2 before purchasing this one. There are a problems managing the camera. And a lot of problems tarrgeting the enemies. You will have to see a lot of youtube videos to progress in the game. Lack of intuition.Actualization: After watching this video:   I have seen that my enemies are much agressive than this one. I got no idea why my steam version is much difficult than  others.
Negative,"How do I start?First I've never played it on console so my review doesn't apply to those versions.Secondly: This is a horrible PC-port.- input lag- framerate drop on a decent machine- hitbox is laughable = I'm 2-3 meters from the enemy's tip of the weapon and I still get hit.- camera: sometimes moves by itself. I LITERALLY DON'T DO ANYTHING AND IT STARTS TO SPIN OR MOVE UP!- controll: sometimes the character moves the opposite way than I pressing a button.- enemies can hit you even you dodged to left or right by simply thrust in a curve- over-complicated menus and submenus- can't use ESC to go back in menus in most cases- no direct quit to desktopOne of the worst PC port ever. I don't think that anyone has tested the main game mechanics.It's one thing that the game is hard but when the game is cheating is another.After a few hours of play it is 100% sure that NO ONE cared about the camera and controlls.I WILL NOT BUY ANYTHING from this LAZY company (probably) ever.P.S.:Fanboys and ""git gud"" braindeads, don't bother."
Negative,"fix poise, make magic better and fix the banning problem and then I will give you a positive review. now excuse me I need to keep playing dark souls like an adict does heroine"
Negative,R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 dodge dodge dodge dodge dodge dodge dodge *fanservice* R1 R1 R1 is this yellow hell over yet?
Negative,Other than the updated game engine and graphics compared to Dark Souls Remastered I really don't have anything good to say about this game.2 bags of popcorn 0 sodas
Negative,Would have been a way better game if i didn't have to fight the camera and my urge to throw up while fighting enemies.
Negative,"Got it on sale, maybe worth it if you like solo, but the multiplayer is so bad i gotta say: avoid it at all costs.Wanna play with a friend? What if some dude with gear you don't know anything about comes and beats you both after you finally managed to get past a squad of zombies? Time to do it again.Single player may be nice though, depending on your disponibility to learn boss mechanics and keep fighting them until their moves are in you reflexes.I will play it more though, the potential for fun exists."
Negative,"There are people who love souls-like games.  I hear they love this game.I like games where I progress.  I did not progress in any meaningful way in DS3.I do not like fighting the same boss literally fifty times and still not getting past it.  I especially don't like having to run around for three minutes every time I die and have to run back to the boss to retry the encounter.I call this game ""not respectful of my time"".When I run fifty practice laps over the same track in a racing game, I feel like I'm constantly engaged and learning.  In DS3 I just feel frustrated."
Negative,Not any good on a PC I could not get past the setup because it requires a controler on a PC to navigate the setup menus. I could set the settings but never get out of the submenu to main menu or game.
Negative,More crashing less dying-gotcha! :( Do i really have to go back to my console and play this. over there i never had it crash on me grrrrrr.
Negative,EDMUND MCMILLEN U FUCKIN COCKLSICKWE FUCKIN TOOD HOWARD FUCKIN Artificaial difficulrty fiufckiff
Negative,game is still trash
Negative,Input lag and buffering in the fastest game of the (Dark) series. What can possibly go wrong?
Negative,Have not tried this game on pc as the controls are the same as controlling an actual fighter jet. The controls are just ported over from the xbox and if u were to play on pc have fun cause u ain't gonna enjoy shit BUT on the other hand console works perfectly normal
Negative,"Great game for the most part, but don't go in expecting fairness like we've come to expect in Dark Souls. Remember the Drakekeeper with the big mace in Dragon Shrine in DS2? He's back, in different forms and names. Expect more things with seemingly infinite stamina and poise, on top of being apparently able to hit you through walls and damage you after the fact you rolled out of range. Half the deaths you experience in this game feels like cheap shots from From Software. They have learned nothing from the flaws of Dark Souls 2, and brought more bad from it over than what improvements it had. And that's just the PvE part of the game. Don't even get me started on how PvP is, with the poise stat apparently useless for players, as in literally turned off.  Fast, pokey weapons dominate the PvP scene right now. All because poise is basically nonexistent due to poise being turned off. Poke, poke, poke, and you're dead. Not much you can do besides hope to parry. Rolling away only gets you poked in the back. Then it's back to poke spam.  All fun and balanced, right? Oh, one last mention... Their anti-cheat system is a joke and even that is being generous. Victims get banned from multiplayer because they got poked by a hacker that illegitmately gives victims a TON of souls and permanently curses them. By the way, there's no appeals process to get unbanned because From Software can't be assed to listen to their Western customers and fix their system. It didn't work in DS2, it's not going to work in this game, From Software. Not a difficult thing to grasp."
Negative,"The game just isn't for me.After hearing all the good talk about dark souls and asking friends about which dark souls i should start with, I picked this one. I had high hopes but unfortunately weren't really met throughout my short time of playing.My first problem that came into play was that I really hated going through everything I went through to get to the place I died to again, only to die again and repeat the process. This killed my resolve to actually persevere through enemies.The second problem is that I'm but a lad and it was just too punishing for me. I'm faced in a situation with a tougher enemy. I have no clue how this enemy works so I wait for it to attack first and I roll to dodge it and try to attack, congratulations I was a FOOL and the enemy pulled back in time to pull their shield out and i slam my long sword into the shield, staggering me and getting impaled by a spear. This rookie mistake ends up with 92% of my health missing. One more mistake and problem number 1 arises again. So now I am bashing my head against a brick wall until I figure out the enemy pattern and can continue.The third problem I had is that delay between attacks and endlag make the gameplay feel really unresponsive. This is coming from me having a larger catalogue of FPS games, platformers and rhythm games, so I'm used to pressing a button and the action being done immediately and therefore in dark souls I'm immediately turned off by endlag and that delay between the button being registered and the action being done.TL:DR - The game is very slow and feels unresponsive and I am bored of doing the same thing only to gain a little knowledge about how to destroy said enemy I can't get past and dying again to do it all over again. Game is probably really good I just can't get past these hiccups. Just simply not for me."
Negative,"Dark, dreary, clunky and brutal. If you are a masochist, you will enjoy this game. For everyone else, there is  Elden Ring. It is far more fleshed out, the timing feels better, and it feels far less crappy over all. Elden Ring is also more than a shade of gray, upon a shade of brown, sprinkled with a lot of decay across your screen.If you own a Playstation 4 or 5, Bloodborne is also an excellent title, worth playing. This right here though, isn't it.I am sure it is right for some, otherwise the Dark Souls series would not have enjoyed the success it did, but it is not for me."
Negative,fuck the snake cunts in archdragon peak
Negative,Horrible PC port. Looks good...but controls are still all based around a controller.
Negative,"This game is unplayable, it crashes so much that i havent been able to actually play the game."
Negative,I thought I would like the game but the PC controls are terrible and make the game useable.  DO not purchase if PC based without controller.
Negative,"The game takes what was done in dark souls 1 and 2, and what was done in bloodborne, and just does it worse. The games feels and looks great, and the bosses are some of the best in the series, but the levels and their designs are horrible, tedious and a pain to explore and play through. Play elden ring, or bloodborne if you can because otherwise this is one of the weakest souls games for 80% of the game, with some good moments sprinkled in."
Negative,"First off, I LOVE Dark Souls games.  I love the challenge, lore, everything.  But at this moment the PC version has two major bugs that I cannot forgive: the game freezes randomly and summons are unreliable.The first issue people said they've ""fixed"" with stopping system processes or updating controller/graphics drivers; I've tried it all and, while reduced, it still happens.  It breaks emersion and combat cadence.The second issue is absolutely terrible.  I cannot cross fog doors when summoned as a sun bro.  Or I'll try summoning people and 9 out of 10 times, it fails.  I've also noticed plenty of PVP glitches and lag.  I have a very good gaming PC and the best broadband service in my area.  My roomates and I play plenty of online competitive games with no complaints.  And what's worse, when I'm the only only gaming this still happens to DS3 and other games play fine online.There's not much I can do, but shelve the game and wait for patches (no, not that guy) to roll out.  What's crazy is that for all the compaints DS1 got, it played smoother and more consistently than DS3.  DS2 was practically a perfect PC experience in comparison.  It saddens me to say this: I cannot recommend this game in it's current state."
Negative,"This game is my least favorite of the series. Although I think badly about this one it holds single-handedly the strongest boss designs/fights in the entire FS lineup. Although the bosses in this game are absolutely amazing, there are some that shine through even more, especially Midir, my favorite boss of all time. The boss design is the only diamond in the rough. PvP in this game is absolutely atrocious, simply the worst in the series as there are a plethora of flaws in every aspect of it. Another massive gripe I have with this game is the world design. It's almost like they didn't even try. I have played every game countless times over and DS3 is always the worst one to run through. I understand that these are supposed to be linear to some degree, but DS3 takes it to a whole other level, coining it the nickname (from me personally) a hallway to bosses. I will defend this games bosses over any other game any day of the week but I still enjoy playing through DS2 more whether its casually or if I was speeding through the game, simply based off of the RPG elements received in DS2 that simply never made an appearance in this game. I am referencing the insane amount of weapons and armor pieces that have passive effects that gave it that tiny touch of RPG these games needed. I also wanted CoC to make a return from DS2 but for some reason that was gone. A covenant that made the game more challenging, essentially running though the game on NG+ rather than NG is amazing. Of course bonfire aesthetics were a great touch as well as fire seeds and the overall balance given to magic from DS1, obviously, excluding the overpowered item called Amber Herb. Sadly DS3 lacks heavily in these fun little gimmicks and made the game 'boring' as I like to put it. I view DS3 like the overarching community views DS2. I dislike it heavily, but I will be honest, at certain points and times, it can be extremely fun and I only ever fun through it for the bosses."
Negative,"Wait it out.I'll start by saying that, as far as I have played, Dark Souls 3 is the best game in the series with varied gameplay (for a Souls game) and an environment that truly pushes you to explore it. Gone is the bland map and encounter design from DSII, replaced with newer, much more varied encounters and places. The storyline seems a bit more explained this time around, and the overall feeling of the game is quite good: It speaks as a labor of love, one that deserves to be played.HOWEVER: It runs bad. For me the framerate is all over the place, jumping from 60fps down to 15 at the drop of a hat, and changing the configuration does nothing to help. The issues persist whether the game is run on minimum or max settings, with the variance adding perhaps five frames per second to the overall experience. ""Bad ports"" as the previous two games were thought to be, they ran much better than this, and therefore I can't possibly recommend that people get this game NOW, particularly when some people are getting not just framerate drops, but constant crashed (I'm luckily not one of those).Wait it out. If it gets patched and becomes properly playable without the game becoming a slideshow I'll change my review to the positive one the actual game design underneath deserves. The risk of getting it right now just isn't worth it: Souls games are meant to be played smoothly, since reflexes are needed to survive in them. When the framerate is wonky and the game threatens with crashing you just can't do that."
Negative,"This game has the worst model clipping of any game I've played in a long time.  Some examples:https://i.imgur.com/6TLeTFi.jpghttps://i.imgur.com/xvH9a50.jpg (the bosses foot has eggs on it, its the entire gimmick of the fight, and the foot is hidden beneath the floor graphic)."
Negative,"Sadly unplayable, crashes every 2 minutes -.-"
Negative,So hard you can't get past the title screen.
Negative,"Let's call it Crash Souls. In it's current state not playable. Palying with a high end system and the game still crashes every 20min, even on medium settings."
Negative,"I like this game, but it is impossible with high level players invading my world even at the very beginning of the game. I'm low level and in two hours I had 10 invades from enemies with enchanted weapons...I know it is a PvP game (i love cooperative) but it is unfair trying to pass the first ""level"" of the game and get killed repeatedly with invaders that oneshots me everytime, it is like sealclubbing."
Negative,"You know, I was all hyped for the dense difficulty and unforgiving bossfights.  Pattern memorization and all that jazz.  Figured I'd jump into the dark-souls with the allegedly easier entry.  Tried to do the first boss for... 3 hours straight.  Finally got sick of it, turned the brain off, and just panic-rolled more or less continuously and without any plan, and managed to beat the fight without getting hit.  I know an omen when I see one.  I ain't gonna waste my time on this.  It's such a shame.  I really did enjoy the Armored Core games.  The earlier ones at least."
Negative,"I had high hopes for this game, thats why i bought it.I only played 20 minutes of it and i had enough of it. The controls was put to xbox controller controls and i could not change them to PC so everytime it told me a control to do, it told me how to do a action on a controller. I had to press 'esc' everytime it told me to do a action to see how to do it with pc controls."
Negative,It's not a bad game but it's a very bad port! Oh and did I mention it will lose your save file if you reinstall or it does not change the icons from controller icons to keyboard icons but it DOES have a purchase DLC option in the main menu? Play it on a console if you have one and you like these type of games
Negative,"I'm sorry to write that but i think don't buy this game if u don't play at the 1st and 2nd Dark Soul. This game is for a players, who want to die and retry, this game is not enjoy me maybe i'm a bad player but it's very hard game so if u are a casual like me don't buy this."
Negative,"I never thought I'd say this about a ""souls"" game, but this game sucks. It constantly crashes every 5-10 minutes. My PC is more than capable of running the game on Max, but I did trying setting graphics to ""low""  as some people suggested on the forums, this makes the game crash every 10-20 minutes, and the game looks very bad.This is the first (and last) time I pre-ordered a game, and was so hyped to play it, but the bad quality of this port killed my hype. Shame on you FromSoftAs it is right now, I cannot recommend the game.Edit: after the 1.03.1 patch the game is crashing less often, and is playable now. The game itself is great, but I'll keep my negative review in the hope that game developers stop focusing on PS4 and give us bad PC ports."
Negative,"I got excited to see this on sale for $10, and I can see why the game is so popular.Granted - I didn't play it much, but every time I did the AI did the EXACT SAME THING every time. This game is absolutely a memory exercise. You learn the bosses and the required sequence of running, jumping, blocking, attacking by dying 1,000 times in a row... at least that's my experience with games like this. Kudos to you if you like this kind of game, it's just not my thing. Even at $10 it wasn't worth it to me, thankfully steam has a great return policy ;]"
Negative,Curse rotted Greatwood worst boss ever designed. I´m out
Negative,"Amazing game, it rekindled my love for gaming but my review is going to be negative until multiplayer functionality is restored. I paid the price for all the features, not only the singleplayer."
Negative,"The optimization is a total failure. I can run most games with almost max graphics, but I can't even play this game with the lowest settings. This is ridiculous. Just waisted 70$."
Negative,I hate this game
Negative,ked sa chces obesit tak pohode :)
Negative,"Controls of 1, looks of Bloodborne, and the ENEMY DESIGN OF 2. This game is fucking shit. Get the most spammable weapon you can and unleash the PURE SKILL on everything.The only fun part of this game is the pvp/drinking contests. Not even kidding its fun as fuck. But it aint worth the $80.notdarksouls1/10 git gud fgt madcuzbad 420yoloswag 360noscopez #autismspeaks every day i wake up is a bad day i wish i had been aborted"
Negative,"Playing with friends in this game is some of the best fun I've ever had, but by god co-oping with two brand new Souls game players and one other experience one and getting invaded by non-stop lightning resin Dragonslayer axe and dark hand wielding twenty estus sipping twinks has honestly degraded any will I have to positively think of this game or series anymore. All of it has been sucked dry. Everyone seems to want only one thing and that is to completely halt and stall any fun or enjoyment that is to be had in this battered horse carcass of a series, and well done on them! Their efforts have been successful. I'll probably come back and try the game again when the player count has dwindled to nigh-infinitesimal numbers, and enjoy the game then."
Negative,"Take my review with a grain of salt since I haven't completed the game:I honestly didn't like it much. I have enjoyed DS1 and DS2 much more than this one. The uh, let's call it home base, sucks compared to the other 2 games. I had a hard time getting into the game's atmosphere and lore, and evidently from playtime, it never actually happened so far. I cleared a few areas, fought some boss and then decided to set it aside.It may well be due to burning out on this type of game? But from how I remember it, I just didn't feel the story, atmosphere and/or characters of the game as I did in its predecessors. It lacked charm to me. Generally, Dark Souls games aren't known for having a happy, relaxing atmoshere, sure~ but at the very least the 'home base' has been charming, relaxing or nice to stay at. In DS3, it's just a grey hole cave thing.Gameplaywise, I would also say that the game felt a bit too quick to me to the point that it felt off to me. This may be a positive for some - I didn't like it.That said, if all you care about is this type of game as well as not minding a faster pace than is usual for a Dark Souls game, then this game is prolly for you and you likely already bought and cleared it anyway. I simply didn't feel it this time. I may try it some time down the line, but given that I got the game in 2016, and it now being 2023 and still only having 8.4 hours to my name in this as opposed to the 200+ hours I have in DS2 for example... I don't see it happening.Edit: I just noticed the game is still at 60 bucks full price 7 years after its release... that seems like a negative in my view as to whether or not to recommend this game as well."
Negative,"Perhaps I do recommend it after all. Not sure. This is not an awful game, but it has a number of quirks that turns it into an unnecessarily frustrating experience. Granted, I am writing this review affected by fresh DS3 frustration, and the best games provides a certain degree of frustration, but this is too much, in my opinion.DS3 is, for better or worse, unforgiving. The gameplay is pretty good. The atmosphere is magnificent. The enemies do bore me after some time of repetition, but they can all amazingly easily kill you if you make a small mistake, which is nice. It's not the gameplay in itself that annoys the fuck out of me, though:One of the aforementioned quirks is simply that it is an obvious console port with controls not designed for the PC, but after a couple of hours, you overcome much of, if not all, these obstacles.Another is its imposing limitations. Take the co-op dimension. I'm not going to go into detail about how I bought this game because it was said to have magnificent co-op. Spoiler alert; it doesn't. Or, rather, once you finally manage to summon your friend (took me 15 hours to understand how and where it's done), who by the way can't progress his or her own campaign while being a ""phantom"" in your game, and who gets only half of their much needed health flasks, you are invaded by someone far more talented than yourself, and who knows what he's doing, and he kills you and your friend off, and you have to find another ""ember"" to be able to summon again. Now, why is this not an option? Okay, you don't want to offer good, simple co-op mechanics for those who wish it, but why not at least let casual and non-competitive players simply TURN OFF invasion? Some people say that no one plays DS3 for the co-op/pve dimension of the game, and that is wrong. So why not allow for more obvious options so that players can more easily actually play and learn the game? Perhaps I would have enjoyed this game more if it let me play it enough to learn how to play it without getting invaded as soon as I'm ""embered"". It is these unnecessary limitations that I simply can't accept.The game in a sense forces you to love it before it gives you anything back, and while I can respect the designers who obviously didn't give a fuck about casual players, it doesn't necessarily make it fun. And I play games mostly for fun."
Negative,better in my memory
Negative,"Very bad PC port. Crashes constantly. Do not buy on PC. The game itself, I imagine, is quite good tho. Just don't buy it on PC."
Negative,"DS3 is the same miserable, trashy Bloodborne with DS1 decorations and items from the series. I didn’t get fun of completing this part at all, at some point I dropped the game for more than a year, now I have found the strength to “finish” this masterpiece. In my opinion there are only two soul games Demon souls (hardcore and buggy) and Dark souls 1 (""Golden standard"", slightly less hardcore and less buggy). As for DS2, the game feels like a late child of Lords of the Fallen and Darksiders, a very strange feeling you experience when passing the second part of the series. It's like scratching the balls, bringing your fingers to your nose, knowing that there will be no flavor of roses, but you still do and inhale with ""rapture"".In conclusion:Bloodborn lovers can safely buy the third part and play in a classic way with a silly smile and eyes looking in different directions./DS3 это все тот же убогий, в хламину оказуаленный Bloodborne  с декорациями DS1 и предметами серии. Удовольствия от прохождения этой части я не получил от слова совсем, в какой-то момент дропнул игру больше чем на год, сейчас нашел в себе силы ""допройти"" этот мастерпис чисто для галочки. Я глубоко убежден, что есть только две стоящие соулс игры, это Demon souls (хардкорный и забагованный) и Dark souls 1(эталонный, чуть менее хардкорный и менее забагованный).Что касается DS2, то ощущается игра как поздний ребенок Lords of the Fallen и Darksiders, очень странное чувство испытываешь проходя вторую часть серии. Это как почесав яйца подносишь пальцы к носу, зная, что на том конце не будет аромата роз, но все равно делаешь и вдыхаешь с ""упоением"". По итогу:Любителям Bloodborn можно смело покупать 3тью часть и по классике играть расплывшись в глупой улыбке с глазами  в разные стороны."
Negative,Monster Hunter World is an objectively better game. dark souls iz 4 low IQ gamerz
Negative,"Clear cookie cutter console port. No support for ultrawide, no support for more than 60 fps, no support for keyboard and mouse (implementation feels like they slapped it on 5 minutes before the release).The gameplay loop is not exactly.. skill based, yet the game presents itself as a challenge. It depends on your knowledge of game mechanics that you get... through trial and error. You don't get to become better at the game. You either memorize everything and beat your enemy, or you die learning. Essentially, this is just a complex memory game where skill is not exactly involved. You see.. playing a different game - you will be able to tackle challenges through experimentation and overall progression and/or skill. In this game, you are reliant on dodgy mechanics such as invincibility frames, inconsistent AI behavior that is sort of the same every time you die, except every now and then enemies will act in an entirely different way, making you just die for no reason. When enemies wear shields, it doesn't take away from their stamina and they don't need to block for the shield to block your attacks. When they swing near terrain, they don't get stunned by hitting a wall with their sword. But when you have a shield equipped, you HAVE to block, otherwise enemy attacks go right through your shield, despite them attacking you from your shield side. Have an enemy near terrain? Tough luck because you will swing, hit them and then your blade will hit the wall next to them, you will get stunned and the game will punish you for this. Its just overall inconsistencies of game mechanics that apply to the player, but not the mobs is what is frustrating. The enemies do not have stamina - they have infinite amounts of stamina. They have pre-determined attack sets which have openings for you to attack them, although the timeframe between these attack sets is.. inconsistent. Sometimes the enemy will sit there and look at you for a solid 10 seconds, other times, they will perform three attack sets with literally no time inbetween for you to attack, making you think that ""hey, you learned his attacks and you are using that to your advantage"" except not really because it is inconsistent. Sure, you can wait more and more before you strike, but this makes the game even more unskilled as a result, as you can't really be sure what the enemy will do, you just have to wait, which is tedious and unfun. Also.. the fact that they can initiate attack sets one after another without stopping means that the mobs have the power to overcome you (which is the idea of the game, fighting enemies muuuch stronger than you are, but you outwitting them), except they just straight up decide to not use all of their power against you, thus letting you defeat them. Like, what? Why make a game all about difficulty and design the lore around the enemies being strong and then code it in a way to have them just not use their full power? That is a bit counter intuitive. They had an idea and then half-way through implementing it they were like ""nah, lets go the opposite direction of that idea"". A fix for that would be to give enemies actual limits - like not being able to block indefinitely and not have infinite stamina, which would actually make a lot of sense and will lead to a more predictable and consistent behavior and this would make it more skillful, but oh well.Sure. The game presents a challenge to overcome and a hard one.Winning a game of basketball versus an NBA team is a challenge.Watching paint dry for 2 days straight without letting your vision stray away and not eating at all is a challenge.One requires huge amounts of skill and physique, the other requires extreme patience. If you expect a challenge that would be closer to the first example - this is not the game for you, as the *type* of challenge that this game presents in my eyes is one similar to that of the second example."
Negative,"It's like doing chores. Repetitive, ultimately pointless, and when you finish your only solace is the thought, ""oh! now I can do it again, but correctly!"" I can also only describe the desire to play the game as a sense of... moral obligation? Like playing that MMO that you don't enjoy, but you already paid for a month of. + Visuals+ Sick Lore+ Gameplay- Gameplay - Game doesn't share any of the Sick Lore it's copping."
Negative,"I have no doubt that this is a good game, but I'm sorry, this is a completely rushed port with little to no support for PC players. If you have an xBox Controller then fine, the game won't be an issue, but if not (like me) it's no worth it. Menus are awkward, hints are borderline useless to start with as the controls are given for an xbox controller, the gameplay is clunkly as hell when you have learned the controls by guessing. After over an hour I figured out how to sprint, but the key binding is locked to whatever the developer locked it to. You can't rebind a game in 2018? What an utter disappointment. I've reuqested a refund..."
Negative,"The community is awesome and hilarious and helpful, sometimes even the invasions are funny, but not this system, the Family sharing was really important for all, most of us cant play with friends without.I can't recommend this game, just because the people who want to play online co-op and PVP because their anti cheat system.You can get invaded by hackers that injects invalid items, like story line items that cannot be deleted, then killed immediately, then getting banned because someone else cheated on your profile. Most of the game experience is ruined by cheaters.Regards, i guess"
Negative,Great game so far but it won't respond on opening. I've tried reinstalling twice and it works directly after but the next day it won't respond anymore. No fixes available online so I can't play it anymore.
Negative,Buggy controls and a wandering camera
Negative,Dark Soul III : The Hacker City
Negative,Amazing game other than the fact that ive been penalized and cant play online on my level 9 knight. Dont know how to fix this and there is little to no support for the issue or the from the developers.
Negative,"This game is good but definitely not something like 94% positive.I bet ppl like this game because of the lore rather than the game.The world is pretty huge with different enemies and buildings.However, some of those enemies are repeated over and over.Also, the builds are quite limited, leaving you countable options.Most weapons are significantly worse than the meta.The plot feels rather standard, nothing special.AND Fix the goddamn PVP server"
Negative,"May as well start the review with the cards on the table, that is the 600 and some odd hours I spent in DS2. More importantly, I wrote a lengthy negative review for DS2 and continued to be drawn towards the game, amassing those hours. Like many fans of the series I missed out on DS1 due to bad port, but I enjoyed the pants off Demon Souls. This one didn't go so well with me and I guess I'd like to explain why below, if your interested. Making no effort to hide any spoilers..We kick right off the game rolling into the first boss which probably caused a heap of refunds for those that didn't spend those few important test-hours in character creation. Really not sure what the idea was with this boss, but it was not the right choice for boss number one. This boss returns near the end of the game once again to show you how having loads of stamina and a very fast weapon is the only way for success in Dark Souls 3 boss fights. And it also shows how bad animations and glitchy enemy-arm-must-autolock-player-model-no-matter-what-way-he-is-facing looks like on the screen. And eww, nowhere in this review will I be saying anything about difficulty, same went for that DS2 review. (prefer the word frustration)The odd mechanics continue forward with the same layers that I must be frankly tired of by now. Entire zones with poison effects, stunlock situations abound, zones with auto-targetting projectiles raining from the sky on the other end of the map, enemies seemingly without stamina bars and unlimited magics/projectiles, enemies full capability to strike through walls and objects (the ai makes full attempts to use this feature). For comparison, the character you play has trouble wielding a sword in a hallway as swinging it bounces wildy off the walls. Best advice for a new player of this game, don't think for a second that the enemies play by the same game world rules as you do. Some of this I expected to be the same from DS2 and it was, so I shouldn't have the right to complain.Probably the biggest no-no for me is this fast-forward feel to the game. I read this is some kind of Bloodborne feature but never played that game. Pushing the fast forward button on Dark Souls after releasing three prior games in the souls series with slow-methodical gameplay, why? Say hello to the horrible camera controls, now in high speed. Watch as high-speed bosses flip around arenas causing the camera to lose its mind. (sigh)...nevermind your dead again.I don't know what happened. All I can say is I have zero interest in entering new game plus mode. (which has been a staple feature in the series) For new players, you can re-enter the game in new game plus mode with your character beefed up and play through a harder version. But with the flashbacks of the bosses, the camera, the who-made-these-decisions face palms?Armor no longer can be upgraded which is great, as there wasn't enough materials in the game to do it anyway. Unfortunately it seems armor-with-buffs doesn't really exist anymore. (just one or two items) Dual wielding weapons seems to be removed, which is a shame it was fun to dual wield ultra great swords in DS2. (or hammers, or morning stars...etc) Archery has been nerfed big time with arrow stacks at 99 arrows instead of 999. 99 arrows doesn't get you to the next bonfire unless you run pass everything, and running pass enemies doesn't earn souls to buy more arrows. Just started using magic after finishing the game, so not going to comment on fighting bosses solo with it. All I can say is you have to use fast weapons in the boss arenas, and have lots of stamina to survive. (see fast-forwarded gameplay above)There's more but I must be about out of room by now. Thanks for reading and hopefully this was helpful to some extent. (I feel better after putting it into words)Edit: fixed typo and removed link that was created because I used three periods in a row"
Negative,"Horrible on PC. When a game is released on PC, I generally assume I can play with a mouse and keyboard. Technically you can, but it's horrible. At default 5/10 camera speed setting, it orbits at about 2,000,000 miles per hour. If you set it to 0/10 it still orbits too fast, but is playable. The controls while using a mouse and keyboard are clunky, and it feels like the bare minimum was done just so that the lazy devs could say it supported a mouse and keyboard. Instantly refunded."
Negative,"If you are an adult like me who has an hour now and then to play a game, this is not for you.  You need to accept doing the exact same sequence for hours on end to figure out how to get past even the most basic boss.  It just isn't fun.  On the other hand it has defined a whole genre, so now I know exactly which games to not bother with - just look for the ""souls-like"" and don't buy it!"
Negative,"-removed poise-literally no reason to not just spam r1-most weapon arts borderline useless-most items and rings completely useless-many status effects and elements useless-same with castables-small weapon variation and even smaller table of viable weapons-no reason to use heavy armor-no need to manage stamina-infinite rollspam-ruined invasions by various means-healing with estus has no penalty, no way to punish it due to it being fast and instantenious healing-pvp is spam caestus or two hit the enemy, or die-revisiting areas from previous games is nice but not when visiting them consists near half of the game-dull areas with litte variation and a lot of unessecary swamps-ng+ adds nothing new to the game, just tougher enemies and few useless rings swap places, and  the more powerful rings have little to no improvement in stats-durability is so high, it takes a lot of time to break anything and you have to do it deliaberately, why even have the mechanic anymore"
Negative,Have some self respect.
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 for me is the weakest game in the entire From Software series. It's a massive step down for last years GOTY Bloodborne and it's expansion The Old Hunters in every way possible.  Some areas borrow Bloodbornes enemy mechanics but it fails to balance the odds. Classes are severely weakened(forget about playing mage or pyromancer). You are required to use frustrating melee brute force. Armor upgrading is removed and the newly introduced weapon arts gimmick is clunky, leaves you extremely vulnerable and slows you down even more, if you use it, you better make sure it hits it's target or prepare for a spamming stunlock death. When considering the games enemy pace has been increased greatly. It's for PVP only.It is a frustrating slog in the later areas after a easy opening half. This game lures you in with it's easy opening and then later pummels you unfairly while exposing it's balancing issues later in the game. Frenzied fast bosses without Bloodbornes player dash? It's just plain silly, it's Broken! You will be summoning players regularly, if you can actually summon them. Online is a little janky at times. Connection and animation issues.Artisically it's also the most visually unimpressive entry. Bloodborne looks so much better. It has the modern graphical bells and whistles but it doesn't have the beauty of DS1's Anor Londo or Majula of DSII. Irithyll of the Boreal Valley is the games visual highlight.  Instead It has a look that fits in with the death and decay conclusion to the series. Level design is also lacking. levels are large but a little simplistic and look rushed in places.If you are a souls fan you already own it.  If not, wait for the eventual Steam sale.With a heavy heart I'm leaving a negative review. The series can and has done so much better before."
Negative,SHIT GEM I ONLI DYE AL TEIM
Negative,"This game is pretty bad, pretty bad.""omg y u say dis myazaki maed dis gaem, he es mah gawd"", yes yes i know, you are just a stupid fanboy willing to eat whatever myazaki makes.Dark Souls 3 had potential, it could've easily been the best souls game, it could've beaten DKS2 in PvP and DKS1 in PvE.Okay lets get to the pros and consPROS: Good PvE.Great map design.Great combat system.Has PvP.Well designed bosses.Difficult.CONS: Magic is WORTHLESS, unless you are going sorcery (with CSS or CSM), but then again, everyone in PvP can dodge it.No replayability.Melee is overpowered, it is way better than magic.Can't go hybrid magic/melee, you have to invest 50 int/faith to do serious damage.Tank builds are non-exsistant, they have low def and poise is bad (hyperarmor on attacks).PvP is insanely inbalanced, its either use a long-ranged ultra weapon or use the washing pole, fist weapons are USELESS USELESS USELESS USELESS! (or any short ranged weapon in this game) No versatility in weapons, they all have the same movesets and there are only about 6 weapons that are worth using in pvp.Rolling is too spammy, in other souls games, the more weight you put on the worse your roll gets, there was a ninja flip (op) light roll, medium roll and fat roll, now its just light roll and fat roll. Equip the Carthus Bloodring as well and you can't be touched at all.Invasions are so bad in this game, the game puts you at a GIANT disadvantage, prepare yourselves, this is going to be a long list of disadvantages1. When you invade, you will have less hp than the host.2. The host can summon 3 people into his world without cooldown (if you kill one, he can just summon another)3. You have HALF your healing/mana items, meaning magic is even more useless and invasions are even more hard.4. When you die in an invasion, instead of your souls being place where you used the Red Eye Orb, it will be put where you died so you must either run all the way to where your souls are, fighting through mobs and wasting your time. Or you can just lose your souls and start another.""Oh but you have mobs to assist you, meaning you have a great advantage"", yes true, but this brings us to ANOTHER disadvantage6. The host can turn his mobs against you with the seed of the giant tree.Really fromsoft? so not only am i getting destroyed by 3 phantoms and 1 host with meta weapons, but i have less healing items, their mobs piling up on me and ripping me to shreds, AND my souls get placed like a million metres away. It is so inconvienient and unrewarding to invade someones world.That is UNLESS, you make a meta build consisting of the lothric knight greatsword (does stupid damage), Moron blade (20% more damage with low hp), Red Tearstone Ring (20% MORE damage with low hp), and boom, you are now one-shotting people.That gets super boring, using one build over and over again just to be able to do something in invasions. If you want PvP, I suggest placing a Red Soapstone Sign down, so you can be summoned for a duel and have an actual fair fight.Oh yeah, and i forgot to tell you, you can't get invaded if you kill the boss of the area. Wow, you didnt learn from DKS1, instead you made it so people can only get invaded like 4 times in the entire game (you have to be lucky to get invaded 4 times).Like I said, this game could've been great, but they screwed up PvP and made it so you can only go light armor with heavy weapon/dex weapon or you do nothing.I give this game a 5/10, I will change this review after dlc comes out, hopefully then the game is more balanced, right now, I just cant recommend this game.inb4 people who cant be bothered to read the review and dislikes straight away."
Negative,Kinda mid ngl
Negative,They don't have an option to set the displayed keys to keyboard and mouse. Its not even optional. Thats just ridiculous.
Negative,"I gave this a try, I really did, but just no.The controls for PC are really wonky. You essentially have to guess what A and B mean and hope that you will remember it the next time you play. Movement and camera direction feel super weird as well... like something made back in the early 2000s, you know... when games were first becoming ""3D.""But that's not what gets me. See, I like that the game is meant to be hard, but at least give me the option to be able to dodge things properly. And here is what my issue is: rolling. It's bonkers. There is like a half second delay from the time I tell the game to roll and when it actually does it. This is also a problem with attacks to an extent, but it's especially bad when rolling. If I tell you to roll, ROLL. Like NOW! Everything in this game as a delayed response and that's frankly BS.Not getting another Dark Souls game ever again. And before you say it: no I will not get a controller just to play this stupid game. Just no. If you release something on PC, make sure it's playable on PCs. Period."
Negative,"I don't care how much anyone says FromSoft actually cares when they can't figure out the most basic multiplayer no-no's like not preventing people with a thousand hours in the game and endgame equipment from people who have just finished the tutorial with their starting equipment. I know there's systems in place to try to prevent that, but they clearly do nothing.I've only played the game for four hours trying to co-op with a friend who made a new character to play with me and we've had a dozen invaders who were all rocking endgame equipment.Play the game solo at first, don't bother with co-op. The multiplayer is probably exactly like Elden Ring where it isn't worth bothering to do unless you're already 2/3 through the game and on a more even playing field with the people who revolve their entire playstyle around ruining the game for everyone else."
Negative,Please there is no point to having the option in truning off cross region play if I am going to matched with people from china anyway.
Negative,"Too hard, quit years ago but I'm back and the matrix wont hold me anymore I will beat this game no matter what just you wait"
Negative,"I regret purchasing this game.  After about 10 hours playing it, I agree wholeheartedly with this sentiment I found on the web when trying to understand why anyone likes these games:""Ohh I am so happy to see this thread. Dark Souls series is among the most overrated series in the history of gaming. Bad animations, clunky repetitive combat, ugly 3d models, shallow story trying to be ""deep"" by reducing accesibility, exploitative gameplay, meaningless progression, and a general sense of ""half-bakedness"" across the board. The only things I like are the environment and design of creatures. The success of the series depends entirely on fanboys convincing each other ""Oh you play Dark Souls??? You hardcore!!!"""""
Negative,"THIS IS NOT DARK SOULS!Dark souls is know for being hard but fair. I can't count how many cheap deaths I had in this game. Like having full health then knocked to the ground and before I can even get up im hit so many times I die. Or getting wedged inbetween objects in the game and not being able to move so the enemies just kill you. Or the fact they can hit you through solid objects like trees and walls!! CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP.I love the Souls games I have hundreds of hours in them, I love playing them over and over. This.....this I am not enjoying. GraphicsNot great. I would even say not next gen.Some areas just look really bad. Almost as if the game was rushed. Framerate issuesSoundGood. Not much to screw up in these games though.GameplayEnemie AI is broken at times.Relentless mobs that dont stop attacking so your stamina is drained until they kill you.Casting magic takes to long compared to the speed of the enemies. Using a sheild to block is death because relentless attacks.(the game forces you to play one way. Attack then roll away. repeat. They should have called it Dark Rolls)There is so much I can say about this game but I am just too disapointed to even bother. Oh yeah and I wont talk about the crashes."
Negative,"Kinda shit level design, bosses are kinda shit, and the game is riddled with hackers that can permanently ruin your save meaning a ban or losing all your progress. Pretty much every invader cheats since ""Honest Merchant"" mod came out, and if you somehow manage to defeat an invader using this mod, or even more op mods like statchecker etc, you will probably instantly die from the invaders ""smite"" cheat, which does 1000 lightning damage a second and breaks all equipment, and if you are lucky you might even recieve an item which bans your character. Dont play online, if you do, use anticheat mods and hacks to hopefully avoid most cheaters, or get banned yorself since there are less cheaters on the banned servers."
Negative,"Like all Dark Souls games, this is a terrible attempt at porting to the PC. I really don't recommend it."
Negative,Please fix the online service. Don't abandon this game FromSoftware !
Negative,really fun game
Negative,"They went absolutely insane with the regional pricing. I paid around R$30 for the Deluxe Edition, now the game is going for R$115 for JUST THE BASE GAME. The Deluxe Edition is now over 160. That's over a 5x increase in price."
Negative,"It's more of a mixed recommendation, it depends on what you are looking for when you sit down to game. If you like working on very hard problems, grinding away at it bit by bit, then this game is for you. For me however, this game feels like hard work, and after I do my actual job I like to relax and have fun with games.It's not that I am against a good challenge, I really liked Elden Ring. Here though it feels like the game prioritizes difficulty over fun. Every boss door has a few tough enemies in front of it that you kill over and over again as you learn the boss. Not sure why, just to spite you I guess. Sometimes you have to backtrack the map and the fast travel points are not even close to were the game is branching off, so it can be confusing where to go.Of course it's very satisfying to overcome bosses in this game, but everything else in the game is overly annoying in my opinion. In contrast Elden Ring was a joy to explore."
Negative,Why in the hell is this still $60? It's damn near 3 years old. Thought I'd pick it up for PC but guess not. The other versions you can get for like $5.
Negative,Govno iz jopy a ne igra ht tfy razrabam v ebalo
Negative,"Trash without controller, don't get if you are planning on playing with keyboard and mouse."
Negative,"This game is ass just because of the fcking door bug at the Dancer of the Boreal Valley boss fight. L game, Elden Ring is better."
Negative,"It require too much effort to play and gives nothing back. If you don't want to spend 100+ hours trying to understand how to beat delay on the controls first, camera glitches second and ass-kicking bosses (especially one of them that without knowing what to do will take probably a week of your time) then better avoid this game. Game gives you only minimum amount of information even if you pay attention to every dialog, it doesn't provide you clear vision on what to do next and even where exactly you are in current moment (because there is no map). Graphics are beautiful, story line is intriguing but not full clear, especially if you play it in non-native English."
Negative,"The pacing of combat makes no sense for the first boss and for almost all other hostile people. I got stuck on a spear knight blocking my way and couldn't hit him unless I was lucky because there isn't any gaps in his move set unless you roll out of the way. BUT even if you roll out of the way your small survival frame will most likely wear off and his spear will be somewhere where you will touch it get damaged, staggered, stabbed, then killed. Another issue is that I spent 5 to 10 minutes trying to change one key binding because they couldn't bother to even port this game over to PC from xbox properly. Overall I'm displeased because Dark Souls was one of my more favorite games, I would go back to one on the 360 all the time. This just can't compare though."
Negative,Cant play the game lol
Negative,Great game but joke of an anti-cheat system.Do NOT buy this until they fix their anti-cheat system or you'll risk losing online play for no reason with no support or a word from the developers even if you follow all instructions.
Negative,"I am so glad I finally picked up this game to play it. I really missed out on a whole genre of games that I thought I would never be interested in. I absolutely love the Dark Souls and 'Souls like' franchise, but.....Out of spite i'll still say that it's unacceptable that a PC port of a game does not include simple features such as -Mappable Controls -Mouse and Keyboard support (i.e. showing what keybinds does what etc)-Proper Graphic settings (Being able to change things more than just textures and motion blur-Half-assed controller support, only Xbox support. Meaning that when I plug in a PS4 controller, I have to know the keybinds by heart in order to even play the game correctly. (This is a horrible idea because this was my first souls game, I had to go out of my way just to play with a old controller just to sit through countless troubleshooting videos because Xbox 360 controllers are not bluetooth and require a external wireless adapter.)All of these problems stated are issues that I had to never experience in most PC games and ports because they are made in mind of the user and platform. This is unacceptable and shows a lack of care from the developers for their game. And to drive this point further because most fanboys I'll talk to about this issue always get so flustered, let me make a point so you can understand the principle of the issue at hand.Imagine buying a game from a company like Nintendo or Sony. You are buying a game for that platform (Switch or PS4) and without any note from the developers or from the company that you are buying from fails to mention that it has basic features missing. You put the disc into your console and you realize that it barley works with the controller that you use to play 99.9% of your games with. You do some troubleshooting and you find out it only has true Mouse and Keyboard support. And using a controller is borderline useless unless you want to mod it in so it can work properly. Well that's a little ridiculous, especially that you are playing on a console and usually you are not asked to use such a input mode before. My point here is that you are being forced to use a medium of input that is alien to the hardware you are using, just because the lazy developers did not spend the extra time to make a simple addition to support the platform's main input and control scheme. If the developers fail to make a simple addition in preparation of the platform the game will be released on, it shows a lack of care for their own game."
Negative,"Thank you bandai namco, remove the game from geforce now so that people who bought for that platform cant play. Never ever buying a game from you."
Negative,"no, just no"
Negative,"If you're just looking for more of the same Dark Souls single player experience, I'd recommend the game. A lot more of the unique world, lore and bosses are packed into this one, though at this point in the series a lot of the bosses are getting a little too easy and predictable.If you're wanting anything innovative or remotely different, look elsewhere. Almost nothing new is brought to the table.If you're looking for a fun and complex PvP scene, as I was myself, turn the other way. A large amount of the skill and strategy involved in PvP has been gutted from the game, replaced with gimmicky weapon arts and bugs where your enemies will have literally zero animations. The netcode is worse than ever and there's no dedicated PvP arena, something that they'll probably add in future DLC. Everything is obviously horribly balanced, backsteps rarely work, you can't fake attack, healing isn't punishable. There's a lot to be fixed and some that can't."
Negative,"Don't get me wrong, I love me some Dark Souls... However,Best Crashing Simulator 2016Fromsoft please patch the game"
Negative,Get the servers back up fromsoft
Negative,"Only shows xbox controller buttons. Mouse sensitivity is off the charts, I turned in game mouse sens down to 1, and camera speed down to 1, my camera still flying all over the place had to turn down my dpi but then when I do that my mouse is super slow when I hit escape to go into the menu. So dumb that studios just port a game without any effort whatsoever. Background sound effects keep cutting out every 5 seconds which is super annoying. Would love to play the actual game but unfortunately because the developer is lazy and doesn't care about PC this is not it."
Negative,"I know, I know, I'm a bad gamer. I wanted to like Dark Souls, I really did, but as my first foray into the Souls-series, it didn't do the trick. The weapons feel sluggish, and I can't properly control my character half the time. It's not even too challenging, I just find the controls actually obnoxious, and with my bad sense of orientation, I spent my entire time on the walls of lothric not finding where I need to go to continue.I really wanted to like this game, but I just couldn't quite manage."
Negative,"PVE is fine. PVP is shit.Expecting a fun PVP game ? Well dont. Invading has a plethora of problems and to top it off, cross region matchmaking is never not on and youll just get a bunch of laggy chinese retards hacking using family share accounts."
Negative,"This game is currently completely unplayable due to constant crashes and disconnecting from the server due to insufficient frame rate(On minimum settings with a decent computer, never had any issues running any other new game on maximum settings) and getting booted back to the main menu, where it will crash again sometimes, and it will crash when starting the game back up after it crashed, horrible port, no effort at all and 1 month behind the console release? Don't buy this unless they fix these issues, in fact, get your money back while you can if you have purchased it already, and buy it later once you can actually play it, it'll probably be cheaper."
Negative,after a couple 100 hours  on console and pc cobined i say dark souls 3 is the  worst of  the 3/4 if you count elden  ring  map design  of dark souls 3  was pretty damn lazy and waay too linear and felt too much like fan service with bringing back a  part of anor londo enemy design pretty  lazy  aswell as it's just reskinned dark souls 1  and  bloodborne enemies bosses are also worse  in my opinion like  over half of them  feel like bloodborne enemies by how fast they attack making me think damn  wish i had  that  parry  pistol in dark souls 1  all these  enemies where pretty slow except from  the dlc  but that was logical with the size of some  of them  when  i  saw  vordt i  was  like oh is he like asylum demon  aka slow  and  fat but no not slow just fat as if they thought the game would  be more fun and  hard when every  enemie is attacking and moving double your speed
Negative,"This is a lazy port from console without any PC optimization. Tooltips only show controls for controllers and there is no option to change this to KB+M controls. I don't even have a controller. This makes no sense. I have to constantly go back and forth between my keybinds settings just to see what key does what. More frustrating than it is worth. It is even locked to 60 FPS! As if this were still on a console! Gross. I really wanted to like this game and be able to enjoy it, but it just wasn't made for PC at all. Requested a refund after finding no way to change tooltips to show KB+M controls instead of controller."
Negative,"stupid game banned me for ""toxicity"""
Negative,Co op system is really bad. otherwise  FUN GAMEEDIT: fucking controls say controller things even if using keyboard/mouse.
Negative,"this game fuckin sucks, and its not even that its hard. it has bad mechanics and a lot of enemy types that arent really programmed all that good."
Negative,"Unfairly get overleveled people joining in the game for beginners and not letting them actually play the game and if a dark spirit does join your game and you are starting to beat it, it will continue to just retreat until the cpu kills you. dark spirits ruin this game and for that reason would not recommend it to anyone."
Negative,"+1year after release consider this the final patched version.PVP is very disappointing and frustrating with broken hitboxes, laggy matchmaking (or netcode ?) and overall unsatisfying fight dynamic.NPC quests, (inexistent)-storytelling and lore presentation really don't do it for me.PVE and map design is bland and non innovative. Most bosses are forgettable.Faster gameplay is a step in the right direction but it feels like a circus at times, Bloodborne did it better.Unfinished and/or rushed ? Where are previous improvements from Dark Souls 2 ?I still have a sour taste from the Dark Souls 2 Scholar of the first sin rerelease and this last adventure doesn't end with a glorious note. No interest for DLC.-PVP- Focused on 1v1, invasionsLongswords hit 1m away from their tip, lance charges have a 2m radius despite the animation, phantom hits through evasion rolls, 180 degrees correction turns ala ballerina (non commiting start animation).Poise system is ineffective (balance stat granted by armor) so a walking mountain ends up being staggered by a plastic butter knife 3 meters away thanks to cross-continental lag. You often trade direct blows despite having a clearly faster windup or longer range. There is also a hyperarmor granted upon swinging certain heavy weapons which grants stagger immunity however this starts too early in the swinging animation e.g. R1 > first horizontal swing ends > R1 > opponent fails to stagger you whilst you're not even in a swinging animation (sword is still held to the side) due to R1 prefire. 2 light attacks should chain into each other but lag sets them free at times ending up in a trade.Parries do not make for an interesting/fun fight or mechanic, certain movesets are so telegraphed (limited melee mixups) you might as well stop there once you see a buckler rise up. With this well established lag I refuse to believe parrying is a worhful tactic in PVP.Class balance relies mostly on offensive tools thus magic or weapons. Most spells are telegraphed once again but maybe you could catch a lucky lag rollback into your AoE. Hyperarmor heavy weapons and overreaching longswords/estoc are clearly superior, lagwarrior trumping all. I used a scythe which wasn't high tier.Too much stamina regen and too many rolls making matches often devolve into a circus poke and run (if you're not abusing hyperarmor). Fighting games rounds usually finish under 45sec and are a lot more action packed.Matchmaking balance is also lacking as you'll encounter during your early adventure many geared-up opponents with end-game accessories. Or hackers corrupting your save ! This matchmaking cannot be taken seriously when Western Europe is being matched against China/Taiwan/South Africa, even at EU prime time and correct networking options (which don't appear to achieve anything).PVP activities seem unfinised with 2 covenants (guilds) being the same in practice : Darkmoon and Blue Sentinels. They also both struggle to get any action it turns out (which DS2 handled better). No big innovations with the others. Arena __locked__ to a DLC !!!Coming from fighting games this PVP community doesn't feel welcoming. Lot of snarky behavior (hatemail, salt miners, griefing, tryhards) and a ever weird cult of memes and antics. I'll never get those emotes...Overall gameplay quality really feels unrefined due to the points above. If you like 1v1 technical dueling see fighting games, if you like small group brawling see MMORPG Dota or what have you. Dark Souls weapon dynamic really isn't that interesting. For example fighting games have :- clear and consistent data, rules and animations/hitboxes = when I do this action this __should__ happen everytime- low inputlag and hopefully better regional/rank matchmaking- technical with pressure, mixups, low/overhead, jumping, grabs, oki, reactions, meters, reversal and combos- fast dynamic and fluid- mostly balanced and no gear/build time waste- fighting space management (additional pressure once cornered)- easier on the eyes, an arena focuses on the fighters with clear animations / chara design (it's hard to identify dark souls weapons at times)- no silly mile staring contest whilst jiggling around, 9 consecutive circus rolls or improvised marathon. There is always a reaction button to press for pressure/punish- no roleplay no gimmicks, just people punching each other to death as it should be-NPC, story and lore- SPOILERSI hate Dark Souls 3 friendly NPC with a burning passion. Their quests are hidden, nonsensical or cryptic which means you'll most likely have to play with the wiki on your lap. Many annoying branches or death ends with one benign action messing up a whole quest progression. And their voice lines... Heheeeee, hahahaaaa, siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight at every dialogue end. Their mysterious faked relevance feels so forced.See the Catarina knight for example (which you meet at Undead Settlement), you end up tricked in the Cathedral by Patches wearing a Catarina armor and somehow have to guess he stole it from the knight now trapped in a well you're very likely to never pass again ? This ain't a unique armor why would have I made the connection ?Or Sirris which hates me for taking Rosaria's fingers. You couldn't deduct it from her previous dialogue at all.Only cool guy is Greirat and he ended up killed, thank you From Software.First time I met Emma the old lady guarding Lothric Castle I sliced her open in frustration before the end of her lines. This is the first NPC alluding to the story and she ends up pulling a banner out of her bottom for an inexistent and unexplained plot. That's all she is just a banner butt-puller, MMORPG Fedex quest throwbacks anyone ? Some swear by this storytelling or lack thereof, I think it's lazy. A MMORPG has more of a story and NPC development. Dark Souls 1 sitting knight at the shrine at least gave you some useful indications.External forums lorefagging is not a valid form of storytelling (neither for mechanics explanation !!! see poise). Sparsed hints (willfully left cryptic so up to open interpretation) aren't either.-PVE- SPOILERSMuddy swamp, catacombs and generic skeletons, fire hell, cathedral, they really didn't look far for innovation.Some segments really made me scratch my head : first part from Road of Sacrifices with the Corvian felt off for example.Lothric castle looks good I suppose. Graphics and lighting feel nice.Seeing most of the map is a welcome return from the first game.Most bosses are forgettable. Yhorm is the worst boss fight I've ever experienced making me question if it was designed by totally unrelated developpers, it's supposed to be one of the 4 capital bosses dammit ! Abyss watchers is laughably weak to stagger so keep your table spoon at hand ! Deacons of the Deep and Skeleton Lord Wulnir are trash mob worthy, Should you meet oversized or hyperactive monsters it's the awful camera (5th game still not right) you'll fight instead.Lothric Princes were frustrating due to teleportation (causes loss of camera tracking, can end up behind you so off screen) into bright flash covering up the followup animation. It's a fun fight otherwise.I wished they explored some new modes or PVE covenants, a boss rush could have been fun.I'll be honest Dark Souls 3 left me quite bitter, playing with a blood dagger staggering everything whilst iframe drifting felt ridiculous. Previously mentionned sections didn't help. Lord of the Cinder probably saved the experience as he is the best boss fight (or one of) I've ever encountered. A boss made up of all players with all fighting styles, aggresive fast and opportunistic AI (I swear that guy surprised me with his onpoint Oki, miracle force or lance circling swings). Clear and well made patterns. Sound design and arena were great. I catched some funny pop offs when he got my character down, showing off his mighty blows to the cameraman (double miracle force for example)."
Negative,"The game is a pale imitation of what the original aspirations sought to achieve.-PVP is unbalanced-Summoning system is unable to allow you to summon more than one person when using a password system-Summoning results in the entire animation and frames of the enemy to disappear, leaving you with stationary enemies moving without running, taking damage without attack animations, and worse.-Armor system is a new one, leaving you to suffer no matter what you equip-Poise has been disabled from the game, and any attempts to find a way to turn it back on gets you banned despite the fact you're SUPPOSED to have it. It shows poise in the status screen, and yet you have NONE of that rating at all-Camera system is shoddy to say the least; often entrapping you in a position where it cannot even maintain the lock on of a target, leaving your camera to snap forward. This usually leaves you completely unaware of your enemies next attack, and it happens frequently with bosses. -Camera distance is short and unable to maintain lockon even when target is ahead of you.All in all, I feel as though I really want a refund on this game. It's a true disgrace to have to sit here and endure the amount of bull that this company has shoveled together and slapped a Dark Souls title to.  The game can't be enjoyed with friends because of the summoning issues, and holds no regard for the players at all whom  have purchased this game. All in all...AVOID THIS SERIESAVOID FROM SOFTWAREGo play Salt & Sanctuary instead."
Negative,"As a long time souls fan this is a matter of personal opinion. This game does not come close to demon souls, DS1 or DS2 despite it being very massive and polished. I've played countless hours on every souls title and probably purchased each souls title at least twice. This is the only souls game i could quite honestly have gone without playing."
Negative,PvP hackers ruined gameplay experiences.
Negative,mid ass game
Negative,black screen on start up
Negative,game sucks dick. nice final game Miyadumbzki. this game is just fanservice for retared people. FUCK gamers. poop in mouf
Negative,this is why i dont trust reddit
Negative,Everything was great until from banned me from multiplayer for no reason.
Negative,"This masterpiece was rated as not recommended by me. Everyone knows Dark Souls is a difficult game, and it is, and it may not only harm you and your future, but it can also lead to insanity, which is weird since I was going insane while playing it, but I am now sane and will be back playing it in a short time, and I am in love with Isabela Madrigal!"
Negative,"Love the game, but it could have been much better.  I am probably not going to finish the game because it is too hard to have such a worthless control mechanic.  This was made for people with joysticks.  Combat is a timing and memorization challenge where all you do is fire different animations off and then wait for them to finish.  The targeting is so consoly it's gross, but it's required.. you can't circle strafe around an opponent without toggle targeting... you can't look left while running right with out fighting the camera.  Did they not know we have the mouse to control with?  So frustrating. This game is you VS your stamina in many ways; im more worried about my stamina and which enemies need more of it and not the actual enemies.  Sure I recommend this to a point, because it's quite different and will bring emotions out of you.  But I also conclude that this should have never come to the master race without adjusting the game for the extreme control authority that computers have over consoles.  Devs got lazy or ran out of time.  I am a disappointed PC user.   Console control schemes ruin the highly reactive potential of the PC."
Negative,"When it was released this game was so good and the DLCs only improved it and I would have recommended it in a heartbeat, but now 2 years after the last DLCs release date it is just cancer to play online.Just for good measure and so nobody gets the wrong idea, I will mention, that I am not softbanned from the game so I am not in the restricted online pool of cheaters but regardless. I just recently re-installed the game to try to get back at it after doing a Dark Souls 2 playthrough, and the experience is definitely worse than ever now.I can't invade or get invaded, at any given level bracket without meeting twinked out invaders with max estus and all items in the game, twinked out gank squads, over leveled password phantom summons chucking high level spells, like they were prism stones, that oneshot me or script kiddies that have turned god mode on. Or simply overleveled phantoms oneshotting me with their overleved weapons. To top it all off they also have very large health pools it would be impossible to kill them first with my low damage output. All that was just a small bit of what I experienced between level 18 - 30 while trying to start leonhard's quest, and it seems like it all goes completely unmonitored by from, it seems like they dont care now that Dks3 is a done and shut deal. I met more of what i just described than I met lone hosts or hosts with level appropriate phantoms.it is decent for a single player run through offline, but unless you want ""uninterrupted co-op with all my overleveled friends"" online is now a nightmare."
Negative,"I would love to leave a review that praises how good this game is, but the truth is that i have not had the opportunity to experience this game in the fashion that i wanted. I bought this game for one reason only - to be able to play it in coop. Having got to the point where it is possible to summon anyone into your game, i have since spent around 3 and a half hours trying and failing to bring anyone into my game. I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who might think they know some reason why it wouldn't work for me... make sure your character is 'embered', make sure you haven't killed the boss, check your firewalls, open ports on your router... etc, etc... believe me, i have tried every fix that can be googled. At this stage, i really doesn't matter to me if it is a problem with my computer or my ISP or my router - if i have to spend hours trying to make coop work with my generic PC setup and STILL fail, then this game is fundamentally broken. Many might disagree with me, but as far as i am concerned i paid money for a certain experience that was promised to me, and the creators of this game failed to make good on that promise. And the worst thing is, i cant even get my money back.So no, i cannot in good faith recommend this game, despite its amazing visuals, interesting lore and satisfying game-play, because i cannot guarantee that you won't be buying this game for the same reason i was."
Negative,Playing this game without knowing anything about Bloodborne made me wish for a refund.P.S: Still no servers after claiming they would work on it this february.
Negative,The combat in this game is slow and very glitchy. This game was a wast of my money
Negative,Play peak souls 2 instead
Negative,"Great game, horrible PC port"
Negative,"Boring and repetitive, and I didn't even play for 2 hours."
Negative,forced camera auto rotation = unplayable garbageno borderless window = unplayable garbagealso the bosses are poorly designed and the pvp sucks ass and the anti-cheat doesn't exist and the level design is extremely bland. but i'm not mad about that
Negative,"Thats the biggest waste of money i've made on steamThis games looks beautiful, almost as its boring.DS fans consider themselves as hardcore players which loves challenging games, but its not trueThis game is not about skills, its about learning scripts and attacks.You dont need brain to play this game, you gotta figt and die untill you remember all combos of all bosses in game.This is boring and awful console game poorly ported to PC(unconfortable controls+bad menu navigation)"
Negative,The co op in this game is so dumb. It is such a chore just to get into the same game and progress together. If you are going to play this treat it as a solo only game. I bought this because i saw that it had co op and wanted something to play with my friend. I like hard games in general i enjoy the game but they make it such a choir to play with a friend. The system doesnt even make the game harder it just makes it more inconvient and annoying.
Negative,"Absolutely terrible creators who successfully destroyed this game for me and showed that in effect it's a waste of money.First of all, I play co-op with my friend. Which means that other than jumping through 1,000 hoops to make yourself uninvadeable it's just not possible to co-op this game really. So, right from the start 30 seconds after we find each other in game we're invaded by someone who literally can't die. For over 20 minutes we were fighting the person whom took ZERO damage from us until we finally died.10 minutes later, yet another invasion from someone wearing what we later discovered to be ""end game"" armour, who had unlimited amounts of estus flasks. About an hour later, we're invaded by someone who seems to drop a bunch of weapons and items but we actually managed to kill him, I picked up a few items and we continued the game, finally we got the blue shield thingy that helps us when we're invaded, however being invaded every 15-20 minutes of gameplay is complete breaking the game. How are you meant to make any form of progression when you're constantly invaded by hackers/cheaters?So, like a week later I was given a warning that my ""save file is corrupted"". I googled a whole bunch to find that the items the guy dropped must be duped or something. Oh but wait, it's not over. After I DELETED my damn character due to their garbage cheat detection, 4 days later I got banned ANYWAY regardless of the fact I've never cheated in the game.So let's get this straight, your restrictions now prevent me and my friend playing together, you place me against people you KNOW hack, and now I'm left with a £60 on the deluxe edition of the game that I'm never going to play again because your trash system thinks I'm a cheater?Good game, unfortunately the creators are just complete trash and don't know how to detect ACTUAL cheaters."
Negative,I cant recommend this game on PC. It really optimized no support for people with motion sickness and the fps is locked at 60.
Negative,"anmy hard , boss easy"
Negative,fuck this dumbass game
Negative,"irritating lack of explanation ingame, periodic freezing on my more than equipped gaming rig, and frustrating gameplay"
Negative,I went offline...I came back online...AND I GOT FUCKING BANNED. FOR GOING OFFLINE THEN ONLINE. SCREW YOU BANDAI NAMCO. NOW I CAN'T ENJOY PVP AND PLAYING WITH FRIENDS!!!!
Negative,"I'm suprised I've never written a review for DS3 well, Here it goesWhere do I begin.. Starting off Yes I have 145 hours on record by the time im writing this which probably means I love the game right?Well.. Thats not the truth at all, I want to love this game... Especially as a long time fan of the Souls franchise and anything From Soft.Lets begin with the Pros.The Pros to Dark Souls 3:- The Combat has been improved upon even more then its previous two games - The Coop has become more fluent and so has the PVP aspect of it- Theres more Spells then in the Previous games and a Introduction of a new spell type in each of the three trees aswell as bringing back old fan favorite spells such as power within.- Lots of hints and reference to the previous two installments especially Dark Souls 1- Not every weapon is the same introducing unique skills and movesetBut thats all I can say now about the Cons..- While yes I just praised the Coop and the PVP aspect its also its biggest downfall, due to allowing way more players into each world theres alot of times where Players just decide to Gang on single random invaders or if youre unlucky you get a group invading you(Yes even blue boys could fuck you over) - Pyromancy... My god... I started as a pyro player because I was like yknow what lets try something different... and oh boy... Was it a big mistake.. It made the whole game a cakewalk and actually kind of a shame... It feels like spells are super overpowerd in this iteration.- Endings, When the game first came out it was so messy that when I was heading for one ending I suddenly got another one because it bugged out and didnt let me get the thing I was actually aiming for this apperently took a longtime to fix even after I finished playing- Bosses as stated above with the pyromancy I feel like the difficulty felt much less challenging then the previous game (Talking about the base game here not the dlcs)- The dlcs... They were great but... I feel like they were on crack when designing some of these dlc bosses I loved them dont get me wrong it was great fighting and getting my ass handed but some of it also felt like bullshit and poor frames or hitboxes (God we love our crappyy souls hitboxes dont we?)- Now this one... as a long time player I used to LOVE arenas in both dark souls 1 and 2 but... MAN in dark souls 3... the fact that both the local hosted arena and the most popular pvp area was on the same map... really ruined the PVP for me for mentioned up above if you didnt find natural players you would usually end up in a arena against your willNow for my actual end of this wall of review... Dark Souls 3 is a great game dont get me wrong but I dont think its for the hardcore dark souls 1 lovers (And 2 if some of you exist LOL) This is more for the People that has never played a Dark souls before and want to get into it without getting kicked hard like we used to in the Original (I really felt that getting kicked hard again in the remaster of 1)Now if you have been considering picking it up for a long time If you are new to the franchise definitly start with this one to ease into it but if youre a vet and never picked up 3 Im unsure if you would enjoy it because it may be easier then the previous installments but ultimately...Make your own Opinion and dont just blindly trust what someone writes on the Internet."
Negative,"* PvP review * Dark Souls 3 pvp is extremely unbalanced and highly flawed (unlike singleplayer, which is fun and well designed), the lack of poise is laughable, making short spammy weapons all the more annoying. Hyper armor on greatweapons is insane, the high damage plus the ability to auto-poise through any attack is just down right overpowered. There are obvious weapons in the game that are by default stronger than others, giving you an immediate disadvantage for using anything else. Invasions are bad, really bad. When invading, you're going to be put against at least 2 enemies by default due to new gameplay changes in DS3. Every invasion is a gank, and it's painful. Invaders get half of the estus that the host gets, and by itself its not a bad idea, but when you combine that with the 2v1 or 3v1 scenario for invasions its just not enjoyable. Estus was annoying in DS2 sure, but it's not nearly as bad as DS3's new estus mechanic. Estus chugging is super fucking quick, and can be abused in pvp. If your opponent is just a bit more than a swords reach away he can heal instantly back up to full health, thew animation for healing is much much quicker than in DS2. It generally ruins invasions, but it's not as big of an issue in fight clubs, as most people use the honor system. It just adds to the already flawed pvp experience in DS3I'm comparing DS3 to the previous game in the series DS2, which I find to be more balanced of a pvp experience, and way more enjoyable. Sure, the story sucked, and the level design was meh, but the pvp aspect was brilliant, and gave me hundreds of hours to enjoy of it. Dark Souls 3 is just way too buggy and unbalanced to enjoy at this point, avoid it.I'll be playing DS2 until shit gets fixedPVP - 5/10Singleplayer - 9/10"
Negative,Dark souls is like a gambling machine that makes you feel like you are winning when you are not.it makes you go around in circles like a goldfish in bowl.
Negative,"Ok, I've sunk enough time into the game to write this, so here goes. As a Dark Souls game, this is my favourite one so far. The world is huge, the bosses are awesome, the music is grand and the whole game is just, stunning! Everything about the game itself is just brilliant and I love it. However.The PC-version itself? Dreadful! Huge FPS drops, stuttering and even a few crashes! The online play is horrible. There have been quite a few instances of me trying to summon people, only to have them not be able to pass through the fog walls to the boss. Even invaders suffer from this. I had someone invade me, only to have him be stuck in the t-pose and not be able to attack me. It is a mess. So really, dont buy this yet. Just dont. Wait for fixes and patches and whatnot. Or buy the PS4 or Xbox One version. They have an FPS cap. but at least the game works. Great game, crap PC Port."
Negative,"I was already a Souls Veteran when I first played Dark Souls 3 in 2016 and was so disappointed that I never touched the game after my first playthrough for over 3 years. When I came back having forgotten everything, I replayed it and was so reassured that DS3 is to me one of the most unfun games I have played to date and it is made by my favourite developer of all time. Now that Elden Ring is out and costs 60 dollars and has way more content than DS3 with DLC, which STILL costs 90 dollars combined, there is no reason to ever consider DS3. Even if we would ignore that Elden Rings content is on average so much better than DS3, the value proposition is just so bad that you should never touch this if you have Elden Ring and you should never touch this if you don't either, because YOU SHOULD JUST GO PLAY ELDEN RING.Here is where my bad experience comes from: 1. The game is wildy unbalanced. First time I played through the game as a dex/int character and it was so difficult that despite this game being by far the shortest in the series (definitely half the size of DS2), for the tiny amout of content it took me 44 hours. The second playthrough I played as a mundane strenght guy with just a large club and no thought put into it. I died less than 10 times to bosses in total. It took me only 14 hours to complete the game and it was a complete joke. Magic is terrible, Faith I hear is even worse. Having a pure physical damage character makes the game easier than a ubisoft game.2. The basic design philosophy is that mundane stuff is strong and cool stuff is terrible. Hey, you found a cool weapon that has cool moves? It sucks ass. You found a weapon art that looks really cool on a sword? It's terrible. You want to make a creative build based on cosplaying your favourite character? You will get punished immediately because the game is 100 percent linear and you can't even get the all the stuff you need till the game is almost over and that is if that stuff even exists. You want to be a knight in regular knight armor swinging a regular straight sword? Press R1 and spam roll and you are the god of this world. You want to play a regular dude with a big piece of wood in your hand? Congratulations you now can kill any boss in less than 10 hits.3. Time is convoluted. Solaire has one line saying this and it seems to me the writers used this to make everything in the game permissible even if it makes zero sense by every rule the previous titles established in the world. This is done so that we can have unlimited fan service and don't have to pay attention if random neat stuff actually makes any sense. Do you like reused NPCs that make no sense lorewise? Did you think that the cycle of the undead made way too much sense? Did you hate the narrative of the previous games and wanted something that you have to think about for only a few seconds until it doesn't make sense anymore and you have to tell yourself that time is convoluted in your head constantly so that you don't go mad that a cannon entry in your favourite franchise breaks any sense of coherency? Well here you go. The fire can now resummon Souls that it used as fuel and hollows who failed at kindling can be brought back to life by the flame any time as well to rekindle it, even though that isn't necessary as the flame can in theory just resummon Gwyn at its center 1000 times and keep running forever.4. There was way too little time put into making a unique memerable experience with depth and way too much time put into appeasing people who don't understand these games in depth (lore, world, leveldesign, community), but only thought they were cool because they beat a Souls game. This game is short. Like, really short for a Fromsoft game. A quarter of the bosses are gimmick bosses that didn't take much time to develop at all. The multiplayer is very lack luster, they didn't give you any arena until much later that you had to pay for in a very poor DLC package (I never picked up the DLCs because I didn't want to support the massive step in the wrong direction DS3 was). They removed all interesting convenants. They removed all the fringe mechanics that made the previous game's multiplayer so charming. NG+ is not NG+, it is New Game scaled up. They didn't take the time to change anything in this already really short game. So much of the game is fanservice. This is old dragonslayer from DS2 times 100. Entire areas are pure fanservice, with no reason other than: The fanboys are gonna love this. So from the tiny amount of content, there is so little left that is actually DS3. It is 100 percent linear. There is only ever one path to progress. Sometimes, you get optional areas, but those never lead anywhere. There is one way to beat DS3 and one way only. It takes the streamline of the first part of DS, with the lack of interconnectivity of DS2, the worst of both worlds.5. The potential was immense. I really, really loved Dark Souls for its deep environment and interconnectedness. I loved DS2 for its originality, freedom and community. I loved both those games for the deep coherent lore and experiences I never could have had in other games. DS3 felt like a poor imitation that didn't understand what made the previous games. It is the wet dream of a shallow Dark Souls fan that goes on reddit and watches memes about Solaire, Patches and DS = hard, when they think about Dark Souls. It is the worst nightmare of somebody that loved all parts of the Souls games, not just the keywords game journalists throw around.For me the day I finished DS3 for the first time, was the day the Soul of Souls died forever. I was really happy when I remembered that Miyazaki said this would be the last Souls game. And much happier when I played Elden Ring and found out that Miyazaki has learned from his mistakes and took a 180 away from this mess to create an Anti-DS3."
Negative,"First off, this game is very challenging and I have only played it a little bit. I think the game has the potential to be a lot of fun, but this is about the LAZIEST game port I have ever seen. All the control representations and beginning tutorial is all in XBOX controls so you need to lookup the settings and google how to do what. Why bother with releasing a game for a platform when you can't even just swap out the XBOX control icons with the correct PC controls? Is it THAT hard? Navigating the menus is also horribly designed and I had to Google ""How to quit out of Dark Souls 3 on PC"". I had some control issues where my player would randomly run in a different direction. I feel like if you want to play this game, you should probably play it on the XBOX or PS4."
Negative,"Darksouls 3 to sum it up is a experience u will not find whit the other souls like games honestly the pve just fells lacking and mostly easy to beat besides a few parts that will surprise u once and kill u and then be quickly learned and overcome the pve overall is mediocre  whit quickly forgotten enemies and plenty of bosses u wont remember 10 minutes after u beat them whit a few exceptions, the music and felling of the world are definitely its strong suit, while weapons are plenty they mostly all fell the same besides there weapon are that u will rarely use in pve, and the magic was fun to use but in most places it made the already somewhat easy pve fell like a joke, as for the pvp/coop side it used to be very enjoyable whit invaders and co op players about all the time a helping hand or boot to kick u  of in every area it sadly mostly turned into either making a post to find any help or being invaded by a twink trying to ruin a new players day or a hacker blasting your character and possibly save file to bits, if  u are locking for a challenging experience then by all means play it but i recommend keeping your game offline as the leftovers of invaders and such u will meet as a new player will make it worst by not offering a fight or fun time but a quick death by hacks and exploits and if u are looking for a pvp time there are still some organized pvp communities that are fair and free of hackers but normal random pvp is not fun anymoreAs it is right now i give it a 6/10 Not bad not great"
Negative,"Bruv, what is this price? Go on ThePirateBay, it's more worth it."
Negative,this game is so fun but my balls itch every time I play it please help sometimes they burn please EDIT: they still itch please help oh my god
Negative,Im just a scrub lord who cant play this game
Negative,"This game takes patience and perfection, progress feels brutally slow, at least at the start. While many people might enjoy this game I don't think it's for people who want to play casually or have fun, but probably for people searching for a challenge.Ok it's been 60 more hours I just beat the gameOk it's been 40 more hours I just beat it again"
Negative,"The bosses are the easiest part of the game. Everything else is arbitrary as you fight the camera, controls, and contradictory mechanics and design. If you want a ""hard"" game, yeah bro it's dark souls but it's not a FUN game until the last four bosses. Also I played up to the final boss without knowing it and then the servers went down deleting my character so I had to start over.updated review: tried playing a mage, didn't know the game could get worse.tl;dr: trial and error isn't hard, nor is it fun."
Negative,"PLAY OFFLINE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, rampant hacker problem and trying to do co-op only makes it worse as invasions target worlds with more than one players so its always a gank, AND invaders can heal with estus ruining any sense of honor in the game. You can't upgrade armor. Bosses aren't too hard, they just have too much health making fights last WAY longer than they should, and the multitude of one hit kill moves they have is a bit unnecessary. Bland weapons and moves sets, and a lack of ANY poise makes is just awful to play.Dark Souls 2 did PvP and weapons right with power stancing, an awesome mechanic that wasn't included in DS3, and no, I don't count the weapons that split into two, that's just lazy rip off of what DS2 did better. The movement feels nice and fluid, I'll give it that, but level design is really bland. I mean, a scaled down version of Anor-Londo that is only scaled down to try to make it look different and cover up the fact there are tons of low resolution textures as the whole set was simply imported from the original Dark Souls. And the rest of the areas are just kinda boring/standard (you got your mandatory poison swamp, a castle, library, forest, spoopy catacombs, dragon area, a second Firelink shrine that is just pitch dark so you can't tell is copy/pasted, and a prison that is suspiciously similar to tower of Latria in Demon's Souls). Countless infinite stamina enemies that never stop attacking EVER with combos that, if you're caught by them, you might as well let yourself die. That's just a lazy way to make the enemies harder. They pull too hard on the nostalgia strings, trying to bring back old things you'd recognize from past games (onion knight, lots of armor sets and weapons *cough* Moonlight Great Sword *cough* and areas like the aforementioned Anor-Londo, even characters like Andre).Do not waste your money on this. If you really want it, wait for a sale."
Negative,This game is horribly optimized. It is almost unplayable as no matter the circumstances the game just stutters every 45-60 seconds no matter if you are staring at a wall or walking through a forest. Textures only pop in 5 feet in front of you and sometimes your inputs just stop working. Great game but horrible optimization. Buy at your own risk.
Negative,"Game's servers have been taken down due to a malicious exploit. My guess is that From Software/Bandai Namco will allow their servers to stay down until the release of Elden Ring, as they have ZERO incentive to fix their servers when they have more to gain from shifting the playerbase from older games to the new release.Bandai Namco will use this opportunity to hype train Elden Ring and ignore older releases of Dark Souls. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if they NEVER fix this game or the other souls games as they can get more people to buy Elden Ring."
Negative,Absolute trash. FROM Software seems to have delivered their magnum opus years ago with dark souls. The demise started right after.
Negative,"Game is too hard, refund requested."
Negative,just a bad game
Negative,"The most difficult boss in this game is the abysmal port by FromSoftware. Terrible GUI, mouse controls, locked fps, lacklustre graphical options..."

Negative,"This game looks amazing, but lacks the qualities that made Dark Souls so good. Balanced, finessed duels are replaced here by enemies with seemingly unlimited stamina and poise, putting certain builds at a serious disadvantage. The lore feels the same way. It's like the writers were struggling to justify all the copy-pasted elements from the first game. Dark Souls was one of a kind. It shouldn't be surprising that it hasn't been matched, but it still sucks to be disappointed."
Negative,i want to blow my brains out
Negative,I got the PC version for ONLINE too. DO NOT BUY THE GAME ON PC IF YOU WANT TO PLAY HIGH QUALITY MULTIPLAYER (by DS3 standards). Demon Souls lasted longer and wasn't even half the game. Burned by Fromsoft.
Negative,"Jumped a game, summoned a dude, he backstabbed me, and unlocked all my achievements. 0/10"
Negative,ferbgijhes gsoig o anfopiafnjpaofnag ag as;kgk n 0wpeibg
Negative,"I want to give you guys a Yes recommendation, because for the hour I've played, it's a great game. Unfortunately most of it is spent re-doing the same thing over and over because of constant crashes. I've tried putting lighting on low. I heard a rumor about starting as Knight. Didn't work. Apparently full helmets cause the crashes. Took it off, didn't work. It took about 8 attempts to open the door after Gundyr without it crashing, and when I finally got through, I crashed at the first enemy afterwards."
Negative,"Honestly this game is pretty decent, but it's easily the most frustrating game in the series.The removal of poise is a mistake. Through and through, there is zero argument. This alone enables almost every single flaw in the game. It is NEVER your turn in this game, enemies will flail at you endlessly R1 spamming you, forcing even longer wait times in combat than Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Now that's a feat.Thanks to bloodborne being so popular we now have to deal with rolls taking up 1/6th of your stamina even without endurance upgraded... Why would that be a good thing? It makes PVP a joke right up there with chain backstabbing. Also the parry windows in pvp are insane in this game. They are so obnoxiously long that anyone with half a brain can do it. The only way to fight is through baiting parries or using weapon art attacks/sorceries/miracles.There is a huge difference in the queue system of attacks in this game from other games. What I mean is, if you get hit just as you try to roll... No matter how long the hitstun is... you are going to roll when your character is free again. This just literally sets you up to lose your tempo. It's not fun, it doesn't make you think about every action. It does not improve the game in any way and it creates constant dissonance between taking risks and feeling like you've been cheated by a misinput.This is just dark souls with only the flaws of bloodborne. It's incredibly frustrating, because this game has good bosses. It has loads of build variety, enemy variety, and some great locations. But the core fundamentals are just lacking. It requires the most patience in the series easily and if you HATED R1 spammers in any other souls game just run screaming in the other direction cuz this game will not be fun for you.Get Elden Ring. It's worth it's price. This game has never sold under 30 dollars CAD WITHOUT DLC, and it will never be worth that 7+ years later."
Negative,"Tl;dr: if you loved DS1 and DS2 and thought they were just right, you might feel let down by DS3.This review is about game mechanics only.I'm not allergic to change. I'm really not. Initially I loved that the game went for a more Bloodborne deal: fast enemies, no poise. But I eventually got disappointed that this game is too unlike the predecessors, in a bad way. Let me explain.Some enemies feel like they were tailor made to punish players that were expecting to play a certain way. This is normally expected to a point with sequels, but I believe they went too far in the wrong direction. Take both the DLCs for instance: them being post-endgame content is no excuse IMO for some not-even-rare mobs to have boss-levels of HP and gigantic combos. The difficulty comes not from enemies with tricky patterns, but because they have so much much HP that your chances of screwing up go up. And then there's a bunch of these enemies, and they respawn. By this point in the game you will have mastered the art of running past everything, but it got me wondering why even have the mobs there if the optimal strategy is to not even engage. It isn't hard but fair, but simply annoying. It's less 'this area applies pressure' and more 'I'm not gonna bother'. IMO they got the balance wrong - falls too hard on the 'hard' scale, with no good rewards for overcoming.Another sin in my book are some of the base game/almost all the DLC bosses. There's simply too many bosses with multiple phases, tens of thousands of HP, adds and 'enraged' modes, sometimes all at once. Instead of something that happens to spice things up, it becomes routine. Too many bosses where you get to view phase one 10 times for each phase two (or three) attempt. It's exasperating, quickly becomes unfun, and doesn't quite engender a frustration like the earlier games, where you felt you were right on the cusp of overcoming. Instead it's just painfully boring. You could say I am simply too used to duel boss fights, and you'd be right - it's what I've come to expect. But bosses with 18 thousand hitpoints across three distinct phases? It's like someone's idea of difficulty is just hitpoint inflation. So I suppose what I'm saying is that by the time I got to the DLC, if I wasn't aware of the general art style and design, I wouldn't say I was playing Dark Souls, but some parody of it, where they got the surface details right but everything else wrong.If you resonate with any of what I've written, at most get the base game. Skip the DLC."
Negative,"Edit:invaders are like the losers who show up uninvited to a party, trying hard to ruin the fun but only embarrassing themselves in the processGo to pvp area you **** invaders, leave me alone while I'm running for stories"
Negative,"I started my FromSoft journey purchasing Demon Souls on the PS3 when it first came out and have 100% every From game since.   This is by far the worst for me.  I would rather play Lords of the Fallen, The Surge, or Nioh.  As a day one purchaser with many hours I consider this one of my biggest gaming letdowns ever.  It just never grabbed me and I never felt the urge to continue even though I have almost completed the game several times.  I just hated it."
Negative,"Three games in, and they STILL can't fix connection problems."

Negative,Very bad combat mechanics. You can't hit the target even when you are in front of the enemy. Definately not recommending it to others.
Negative,"1/10, CANT GET GOOD"
Negative,"Umm Thanks, but no thanks, Miyazaki. We did not want to see your fruitless attempt at trying to recreate the magic of Dark Souls 2's gameplay. -_-"
Negative,Game actually sucks. I beat the game only to be able to say that with confidence.
Negative,"Not having keyboard prompts is kind of a bad thing. Also very weird to have full keyboard compatibility without any option to show their prompts. Why would you do that? it's just unpleasant for a huge portion of steam users.No idea how fun it is, though."
Negative,Literally a one shot sim. If you hate yourself then buy this game. If you want to suffer like your soul is on fire then play this game. If you have  nothing else to do and just want to die over and over again then you;ll enjoy this game. (IN OTHER WORDS DON'T BUY THIS WASTE OF TIME PIECE OF SHIT.)
Negative,"The game simply assumes you're using a controller.  Right from the start menu I had to guess what ""A"" and ""B"" were on a keyboard- all the ingame hints button hints are for controller as well and can't be changed.  Very lazy."
Negative,DLC costs a little fortune for 2h of gameplay? NO thanks. BAD FAIL to the end of soul series.
Negative,Crashes as you walk at the 1st and 2nd bonfire
Negative,Ah! fuck this game! 1.1/10
Negative,"""Git gud, the game is fair, it's you who sucks"""
Negative,you like being anally molested without breaks like your a little cum-dump? then youll love this!
Negative,"Quite how a game can have such high reviews and such unresponsive controls is beyond me. Atmosphere is excellent, bosses and monsters look and feel interesting but the 500 year delay between pressing a button and things happening makes the game a chore."
Negative,"TL;DR: The game is a tacked on footnote of closure to a series that needed more innovation like Bloodborne, rather than a rehashed sequel.In one word, ""meh.""  While the game is certainly better in certain aspects than previous entries, it still exists in a world where those previous entries also existed, so certain aspects are expected to be improved upon as the developers were able to learn from their miistakes.  Overall though, I feel like Dark Souls 3 does not learn from all of the mistakes of the other games.  I was not gripped by the story; I found myself pretty much indifferent. The world in 3 is unintersting, and just feels like a nonconsequentil jaunt from area to area. Even Dark Souls 2, the mess that it was, had interesting aspects to its world and story; raising interesting questions while exploring new aspects to the world.  Dark Souls 3 feels like a rehash with zero identity of its own.  Gameplay is not rewarding.  What appears to be fast paced and tacital can almost always be beaten with r1 spam from light weapons.  Weapons themselves feel less unique than in Dark Souls 1 or 2.  The added weapon arts are almost all useless.  Wepons themeselves feel shallow.  Dark Souls 2, again, a flawed game, at least put effort into making movesets serve a purpose.  Dark Souls 3 just tries to jam flashy, overly-acrobatic movesets on its snowflake boss weapons.  Enemies feel less methodical and more suited for a faster paced game like Bloodborne.  Fights are annoying rather than engaging.  Dark Souls earned it's more intense fights, while in 3 every enemy seems to be ripped from some anime.  I don't feel the DLC's justify their own existence or price either.  6/10"
Negative,"if you dont have a pc/xbox one controller dont bother, the interface is horrific for keyboard and mouse and nearly impossible to decode. im sure the games got tons of potential but its made for console play. GG dont buy it here!"
Negative,killing in this game is like eating a big chunck of sweiz chees xD becuse there are so many many HOLES in it so its a gamble if you get pure AIR or a big ol´ chunk-a-cheese in your wide open mouth. so remember when killing maybe u get air or cheese. its your choice.
Negative,"THIS IS REALLY GOOD...BUT...EY CLICKBAIT, I love this game and the series but the optimisation for this game is too poor atm. Too many times have i missed a parry or died because the frame drop from 40-60 down to 1 fps for up too 10 seconds. With that type of frame drops PvP is much harder and you'll have to hope the FPS doesnt drop when you walk into a new area. Btw im running darksouls on a GTX 980 (used to be on max but now on Low in hopes that it owuld help the frames)atm so i would hope that the card would be able to handle this.If/When the frame drops are addressed ill change this back. Ontop of this PvP is pretty lacking atm as it is near impossbile to punish those who constantly chug, and also allows the host to summon multiple summons wile invavded.For example i was dueling with a host but as soon as he is low he summoned a phantom to kill me, PvP is really weighted towards the host at this time.ALSO I love the rest of this game, the story, PvE, interactions but i was looking for PvP =/"
Negative,"Spent alot of time on this game(by my standards).  Lived in Bloodborne on PS4.  I am really having my doubts about this company now.  They ignored a critical flaw in their netcode for more than a year.  They got exposed on twitch and finally took the network down.  It is a shame  that the  maker of this classic franchise had to be exposed publicly before they would lift a finger to fix a vulnerability that results in anything from corrupted saves to bricked hardware.  Now their new game is about to go online with the same problem.  Either it delays or launches without multiplayer.  Sadly, I am to far in for a refund, but others can be warned."
Negative,"The Dark Souls Series has been great, and has improved visually each time. This game was fun, but like that last Souls prior. It gets quite old ( Rinse and Repeat). I do like that multiplayer has been made easier, but with that being said. Making it easier, also made the connections with invaders or summons worse. Like I said I did enjoy the game, the story, and the world. But being invaded by near invincible people, or people whose bodies stay in the default position, which in turn makes them impossible to kill, see them swing, cast ect... Playing past ng plus or more, is again more or less pointless, you gain a few plus 2 rings but nothing really worth the extra time. I guess I would say I would enjoy the game a bit more had the connections and phatom range ect... been fixed, but with all that bs it makes multiplayer boring, and quite lacking in the fun area.  When you do get a decent connection PVP can be fun, but thats rare. So after less then a 100 hours play time I will be saying good bye....at least till the dlc launches and thats complete. Otherwise, I do not recommend this game as replayable like its intention."
Negative,"Not for keyboard and mouse user. It may say it does... but this a controler game. UI is un-friendly.  Did run well, look good, but this game is not for me."
Negative,I can't get past the first boss.
Negative,"I've played through this game several times both on PC and PS4.  Enjoyed both the PvP and PvE gameplay, and didn't ever use anything outside the game for any advantages.  No cheat engine manipulations or anything.  I haven't played for over a year and decided to try and play today.  I'm now softbanned for no evident reason.  This detection for cheating in this game must be absolute ass.  What an awful way to end the series, and to only follow it up with that joke of a remaster."
Negative,"Yet another DS completely ruined by forced PvP, would have been such a great game if people were allowed to play like they wanted.If you do not LOVE PvP, and yes, u gotta LOVE it, cuz you WILL be invaded all the time, while doing quests and other stuff, and ofcourse NPC's ignore the invader but start fighting you while try to fight the invader, you can even be invaded in offline mode now...DO NOT BUY"
Negative,"Over 300 hours and I still love it! It's great if you are looking for a hardcore-singleplayer RPG.If you play alone the sense of progression you get is really awesome not only your character but also your skill grows over time. The lore is awesome although you have to dig very deep to find it and even then not everything is clear, but i consider this part of the fun! The PvP is really fun and feels accomplishing when you kill 2 or 3 people on your own, although i think the invasion system still needs some work, as invaders have to many handycaps. Most of the bosses get ridiculously easy when you summon phantoms in though. I recommend playing it without searching in the internet for questline solutions and similar things because the the feeling of finding this huge questline on your own is priceless. If you want a good coop game however, I do not recommend this game, because you will have to progress through the level two or three times, depending on the number of people you are playing with and you need an ember, an ingame item, to be able to summon phantoms and if you die you have to get another one of those items. I would rate Darksouls 9/10 because of the great experience I had and will continue to have with it, however not the full 10/10 for the flaws I namend.[EDIT] Over 900 hours now and I mostly agree with what I wrote, such a great game![EDIT] 2k hours, game is trash.[EDIT] that last one was a joke but now for real, play offline. Only people still playing this are loser cheaters who got their accounts banned and can't make infinite alts for free for Elden Ring."
Negative,"How do you review a series you enjoyed through many installments and through two different platforms? I will be reviewing dark souls 3 in a pro/ con style and end with my final conclusions.Pro:     Nice scenery. The game looks amazing with the better graphics overhal compaired to previous installments. Besides that every location you go to looks nice and unique, easy to tell the difference between one location compaired to another. To add to that the different worlds are filled with enemies that feel cohesive to their respective land.    The music is great. I enjoy the music that is played at the fire link shrine and also the boss music for the abyss watchers.    Plenty of weapons to use. There are many of weapons from your basic solo weapons like swords, maces, ect. Now they add in the feature to have dual weapons. So the player must equip it to whatever hand they wish and they will use a single weapon but if they two hand it...the character will have 2 of that weapon. It is cool and can provide some neat combat moves.Con:      The reuse of old enemies. It is less like they tried to add new things but made the game based on things fans liked from old dark souls games. Really it is pretty lazy and i did not want to see the wheel skeleton enemies or multiple variations of the first boss in dark souls 1.      The lack of choice in dark souls since dark souls 2. What dark souls 2 easy? yes but it had choice to it. It allowed the player to experience the game on an easier level while if players challenge themselves they could do that with their own choice. None of that is here in this game which really sucks.     The enemy placement is pretty bad which messes up flow even for this game. The idea of putting tank like enemies on narrow platforms is a horrible idea. I dont mind challenge but what this is....it is not a challenge rather poor level design.      Dark souls 3 takes inspiration from old dark souls and bloodborn. That is cool but the issue is that dark souls isnt bloodborn. Bloodborn is a fast pace dark souls game that has its mechanics dealing around being agressive and quick dodging and such. Dark souls is not that. What dark souls is...is slower and more thoughtful as to when to strike and when to dodge roll. The bosses in the two series are different and combining them in this game is a beautiful mess. It provides a clash between mechanics and combat.     There is a swamp level that not only does it poison the player similar to lower blight town from dark souls but it is unbarebly slow.  Sure there is a way to speed it up but why is it even here? It feels like a checklist in all souls and souls like games.Conclusion:     In short i am a major dark souls fan. Played all the souls games except bloodborn on multiple different platforms till I 100% it but this game is tied for the most unenjoyable souls experience with dark souls 1 and salt and sanctuary. It is  not that i am a casual because that is obviously false but it deals with how enemies are really agressive like playing bloodborn but clashing with the slower pace of dark souls. Could i reccommend the game...no. Sure the game looks better and the music is nice but the issues are a big problem."
Negative,Stop loking at negative reviews of this PEAK designed game and go **cking buy it
Negative,Out of the gate... all on screen instructions are for gamepad. Does not detect my X360 controller. Haven't really gone much past that TBH.
Negative,"I like this game. I do not like poor optimization, repeated crashes, or arbitrary bans.Fix this."
Negative,"no steam cloud,huh.interesting"
Negative,"The game progress is not saved in the cloud so basically I just lost my 31 hours played. At least I could have had a warning that this could happen. Thank you Steam and overall, thank you From Software."
Negative,"Impossible to play with mouse and keyboard. Crashes steam whenever running on steam link,"
Negative,Keyboard and mouse options? Good luck! Messy messy gameplay and the developers were too lazy to convert the controller commands on tutorial level and never even bothered with PC players. I will not recommend this game until they actually learn to patch it up for PC players. Wasted $80 for this terrible game.
Negative,Temporary review.This is the first time I have not been able to get a game to run on steam.Constant white screen flickering when playing in fullscreen. (Windowed works on max settings @ 60fps but I didn't buy this game to play windowed)
Negative,bad pc port.. the fact that this game is capped at 60 fps and has controller promps for everything even tho your playing with M+K is terrible...
Negative,Basically fuck you and your fps. If anyone has any knowledge on how to fix framerate issues please help. I guess I'm just lucky mine isn't crashing like others have said...
Negative,"This is for PC, they should at least an option for showing the keyboard bindings not the controller bindings for the hint pop-ups. I could see how this game would be fun for some people, I am not one of them. I prefer to use bows, this game doesn't seem to really offer much on bows from the start of the game - maybe plenty of bow action later in the game, but doesn't matter if I don't stick around long enough to find out. It would have been nice if there was a bow for purchase from the lady or blacksmith right after the starter area boss.Invasions are just annoying for new players trying to learn the game. I can see how invasions would be a lot of fun after you have played the game for a bit though."
Negative,"Ok as a stand-alone game but a disappointment as a Dark Souls title.Gone is the world exploration from 1 and 2 that tried to railroad you with seemingly overwhelming enemies for that stage in the game which could be overcome with skill - what's left is basically a stage by stage slugfest.You've only twice in the journey a choice of which stage to handle first but you have to do both anyway.While you could in the past route a way through the game to find your main weapon possibly much earlier than intended this is simply not possible here.Beyond that the story is kinda incomplete.In past titles you had 3 stages:1) proof yourself worthy (ring the bells, overcome a certain door)2) collect some token(s) to access the final stage (lord vessel + 4 souls, king's ring)3) journey to the final bossDS3 skips 1 and goes from 2 right to the final boss.You don't have to prove your worth, you just are. Simply collect the souls and be done with it.No real plot twist to speak of either.Absent are also poise, power stance, bonfire ascentics, and a lot of more things that made the past 2 games fun.TL;DR: not my dark souls"
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 looks like a great game, and the sort of thing I could really sink my teeth into, but in 2018 when you install a game the last thing you expect is major input lag.The game actually runs fine in other respects. Even on ""max"" settings it doesn't stress my computer at all and the system doesn't go much over 20°C (when this machine is being hammered it sits at about 70°C and blasts hot air out of the radiator), but my god the input delay is awful.Call it ""input buffering"" all you like but other games don't have that kind of game-breaking delay.Just google ""Dark Souls 3 input lag"" for an overdose of 1990s PC gaming troubleshooting ♥♥♥♥♥fest nostalgia.This is not the 90s.I'm not trying to run Doom on an Amiga.And I'm not jumping down the rabbit hole of tweaking and hacking the game to get it to maybe do what I take for granted with every other game.Refunded."
Negative,heard ds3 was bad.yep. its bad. DLC is worse.
Negative,Dark Souls II is better bruh
Negative,"Horrible port, doesn't even display keyboard keys in game. Controls are un-responsive, I press dodge button and character reacts after like 2 seconds. Clucky game."
Negative,very fun game yes okay
Negative,"Fantastic sequel to Dark Souls. Dollar per hour ratio is ok. It really depends though, if you can not play a game twice wait for a sale. If you can this game is definatley worth it at $60. I think it would be unfair for me to assume everyone can play a dark souls game twice, therefore I do not recommend this game at it's current price of $60. This game is worth about $40 taking age and length of story into account."
Negative,wayyy to easy
Negative,fix the game I payed 50$ fix the game mother fucker stop clotting people money  crushing game ever were poor pc port
Negative,my dick fell off
Negative,No cloud saves? 🗿
Negative,"No recommendations from me due to certain ideas that is within this game.1. If you have limited time to play, invaders are really wasting your time. That is a stupid concept. There is no open world and private lobby like in other games like Grand Theft Auto Five. The developers do not consider your preference or need. It seems theirs is the best.2. There is this stupid penalty that you get when you get disconected. System crash would deem you as being disconnected and you would eventually be penalized and not be able to summon or join your friend for at least 14 hours. Is this game worth to get you penalized for something that was system problematic? Or maybe the game caused the crashed in the first place?Though the game looks interesting, it does not warrent such stupid behaviours like those I have mentioned above. It is good only for personal game, if you have the time that is.Edit: The gap in letency is just horrible. Invaders with least letency have the fullest advantage to hit every time. The developers could at least thought about it and planned regions for the PvP. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME if you are very from their server or your Internet frequently gets disconnected. It is a wise warning."
Negative,"This game is way more of a grind than Elden Ring. For those who want to get into this after playing Elden Ring. I am towards the end of the game, and its just become a boring grind. It was fun to explore Elden Ring when you needed to level up your character, this game just finds you doing the same loops over and over again, killing the same three or four guys, then refreshing at the fire. I am sooooooo bored with this game. I was having fun at the start but now its just the same thing over and over. There is no point going back to earlier areas, because you barely get any souls to level your character. I am sick of it. And I have over 300 hours in Elden Ring, have played through multiple NG+s and regular new games, and I never got bored with Elden Ring. Just over this game."
Negative,"Game forces you back into the loading screen if it decided that suddenly your framerate isn't suitable for online play.Dumbest online mechanic i have ever seen in any game, i loved the former souls titles, but sadly this one is virtually unplayable right now, might change review if they fix this."
Negative,"Gameplay: AwesomeQuality Assurance: Unbelievably Horrible - Game breaking bugs day 1I've been hyped to play this game for a while. Downloaded the game, set up my stream and got all my viewers excited to watch the game, then about 1.5 hrs in, after the first boss fight, the game crashed. I chalked it up to my PC juggling too many things at once. Fired up the game again, and non-stop crashing. People say put ""lighting"" on ""low"". I've had all my settings on ""low"". Still crashes.  People say ""play as the knight"" as they say it doesn't crash. For me, still crashes my game. Even crashes when the only thing I'm running is the game, so it's not my stream setup.It's appalling that such a triple A title game would be this buggy at launch. Get your sh!t together FromSoftware/Bandai Namco!I would change this review to positive if I could actually play the game."
Negative,I dont ilike the fact that you fasdt travel at the start thats also a comon complaint but it couldve been changed pretty easily. Theres not a good sense of adventure at any part of the game because of the fast travel. The mapo is laid out beautifully AN DI THINK its just a waste of good mapo design to make the player teleport everywhere cmon man. The game hgas some interesting shotrtcuts but they are all made redudnat beacuese of the teleporting. The game couldve easily vbeen designed around a firelink esue area like the first game but no the devs chose not to do that comn son. But anyway I like the game it's the third best soulsborne game if I choose to ignore te latter half of ds1 hwich I will.I was made aware that the game costs 60 euros it is NOT WORTH that amount of money I would know. Buy it maybe if its beow 20euros or something and you can't play bloodborne or Dark Souls 1 or 2.
Negative,Be careful. You cannot play online. Uninstall and refund.
Negative,"Unplayable on keyboard and mouse.>inb4 ""git gud""Beat the game already; I'm rating the port. The port plays like d0gsh1t. Get f'k'd, fanboys."
Negative,this game is too easy
Negative,Dark Souls 3: a game made by smartasses for smartasses.
Negative,This is my first darksoul game so I honestly couldn't play this without looking at guides or getting help from friends.
Negative,Extremely hard to navigate menu with forced Controller navigation I do have a controller but I it wasnt charged at the time
Negative,No cloud saves smh
Negative,"The game is locked at 60fps, and keyboard controls are not great"
Negative,Pointless to have a game you can't enjoy.
Negative,keyboard and mouse fucking unplayable
Negative,fuckin hackazaki ruin it
Negative,my account got reset for nothing :)
Negative,Spent a bunch of time trying to put together a magic build and when I finally found a scroll it was too late to turn into the guy who sells you spells. Now I can't use the late game spells because I didn't google half the game before because they literally remove him PERMANENTLY for no reason. Can't they just make it a shitty side quest to get him back or something? This game is needlessly inaccessible and I wish I could get my money back.
Negative,I find it crazy that this game has been out since 2016 and the crashing issues still haven't been fixed and none of the things i've found online have been helpful. I've got over 2 hours of in game play time and thats only having the game launched trying to get it to work. THIS IS FUCKING SAD!!! I'm beyond PISSED! I love this game I've played it through multiple times on Xbox and I love PC Gaming so I decided to buy it. It was a waste of my money I can't even play the damn thing.
Negative,"I used to like this game. I really don't know why.In 2020 I tried doing another play through. I thought I was enjoying it till about 18 hours in I realised I really don't like this game. I was forcing myself to play it. Even in co-op neither of us were having fun. The Bloodborne styled combat, the infinite stamina and poise on enemies. The amount of garbage weapons and magic. The copy paste of enemies everywhere. The broken netcode and constant invasions of twinkers and cheaters.I just can't with this game anymore.I get more enjoyment out of DS1 & 2 and even Bloodborne.I want to like this game, I really do. But right now, I personally think it's just in a bad state and not worth playing."
Negative,"Often dying due to clumsiest controls ever, or camera starts spinning during battle, or something else that is beyond the gameplay....just not fun. And what's with the xbox control notifications? Was that so hard to remove for PC version?"
Negative,I dont know why everyone says the game is difficult.The only difficulty i found is that I lost 250 hours of progress and items when i switched pc because the game doesnt have cloud save
Negative,"Great game, until I realised the developers purposely disabled Poise allowing you to be stun locked by an undead timo shooting a balloon popper at you while you are wearing the heaviest armour on the game."
Negative,just maybe add keyboard icons ?
Negative,Cheaters can join your game in multiplayer and delete all your progress on PC.  Good game but cannot recommend on PC since you have to play offline until they fix the exploits.
Negative,you wont like this if you played ds1 first and really love that game
Negative,Really annoying those disconnects truly truly annoying. and they happen literally every 2-4 minutes. I wish I could at least get to play the bloody thing to be able to review it for its content ... sinfully i can't.
Negative,Season pass holders can't play DLC.Do Not Buy Season Pass.
Negative,"A VERY BIG AND SUPER MASSIVE F*** YOU TO THE GUY WHO HAD THE IDEA TO PUT NORMAL MOBS ( KNIGHTS ) IN THIS GAME....NO ATTACK PATTERN, UNLIMITED COMBOS, THEY DONT EVEN STAGGER BY ATTACKING.....ITS MUCH EASIER TO KILL A BOSS IN THIS GAME THAN THE NORMAL MOBS, Good game but it has become very irritating due to that so its a very massive NO from me..."
Negative,"A whole lot better than 2, but not as memorable or good as 1. The game's world feels so, bland...A lot of the time I felt myself dreading getting a certain item just because I had to trudge though X area. This never happened to me in DS1. The hubworld is shit, and I can't believe they kept leveling up with the firekeeper a thing. Thanks for making me have to sit through two loading screens just so I can end up right back where I was. Cool. The bosses are non memorable; half of the bosses being a literal joke. PVP, is ok, but parrying feels very DS2, which is shit. Final boss is a letdown, and is just ""le nostalgia fighty gywn man fanservice"" for fans of the first game. I'm a fan of the first game, but they really should have done something different and more grand. Once again, the game's lore and characters are complete BULLSHIT. There is no way in HELL ANYONE would be able to get certain items in the game, or access certain areas without a walkthrough or searching it up online. (You know what area I'm talking about.) The world and the characters should drop slight hints, give you SOMETHING. They don't say jack shit in this game, they just repeat the same dreary bullshit, and then; oh, you can't get that item anymore sorry.I wanted to get all achievements for this game, but there is no way in hell I am suffering though the boring trudge of going through NG to NG+3; something which once again, I had no problem doing in DS1. I really wanted to like this game, I really did. But playing through it again for the sake of the DLC really opened my eyes.5/10Get it if its on sale"
Negative,Not playable.Bug Bug Bug
Negative,not worth $79.99. Elden ring ruined this game for me.
Negative,"Worst of the Souls games. Poise is bullshit in this game, no interesting weapons and the PvE is bland and boring."
Negative,"I spent 2:00:22 hours on the tutorial level alone, and still didn't fucking beat it....THIS GAME IS WAY TOO MUCH LIKE DARK SOULS"
Negative,"Couldn't handle combination of too fast camera movement (even on lowest camera and mouse settings), AND being locked at 60 FPS. Made me nauseous.Also, keyboard+mouse barely supported - controls are clunky, and all onscreen hints are controller buttons.And I hate controllers."
Negative,The game can be fun at times but do not buy for pc. I spent more time trying to figure out the key layout than actually playing the game because all of the prompts are for console. It is a huge turnoff when you die mostly cuz you have to open the menu to find the proper key to press to interact or use items.
Negative,For a fulltime broadcaster of SoulsBorne content being my Job i actually have to say this is the worst experience ive had with souls and fromsoftware in my life. I cant even move my character once they emerge at the start and ive done everyting from re installing drivers to deleting and re installing the game. Please fix your shit for the people who advertise your game 7 days a week to a dedicated audience pls.
Negative,"this is shittest game ever i fucking broke my mouse and couldnt play fortnite for weeks untill i bought a new one, these bosses in this game so hard i fucking lost my shit and threw my mouse in the wall and it just shattered. Please take this game down for dangerous game"
Negative,"Oops they did it again!Don't trust preorders, especially from a devloper and publisher that hates PC gamers and proves it every release.You won't have any fun until the developers get out of their launch day booze haze and release a patch to stop all this constant crashing even on the strongest of rigs.I guess millions of dollars isn't enough to make a working game."
Negative,Just get DS1
Negative,"They refuse to brign the servers online because they don't want Elden Ring to tank and lose 50% of their players as they come back to the superior Souls games. Very underhanded, they could have put them up at any time"
Negative,THERE IS NO HOT BOOBIE WOMAN IN THIS GAME! DARK SOULS FRANCHISE SUCKS!
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 is a spectacle, many areas are big, open, and highly detailed, but at the same time, completely empty. It wants to be a game where you look at the environment and go ""woah"" but there is just nothing happening to actually warrant any interest. the bosses are some of the best in the franchise, but a few were designed simply to frustrate players by directly countering specific common playstyles. the story is Dark Souls 1 but big, pretty much every part of DS3 directly correlates to a part of DS1. if you liked DS1 and wished it controlled more like Elden Ring, this is th e game for you"
Negative,Button promps have not been switched from the Xbox controller. I also didn't realize this was ported from the console. Wanted a refund but was denied because it was more than two weeks. I didn't install the game for a month because I bought it on sale and planned to wait to play it.  Lame situation. I'll remember this when I think about buying anymore games.
Negative,"Summary:A lumbering, tedious, and drab farewell to the series.Review:Let's be clear right off; Dark Souls 3 is not a bad game, but it is in many ways inferior to its predecessors. Dark Souls was a new and interesting take on the 3rd person adventure game. Its minimalist storytelling, grungy environments, and steep difficulty spikes built it a reputation for being one of the hardest games of its kind, which is very untrue. Trial and error, patience and repetition were all it took to win, though a few FAQs were needed to understand or explore the game's often confusing narratives and baffling world design.Dark Souls 2 built on this, expanding in some areas and regressing in others.Dark Souls 3 is a hodgepodge of some elements from the first two games, lazily tacked over corridor world design, cheap ambushes, and enemies with a ton of stamina and unbelievable combo strings.The story is part of the discovery and while I won't spoil it, I will say that this time around I was almost totally checked out. It's not just that it's too cryptic, lazy, or vague; I was just bored with it. If it had no narrative at all I might have been able to at least cruise by on the action, but whenever an NPC had something to say I would just mentally check out. Inane isn't quite the right word for it, but it isn't wrong either.Firelink Shrine, the game's hub, is populated by an array of stiff-to-lame voice acted characters with uninspired scripts. They said little of substance, and what they had to say was often said as slowly as possible, with long pauses between parts of lines. This has always been the case with the series, but somehow feels more pronounced this time. Thankfully there isn't a lot of dialogue, regretfully, most of it is just so bland.The sound in this game was equally annoying. Some sounds seem recycled from earlier games (as were some items), whether by design or other constraints, I couldn't say. In most cases the monsters were unnecessarily shrill. I appreciate that a dragon's roar should be mighty and impressive, but shrill and irritating? The same with a lot of enemies, whether attacking or being slain; they'd shriek, screech, and otherwise scream into the ear like harpies. Meanwhile other sound effects are much quieter, even difficult to hear. Turn up the volume to hear what someone's telling you? Hope for your sake you remember to turn the volume back down again before killing something. Better sound balancing could have created a stronger sense of atmosphere, but here it's low speaking NPCs, loud shrieking everything else.The level design felt really linear; almost no room for deviation. You will be funneled from one area to the next with no real options. Previous games had forks or fields, all of which generally lead to the same destination, but at least in those you could choose your way to the next exit. Some areas were terribly convoluted in their approach, ultimately feeling like a singular winding hallway pretending to be broader than a corridor.Many areas were also uninspired. There were some that looked really great, including the starting area leading up to Firelink Shrine, which with all settings on max looked beautiful and haunting. Most other areas were just castles, dilapidated villages, or swamps. Firelink shrine itself was overly complicated, making the travel between NPCs for interactions like dialogue or purchases unnecessarily long.The combat varies, but is effectively about timing and balancing stamina for offense and defense. It felt like a big step backward from Dark Souls 2, but still closer to Dark Souls. Parry and riposte return, but the damage rewarded for pulling it off is sparse compared to previous games, as is the bonus damage for a back-stab. Buff items are weak, lasting only for a few seconds, and giving minimal effects.Enemies are combo machines with high stamina and ridiculous combo strings, and rather than being well-developed AI wise they just repeat long combos until your guard breaks or you die or both. It does force more offense than defense, but it doesn't do so in a way that didn't feel cheap and lazy. The AI seems pretty dumb, which is offset by grouping and making them damage sponges and having them spam long combos over absurd distances.This game was played with all settings maxed out using an Intel i7-8700k, 32gb DRAM, Samsung Evo SSD, 1080ti, running at 3440x1440. Ultrawide wasn't possible without third-party fixes, and even then there were some issues, and I had to play strictly offline (Steam and all) just to ensure From's inconsistent banning policy didn't snare me. If it is a matter of fairness, why not permit ultrawide and just overlay the edges of the screen to ensure both sides are locked at 16:9? Just an idea.Pros:    Visually excellent    Controls feel mostly responsive    Some beautiful environments    Plenty of secrets to discover    Vast array of spells and weaponsCons:    Most weapons redundant or pointless    Level complexity only skin deep    Ambiguous/nebulous online banning policy    Had to play offline to enjoy Ultrawide    Ultrawide needed modding to work    Lazy enemy AI    Uninspired combat    More linear than before    Mostly drab and repetitive environments    Constant screeching and volume spikesVerdict: 06/10Maybe it was the repetition, maybe the frustratingly high level of cheap ambush corridors, or maybe facing enemies that had absurdly high stamina and combo strings. As much as I tried, I just wasn't able to enjoy this game. The score is average, but I can't recommend it to anyone but series die-hards."
Negative,"I understand that one of the selling point of Dark Souls 3 is its intensive combat styles and mechanics, however, after trying it myself, I am not a huge fan... The lore of the game is deep, the graphics is still beautiful on today's standard, but the combat struggle stopped me from progressing very far into the game unfortunately.  I just do not enjoy the ""git gud"" play style... I play games for mild reward and enjoyment at the very least, and not just endless grinding through challenges...  I will recommend this game with caution!Genre: 3rd person RPG, dungeon based adventure"
Negative,"As someone who likes the Soul series and played them all, I have to say that I am somewhat disappointed with this game.It feels repetitive as I am playing, I find myself resting at bonfires (of which there are an inane amount) just to know if I am in a new area, enemies are the same for many areas and I am simply getting bored (which never happened in any of the previous games).The enemies become boring and the combat is somewhat lacking, At least not what I am used to from the soul games. This feels more like a Bloodborne 2 then a Dark Souls game.Dont misunderstand me though, it is a good game. But in a legendary series."
Negative,"Game has its moments, difficulty of mobs is good learning. I do have to say that the pvp aspect is pretty bullshit. Log in not 30 fucking seconds get invaded. Cannot enjoy this game with friends without Invaders and don't want to put in 1000+hrs to play offline. 5/10"
Negative,"First day playing and I get invaded by one hacker after another.  It's just infuriating.Edit: I came back cause my buds are playing again.  I still hate this game.  Every thing is way too damn hard.  Still getting constantly invaded by people who are massively over powered compared to me.  I don't understand how people find this game fun.  I really don't, but then I've never much cared for PVP either, so maybe this is a game meant for people who do.  It is a lovely game, and I do love the lore."
Negative,Unmitigated arse. Disgusting cash-grab.
Negative,Doesnt have cloud save (steam deck)
Negative,"Got softbanned for no reason, now had to delete all my saves and pray I get unbanned. Good job fromsoft. Suck my ass."
Negative,Don't waste your time they didn't.
Negative,"It's not that it's a bad game... I'm just bad at it. :-(For only a small donation of $29.99 a week, you can help taech kids that were naever tawt how to spel."
Negative,"I also played about 400 hours on console, its an amazing game that had a great community but is now full of hackers. You cant play with your friends without getting invaded by dark spirits that are immune to damage. It is an amazing single player game and if you want to play it that way I'd say its definitely still worth the buy, but if you were intending to go through it with a friend I'd recommend playing something else."
Negative,"Read through the reviews, watched the videos, and was really enticed, so I purchased...First run crash but finally got it working. Nice visuals running on a Gtx980, that was where to positive experience ended.I assume this must be a console port because all onscreen tooltips refer to A,B, RT, LT, etc . Advanced combat tactics require simultaneous button clicks on a keyboard and mouse to accomplish. No story, no anything, other than proximity overlays that indicate a controller that I dont even have configured or plugged in. What is my purpose in this universe... I guess to uninstall and ask for a refund, yeah right"
Negative,"The game is terrible.+ good graphic, even for 2020.+ long game.- A very long (20-30 sec) load screen and unnecessary (for single play game) checking the connection with a server. It takes so much time. I bought a top-PC to avoid this time in games.- There is no any Journal/Quest List. I spent a lot of time to understand what to do next...- Unfriendly user interface.- In PC version I have still xbox/ps notification and keys in the setting. I took much time to learn the movement and tricks with a keyboard/mouse.- Bad Camera behaviour, especially in one-on-one with the bosses, where you need to move fast.- Buggy focus. Sometime it disappears and does not work till you restart the game.- The Main Idea of the game is to learn timing of the next boss. It's boring. It's not better than Chrome's hidden dinosaur."
Negative,"Servers taken down with no expected return to service date.Normally I wouldn't let some thing like this effect my review, but given how this was a reaction to a security flaw that exist by their own design, and was fixed for ER, I see no reason to give this a recommend given current circumstances."
Negative,"One of the most influential game series of a generation, the Souls series has helped shape modern gaming.Sadly, I cannot in good faith recommend this game.The game is plagued with hackers, some simply giving themselves endgame equipment, others who warp you to impossible bonfires that break your save, and STILL others that'll ADD items to your save, getting YOU banned from the game.And From Software has been impressively ineffective in stopping them, or even attempting to stop them."
Negative,"too much crashes, buy this after its patched"
Negative,Boring80 minutes about nothing80 minutes jerking off in one placeStupid control if u use keyboard. Game have normal adaptation only for gamepad
Negative,"They've removed all mention of multiplayer from their Dark Souls game's store pages.This game needs to be review bombed until they decide to fix multiplayer. I cannot finish my full coop playthrough with a buddy since the devs refuse to patch the game.edit: Took em about a year but they fixed multiplayer finally. Though they completely abandoned it on DS1: PTD Edition. Too bad moving the negative review over to that version is futile since they pulled that one from the store in order to charge more for their remaster which should have been free for DS1 owners. So I guess I'll leave this as negative so they can smarten up, and because it'll wipe the upvotes this review has lol."
Negative,"Once again the ""PC Master Race"" takes another LPlay it on PS5 if you want a completely locked 60fps"
Negative,i diesd to a mimic fuck
Negative,Seems like it was directly ported to PC from console without changing anything.
Negative,"Very good game, best I have ever played. Makes me cry tho."
Negative,one of the worst video game of all time does not deserve 1 dollar
Negative,"I was hoping that the port issues I'd been hearing about at the PC release of this game were going to be fixed by now, but after trying for close to 45 minutes just to f###ing jump, I'm gonna have to say, come on now. It's a beautiful game, I really want to be able to, just, play."
Negative,"I've tried really hard to like Dark Souls 3 since it launched. I sat with a good friend and watched him play in on PS4 before I got it on PC. I was hyped since the release trailers started going live. I was a fan of Dark Souls before it was ported to PC, and I was really into Bloodborne even though I didn't have a PS4 of my own to play it on. I even couldn't find a place in my heart or mind to call Dark Souls 2 bad, a good game but a mediocre Souls game. I didn't think FormSoft could make a truly bad Dark Souls game, but here I am.I legitimately think FromSoft's development team just wanted to make Bloodborne 2, but every higher up kept saying ""No, you have to make Dark Souls 3."" and so they did (not). If you've played Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Dark Souls 3, you'll start to see what I mean. Controlling the character moved from the slow-paced combat from Dark Souls, to the frantic button mashing speedfest that Bloodborne used. There were very few times when I played Dark Souls that I ran into the problem of ""What was that attack? I don't even know what happened."" What I mean by this is that (almost) every attack animationin the first game was very visible and usually had good windup for you to know when to play around it. This let you learn the enemies moves and the speed at which they hit you, you got to ""level up"" in real life and feel rewarded by conquering the enemies that beat you last time. Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3 didn't have this, they didn't want you to sit still in combat and think. Enemies often, and I mean very often, have fast attacks and gapclosers to test your reaction times. A big enemy that lumbers around when you see it out of combat will usually become a speed demon the second they know you're there, and even if you dodge the slow attacks and try to hit them in the back they just do an ""instant"" attack where they spin around and hit you while you're locked in your animation. Where the first Dark Souls had enemies that usually threw out short combos and had decent downtime for you to counter attack, Dark Souls 3 gave almost every enemy long combo chains just to dissuade you from counter attacking which forces you into the speed-filled turbo-action button mash of dodge rolling. Where you could get a good stability shield in the frst game and block the combo, you now have to dodge roll three times in a row without a break or else you get caught up in the enemies 8-hit combo and get stunlocked and die. The first game's combat felt like a thinking man's game (not that you had to be a genius to succeed, you just had to apply yourself) and Dark Souls 3 feels like it's just fast paced combat just to get your adrenaline pumping so you think it's cooler than it is. The problem here is that when you lost to an enemy you fought a bunch in the first game you could fall back and just say ""Wow, I messed up. Why did I do that? I'm such an idiot."" and learn from it. In Dark Souls 3, I usually couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong when fighting certain enemies. Some of the attacks came out so fast, and were partially blocked by my own character that I regularly found myself unable to find out what I did wrong besides ""I baited the wrong attack."" but when I would go back and test what attack the enemy would do at that range, I found that they would sometimes do different moves at random ranges or positions. This was only possible when I was fighting an enemy that I could understand their attacks, which shouldn't be a problem normally. I like the odd enemy that fights very differently from other and I think it can add a lot if done well. Pus of Man enemies do not fall into that category though, and I'll use them as my example. Visually, they're very hard to understand and what I mean by that is that every one of their limbs look similar. On top of that, their ""torso"" is very large and obscures the limbs constantly. Even if I know that they're going to attack with the head, I won't be able to see it coming if I'm it's left side. The sound design for them is terrible as well. There might be 2 whole sound files for their attacks, both of which are just high pitched squeels and shrieks that play way earlier than their attacks start. It was very easy to tie enemy sounds to what attacks they would use in the first game, and this is why I have a problem with this type of enemy. It all feels wrong, and because of that I could never tie what I did wrong to why I died to the Pus of Man. I ended up just spamming them with ranged attacks from a ledge they couldn't hit me from to be able to deal with them. I know it seems like I'm really digging for a cherry to pick right here, but they aren't a one time enemy. There are areas (plural) where you can fight several of them at once, and even if you don't it can be difficult to avoid them entirely. I've been writing this for too long, in my opinion, but I really think that Dark Souls 3 handles combat very diffrently than there first game and I feel like it's worse in almost every regard. Combat stopped being slow and became R1 until they die unless they have Poise. Defensive options turned from distancing yourself from your opponent, dodging, blocking, parrying and baiting attacks to get a sweet counter poke to dodging and parrying only (seriously, watch DS3 PvP and take a shot every time someone panic dodge rolls 4 times in a row when they get low, or try to parry the first attack. You'll be wasted before the first video ends.) 8-direction dodging is about the only improvement. I liked the addition of Bloodborne's charged R2s. I don't like the way they handled removing regular backstabs, but I do like not getting lagstabbed anymore.The art design boasts incredible detail, from far away or if it's not your focus because you're in combat or running around. If you ever stop to look around like I did, you'll notice something that you'll never be able to unsee. Every surface in Dark Souls 3 looks wet. Every surface reflects light off of it as it if were moist at all times. This made sense, somewhat, in Bloodborne. Yharnam was set at night with no sun to evaporate anything, there was a low fog hanging around at all times so condensation was easily plausible even on rooftops. In Dark Souls 3, this doesn't make sense. Most of the game happens during daytime with no rain clouds visible. It happens indoors everywhere, not just in dank, dark, dungeons or sewers. I don't know why FromSoft started having an obsession with everything looking like this, but I assume it's so they could keep a little mechanic I'm going to be harsh about right now. So, you can call me a RP loser or an idiot for liking this, but I REALLY enjoy stopping at scenic points in games and just stop and admire the scene and my character I've boned myself in games by doing this by taking off my characters helmets and forgetting to re-equip them. Bloodborne added this visual touch where blood would splatter on your gear, and it would remember what parts hit your face and what hit your mask so when you removed the equipment, the part of your face that was covered would still be clean. They tried this again in Dark Souls 3 and failed miserably. Because you have to spam the roll button a bunch, and because every surface is permanently wet at all times, your character gets caked in mud within seconds. This happens even if you wear a helmet and take it off after rolling, you will always have blackface (also I lied, I'm not done talking about the combat. There's a system in place with your gear where you gain a certain flat % physical reduction if you equip ANY gear in that armor slot. This means you are actively gimped by an invisible number that doesn't show up on the gear itself if you play without gloves, boots, or a helmet. Want to constantly see the face you made that took you an hour to make? All right, just be ready to take more damage than you should.). I think I'm out of room to write any more, so that's it from me. 4/10 Season Pass"
Negative,"great bosses, abysmal level design"
Negative,"Game is BS all the way through, only reason why its hard is because the game mechanics cheat..."
Negative,"I wouldn't go as far as to call this game a disgrace to the Souls series, but it really pushes that boundary. Dark Souls 3 strays so far away from what made Demon's Souls through Dark Souls 2 enjoyable that it almost doesn't feel like a proper Souls game. This was honestly one of the least enjoyable games I have played in recent times. DS3's biggest flaw is its lack of identity. DS3 suffers greatly from ""sequel syndrome"". With very little innovation and a heavy reliance on DS1 references, this game loses all sense of being its own title. DS3 tries so hard to ride on the success and nostalgia of the first game that it doesn't even feel like a sequel. This game just feels like a bad knockoff of the first. The constant references to DS1 undermine the original due to the frequency with that they occur. You revisit several locations from the first game, and this just feels more lazy than anything. I would have appreciated new locations over revisiting the past. When a sequel feels too much like a previous entry in the series, it risks fatiguing the player. This is exactly the case with DS3. This title doesn't stand out in any major way and feels like a rehash of DS1. The locations in DS3 are all very lackluster. None of the areas you visit in the world of Lothric feel inspired, and the excessive use of castle levels feels boring and repetitive. Normally, large and extravagant castles are used in these games to convey progression. Castles were visited late-game in previous titles as a way to present how far you have come from the start of your journey. In DS3, you start at a castle and visit many more throughout the game, which detracts from the awe you feel when reaching these levels. Castles are no longer something special to look forward to in DS3. The only innovation DS3 brings with it is the boss fights. Unfortunately, these fall flat for the most part. The bosses are now faster than ever, and their move sets are expanded upon. This sounds like a good feature until you notice that the majority of the bosses are massive. Extremely fast attacks and huge bosses do not gel well together. It creates a setting where the hardest part of the bosses is seeing their attacks. Speaking of difficulty, this game is by far the easiest in the series. I believe this is due to the new rolling you can abuse. I was able to beat most bosses within two or three attempts, if not the first. However, difficulty is subjective, so I will not dwell on this. My main complaint with the bosses is that they discourage many builds. I played using an ultra greatsword, which turned out to be highly unenjoyable. The fast movement of the bosses made it hard to use large, heavy swords. I found myself having to trade hits with bosses frequently because I didn't have enough time to roll out after a slow attack, which led to many of the bosses in this game being more frustrating than fun. While graphics aren't something I'd normally comment on, I have to note that DS3 has a lot of aliasing issues. Even with the highest AA setting, there is a lot of distracting aliasing present. This is mainly a problem for the first third of the game as there are many large open areas. One final disappointment I had with DS3 was the OST. There are very few memorable tracks, and they all sound bland and too similar to each other. The only tracks that stood out to me were the Main theme, Vordt theme, and Abyss Watcher theme. Not even the credits song was good. Many of the tracks in this game use an angelic choir of voices, and they get very tiring after the first few times you hear them.  While I wouldn't recommend this game in general, there are still several groups of people I think should buy it. If you have played all the games up to this point and are a Souls series fan, then you should buy this; DS3 is just more of the same. In fact, this group has most likely already bought this game. The second group is comprised of people who have already played DS3 and want it on PC. Yes, these people should also buy the game. It is worth getting on PC for mods if you already like the game. Now for the groups I would not recommend this game for: If you haven't played a Souls game before, please do not start with this one. Either play DS1 or Demon's Souls first. For those who have played a Souls game before but not the titles that come before this one, go at least play DS1 and 2 first. I believe one of the reasons for my dislike of this game is that my high expectations were met with great disappointment. DS3 does not live up to the heights of the first two games, and that saddens me to see."
Negative,You may have heard this game is hard. But the hardest part of the game is trying to get online. The servers are even less stable than the mental stability of my ex.
Negative,"Darksouls was a really good game it was tuff and sometimes made me nervous, facing bosses or black phantoms, they'd always come and attack some different way it was fun and I hopped to see it get better from there, but it didn't really and that makes me sad.Dark Souls 2 came it was more blocky the animations were kinda bad the bosses were mostly humanoid but didn't really notice because pressure was on! the pvp was awesome and somewhat fair aside from op hex builds or gank squads and super oneshot buffs  still very fun.  Now Dark Souls 3 the looks are amazing! The animation is like taking Bloodborne and DS together fluid smoth moving emotes and this all makes it look and feel great the bosses are kool and fast with diff moves and epic setups that I wish I had but kno I'll never get!! and the story as always is hard to follow but I see the prgress from the other games I liked that a lot! The praise ends there sadly, Dark Souls 3  pvp is terribly broken, to the point where most of the ppl use only rapier that can take out all your hp with no effort one poke and you're dead or duel sword roll stabs that have more reach than they should  that can kill you in one shot it's very unfair, I always liked fire mage and magic is awesome but it's debuffed so much here or just not thought out, the aoe fireball can be rolled out of with no effort (even when it connects if they rolled it does no dmg) ou can't lock on with it to hit so there is a gamble and if you throw wrong you'll be killed, the aoe fire storm doesn't connect even when they get hit by the fire, the charge times are crazy and there literally is no way to stand alone keep distance between you and say a katana user running and poking. Pyro isn't only thing that is discouraged, there are the heavy tanks too that lost poise replaced with I frames (which are useless basically) so a poke from anything can stop them that's silly..My only thought is they'll try and put out another DS3+ edition with all dlc and well I don't recommend it for that reason alone. Please save your money until the full product is out with full thought or until this game sells for less than 30 usd. :3"
Negative,You guys didnt have a second to port this properly? jesus...
Negative,"It's like Dark Souls but with very bad game and level design. Technically is better than Dark Souls II, but gameplay-wise is way more boring. Even if you play with total overhaul mods (like Cinders or Convergence) there's no salvation, it's still downright boring. Buy it only if you want the whole trilogy for collection, otherwise stick with Dark Souls and Dark Souls II only."
Negative,"Since the game is supposed to support Co-op, I bought two copies of this title to play with a friend. Unfortunately the game mechanic that allows you to do SOME content together isn't available from the start and also dependant on in-game items.Maybe this is logical for players who have played the Dark Souls genre for a while, but I was unpleasantly surprised.Furthermore the game is obviously designed for a controler. Since I dont have or want one, all the tooltips are worthless because they are not dynamic for your keyboard layout.All in all I regret buying this game and would advise to spend your money elsewhere."
Negative,"Character control in this game is piece of crap, because of camera that is always doing what it can to make you loose the sight of the attack or boss, especially if boss is so big and close to you...."
Negative,"From Software has abandoned all 3 of these games on PC, no online support, enjoy your single player only game, thumbs down from me."
Negative,worst game i've ever played. 0/10.
Negative,"this fu##ing game sucks. I could not get past the first boss. Who designs a ,,tutorial'' boss this hard??"
Negative,"Awesome game, see other reviews, but I cannot recommend because the game is now unsupported and hackers are everywhere, so don't expect to play any of the multiplayer content with any dignity."
Negative,"This is an edited review: First, I have to play with mouse and keyboard because controllers make my hands hurt. This game is more of an art piece designed specifically for consoles. The mods to make the game make sense for PC players are very difficult to implement. Like the PC version still says stuff like ""A: enter"" or ""right-trigger: auto-level"", forcing you to go into the menu and figure which key you actually need to use. The game is hard but the menu interaction is needlessly difficult. The menu music doesn't stop playing until you click through the first screen and there is no way to turn it off before that. Even muting all music in the settings. The game itself is mostly good though. The only disagreement I have is that the hitboxes for NPCs can be much greater than their animation suggests, making for very frustrating and irrational gameplay. Some people seem to like that. Update: The whole reason i started playing this game is so i could play with my friend, but when we joined up, some other player joined my world and started killing both of us. After that I realized this is an absolute piece of garbage and that nobody in their right mind should have created it. Uninstalling now. Fuck you if you do this to other people and fuck the game devs for allowing it. Eat shit and die."
Negative,"Final Boss is nothing more than attack spamming until you die.  You cannot beat him unless you get incredibly good RNG.  We're talking tracking mid and post attack, infinite attack combos, an actual juggle combo, and hitboxes and timings that do not match the animations.  fun to play, impossible to finish solo.EDIT: Apparently when they took the servers down for a security exploit they created a bug or decided to harass players by breaking Abyss Watchers.  Now the neutral one focuses only you meaning the fight is 3 on one.  IF you survive the boss gets infinite stamina and spam with, no exaggeration, no window to defend or dodge.  Thus making the game impossible to solo while co-op is offline.  Great job FromSoftware, you managed to butcher a game that had such great potential."
Negative,why am i getting controler buttons instead of keyboard inputs
Negative,"It is not a bad game, but you need patience which I dont have"
Negative,"If I worked for a suicide hotline, I would make someone play this game just to end their lives quickly."
Negative,The hitboxes are awful. Enemy model going through my character model. Wtf!? Leaving it for retirement
Negative,"Not recommended. This port has so many fucking issues in getting the game to run normally.I had my PS4 controller not get recognized, so fixed it in Big Picture mode. Bit weird that a game that originally came out on the PS wouldn't have PS controls by default, but whatever. We're good to go right?No, there's fucking motion controls enabled by default so the slightest movement of my controller sends my cursor flying around the screen.Okay, no biggie, I'll just find another control scheme with motion controls disabled. Okay NOW we're good right?No fuck you, now there's no audio in the opening cutscene, the speaker sounds like they're playing chinese whispers with me and I can't make out a single fucking word they're saying with my volume cranked to max.I'm starting to get pissed now, but that's fine, I can just skip the cutscene and rewatch it on youtube later.So I start making my character, and then the game decides to minimize itself every 10 seconds. That's my breaking point. I'm surprised at how fucking busted this game is 3 years after launch.If I wanted to fiddle with settings and config files to make my game playable, I'd be playing Skyrim with mods for the umpteenth time.The fact that the game needs so many fixes and tweaks from the user side, and even then still have unplayable bugs popping up nonstop is ridiculous.This isn't the first time I've had problems with Dark Souls on Steam, I can't even play 1 or 2 with my friends because their game either doesn't recognize their controller, or their control scheme was busted for some godforsaken reason."
Negative,feels bad to get invaded while afk ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Negative,Crashes and locks up on Steamdeck
Negative,Bought for multiplayer..is garbage. If you care about playing with someone else buy a different game.No loot for second person. If you die you have to go back and resummon them back. Tons of wasted time doing that. Not a smooth experience at all.
Negative,"Due to a problematic exploit, the servers have been down for days. From Software has made no announcements on this, and little mention. With Elden Ring just around the corner, I'm sure this is the kind of service we can expect. Some communication would be nice for those who enjoy these games, but it seems as tho they have just ignored the problem. Pulled my pre-order, no thanks. I'll purchase Elden Ring once it's stable, or on sale."
Negative,"This is a great game!It was different from DS2 but it's still great none the less.However, If you gonna buy this game.I must warn you.There are CHEATERS roaming around. FALSE BAN distributed.and IGNORANCE committed by Bandai regarding any of the MASSIVE number of false flagging for bans on their side.Lot's of those cheaters are getting banned, but also lot's of LEGIT players are getting dragged into it.Oh, also a cheater/hacker/modder can invade your game/get summoned into your game and screw up your game saves, which also trigger a BAN FLAG for your account that is currently NOT REMOVABLE.Don't say I didn't warn you.None the less it's a pretty decent game.7/10 for gameplay (ignoring cheater and flagging problem)"
Negative,how hard is it to change the options to show keybored and mouse controls please change this like now. it just show controller controls i cant do anything like some thing i get A is E vus some thing over lap and i cant change conrols no matter how much i try just change it its really not hard pay like a high schoolers to do it. its litterly that easy
Negative,Please bring back servers.
Negative,"Banned for picking up an item that someone else dropped for me. Nice game. Apparently its my fault that someone cheated to get that item, and now I get the punishment instead of them."
Negative,10/10 BUT... THEY TURN DOWN THE SERVERS BECAUSE THEY WANT YOU TO BUY THE NEW GAME THEY JUST RELEASED! COME ON BANDAI!!
Negative,"PvE : 10/10PvP : 0/10 unplayable, most useless thing ever ! because Poise bugged! Idk why not fixed.. MAIN stat in pvp.. and ofc lots of cheater :/"
Negative,i find dat net guad
Negative,if ur not a crackhead dont play
Negative,"Ultra hyped game with message prompts for an Xbox controller. With all that praise and fame, is it too hard to load an update to map it to PC keys? Maybe I could figure them out if at least I could find everything in the keybinding settings. But no, I found no way to change the Parry button, or the kick. And seriously? A 2016 game with a customization interface looks like some crappy 2005 game?Perhaps I came with too high expectations, given all that I had heard from the game."
Negative,"Ultra weapons, ultra weapons on tank builds everywhere.I would be inclined to say that everyone in Dark Souls has a unique approach to things but I find that only true in Youtube videos and not in actual gameplay that was experienced personally since every fucking invasion/summons brings me into the waiting arms of someone who goes full tank with a ultra weapon that feels like they are compensating for their small penises.They really need to change the name that is more suitable for the player base, Tank Souls 3: Ultra Weapons for my Lack of Girth."
Negative,disabled online cuz elden ring releaseshitty developer with no respect to playersdownload from torrent and dont buy this until servers upbtw game is nice
Negative,why can't i fuck the fire keeper
Negative,"a Good game, poorly converted to pc, a destruction derby has less crashes."
Negative,"Not really a souls fan. But I have had my fair share of ""hard games"". I have finished DS1, cuphead, hollow knight, re8 VOS NG etc. Most of these games feel fair, albeit frustrating. But DS3 is the first game I have ever played that felt that the game hard, but unfair.Not one moment in DS3 really stood out to me. The areas seem linear and uninspiring, the enemies were stupid and buggy, the bosses are gods and have infinite stamina. In contrast in DS1 I really liked the map design that branched off to multiple paths, enemies had more variety IMO and hard but fair bosses. I remember going down to the lava area for the first time and saw a dozen Capra demons, I remember the blight town ferris wheel and jumping off branches of a giant tree, I remember the fortress with lots of traps and rolling boulders.Thinking back at it, I would rather fight 50 more bed of chaos's than another boss in dark souls 3.A few problems that made the game unenjoyable for me:1. Kicking instead of attacking is always frustrating, why would you bind a kick to mouse 1??? I cannot tell you how many times I had a boss at 1hp and kicked him instead of attacking.. You know what happens next.On the same note, extremely terrible mouse + keyboard support, not only is key binding unmappable, but on screen hints also show controller buttons???2. quite bad optimization for PC, sometimes down to 2X fps for me. In contrast DS1 remastered had 60fps throughout I rmb.3. buffering a roll/attack after taking a hit (up to 2 seconds). Why?? Surely if I wanted to roll dodge but failed because I took a hit I would not want to roll right after? Is this what makes a game hard? Most of the time this mechanic is completely worthless and wastes precious stamina/opportunity for attacks.4. Terrible lock on system. Again, DS1 also had this problem, but I was having a worse time with lock on in this game for some reason.. Sometimes, the lock on automatically cancels. Sometimes the enemy has a seizure and the camera is all messed up. Don't even mention the enormous bosses with terrible hit boxes where locking on does not mean you will hit them.5. Sometimes I try using an ember mid fight to heal. I use up the ember but get killed - Ember restored :), you are dead :):) This is the most frustrating mechanic in the entire game. You either take my ember and let me heal, or you take my life. DO NOT TAKE BOTH.Just GIT GUD."
Negative,dark souls? more like DANK souls.
Negative,it was too easy
Negative,"Console game, very poor using keyboard and mouse, all the tips are for console controls. Unless you have a controller do not buy this."
Negative,"Dark Souls is a mixed bag. I love DS lore, I love a hard game. But I need a fair challenge. In DS I'm just fighting the controls more than I'm fighting mobs. Lock on keeps disconnecting, locking to the wrong mobs, has almost no range for locking. The button combination to jump is flawed. Who'd put the jump control on the down press of a joystick that can completely change the angle you're jumping at. This all wouldn't be an issue if the game supported decent keyboard and mouse controls. There are countless 3rd person games that get melee combat right. I'd even be happy with Chivalry style controls. But not being able to strafe without locking on to a target (a function I don't need with mouse controls) and not being able to use my mouse while locked on just makes the control even worse.Then let's talk about the PvP. If you ember in the earlier part of the game be ready to get invaded. By cunts praying on new players. By cunts who cheat praying on new players. This idea of the honorable DS player challenging you to a duel, not consuming estus, not using shitty strats is a farce.I wish DS would shed this rigid idea of the game where you have to play it their way and ""git gud"". I wish I could turn off invasions or make sure invasions are regulated in some sense with a decent cheat protection. To me the largest obstacle to overcome in Dark Souls is Bandai Namco with its head up its ass."
Negative,"Would've typed this review earlier if I wasn't busy playing the game itself!This is the first of the Dark Souls games I've played, and I have to say I love it.I heard the game was pretty brutal, and I hadn't really played that many legitimately tough games besides XCOM 2. I was unprepared.The term ""Git gud"" really applies here. Unless you work to better your skills, you aren't going to succeed in this game. I have spent over 90 hours on one character as of me typing this review, and still die quite often due to the purely brutal nature of the game. Leveling up isn't simply a gate to success. You need to learn tactics as well. The visuals are amazing. Sounds are good, music is very well composed. The lore, while hard to understand, is not bad either.I give this game a solid 9/10.UPDATE, 7/6/2021: I can not recommend the game in its current state. The game is still amazing itself. FromSoftware, however, is completely ignoring the glaring exploits within the game's engine. It's recently been brought to their attention that not only can exploiters break players saves, but it is possible to perform remote execution of codes through multiplayer. This is extremely dangerous to users, and FromSoftware should have been on this the moment they were told of it. It has gotten so bad that modders have resorted to making their own anti-cheat systems to protect against this. While the anti cheat systems created by users work for the time being, it is absolutely despicable that a developer would allow such a thing to go on in their game, endangering their playerbase."
Negative,Friend lied to me and I laid out the fire keeper. #NoProofIBeatTheGame
Negative,not going to say that its a bad game because its certainly not. the game has good controls and good story but im not into sodomy or bdsm so this game aint for me.
Negative,"1. Utterly garbage and unchangeable keybind on kick which leads to random kicking in middle of a weapon combo, ruining the flow of the combat;2. Obtrusive camera collision detection that leads to constant and nauseating camera distance changes in about half of the major fights, especially noticeable on larger enemies and around anywhere cluttered with objects;and, to a lesser degree:3. Action queue window starts and ends way too late for slow weapons in a counter-intuitive way, but can be mitigated by doing one swing at a time.Game is still fun, but it is hard to recommend it due to the aforementioned problems, unless you really want to experience some dated polishing in a game."
Negative,"Let me be the first to admit that I am not very good at this game. I get people love a challenge, and that some people genuinely find these games TOO easy. That said, if you're a new comer to this series, I would not recommend starting with this title. The hit boxes are ridiculously unfair, it's too easy to get stun-locked, and I cannot even begin to describe how many controls, settings, and moves I had to look up online. While I understand this is a good game, and I am just bad at it, I do think that something needs to be said for making the controls clearer, easier to find information would be appreciated, and perhaps some easier to level up areas would help (for people like me that just suck).So, if you're a veteran of this series? I'd say this game is a thumbs up. If you're a newcomer (like me) this game can be great fun at times, but misery incarnate at others."
Negative,"pros:- very creative design- interesting bosses with a lot of different stages and forms- good graphicscons:- high amount of hackers- compared to dark souls I or II very repititive in Ng+- absolutly horrible pc version. especially for some amd cards. Just look at all the unsolved threads about lags, fps drops, crashes and network failures- poorly balanced (best example: dark sword or dark hand, 360° parry (not quite sure if that´s a bug or just the work of hyper lazy animators))Dark Souls 3 is one of this games that rly makes me sad. It has practicly evrything i like: Stunning locations, thrilling bosses, a intelligent story about what makes mankind human and a creepy, unreal design, weren´t there these Pc issues which are way more frustrating for me than the difficulty of the game itself.Overall a wonderful game that reminds me a bit of Batman Arkham Knight. The game itself was realy nice but at the end it failed due to the decision of the producers that it´s obviously not necessary nowadays to release games in a playable state because a lot of people will buy it anyway because of pre-orders and bolstered gameplay trailers."
Negative,"This game is amazing if you go in blind and on a first playthrough.The story is rich and ambigious, the difficulty is balanced in a way that only a complete nonce would not complete it and overrall, I'd recommend it.For one playthrough.The game offers nothing but the same, linear path towards the same goal. In the past games, you had some sort of decisions as what you should do in some, if not all, parts. Dark Souls III has the same, linear path every playthrough, the only choice the player gets is when you should tackle one of the areas and what one of the mid-game bosses do you want to fight first. Sure, each area has things to explore, but outside of a few scenarios, most of them cryptic, no optional path will lead you to a new sandbox to play in and explore. Even then, most of the optional bosses reach hair-pulling difficulty that barely allow your character to breathe before their next attack (*cough cough* Champion Gundyr *cough cough) And then there's the communityAll of them are cunts. You will never find a single kind Dark Souls III player. The most help you're gonna get is with a boss and even then, the summoned gets a reward for it. The tamest ones are people who place a dickish message ('Hidden Path Ahead' on an obvious drop, 'Illusory Wall Ahead' not on an illusory wall etc). The worst ones will try to fight you. At least in the other games seeing a Pyromancy Flame did not immediatly make me contract terminal cancer. Invaders invade you, whether through their covenant or by choice, point down to signify where you belong and then shit on you. Invading, you will always find a group of 4 people ready to stunlock you, then synchronize their point downs and shits. The only way to avoid these people is to not be embered, but the game punishes you for not being in an embered state by cutting your health to 3/4 of what it was.Overrall  Good game Varied environments Intense difficulty Boring post-end content Asshole communityIn conclusion, pick it up once, beat it and then never again"
Negative,"Wow, that was not enjoyable, it's not DS game it Ambush game with huge health pools. Levels are really bad, it always feels like you are in hallway and never allow in ""house"". Enemies lack of creativity, in most cases they just hit harder and have much more HP to the point of absurd, where you need to hit 3-5 time with BKS normal basic enemy. And that is problem of the entire game, it was made for try hards that cry that DS is to easy and to many people menage to finish it. Now almost every single common enemy have too much health and have some nasty attack that render armor and shield quite useless. Enemies gank you hard because scripts turn them on even when they shouldn't hear or see you. It makes exploration a chore because with so many enemies, with so much hp there is  ambush on every corner, you see one enemy, you can be sure there are 3, you see no one, someone probably will spawn or sits on wall or roof waiting to attack it's tiresome.And now bosses, they are 3 types: 1. laughable, 2. kill you instantly 3. bull... using faulty game designs.I will write only about 3rd one, in game where camera works really bad they make bosses that use that against you, bosses act really quick, can jump really high or are really big which brokes camera angle making sometimes impossible to see what's happening and then you get hit in the back. Or you need to fight with weird perspective where you are sure you are close enought but miss and miss again, of course boss have just absurd range so it's not problem for him. Sometimes also they hit you in perfect nanosecond when you get up, making it impossible to react.I have beaten Soul of Cinder but I gave up on Nameless King, camera in the first phase literally doesn't work and second phase is to fast to tank with shield. Plus none of resistance items worked on his attacks so he chipped health with every hit.(full Havel is worthless)"
Negative,"Going into it, I really wanted to like DS3. But after 30 hours I just lost interest and stopped playing altogether. I didn't make a conscious decision to, I wasn't stuck on a boss or anything, the game just ceased to be compelling for me. I'll list my main criticisms below.1. Boss's are extremely tedious, which is why no one wants to be summoned for them2. Messages don't really have a purpose with the scarcity of mimics, illusory walls and other secrets3. PvP is trivial to ignore altogether and has some weird metagame I can't be bothered to learn4. Exploration is hampered by aggressive enemies and frequent bonfiresI could go on but suffice to say ds3 isn't my cup of tea. It's weird because in a lot of ways dark souls has never been better, but I'd rather sink another 40h into ds2 than finish ds3."
Negative,Do i even have to say at this point playing the game is uterlly useless if i cant play online without the fear of being banned. OH WAIT IM ALREADY BANNNED NEVERMIND!Other than that great game i will update this review with a real one when they fix their shit and if they dont then this will stay the same until the end of days.
Negative,Does not save to steam cloud. Does not put save files where they will be backed up.  Not sure I want to put another 24 hours in to get my progress back.
Negative,PLEASE DONT GET THIS GAME ITS BUGGING OUTTA THE WAZZOO
Negative,Anyone have a fix for the input not supported at the beginning of the launch like can't get anything besides input not supported. Changes resolution and everything so far. HELP! Or this review stays negative.
Negative,most boring piece of shit game ive ever played
Negative,"I've played 3 souls games at this point: Bloodborn, Elden Ring and DS3A lot of the problems I have with DS3 are parts of the other games, they are just more numerous feeling in this entry. More instant deaths, more “the floor is murder” more bosses with grabs and cheap moves, more overpowered enemies that minimize how epic the bosses could feel, more “do things because reasons” story elements.I have come to call these parts of the game the work of “Jon Darksouls” and he worked a lot on various parts of this particular game. The poison swam, the death knights, the roundy ball shaped knights are are hard to kill and yield pathetic rewards, you name it and I bet “Jon” was in charge of it.I played using a co-op mod that makes it so you don't have to be ember'd to make it a bit less of a trial because the High wall starting area is also the hardest starting area in all 3 of those games I mentioned, imo. I find that ironically funny that “high wall” is a literal tough way to start playing a souls game.Finally the last boss felt really unbalanced and that if you have any build that isn't just a brick wall with a sword, you're out of luck.I've herd good things about the DLC, I hope I can enjoy those more.I'd recommend one of the other games over this one."
Negative,"The first playthrough is very fun, OST's are brilliant at the boss fights, however the game becomes really stale at NG+ and after about 5-10 hours in pvp it becomes boring, after the countless disconnections / laggy fights or even getting sent back to your own world the second you've invaded because they've started the boss, it becomes incredibly boring.The covenants in this game are also very bad, 3 of the covenants are auto-invade/summon and they do not work most of the time, you have to be lucky to get summoned or if you didn't level yourself too high so you could pvp you might get lucky, but for those at around SL 80 don't bother with the auto invade/summon covenants, stick with Warriors of Sunlight, Rosaria's Fingers & Mound Makers.also out of the 30ish hours I've played the game, I've only been invaded 4ish times, and I was embered pretty much the whole way through my first run.The game is also very very short compaired to Dark Souls 1 & Dark Souls 2, i'm pretty dissapointed in the game at the moment but hopefully with whatever DLC they bring out it improves the game a lot."
Negative,dark souls 2 better
Negative,why boss as normal enemy? unkillable?
Negative,"This game is really Fun to play, the gameplay and controls are pretty top notch and I defintily wouldn't mind playing more games in this style.That being said I have to vote it down for two major flaws...1. The Co-Op might just be the single worst version of Co-Op I have ever seen in a video game, the fact that you only have a limited number of tries to play with your friend and that if you are playing wth your friend then other people can just attack you and him outright is absurd, I get it the game is supposed to be hard but was it really such a challenge to just put in a 'Invite Friend' option to your game?2. The difficulty, I know, its supposed to be hard and theres nothing wrong with a challenge but this is diffrent.Everything can kill you in 3-4 hits, while blocking you take damage, the stun lock is awful, enemy weapons can clip through object but your weapon bounces off of them ect ect.This isn't real difficulty its artifical diffficulty, the game overpowers ennemies while underpowering you and uses cheap tricks to keep you down and beat you, its a game of trail and error with awful checkpoints to match.All in all the game is really fun to play and satisfying when you actually beat you foe, but all the cheap tricks and the garbage tier Co-Op system hurt this game horribly, I'd say buy it on sale and never over $20 as its not worth full retail price, maybe after I play some more and 'git gud' I'll change that but until then.10/10 a masterpeiceEdit: Turns out I'm just a scrub, the game is pretty damn good probably say its worth $30-$40Co-Op if still kinda shitty most times, mainly the invasions its just really annoying to be doing something and get invaded by some asshat who just tries to lure you towards npcs that don't hurt him.Its not even really fighting all it's just standing around and waiting for someone to make a move and thats boring as all hell.Still a good game but there should be a way to kick invaders from a game or a time limit for invaders so that way your time isn't wasted or even just have the NPC's be able to attack them so its fair (Then again dark souls is the literal form of unfair)11/10 s better masterpieceEdit 2: Can't say you should get this game at anything over $20 and that pushing it, while its fun to play the ammount of times i saw bosses noclip there weapons and bodys through objects so they could do there attacks is staggering.It's hard yes but not because its chalanging its all artifical.Bosses can do just about anything and have no limitsregular NPC's can do the same even hitting you behined a fog wallsometimes the game just Alt TabsLeveling up is actually pointlessand worst of all is the forced PVP the shoehorn into the game so that way you have to do it, don't like it? sucks you get invaded by npc's if your offline tooWan't to play co-op prepare to be invaded all the time.All and all with a little more work this could be a fun challenging game but instead its a glitchy unfair mess and really deserves some blame (don't tell the dark souls fanbase this though, they know its broken and there only response is to 'git gud')-10/10feels like it's still in beta(also as far as I know you can't even use mods offline otherwise you get banned online, i'd test it myself but this company has an itchy trigger finger and saying this in a review will probably get me banned.drop it to -11/10 for lack of mods)Also recently fought a bird boss and not only does the camera freak out in that area the lock on just does not work 9.9/10 making it hard to see or keep track of a flying enemynot only that but this boss likes to phase through your attacks as well to top it all off.in case that wasn't even close to enough getting to that boss is a pain since enemies will just block the door way with there body and if you try and fight your way there you'll have an awful time (or rather a more awful time)Update: Played some more and this game is still trash, combat is good but everything else is just a steaming turd-131/10 game gets steadly worse the longer I play (and this comment remains true)"
Negative,why is it thatas the game number goes upthe quality goes down?
Negative,No cloud saves. FeelsBadMan
Negative,"Absolute joke on the PC - they don't even change the tool tips to allow for play on the keyboard. Controls are made with console monkeys in mind. Lazy, lazy port."
Negative,I liked the other games in the series better. This just feels like a repeat.
Negative,Poor port. Don't even think to play with mouse & keyboard. It's like using M&B as controller.
Negative,"For online play: Too much phantom range, and some attributes have near no actual reflection to the stat value in comparison.I understand its fairly new and things are subject to change but it does not seem that some stats actually are completely worthless and a waste of effort."
Negative,"This game is poorly designed and lacks any semblance of coherent storytelling or, indeed, any reason to bother playing it unless you happen to enjoy fighting the same repetitive enemies over and over again while struggling against archaic character controls and a truly terrible camera. I strongly advise against playing this game, it is worth neither your time nor your money."
Negative,"Do something with god damn cheaters, there are tonn of this fuckers i litteraly cant play at the beginning of game coz of a retard that invades me all day and deals 1k dmg on soul level 23, when i got +2 weapons at max(so he can not invade me with +10 weapon coz of ds matchmaking system)"
Negative,"This game isn't Dark Souls. Invasions have always been part of the game, but the way they have things set up in DS3, you can run ahead in the game, remain low level, and then invade starting areas and just spam heal against new players. I have been unable to progress not because I'm not better than these people, but because they can dodge roll twice and heal instantly basically forever while I am stuck with 3 estus flasks of the lowest quality. Time and time again I'll have these losers down to their last hit or 2, and they'll roll off and instantly heal. Meanwhile, stuck with my very limited healing, I have no choice but to dodge, block, parry and fight like a mad bastard. Sometimes I even win. But the balance is so far broken its not a question of me being better, but them simply being unable to roll far enough away.Honestly, if I could get my money back for this game I would, this game simply isn't Dark Souls. Its a broken troll fest mess."
Negative,"Game's a bad meme.At this point the only people playing this are either newbies, or tryhards who only use the latest meta. PvP is pretty messy and incredibly laggy, though that could most likely be because Australian Internet is pretty garbage, so.From a PvP Standpoint, I dare say this is the worst in the series. I don't know why FROM decided this, but invasion priority goes to hosts with a phantom (or 2), while you get stuck solo. It's just insane. Phantom Range is rampant in this game, you can roll twice but still get hit and the Straight Sword is still king. Fast attack, wide swing, and more range than an ultra greatsword make them stupidly overpowered/PvP Meta. I'd prefer the old Carthus Curved sword meta over this current patch anyday."
Negative,"Zero effort when porting game for PC.Terrible experience, I'll have to buy a game-controller before I try again to play it."
Negative,my balls are on fire :(
Negative,cannot save online this game . only have  local save
Negative,Only artist did their job well.
Negative,"shit, save gets corrupted 3 times u have to start over each time trash ass game"
Negative,"Just venting, dont mind me.Why is nothing thats related to DS3 working, like, at all?First I'm trying to play this Steam Deck verified game on my Steam Deck, only to discover that it's impossible to play, because the current version of the game (or the OS, dont ask me) is literally broken and even creating a character is literally impossible.Okay, fine, whatever, switch to PC then.So whats next? There is no native support for Ultrawidescreen, so I have to learn how to use HxD to code it in there myself, so the game doesnt look like stretched pixel vomit. Alright, that was a dumpster fire, but after a while I even managed to get that working.Already frustrated, but happy that it FINALLY works I start the game, press X and... wait... I press X and nothing happens? Phenomenal, my controller isnt recognized either! So I tried everything. Deactivate Steam Input, activate it again, set it to default, use my PS5 controller wired, try it wireless, give up on the PS5 controller, thinking its just too new for this game, repeat all of the steps with a PS4 controller, nothing works, ragequit and write salty article on the steam forum.Every Indie Dev in the world manages to have Steam Input do the work for them and have every controller work natively. What the hell is wrong with this triple A title that just refuses to cooperate at all?This is truly the Dark Souls of tech issues. I give up."
Negative,"Too expensive for an 8 year old game, Pirate it."
Negative,"i have been penalized for corrupt data,and I even reseted my whole pc and still I am penalized,this is bullshit,this game was the best ever but now it is fucking shit"
Negative,"Was getting ready to declare this the best souls game by a mile after the 1st playthrough going through every boss in base game and ringed city until I had found the absolute fucking shitstain that is Sister Friede, this boss has resulted in the miscarriage of my unborn son, the divorce of my wife of 10 years, all property I had owned being seized and the death of my 54 year old mother, this will be the last fromsoft game I'll have purchased in my lifetime."
Negative,good choice if you don't wanna have fun
Negative,Spent an hour trying to defeat the first boss and still couldn't do it. Difficult ass game
Negative,this game is awful. cant even makeout with lorthic.
Negative,"While I could bear 60 FPS lock, I can't recommend this game for it's horrible online play. I wanted to play co-op with my friend but everytime we tried, somebody connected to us (and there is no way of stoping or kicking them) and kills us/hides in mobs and heals and so on. After trying to get any progress done in the game, we run around doing nothing but dying from that person for 40 minutes. In conclusion, it's impossible to play this game online privately without any interferrence."
Negative,"Honestly? As much as people love to hate on Dark Souls 2, 3 has to take the spot as worst in the series for me. Without the DLC I felt like I was playing an unwanted remake of Dark Souls 1, but without the freedom and fun of Dark Souls 1, this game is a huge, slow and dragged railroad and that really kills the replay value for me. The DLC added some spice to it and gave the the Trilogy an interesting ending as well as some nice bosses (not the most fun areas tho), but the base game is awful. Go play Scholar or Dark Souls Remastered, they do anything Dark Souls 3 tried to do but better in plenty of ways, and if you like weapon arts just go play Elden Ring, they are much better there."
Negative,"Took me a while to understand why i didn't like this game. The answer is simple : its not dark souls.The game is name dark souls and is in the lore of dark souls but the gameplay isn't there. In fact this game is Bloodborne 2. So where to start:1- Most boss are crap because they are bloodborne boss in a dark souls game. That maens: fast and endless spree of attack and unpredictable OR spamming magic and poor fight design like Aldrich. The only bosses fight i have enjoy is the dragon slayer armor, Lothric and Soul of Cinder.That's 3 on 19. Oh yeah i forget to say this one has the least bosses.2- Boss can hit you when you're on the ground, but compare to dark souls 1 you take full damage instead of 1/4.3- The ash flask is crap.4- the difficulty curve is stupid, you start killing scrubs and then a black mass appear and reck your ass. Dark souls always and a fair difficulty curve base on the souls you should have accumulate and your perception.5- Jailer in the Irithyll dongeons are stupid, they drain your max hp, who the fuck though it was a good enemie type.skeleton wheel were a good challenge, you could do something against them with skills. Dark Souls is about skills not button mashing and haste.6- shields are almost useless against boss because most of them do elemental damage or just go through your shield. the only time i use shield now is for parrying. its should not be like that,7- Now we have to talk about dodge, WTF. they don't take enough stamina, so you just start spamming it and never use shields. THIS IS NOT BLOODBORNE, A DODGE IS SUPPOSED TO BE TIMED NOT SPAMMED.8- POISE? where is it? oh i know, this game is bloodborne so they didn't implemented it.9- PvP sucks because of dodge stamina cost10- The map in dark souls 2 was fuck up, but at least it was not has linear has this one.Dark souls 2 was better since it respected what dark souls really is. You don't change the gameplay when you make sequels, you add CONTENT and FEATURES.That season pass better be worth it, you had my thrust Miyazaki now you lost it i wont ever pre-order another Dark Souls."
Negative,"If you like your games to show up at your house unannounced,  tie you up, beat you relentlessly, steal all the beer out of your fridge, then leave you in a heap on the ground then you will adore this game. I for one am not really interested in this kind of experience. When I was younger I would have been totally into this but for me at this time I'm not into games that stress me out like this one does. Many people really like this series so it's not like it a bad game per se. I just can't recommend anyone looking to escape into a game put themselves through this unless you know what your getting into. This was the first time I tried a dark souls game it it literally plops you down with absolutely no explanation to wander off to god knows where to get slaughtered over and over again by whatever kind of eldritch horror the psychos that designed this thing dreamed up. It just not the game for everyone. As soon as I realized that I wasn't really having any fun I refunded it. Games should be fun... and this game was not fun for me. Your mileage may vary. Maybe you hate yourself and you love having your entire psyche torn apart and remade by FromSoftware's sadistic game design philosophy... Idk man... more power to you I guess. I also found that the community around the series seems to be full of a lot of ""git gud"" style machismo types. That is why I enabled comments on this review as I thought that may be fun for everyone."
Negative,"If you're looking for a standard co-op experience, do not look here.While the game overall is fun and a great Dark Souls experience, it does not allow for a standard co-op experience that you'd expect to find in most games, instead creating frustrating interruptions to gameplay that have no workaround. DS3 has a player invasion system where hostile players can invade and kill you every 15 minutes, leading to interruptions to co-op play. The problem is not just that fighting other players is difficult - it's not really about ""getting good"" at the game: it's that if you want to have the experience you love of playing Dark Souls, but with a friend, the joy of the game is constantly frustrated by invading interruptions.Although the internet says it matches lower-level invaders to your game, that was not my experience. With fewer than 10hrs in the game, and with a friend who had created a new character, we had players whose weapons took all my HP in 2 hits. This is incredibly frustrating, because to start co-op mode, you need a hard-to-get resource (that's technically infinite, but not trivially attainable), and co-op mode must be restarted each time the host's character dies. Furthermore, in co-op, the chances for invasion are greatly increased--co-op players are put to the top of the invasion queue, and if even they defeat the hostile, they can be invaded at most once every 15 minutes. Because of how often invasion is opened, you have a high chance of being invaded by players who are more skilled than you, both being killed, and being forced to re-start co-op.There is not a way to get around the invasion system. There is no setting to stop it. There are no mods to prevent it, and even if there were, any modifications to the game's files result in a ban when connecting to DS3's servers. You cannot use a VPN or LAN to escape it, because you have to connect to the game's servers to start co-op. This game is years old, so it's unlikely the devs would change this.If you are looking for singleplayer Dark Souls, this is a great game for you. If you are a DS expert and can kill many other PvP players, co op could be fun to change up the gameplay. If you are looking to play with a friend for more than 15-30min at a time to go through the DS experience together, look for a game that doesn't discourage you from playing its features."
Negative,"Servers down, zero transparency on when theyre coming back (if at all).This means:- No more Coop with friends- No more PVP- All the PVP covenant gear has to be manually grinded out for all achievements- No more messages / player ghostsLot of content will be lost, dont support this blatant laziness by From."
Negative,it will consume you
Negative,This game is boring asf! all you do is run around and roll. why play this shit when you can play runescape the superior souls game.
Negative,you deserve a third nuke for this port
Negative,Same old badly optimized port with clunky controls and combat mechanics.
Negative,"lag ,crash, cant invite , low fps what next"
Negative,"I'd very much recommend this game, had FromSoftware not completely shut down their servers.  They've put all their eggs into Elden Ring now.  This game is good, but far less deserving of the glory it had before it was taken out back and shot..."
Negative,I'm a shooting star leaping through the skyLike a tiger defying the laws of gravityI'm a racing car passing by like Lady GodivaI'm gonna go go goThere's no sto-*Save FIle Corrupted*
Negative,imagine playing ds3 lol
Negative,Not sure why this game got such high reviews game is garbage. Baby Souls 3 rise of the beta male. P.S. good luck playing this on PC.
Negative,"Fuck this ""game"". It pissed me off more than the RL problems."
Negative,it makes me sad...
Negative,idk how to beat polneroeff
Negative,"PvE wise, every issue with the past Souls games magnified by 10. The near removal of poise means that swarms of rats can stagger you endlessly, enemies constantly hit you through walls and barricades, and there's a glitch that's existed since release where sometimes phantoms can't enter the boss arena."
Negative,"so trash. The fucking regular enemies two tap you with like 5 swing chain attacks. Wouldn't be so bad if your weapon actually made a connection with the enemies, but it misses so much and stuffs you up. You can play for 45mins on the same checkpoint because the checkpoints are so far apart and if you die it respawns you back to the start. Shit game requires no skill and no fun."
Negative,"Game wants to be Bloodborne but doesn't go all the way and ends up controlling and playing like shit. It's extremely tedious and unfun and excessively difficult in all the worst possible ways. It's ten times harder than Dark Souls 1 but for all the wrong reasons. The game is poorly designed and legitimately unfair, unlike DS1 which was a refreshing challenge. Not recommended."
Negative,"Just don't get it.Twikers WILL get you, and hackers will enter you session and get you banned.Just awesome! Don't buy the game."
Negative,"I would love to write a review for this game, unfortunatelly I can't play the game due to costant crashes."
Negative,Crashes all the time.
Negative,noleave while you still can
Negative,Full of Cheaters these days and unaware players get hurt.
Negative,i didnt like it
Negative,I fucking hate this game
Negative,"Play it with a controller. The mouse/keyboard controls are garbage. There is no keyboard tutorial in game -- everythis is still listed with Xbox controls. If you have a controller, go for it. If you don't, I hope you like workarounds and YouTube tutorials to figure out how to play the damn game."
Negative,Get it on PS4 or something. I beat this game twice 7 years ago. And forgot to leave a review. Obviously its DS3 its a good game game play wise. But the performance is garbage. Seven years later. On a superior machine. I get frame rate drops during certain situations. It's an embarassing port.
Negative,Why is there only xbox buttons to show the controls on a pc game? There should be keyboard keys.
Negative,It's ight I guess.
Negative,my game wont work ffs
Negative,"Can't fix the security problems, or at least still working on it? I get it. Not Lowering the price of a game WITHOUT full functionality? Fail.Not providing updates to a dedicated community?? Massive Fail!For the price, I expected WAY better from From..."
Negative,Its pretty good i guess. PVP is good for longevity and alot of fun.I don't like how they penalise players while those who truly are malicious escape detection. I still find ways to play occasionally. Would greatly appreciate being un-penalised. Its about time FROMSOFTWARE releases the game files to the players and allow to make our own servers. The entire universe is built in the same engine so imagine the possibilities. With fibre on the horizon for many people it maybe that achieving high play counts in SOULS should be possible. Players have created mods that allowing playable bosses and other such nifty tech. GIVE US THE SOULS!!!
Negative,"Is DS3 a bad game? No.Is it the best thing ever? No.Did I have fun? Somewhat.Would I recommend it to anyone? No.I think DS3 has pretty good combat but the overall experience becomes too exhausting after a while. Bad camera and unclear hitboxes could gang up on you while you're fighting bosses that hit like a truck, worsening the already narrow margin of error. The reward you gain from boss fights aren't really worth it. While the art direction is strong and the music is excellent, the story is told in an incoherent manner through a bunch of mumbling goth kid NPCs. And your character has no character. So, I didn't feel engaged to this drab world. Yeah, yeah, there's some ash lords doing something bad. Whatever. The game is solid but overrated.If you're interested, wait for a deep discount. And if you find it too frustrating to go on, use cheat mods to play offline. Braggarts and elitists will scream blasphemy at you. But it's your money."
Negative,"Bad pc port. Console-only overlays. Continuous game stutters even though the cpu/gpu are under 60% utilization. Numerous manual hotfixes and hacks online to address these but no official handling for them. Finished the game and it's overall great, but this is the 3rd FromSoftware game with a bad PC port."
Negative,"By far the worst game in the franchise. Dumbed down in every aspect, and way more restrictive than any previous souls game. Because the world structure is incredibly linear, it results in way less variety in repeated playthroughs, which makes replaying the game tedious and boring. You always have to go through the same places in the same order on each repeated playthrough until around half point in the game, and even then it doesn't improve all that much. It also hurts build variety, since you can't get certain items earlier because the game structure just won't allow it. The levels themselves are way more linear than ever before too. Combat, while faster, is heavily dumbed down. Absolutely broken poise makes every melee build feel the same unless you're using ranged magic, which you probably wouldn't want to do anyway, since it's practically useless in this game, especially when it comes to miracles. It is the third game in the series, but still has issues from previous titles that were made with way lesser budget. The game still doesn't have cloud saving or even keyboard icons for PC users, for example. Anti-cheat is way worse than it was in Dark Souls 2, literally their previous game. People can break your save files by invading you, send you to ng+, or put broken items in your inventory which will ban you from playing online. Similar things could happen in the first game too, but that game didn't even have any anti-cheat solution to begin with, and was made with a much smaller budget.The game borrows way too much from Dark Souls 1, to the point where it doesn't even feel like a homage anymore, but straight up self-copying and laziness. Half of the characters in DS3 are literally the same people that you meet in DS1, except names might be different this time around.PVP is the worst series had so far. Fun mechanics like kamikaze jumps or magic sniping were removed from the game for no reason, and matchmaking prioritizes invasion to people who have a whole squad of phantoms with them. To add insult to injury you are required to invade A LOT if you want to obtain certain items, spells, or achievements since you need covenant items to get them. In previous games, you could easily farm those items from regular enemies, and well, you can do that here too, except there's a catch. The drop rate for covenant items in DS3 is insanely low. We're talking less than a 4% chance of item drop here. Farming two silver knights in Anor Londo has become a meme at this point, due to how ridiculously long it takes to get items you need (it may take up to 8-12 hours of mindless grinding of the same two enemies), which forces you to either PVP (which isn't fun due to the restrictive nature of the game) or ask somebody to help you with getting these items by invading each other. It honestly hurts to see the game the way it is, because I'm a huge fan of the series and wanted it to be good more than anyone else, but sadly it's far from being a good souls game for me. It's not all awful though. The music is the best in the series, and visually the game looks pretty. Lore is okay too, but that's about it.  Huge disappointment."
Negative,Cant even play the game because it crashes every 5 seconds did everything to try and fix it by taking off overlays to playing in windowed mode and nothing works
Negative,NO REGIONAL PRICE NOW! FCK BANDAI NAMCO
Negative,"Great game, but do not recommend for PC. Lots of technical bugs and errors. You will spend more time on forums figuring out why your game keeps crashing instead of actually playing it. Direct X and NVIDIA issues."
Negative,"Antithesis of fun, masochists only"
Negative,What a load of sloppy shit
Negative,too many cathedrals and weird blood stuff
Negative,this game sucks dog water
Negative,"very difficult to get into, as it is very repetitive and difficult to control the aim of your character. It's also difficult from the beginning and somewhat uninspiring when it comes to sticking with it. I had high hopes for this game but it can't see the appeal sadly. The intro was OK and the tutorial was OK. I would recommend HellBlade instead as that has what I was expecting from this title."
Negative,"The From Software team is nothing short of unparalleled genius. As someone who's played the first two games, you have to wonder how they could make this game even more difficult for more veteran players. Most people tend to think ""smarter AI"" or ""unpredictable bosses,"" but From really threw a curveball on this one. I would have never expected that they would implement constant game crashes & frame drops. These new features have ramped the difficulty so much that I struggle to make it past the first bonfire! They even made getting into the game difficult, with having to disable all other controllers on your PC just to get yours to work! Truely, I believe this is the level of difficulty that every Souls fan has been craving since the original. I tip my hat to you, From Software.In all seriousness, there's an amazing game in here, but an unbelievably bad port has left a sour taste in my mouth. Lets hope for DSfix in the meantime."
Negative,Game is too easy.
Negative,There are way too many crashes right now.
Negative,"fun, but pvp is filled with hackers, glitchers and cheaters."
Negative,Dark Rolls. Fell asleep running to the second boss. 🤑🤡
Negative,"Finally finished it after several attempts over the years it has been released. I cannot STATE how much I hate the combat in this game. It essentially kills the essence of the franchise for me, PvP and invading. If you particularly enjoyed the DS2 combat you'll maybe have a hard time getting into this. Otherwise a pretty good game when it comes to quality, as its common with Fromsoft."
Negative,"Prepare to die. All Dark Souls reviews have to start with that. This game is worse than Dark Souls 2, which is a controversial opinion. It has a lot of problems that hold it back from being a good game.         The graphics are really good. there are some amazing songs in this game, and the sound effects are nice. Some of the bossfights are really amazing and the phases are a nice touch, yet a little overdone. Too much of a good thing can be bad. The game doesn't run as well as Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin. A PC that can run SotFS at 60 fps on max settings can only get about 40 fps on Dark Souls 3 at lowest settings.         The gameplay starts out really fun, but the longer you play, the more you notice things. They removed spell uses from the game, and instead tied spell uses to a mana bar called Focus Points. This wouldn't be so bad, but the way you refill your FP is by drinking Ashen Estus. Ashen Estus are clumsy, they cut in to your standard healing Estus Flasks. You can allocate how many of each estus you have, and getting more Estus only gives ONE Estus, instead of one of each. This wouldn't be a problem if being a phantom didn't only give you half of your Estus, on top of having 30% less max health.          The new Hollowing mechanic, is an item called an Ember, that increases your max health by 30% and allow you to summon or be invaded. This is so bad, if you want to survive better, you have to risk being invaded even if you don't want help, which is even worse because Dark Souls 3 has the lowest end game health pools out of any Souls game, and the way defense works the difference between the lightest armor and heaviest armor is 1 extra hit. If you are a white phantom co-oping with a buddy, these things are awful. You have 30% lower health than you'd like, no real defense, AND you have less estus.          Being an invader is also awful, you still have the lower health, half Estus, and no real defense. But this time, the matchmaking prioritizes people that are co-oping, so it's you against 2 or more players while everyone can use their Estus. Matchmaking is at least based on level again instead of Soul Memory.         The level design is quite nice for the most part, a lot of areas that circle back on themselves and have unlockable shortcuts, but the world design is bad in the sense that it is the most linear Dark Souls game to date in terms of which areas you can go to in order. The enemies are a lot faster and more aggressive this time around, which is a bit clumsy with the kind of game Dark Souls is. They basically took enemy design from Bloodborne and thought it would work in Dark Souls, without thinking about WHY it works. The rally mechanic made it so you could afford to be aggressive, because you could get your health back from it, instead of backing off. the rally mechanic is not in this game, you basically have to stick it out the whole time or try to find a time to heal, which is dangerous considering the attacks all have sweeping hitboxes and slow wind ups meant to make you panic and to catch you at the end of your roll.         The gameplay is very fast for a Souls game, which includes how fast you heal, which only makes PvP more annoying. Dodging takes next to no stamina. You could only have enough stamina to swing an ultra greatsword 4 times in a row, but you can dodge about 12 times in a row with that much stamina, and no punishment for doing so. Weapon Arts were a mechanic added in this game. They were poorly implimented. Every weapon has a special move that USUALLY costs Focus Points, but you can only use them by 2 handing the weapon, having nothing in your off hand, or by using a shield that lets you use the arts one handed. All of these ways prevent you from parrying. Poise, which is your stagger resistance stat, has been changed. Poise is now only active during certain attack animations of certain weapons. They added a type of weapon infusion called Refined, which lowers the base damage but increase the bonus damage tied to your physical stats to be equal to each other. This is the way to get the most damage out of most weapons in the game. Power stancing is gone, now the only way to effectively dual wield is to use special paired weapons.          Dark Souls can never get their stats right, this game included. Dexterity, which is a physical damage stat, also increases your magic casting speed, instead of any stat relating to magic. Luck has a very selective use, it helps status and item drop rates. Faith increases your lightning damage and allows you to use lightning magic, but your lightning defense is tied to the stamina stat.          Dark Souls 3 rehashes too much. There are a lot of throwbacks and references, but some of these just don't make sense or not as interesting as something new.           Dark Souls 3 is not a bad game, just mediocre. It's fun at first but grates on you after a while. There are a ton of small things that seem minor but start to build up and get on your nerves. It tries to be everything that people enjoy about the Souls series, without understanding WHY they were great, and felt like it tried to forget Dark Souls 2 existed. In the end, it just feels like the clumsy child of Dark Souls and Bloodborne."
Negative,"I want to recommend this game, but by all that it does right.... i can't. Why? Well because From Software is absolutly unable  to create a working Anti-Cheat system. They warm up the coop ever time, make it a bit more stable, better connections and then...the fuck the players with the anti-cheat software! Like they would not give a shit about the community?!So unless they fix this (i doubt they will) i can't recommend this game. Sure if you don't care bout online and online play alone offline, well then buy it. The game itself has some flaws, but is still worth the money. But if you want to Coop and PVP, well good luck to you. You can get banned for nothing. A cheater in your game as a invader or even as a helping phantom can mean the end to your online experience! Plain and simple. Even if you would delete all your saves and reinstall the game, you still get the same shity message and soon after you will be penalized!So sad, i hope they fix it somehow and i can change this review."
Negative,"This game is very depressing, will hollow your spirit and make you want to quit playing all other games as well. This game is not for entertainment nor to make you feel better.1. You will get lost all the time: there is no in-game maps and all critical progress points are very well hidden. Very depressing2. The world is hollow and all enemy NPC are mute, no interactions, and depressing. They are not excitingly scary like other games. Just depressing NPCs.3. If you die you will loose all credits (souls) and must fight through the hell to get your credits back. Imagine if it stuck at an odd place or you cannot find it. Very depressing. And you will die a lot. 4. There is no in-game quest logs, so use pen and pencil to write them down so you can remember next time you login. Very depressing to just think about it.5. Your character scales mainly based on how you roll, block, or parry, not much by items, make you stressed and depressed for casual play. Items matter less. Not much of role playing, more like a ping-pong arcade game."
Negative,"pretty sure most of you guys liked this game but i didn`t. i tried it for 35 minutes and asking for a refund. cant bind any keys, telling you to press A or B but its Q of E. i think its not meant at all for keyboard. i created a mage and cant even cast a single spell against huge guys that 2 hit me 2 mins into the game.. i dont care if its hard but at least, if you release it for PC, update it ..i had to google the controls and it was some stupid things like ``press W and space and then left mouse button all at the same time to jump attack``.alright. tried it 20 times, never worked. pressing R takes your potions.. i mean..  what the hell..  really ? R ?? right next to the E key that you must press all the time. there`s no game in the universe with R as the potion key. ``i`` dosnt even pop u the inventory..  i wonder what it was.. maybe ALT and then to access it F4, both at the same time . Probably something ridiculous as that.anyway, pretty sure its a good game to play with a controller, but 0/10 with a keyboard."
Negative,Game keeps crashing after I take a few steps away from the first bonfire in the game.0/10
Negative,I love this game
Negative,this gayme is impossible!!! i dyed like 100000 times!!! why would nintendo make sch a hard game :(
Negative,fix the fucking servers
Negative,"This game is damn near unplayable for me. I've had to look up tech fixes so the game wouldnt stutter in the middle of fights and nothing worked. On top of that the game has started to mysteriously Alt + Tab itself out of the game adn stop my controller from working. What the fuck? I love this game and DS1 too, it’s just given me too many problems to justify a good review"
Negative,"The controls sucks. Playing on PC shows gamepad controls whole time. ESC key doesn't work in main menu. Q E works. Inventory can't be open with mapped key, Only from ESC in game menu. ESC in game doesn't pause the game.The control of char is horrible. Clicked few times to attack - wait for the char to finish 2 attacks. No dash during animation. With active shield - pressing back would be good to step back - not to turn around."
Negative,"You try to play this game with your fucking friends and three hours in you have to use a dried finger to summon more than one person in the shittiest area ever put out in one of these fucking games that's a poison swamp that auto-summons invaders and every fucking invader is some wannabe tryhard faggot who has gone thru the whole game and DLCs at low level so he can go back to the early game and dunk on new characters for fun because he's a low self-esteem having, unloved, piece of fucking shit that feels the need to learn the shitty fucking parry mechanics of this game while as an invader he has netcode advantage, estus advantage, enemy help, and risks absolutely nothing this fucking game is absolute shit and Miyazaki clearly just wanted to fucking end it so he could work on Sekiro, an infinitely superior game in every single fucking way holy fuck please please please never make another multiplayer game fucking ever unless it's co-op only I never want to deal with wannabe ouroboro or peeve tryhards ever fucking again. Fuck."
Negative,"I absolutely love the soul series and have long awaited to get my hands on DS3 but this so far has been nothing but a horrible experience so far. I've played in offline mode for most of the time because everytime I attempt to play online (the way the game should be played), it'll last for 10-20 minutes before saying the connection has been lost and then returning me to the main menu.This was an issue in DS2, however on a very rare occasion and would never kick me back to the main menu. I love the co-op feature of the DS series and it's a big part of the game for me. I've played other online games and have no connectivity issues my end, just seems to be with DS3. (When I get kicked from the game due to connectivity, I'm still connected to the internet).Has anyone else had this issue? Or any fixes? I've looked all over on different forums and such and had no luck. So unfortunately I'll have to leave a negative review for this game as it does appear to be a common issue yet a huge lack of communication from the makers."
Negative,"invade spam, all the invaders are lagging and are immune to damage (wish i could teleport forwards and backwards), cant play with friends, cant refund, nothing but controller prompts, 0/10  only buy if your a solo lone wolf player with a controller and think telling people ""get gud, then you can have fun"" is the only option."
Negative,"Can't even start the game as it crashes during my character creation......what is this. My PC can handle every other game on high-ultra settings, yet this crashes for some reason when nothing is even happening on the screen. I'm almost ready for a refund since this game is unplayable at the moment. DO NOT BUY until they come out with a patch."
Negative,"2016, Still No Controller Support* Note *Maybe Support Some ControllerMine Was Razer Sabertooth"
Negative,This game is abandonware trash. You WILL GET YOUR SAVE CORRUPTED by some hacker trash who hates this game. You have been warned
Negative,Without multiplayer - co-op this game isnt worth it.
Negative,Too many hackers
Negative,"crashes like crazy if I have a shield equipped, time to get good I guess"
Negative,horrible pc ports
Negative,"This game is so broken right now it's ridiculous! i have tried all the ""tricks"" to get the game to work but it ALWAYS manages to un-sync itself and causes major framerate issues, if i wasn't suh a huge fan of this franchise I would have alread demanded a refund for my purchase."
Negative,"If you didn't like DS2 or the direction it was pushing the series, then you probably won't like this game much since it is like DS2, but functional, a bit more fun with more options available, and with more roots in the DS1 lore. I say this because while playing through DS2 and DS3, I saw a strong leaning toward artificial difficulty, meaning that random BS would kill unsuspecting players around almost every corner (it's not a funny surprise anymore when the third room in the same building has yet another enemy waiting on the left or right of the door), lots of enemies in a group, each with insane attack combos that can nearly instagib you while also sometimes being damage sponges, etc.I think a solid way to illustrate this is just the amount of mimics in this game compared to prior ones. In DS1 the first mimic you find is in Sen's Fortress, which is after you've beaten a few bosses and opened a few chests, that makes the discovery that this one chest is actually a monster a funny and shocking moment for the player that stays with them through the rest of the game. in DS3 there's a mimic in the very first area that you'll probably stumble upon within your first few runs into said area. Then later you meet another, and another, and another, with two even being a stone's throw from each other in the dungeons. Granted I never fell for any of them, but it was worrying to me when a fun and surprising part of the first game suddenly became so commonplace to the point where it was just an annoying nuisance. Now take what I said about mimics going from something unique, cool, and dangerous to something just annoying that feels like a ""gotcha"" moment, and apply it to groups of enemies, some bosses (though some are legit fun), some areas, and you'll see what I mean. I've 100%ed DS1 so I don't think it's a skill/perseverance issue, I just don't feel motivation to beat a game that throws needless junk at the player just because ""it's a dark souls game so that means you have to die a lot, even if it's from random bs"".I looked forward to this game for a long time but was unable to play it until recently since my old PC couldn't run it. Although im sure it's fun for a lot of people, It's too much like DS2 and not enough like DS1 for me to enjoy it, if you're like me then you'll probably agree after a few hours"
Negative,"Game as a game is pretty good, in terms of mechanics and such, Some enemies are quite simply disgusting to look at just based on what they are, so if you dislike bugs and creepy crawlies its bad, Multiplayer in the game is an absolute joke, you can summon other players to help you and do co-op stuff if you are embered, however you can also be invaded when embered, About 89 % of invaders are the worst people you have ever met, Most wear very meta armor and weapons, and they like to invade the starting area with endgame characters, In addition to this, you are unable to leave the area until the invader is dealt with, and they will very often run and hide for the sole purpose of ruining your day. In addition to this Hackers like to invade and put hacked items that you can't remove into your game, just by existing, and the company bans people for this and blames players for getting hacked by other players. The game in and of itself, not bad, But multiplayer is quite poor in its execution, and quite simply, the company has utterly failed to stop hackers at any point."
Negative,good game pog
Negative,60 fps cap
Negative,harder than getting a girlfreind
Negative,Banned for nothing xDDD this is a fucking joke picking up ember from stangers *1time* and invalid item *puff*  [YOUR ACCOUNT HAS BEEN `PENELIZED`]
Negative,"Fun is subjective, but I don't think my complaints are.So many of the enemies in this game are not worth fighting. This is a souls game, so you weigh how challenging the enemy is vs how many souls you get from it. That ratio is very bad in this game, however you can just run by/through most threats. That is not a fun way to play the game - for most people.In a souls game, the precedent they have set is: Bosses thrash you a couple times and you overcome them, the levels in between have sneaky bullshit that usually only works once. BUT, it's your opportunity to just beat down on some lil guys and get a little stronger while doing it as well as exploring the super cool and depressing world.In Dark Souls 3, the levels are stressful nonsense and the boss fights aren't much better. Many of the bosses have a gimmick or trick and once you learn that you can usually beat them pretty easily. Ideally, the boss is tough but fair and I persevere because I get better, not because I've memorized this boss's specific attack pattern that doesn't help me at all throughout the rest of the playthrough.Some other complaints:-Shields don't feel very effective as shields. Sure get their buff, but unless you're running a shield that absorbs a lot of damage, it will just give you a false sense of security. Many monsters have multi hit combos that just empty your stamina bar and leave you vulnerable, and that's just one monster, if there are multiple you're just boned. Rolling is king in DS3.-NPCs, not necessary for a normal playthrough for beating the game. However, some builds hinge on when you interact with them in the world. As you may recall, it's not fun to explore Dark Souls 3. There is a point of no return for some NPCs that become vendors that may make or break a build. You don't know what you're gonna find fun as a playstyle, but they do let you respec. However, point of no return. It's irksome at best.-Armor, what does it do? You can't buff it or upgrade it, you just get new armor. It can't be too heavy though else you lose the good roll. You could upgrade vitality, but that's a stupid stat, you want more damage or HP or endurance. It also doesn't help much in boss fights, Vigor/HP is a better investment. It does help against the mobs between bosses, unless you get combo'd or get ganged up on. Armor isn't satisfying.Edit: Poison Arrows are also trash. They were so much fun in 2 and helped with removing annoying enemies particularly casters. In DS3, anything you would want to use them against is likely immune or highly resistant against poison. Your best bet is to just run some upgraded bow and go for raw damage, more efficient.Really the presentation is very good. It's a good looking game that moves and handles really well. The content is lacking in most other areas."
Negative,"Really wanted to give this game a try. What a bad, annoying attempt at a console portation. Awkward controls, unplayable for me. PC controls not even displayed in tooltips - how hard can it be..If you dislike console portations, you will hate this game."
Negative,Game's bad cuz ur a bad trash nugget... Git gud kid
Negative,"Don't get for PC until fixes have been released.Use to work fine for me (to a point) but with latest set of patches game has become unplayable. Too many problems to count at the moment and game is completely unplayable now, with none of the online fixes working anymore."
Negative,"iam to old for this shit man. enemys flopping all over the screen while you panic rolling and cant even see yourself while doing so cause enemys are that big they occupie 90% of your screen. beware that you have to press one key 99% of the time in that game, its the dodge key, it may be broken after your playthrough. onehits and grabs from enemys you have to learn while you trial and error playing through anything, thats what you get here. learning stuff a few hundret hours til it gets fun maybe. wouldnt call that innovative gameplay. dark souls 1 formula was great and i put 1k hours into it, even replayed the remastered nowadays a few times. but anything else i bought from fromsoft since then felt just not fun. bloodborne, elden ring, dark souls 3... all of them overdoing the mainformula and imo the soulslike copys of other companys are better nowadays, they dont push it to far that it just becomes pure cancer. only good thing is i bought dark souls 3 on big sale. still should have just ordered 3 pizzas instead for more fun."
Negative,"For me it's unplayable since it freezes my entire pc for no reason every 2-5 min. Nothing seems to fix this issue. I tried reinstalling my drivers, my windows, formatting my hdd, clean windows/steam install, praying to God, playing offline, playing online, lowering setting, rising setting, nothing seems to work. I have a gtx 1080 stock and i7 6700k, 16gb RAM.THE ONLY FIX I have found to this mess is downloading a PIRATED version of the game!!!! The pirated game WORKS without problems, I was finally able to play and finish one of my favorite games of all time!The game is a masterpiece and a must have, BUT since it doesn't work (seems like I am not the only one), with regret and for the sake of all that is good and fair, I CANNOT recommend this game until it is fixed....Pitty actually, such an amazing game that gets everything right but the most important thing, allowing players to actually play it..."
Negative,don't like it

Negative,was banned for unknown reason and that was a while ago they dont tell you why you was banned and before people throw hate i wasnt cheating i just logged in one day and was banned not a clue why its a waste of money and a toxic company that bans players for no reason
Negative,I just don't understand why it's has too be so difficult....... i would love to play that game. I want to be able to choose the difficulty level.... so i spend 45$ and i am not going to play that game because it is to hard for me.... for me it's very simple: That game it is too hard to be enjoyable....
Negative,"I want to really like this game. and in all honesty. i would.If not for the insane number of crashes. Create a character, crash. manage to get a character made, fight the first boss: defeated and the game crashes immediately afterward. I can deal with losing in a game like this. but when the game crashes as soon as you die, robbing you of any chance to get the souls you lost. thats just unacceptable.I rarely give negative reviews. but FromSoftware. this is terrible. Fix the game, and ill change this."
Negative,Awesome game but nowhere near as well optimized as Dark Souls 2 was upon release. Struggling to play the game at 15-20 FPS. I won't touch it again until a fix is released.
Negative,f*** those stupid lorithian knights + transforming skeletons
Negative,"This may seem trivial to some, but do not play this game without a controller. The bindings on mouse and keyboard are convoluted, and there is a lot of delay for some reason. Hope this helps someone"
Negative,"A simplified Monster Hunter with added frustrations and more busy work.Very challenging.  Immersive if you’re into the grim edginess of the world. Combat feedback feels satisfying but the mechanics are ultimately basic.  Despite several weapons you’re really just learning one tactic, which is the roll timing (/parry timing if you’re better than me!), but I miss the variety of how weapons in something like MHW truly change the game you’re playing.I’m gonna see it through, but it inherently lacks joy. It prides itself on making you feel bad by punishing you for its own clunky controls, and then encourages the rest of the playerbase to make your time less enjoyable.  That might make the reward of success feel more personal for some, but I think it asks an ugly price to get to that moment.Other games will give you the same satisfaction of a hard fought accomplishment without asking for your soul in return"
Negative,"-Poise 404 not found.-The estus system is made to ♥♥♥♥ every mage in the ♥♥♥.(2x less estus if you want some blue flask actimel + 2x less again when summoned)-That first DLC is funny but once again is just a darksouls 1 ♥♥♥♥ sucker.-The pvp is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ted at some point, although you can still have some nice 3v3 with some peps, and there is a real matchmaking system now.-Magic, and Hex and anything like this is just put aside, you can NOT play proprely in pvp against good player, since the cast time is longer than in dark souls II and the character move faster, also the game wont let you trade and any weapon is just quicker than your cast, which lead almot always with you attacking first but still taking the damage, without finishing to send the spell. + Even if you can buff your mage to make him deal around 1000 damage with only one soul crystal spear, the other attack, for most of them are just a great joke, regarding the time it take to cast them, and the damage it deal, even with high level and improved catalyseur.-Weapons are unbalanced too, although it's getting patched pretty often ( => Darksword) some are still way too fast, for the damage they deal, which is kind of annoying when you try to play a correct mage (===> Not a ♥♥♥♥ing tank, just a mage with a normal HP bar)I still finished the game twice, with a swordmen, and then with a mage, but honnestly It's a shame the 2 was more balanced. So yé, maybe a part of the community did not like the II for some reasons, but at least that one was assuming his gameplay.( Powerstance, double click possible on a keyboard/mouse / Magic and Hex as a real part of the game / etc..)I apologiz for my english."

Negative,"Dark Souls is made for a very particular audience that I am not a member of. The game is excellent if you fall within the group of people that enjoy punishing games that you have to learn to beat through repetition. Personally, I come to games for interesting stories set in fantastical worlds. I'm not really interested in perfecting the skill of fighting in these kinds of games just for the sake of finishing the game. Dark Souls has an incredible world, but apparently you're going to have to sit and read the description of every item you find if you want to actually get a story, because DS doesn't really tell you one through gameplay. If you don't specifically seek out the story, it will just be a bunch of bosses interspersed with lower level enemies. They'll look incredible, but you'll have no idea why they exist or why they are important at all. The combat also uses input queuing, and you cannot interrupt animations at all. So if you start swinging your sword and see a monster attacking, you're screwed even if you could have reacted fast enough to dodge.If you're not a Dark Souls kinda person, this game has a great world but the experience of playing it is awful."
Negative,"Do NOT buy if you don't own an Xbox controller.As funny as it sounds, this PC GAME requires an XBOX controller to play. Trying to play on mouse and keyboard adds that much more difficulty to an already difficult game. All menu items are indicated using Xbox symbols. While playing the game, it'll ask you to press 'A' to interact. That means you'll have to press ESC and find the keybind that correlates to the 'A' button on the Xbox controller. Could they not just put the actual keybind on the interact symbol rather than having to match-up every 2 seconds?It doesn't make much sense to me -- this is the equivalent of releasing on PS4 while using Xbox symbols on interact/combat tooltips. The only reason this game has a positive rating is because the actual game is good. It's NOT good on PC.Again, do not buy if you do not own an Xbox controller."
Negative,"Disclaimer - This review is for the Multiplayer/PVP/Co-op Aspect of Dark Souls 3This is not a review of the main game as a whole as I would give that a recommended thumbs up.This thumbs down is for the Online PVP part as for April 19, 2016's build.Please read the entire thing to get a full understanding of where I'm coming from with this.I'm putting this review here as posting on the Discussion would most likely just get lost after mere minutes with how fast the board moves.--------------So to start off I'm not going to say the online is broken. It's not trash.It's unpolished.It has the potential using the foundations built from DS1 and DS2 to be good, but there are too many ""little things"" that add together to make the overall experience not very enjoyable at times to downright rage-inducing.The problem comes with the fact that the Host player when it comes to invasions has too much advantage among other thingsHost Advantage as people put it though the definition of what it implies changes from game to game.(Example - Host Advantage in Gears of War was the host having the best connection thus certain actions are quicker for them. If they shot an enemy at the same time the enemy shot them, their shot would register first, etc)In Dark Souls 3, the host has an arsenel of tricks they can use and it can become downright cheap where the odds lean so much in their favor they are guaranteed to win.The first main one is Password summoning.A host can summon a player regardless of level, NG cycle, and everything if they use a password. The game will summon them, and will downscale them in terms of damage dealt and damage recieved.This occurs a lot in low level areas (Example - Cruxifiction Woods) and while it does downscale a few aspects of them, it does not downscale anything else.These End Game summons will still be using their endgame gear, endgame weapons, endgame rings, and weild endgame miracles and spells. Thus having low level players wearing basic gear like Exile's armor and the Ice sword, fighting players in full Havel's armor, being able to dodge roll, and using a sword that can literally crack lightning down on the enemy player while being completely invisible and using +10 Estus Flasks with 7 chugs and healing miracles while the invader around this area will have a +3 Estus with 3 chugs.The host will have two of these decked out guys most likely, and you trying to fight them would be darn near impossible becauuseee...If you do manage to kill a summon, the host can then immediatly resummon them.And then the resummoned NPC will have full estus and it will begin again.Through experience I've encountered a few groups like this, preying on low level invaders who stand slim chance of even managing to kill one of these, and they will resummon over and over because there is no cool-down or limitations for it.And then, if by some chance you manage to kill both summons and are attacking the host, the host WILL disconnect, thus taking away victory.Course each time they kill someone, they get more Estus drinks thus allowing them to continue for even longer. (The extra drinks from kills is something I do not understand why they added... I'm assuming Bloodborne had something to do with it)So unlike DS1 and DS2, gankers become much more common now.But then let's talk about the Invader Factions.Invaders in Dark Souls 3 includeRosaria FingersMound MakersWolves of FaronAldrich's FaithfulIn games you can have up to 3 invaders depending on how many summons you got and so on, but the problem is... coupled with what I spoke of earlier, invaders also have to worry about each other.The host and his phantoms can communicate via mic chat, and don't damage each other.Invaders, even if they're in the same faction (Not counting Faron and Faithful) CAN damage each other, target each other and even kill each other.Rosaria Finger's gain no benefits from doing this, yet they still can kill each other.Mound Makers make a bit more sense in this department as any kill adds to their kill count and thus can add to victory.But here's the part that to me, makes zero sense.Multiple Wolves of Faron can invade a host. They are put into a party, shown as being on the same team, and can't damage each other.Yet they can not use Mic Chat.This, made zero sense to me as it feels like the Farron guys and Aldrich guys, being in the same party, would then be able to communicate and coordinate with their fellow covenent folks.Potentially overpowered summons with a massive pool of healing potential coupled with quick resummoning coupled with the fact groups of invaders can not coordinate an attack on a group of players since they have no way to communicate and their own attacks will be killing each other in battles as well as among the fact as well that the host can just easilly hit Alt-F4 and take victory when you're close to it makes invading not really fun at times despite it being a key aspect of the Dark Souls Franchise.To make matters worst, there is a growing number of save editors appearing in game that make victory impossible and thus all you can do is just black crystal out and try again.Even more, ingame there is an item called the ""Knight's Roster"" that serves the same functionality as the book of the guilty from Dark Souls 1, except shows contribution of Darkmoon players, that shows tons and tons of save edited characters with ingame links to their steam profile pages available on demand.Yet From Software and Valve do not seem to be doing anything about it.---------Overall, a few tweaks here and there could be made to make the online portion much more enjoyable for everyone, and here are just some ideas I've been thinking over.Now these are just my ideas and my opinion.First... I feel as if there should be ""summon slots"" for summoned phantoms. You have two slots, and if you use the cracked fingers you get a third otherwise you just have two.If a phantom occupying a slot dies, that slot gets a cool-down before another phantom can be summoned to occupy it.The time for the cooldown I am not sure what it should be, as too little would be redundent, but too much would mean the host has to escape an invader and chaos for who knows how long and that can feel like an eternity.I do feel however, even if all the slots have cool-downs, Blue Phantoms can still join and assist the host.This would give Blue Phantoms more to do as I've noticed a lot of people saying Blue Invasions are far and few between and I personally have noticed for some reason blue phantoms get summoned in the moment the host DIES. I have seen this happen after I've killed a host at least 6 times, and I've had the host be dead upon arrival as a blue phantom more often then being alive.I personally think the Blue Phantoms are an enjoyable covenent and one of the more fun and blood pumping groups as they finally get their time to shine after the horror they had to go through in Dark Souls 2...The other thing is, many games can detect if the opponent has disconnected.I feel as if the host disconnects it should be counted as a forfeit and automatically give any invaders the victory.The host lives sure, but the invader would still get their covenent item.Or possibly.... perhaps given an item unique to disconnections.Red Phantoms get Split-tongues by killing Blue Phantoms for example, so I feel like if a host disconnects, the invader should get an item that acts like a token to turn into your covenent, but can be turned into ANY covenent and count as one. However it would not count as a Contribution to the Darkmoon Covenent book, etc.Lastly, I feel as if the Farron Wolves and Alrich Faithful should be allowed mic chat if multiple are in one area.This has just been my 2 cents on Dark Souls's PVP.It's ""okay"", but it CAN get polished up a bit more."
Negative,"I can't even pass the first boss. It's too difficult, think twice when you buy this game. MHW is a much better game compared to this one"
Negative,fun challengning game but i got banned for no reason have never cheated i dont even have cheat engine installed on my pc and they still banned me
Negative,"Game needs to patched ASAP, don't buy the game at the current moment unless you're fine with losing 40 hours worth of gameplay in a split second."
Negative,Doesn't support ultrawide
Negative,"I have tried a few times to like this game, and I just don't.  I get no pleasure from clunky controls and dying over and over again in order to map out the area to clear it on the nth attempt.  I'm a grown adult with a job and a family, and I don't have time for that."
Negative,"Crashes.Not just your typical CTD - crash of the entire system. I have not seen game do this since at least WinXP games. From always made shitty PC ports, this one is no exception."
Negative,"Too easy, easiest fucking game."
Negative,this game is poop!!111!!! I run into the boss swing big sword and i die????????? how! its literally impossible!!!!!
Negative,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH KATANA MAN SO FUCKING DIFFICULT
Negative,"it's shit, just dont, save your money go buy the other 2"
Negative,"I think this video is a very good review of the game and it also mirrors the majority of my gripes with the game. Also: I think the game tries too hard to be a ""Best Of Soulsgames"" and often lacks its own specific identity.The game is still quite good if you like the soulsborne genre, but I think that DS3 is the weakest entry to the series. DS3 heavily resuses bosses and themes from previous games that people liked (Bloodborne, DS1) and most of the time you can instantly see the inspiration as soon as you encounter a new area. The final boss is literally and amalgamation of all previous players so literally a ""Best of Souls""-embodiment. It´s a shame that the game hasn´t taken more inspiration from DS2.I loved Powerstancing and Bonfire Ascetics. DS2 actually changed NG+. Also, DS2 runs at a crisp 60fps at all times while DS3 is much, much worse in that regard. Also, this game is too much bloodborne and not enough souls. Often bosses are straight out of Bloodborne, they move very fast and have unlimited stamina while you are confined to a slower pace that is more soulslike and combat is often frustrating because of that. these are a good writeups of this gripe: https://steamcommunity.com/app/374320/discussions/0/365163686085640733/https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/4hc01j/dark_souls_3_spammy_enemies_and_how_it_ruined_the/https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/4h3rk7/i_love_dsiii_but_i_feel_like_the_enemies_are/A lot of visual influences are taken straight from Bloodborne because people loved Bloodborne, but Dark Souls 3 is worse for it because it often feels like it tries to emulate what made Bloodborne so good without trying be its own thing. The DLC, on the other hand, is stellar. It is worth playing through the main game just to play the DLC."
Negative,This game is extremely frustrating.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone that doesn't have the patience of a saint.
Negative,the mobs are awful and can poise through most attacks everyone has poise but you
Negative,"This game feels so shitty to play now :( If you want PvE go play Sekiro, if you've already played sekiro IDK man wait for elden ring or play DKS 1 or even 2 this game will feel annoyingly unresponsive. I'm still gunna finish this playthrough but cheaters keep ruining my progress. 1/3 of my invasions today i've been invaded or invaded cheaters that gave me items directly into my inventory and destroyed my save file, which after the first one I had backed up but ya know that's not exactly a fun experience losing hours of progress because some knob decided to give me 420 hands feet and torso. If you manage to get PvP its mostly ganks(which can be fun or tiring depending on the aggression of the 3 man squad). The community seems to have adjusted to the invasion life but its still pretty empty,"
Negative,got banned for no reason
Negative,"Terrible camera, terrible explanation of mechanics, being obscure for the sake of being obscure. Some outright instances of terrible boss designs. Inconsistent mechanics."
Negative,TERRIBLE game play if you use keyboard/mouse.  Don't even attempt it IMO.
Negative,"unban my fkn account please, you are stopping me and my bro bro from playing together, ive spent way too much time and money to be permabanned for using dlc weapons to see if i want the dlc"
Negative,"it's a game known for being skill based with bosses which have ambiguous attack-hit-boxes, attacks that hit you through walls constantly, and dozens of beginner traps."
Negative,"Dark Rolls 3....The whole game engine is a asinine unbalanced mess. Iframes, hyperarmor, invulnerability animations. These are the headshaking concepts that you will have to wrap your head around to understand this games defense system. Its like they set out to build a game around a bad engine instead of building the engine around the concept of the game.To simplify you find out that armor does not act like armor and is mostly a waste to invest in, your invulnerable to attack when you roll even if blades are going right though your character, even the largest blades (yeah real hardcore right there) and most boss fights devolve into you rolling around like a tard and getting hits in when they are at the end of their animations.I do not see the appeal of this game at all. When I first picked this up I figured it would be a very hardcore game where armor acted like armor and was built around a solid base of down to earth concepts on fighting and combat. No no no its probably the biggest mess of abstract ideas I have ever seen. Most PVP fights are just people rolling around and chugging flasks, with some parrying while invulnerable thrown in. How is that real? How is that hardcore? Its like someone set out to build the most complex and yet ass-backwards combat engine possible.Basically to be good at this game is far less about skill and far more about knowing the inner brokenness of the game engine its built on and the laziness of the developers. rolling your massive body with giant sword 2+meters takes less stamina then blocking a attack from a similar sized opponent with a shield as tall as a man. you can roll faster then a man can run, and can actually lose less stamina rolling then you can chasing the guy rolling away. its just silly. I could go on and on about the little messed up things this game does in combat that make little to no sense for a world set in medieval warfare I see 2 large armies fighting against each other by rolling around right through sword blades and taking no damage. From the reading I have done apparently little has changed in its combat since dark souls 1. So what I'm being told is that this game has improved in no way since the original? They did not update their games core concept with a better engine or new technology? Wow that's COD levels of stupid...Sorry to hate on your game I know a lot of people love this thing, but I don't see myself playing a new game + or putting any more time into this game, its just not worthwhile. I would not recommend it to someone else not because of any difficulty of the game but because its convoluted combat system makes no practical sense and is such a waste of what is a beautiful world and game."
Negative,"TLDR: 6/10, needs a hell of a lot of bug-fixes, Praise the Sun!          Sound: 9/10 Estus          Graphics: 8/10, if only i could be so grossly incandescent.          Controls: 8/10, poise is important!!!          Gameplay: 0/10, shame on you FromSoftware, your game sucks until its bugs get fixed!Well, this game basically sucks pretty damn hard right now...besides looking pretty good, it has several other sweet features, like crashing about every 10-15minutes, dropping its framerate every now and then, aswell as dogs that jump through walls, pvp versus invincible dudes (they dont move, they dont take damage, you just fight them like 5 minutes and then suddenly take 1 hit that immediately kills you), etc.At least it is really difficult, it is way harder than DS1 and 2, but the way it ramps up its difficulty is somewhat questionable, i played the knight, the pyro and the sorcerer and found that the >first boss< was by far stronger than the 2nd one, but thats kinda fine, if everyone who bought the game right away is an experienced souls player.Beginners might love the Knight, because he's somewhat op right away, but other classes, like the sorcerer or thief, well they just suck for quiet a while, until you leveled up a bit.The Bosses on the other hand, have a quiet nice design, all of the feel different and are challanging, but not unbeatable.For the Lore you ask? Well, the story i've experienced so far was told in a really straight-forward way, NPCs tell you what might await you in your near future and almost every new enemy-type is first presented in a one on one kind of scenario.By the way, this games music is just .... gorgeous... even if its rather quiet most of the time, the 2nd Boss for example has some epic choirs singing in the background... i luv it!"
Negative,"For a game that is bundled with the Steam Controller, you'd expect it to actually work with it. The face buttons (A, B, X, Y) are not detected, and I can't get it working with keyboard controls either, so it's literally unplayable in its present state."
Negative,"This one didn't do it for me. I prefered DS1 and DS2. Too linear for me. And also I hate the enemy patterns, just can't read any of it, it just feels cheap or murky. Maybe I have to git gud more, but I just feel the enemy animation or readibility is not as good as DS 1 or 2."
Negative,Is there anything From does that's not breaking their own fucking games? Oh and FUCK YOUR TWINSWORDS I don't wait for you to apply your damn buffs fuck that
Negative,gwyndolin isn't in this game
Negative,"One of the laziest ports i have ever seen.All button prompts are from the xbox, which makes everything a chore for a keyboard/mouse player.Refunded"
Negative,"if u buy, you cry, do not buy, you shall die"
Negative,*laughs in point down*
Negative,"This game is stupidly un-optimized for PC. It won't even tell you the keybinds for mouse and keyboard and the only way to change that is to install mods from a site that doesn't exist anymore. Not just that, but if you want to try and make this incredibly newcomer-unfriendly game any more bearable (by for example installing mods that display the correct keybinds), you just can't play the game anymore because the devs nuked all mods with an update.Would have loved to play it, especially for the story and lore, but I'm done.Stay clear if you're on PC."
Negative,WOrst game i have played lost my sanity too easy game and if u buy this remember that u r part of turreysm and u r mentally insane from this point forward.0/5
Negative,"TBH, Dark Souls 3 has lots of problems: you can be trapped by curdely made setting details such as the projection of a wall; your enemies don't really hurt their friends or have their big weapons bounced back while swinging it to a wall. I do not intend to list all of the problems out but i do want to say that many of the problems existed in the previous(including BLOODBORNE)games and should be fixed already. I know that many of the players, good or bad, take problems like that as something normal, which is not at all. As a indirect result, game makers stopped correcting their wrongs. I think a hardcore game should really have hardcore, strict, detailed settings that can be fair for both the players and the enemies. This might sounds bad but Dsouls 3 is fucked up since the makers thought hardcore games are all about a lot of traps and badass enemies instead of forcing players to play not only carefully but also tactically.PS:King of Storms is one of the worst bosses ever, the boss fight is really boring and meaninglessly dilatory6/10"
Negative,"This game made my PC crash so hard it made me reboot it. I will not recommend it to anyone until something is done about it.What on earth is wrong with this world when the launch of Dark Souls 3 is more unstable than the original Dark Souls release? What happened here? The release of DS2 was smooth like butter, and now we go back to grinding stones together?This is unnaceptable. No ""soft fix"" is agreeable at this point - we all paid full price for this. I -will- edit this when the problem is fixed, if it is ever fixed, because I know there's a good game buried under this Blighttown."
Negative,Worst online ever can't enjoy the game with a friend unless some idiot coming in and killing us.
Negative,"There was a game here, it's gone now"
Negative,5 / 10 | PC Version has too many Hackers PVP | PVE is boring and grindfest for souls | Everything costs too much souls or too litte
Negative,"if you like getting gang banged by 2 or more big ahh mfs at once in every boss fight, this game is for u"
Negative,Had to return this. The game is unplayable and laggy.
Negative,Puny version of first Dark Souls
Negative,Abyssmally poor consoleport.
Negative,"They didn't even bothered to write proper command names on the pc version... Games for consoles should stay for consoles, lesson learned"
Negative,"From disabled poise breaking half of peoples builds, making it easier for pvp players to wreak your game, hackers getting others banned and From wont do anything for those players. Save yourself some trouble and get the first one or dont bother."
Negative,"*Update March 2020!*In addition to everything bad I've had to say already, erroneous account penalties and false-flagging continues to run out of control. If you, for any reason, lose internet connection during an online session and attempt to log back into the server, DS3's anti-cheat software will flag your account as having ""hacked data"" and permanently quarantine you from online play. There is no fix for this, no reliable workaround (using family sharing will risk getting the account you share to banned as well), and Bandai refuses to address the issue. Bandai has made sure that even attempting to enjoy the game as a multiplayer experience is a frustrating and disappointing experience.This is a pretty unfortunate end for what would otherwise be one of the all-time greatest dark fantasy franchises in video game history.Dark Souls 3 is disappointing. The new features which have been added (the MP meter, new poise calculations, special weapon attacks) only serve to highlight flaws in the gameplay. To spite going far out of the way to constantly remind players of Dark Souls 1, it fails to grow beyond many of the most frustrating and clumsy mistakes of the previous installments. What makes this perhaps worse is that many of the game systems which were abandoned (DS1's bonfire kindling DS2's power-stance and more refined statistic scaling, Bloodborne's Rally and more focussed weapon selection) are exactly what could have saved Dark Souls 3 from being the weak child of a strong family.Even judged entirely on its own, Dark Souls 3 still doesn't have very well designed gameplay. Movement is generally very sluggish, and even without any armor there is a very noticable delay between the button press and the beginning of an evasive roll. Timing windows on attacks in general seem to be out of synch with the animations (to an even more severe and confusing degree than Dark Souls 2, but for different reasons). This results in a lot of incidental damage from partially dodged attacks, failed parries, and enemies which are prohibitively difficult to stagger.Gone, also, are healing items other than the Estus flask. This is compounded by the addition of what amounts to an MP meter, which means that if you'll want to cast any spells you'll need to reassign some of your already finite healing flasks to MP flasks. Without the ""Rally"" mechanic of Bloodborne or the ability for enemies to drop more healing flasks, the frustration of dealing with even normal enemies is needlessly high.Demons' Souls, Dark Souls, and Bloodborne have never been famous for having a forgiving difficulty level, but what makes Dark Souls 3 disappointing isn't an issue of level design, learning curve, or enemy placement. The world design is the real let down.Most of the enemies and locations are heavily recycled. Very few of the bosses are not just ""a harder version of"" a boss battle from one of the other games. A number of the levels are just the ""winter"" versions of an area from either Dark Souls 1 or 2.Being that the community has already decided Dark Souls 3 is ""the best game in the series,"" one negative review isn't going to make a great deal of difference in the long run. Regardless of how well articulated or thought out, negative Steam reviews for Dark Souls 3 inevitably get voted down. But there is a statistic I can quote that helps illustrate my point.At time of writing, only 80% of the people who own the game have cleared the boss of the tutorial. Less than 50% have reached what is about the mid-way point. Less than 25% have finished the final boss.Dark Souls 1 and 2 have been available for much longer, and an even *smaller* percentage of players have reached these milestones on Steam.An estimated half of the people who insist Dark Souls 3 is the ""best game in the series"" have given up before the halfway point of all three games. Do with that information what you will."
Negative,This is the game ever made
Negative,"This is a solid game, but I leave it feeling frustrated as opposed to relaxed and refreshed, which games should be right?Just not my cup of tea."
Negative,"This review is for those having a hard time decide between PC and console versions of the gameAs a die hard fan of the Souls games (I've played Demon Souls, DS 1, 2, 3, Bloodborne), I would like to say that Dark Souls 3 is another great addition to the Soul's family. However, I would highly suggest purchasing the game for a console, instead of a PC.The PC is riddled with 3 major problems1. Hackers2. Illegitimate players (people gaining access to the game through illegitimate means (hint: pie rates(means hackers = impossible to rid of))3. Poor optimization (as with most Bandai Namco PC port).If you are a player that does not mind playing with hackers, having hackers join your game and one shot a boss, or having an invincible player join your game and destroy you in one hit/annoying you but not wanting to kill you/spawning mobs in your game, then PC is the gaming platform for you.I can definitely say that if I knew that the PC version of the game would have these problems, I would have purchased Dark Souls 3 for my PS4, so that I would not have had my gaming experience with Dark Souls 3 hindered by these avoidable circumstances.If you'd like to play Dark Souls 3 legit and enjoy it without having people ruin the experience for you, then you may want to consider console as an option (for those that have one)."
Negative,"On it's surface, Dark souls 3 seems like the best game in the series.  The animations are pretty, the enemies look badass, and the gameplay is smoother. Pros:-Best looking souls game, despite the fact that every zone is dark and gloomy-Faster gameplay.-some seriously badass bosses-special moves-soul memory is gone-armor doesn't need to be upgraded, thus you avoid wasting huge amounts of materials just trying things onCons:-The most broken multiplayer connectivity that I've seen in any game.  There were weeks where 100% of co-op and invasions created an animation glitch, making multiple players or even a boss invulnerable-Challenges are overcome through memorization after losses, not skill or effort.-zero variety in environments.  Sure, there may be a swamp and a castle over of cliff, but everything is a greyscale, nighttime gloomfest of spooky zombie creatures.  At least Dark souls 2 had areas like Heides tower of Flame and Dragon Aerie-The amount of viable weapons is a joke at best.  90% of the weapons are worthless, no matter how cool they are. -poise is disabled/non-functional.  This issue has been blown off multiple times.-This is the first souls game where I don't feel a sense of accomplishment after beating an area or boss.  I wish I could describe why, but it may be a symptom of the rest of the cons.-patch notes don't give enough information-the community hates negative feedback, no matter how valid.  Be prepared to have all complaints on all forums buried-I tried to refund for the broken online play, but was over the 2 hour mark.  However, you probably won't ever encounter online play until well after 2 hours into the game, therefore nobody can get a refund for the thing that is broken-the game devolves into rolling spam and weak attacks.  This is not new to the souls series, but it is the worst it has ever been in Dark Souls 3, especially with the broken poiseThe game is badass on the surface and a disappointment at its core."
Negative,this game sucked but then i installed a mod that made me 2B and it was awesomerecommended if you do that
Negative,No that's it no
Negative,You need a controller for this. Binding keyboard is just hopeless and not worth the hassle. Half of the key wont bind. Refunded
Negative,"I love DS1I enjoyed DS2Souls-Likes might be my favorite genre of gamesI can't stand DS3. It's not only boring as hell, but it's also annoying. Enemies gang up on you and there's little you can do about it.I've tried playing this game on 4 or 5 separate occasions and I just wind up uninstalling due to being so dissatisfied."
Negative,"Game very poorly optimized for the PC, hate playing it."
Negative,"For a game that's been hyped up so much, I can't understand why I feel like I'm being punished for playing this on keyboard and mouse as opposed to console controller. Disappointment."
Negative,"Multiple bugs causing the game to crash, in about 10 minutes mine crashed 4 times. Unplayable until fixed."
Negative,"It took me a little bit to realize it, but this game isn't very fun. The bosses are cool I guess."
Negative,fuc blu gril
Negative,Character creation was poorly optimized. Game freeze for no reason after playing for half an hour. (Never happend with DS1/DS2 on my PC). Stutter occasionally (more noticable than DS2). I'm using i7-4970K Ram 8 GB GTX970 Windows 7 64bits play at 1920x1080 Max Settings.Edit:13/05/2016New patch => Higher stutter rate WTF!!! Keep stutter every few minutes !!!
Negative,"This game is alot of fun. Pleasant to look at and very engaging. I can't speak for everyone who plays, but I personally find the pvp enjoyable. Unfortunately, there is alot of hackers / griefers in the community.  Hackers that have a broad horizon from simply joining your game, floating in the air as a dark spirit and cosplaying as certain characters (Personally seen hackers come into my world as Solaire, and I admit it was funny) to straight griefing. Hackers are a dime a dozen, and most have nothing better to do.  Half the amount of time i put in this game has been spent in an area called Anor Londo, either invading or defending from dark spirits. I'm sure everyone has different ways they get enjoyment out of this particular game, let it be invading, helping other players as a phantom, killing bosses, fending off dark spirits, etc.  This particular area, Anor Londo, is where I spend majority of my time playing. It is also where I experience the most dark spirits, and the most hackers. I've had the same hacker invade my world every time I've played, for the past month. His steam profile would change, but not his dark souls name. I've played with some friends in the same area (Anor Londo), Who would have hackers join their game, and kill the area's boss so my friends would be unable to pvp in said area until they replay the game (basically, grind just to get back to the same level, which is more hours spent for no reason other then a hacker wanted to be a dick).  If you choose to play this game for the pve; With your friends who want a challenge, or just by yourself, it is great.  If you choose to play this game for pvp; I cannot recommend purchasing this game for just that one element. Hackers are a good majority here, and they will make it a goal to grief you. A great way to waste your time & money.This is probably the one game i would recommend on the console soley due to the hacking being out of control on the pc."
Negative,"Everything good and bad about DS2 has returned.Some days, I can't go 5 minutes without being invaded. To make things worse, a lot of the time they are invisible or have no animations at all, so you're hit by invisible attacks. (I have FIOS and the connection is always perfect except during tornados). Didn't DS2 have a 30 minute timer for invasions? Apparently gone.Some of the game is not even fixed yet, but they ""balanced"" great sword damage already. Medium and High level lighting in graphics options crashes people at the bonfire, and the setting for that is shared with shadows, so it resets that setting each time you log in.Blue Sentinels and other ""cop"" covenants don't work, or rarely work.Remove the ""enhanced"" pvp where the worst connection wins and cracked red eye orbs are common as peanuts, and FIX YOUR CRAP, and this would of been a great game."
Negative,worse than bloodborne
Negative,no rat boss
Negative,Dark Souls 3: Legacy Of CheatsOnly on PC
Negative,"I want to love this game, but the game doesnt love me, other players, or even itself.With a lot of the weapons, you can feel the sheer lack of creativity, the lack to make a fancy moveset that feels good and functions good like weve seen in many other previous installments such as a lot of Dark Souls 1 as well as Dark Souls 2s dlc weapons. This game lacks polish and origonal design, alot being borrowed from other games.The crucified ogres in the crucifixion woods use Father Gascoins moveset from Bloodborne, most enemies weve seen before or seen variations of before as well.Movesets feel really bad in a lot of cases, they feel rushed and underdeveloped as if someone really didnt care too much when making them for a lot of weapons, very limp.I got this same type of feeling when I played Dark Souls 2, alot of weapons felt ""floaty"" and rather unsatasfying. You could call it rose tinted glasses but weapons in Dark Souls 1 felt better, and even Demons Souls. Dark Souls 3 focuses more on giving you nostalgia than trying to wow you with creativity. One of the most creative areas of the game is Lothric Castle, the first and one of the last areas was one of those few creative areas I felt good about. Dark Souls 3s level design feels rather unappealing in a lot of ways but is generally okay, there couldve been more love and creativity in a lot of areas and I feel like they really didnt try to get crazy. The Catacombs are the catacombs, the demon ruins are the demon ruins, anor londo is anor londo, undead settlement is bloodborne. I can feel the lack of fun and the more pressure being put on them by Bamco.The game is filled with untested or generally missing mechanics, hyper armor is finnicky on a lot of weapons and poise is 100% absent, people keep testing to find out what it does and so far every single one has been disproven. Some enemies and some areas are flatout ruined by this missing poise, the fire breathed from a dragon staggers you every quarter of a second, enemies like the Thrall are scarier than some bosses too.You can mash your way through this game with r1 where as in Dark Souls 1, you could still do that but id be confident in saying its harder to do, even if you stacked defense and poise. People are afraid of poise returning to dark souls 3 but they forget that the backstab issues from dark souls 1 are fixed in this game and those issues wouldnt return, the stunlocks are gone and wont return as well.Now this just makes it all feel worse on top of everything ive listed.There is so much cut content from this game that im absolutely certain is going to be pushed into dlc, saved by bamco for extra dlc money. Youve got finished weapons, finished armor, all with stats and descriptions too. Im amazed at the lack of UNFINISHED cut content in the game.Maybe the DLCs will be better with Bamco taking a step back away from the pushed release date, but as it stands right now I dont think this game is worth buying and playing and I myself will be stopping until the DLCs release and even then, if the game still isnt fixed I might not come back for a year or so to see if any of the actual game mechanical issues get fixed.I played a lot of Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 2 and Dark Souls 3, ive played Demon Souls and I have not yet played Bloodborne to my own distress. I can confidently say this game is not very good at its current state and itll be a good long while before that changes, as I have said above.Thank you for reading and I hope you can understand my point of view.Responce to Lazbot:Ill answer your questions one by one.I got 355 hours of entertainment out of the game for 60 dollars, but much of that was trying to see if its my fault I am not enjoying it or if its the games fault, you cant know until you sink time into it. Alot of the replayability comes from the PvP and its a shame that the PvP is so horribly done this time around that it barely feels like Dark Souls at all.I dont think the hours I put in warrants a reccomendation because had I known the game would still not be balanced at the time of writing this right now, I would not have sunk all that time into the game in the first place. My review is targeted at both audiences since, if a new souls player isnt interested in the PvP, hes better off playing Dark Souls 1 since its a more challenging and, in my opinion, a better designed game. The world design is so much more intertwined and strung together geniously, and while the game is a technical mess being one of the worst optimized games ive ever played on PC, I still dont mind it.I honestly do regret buying this game because I bought the deluxe season pass edition and im hoping that, much like Dark Souls 2, the DLC can really save this game.I wasnt expecting complete originality but there are so many little cool ideas in this game that it amazes me that they couldnt do more, and if they were going to recycle old things from the old games, the least they couldve done is do it well. The Ithirial Dungeon is the Tower of Lyriat from demon souls without the charm, atmosphere or interesting setting. I also would have liked to see a connected world without teleports much like DS1. That was always something I liked best about Dark Souls 1, no warp until youre done with Anor Londo and even when you get the warp, you still cant warp to every bonfire in the game, you still have to walk SOME places.I dont think its expecting too much to have a balanced game, I can see way too many design flaws that, if I had the coding experience, the time, and the oppertunity, I could fix. Im trying to learn a lot about game design and balance so I can one day have the chance to actually work on games like this and fix their problems. I dont think its expecting too much for the Poise stat to actually work or at least change the description of it to actually say what it does."
Negative,Fuck you Loner and your poise
Negative,Not as hard as the first one and i felt like i replayed the scenery from the 2 other games...
Negative,FIX THE FUCKING CAMERA . Its auto folowing some NPCs even if the assist if OFF . it was perfect in DS 2 and now its garbage ? FIX IT
Negative,While the game is fun. ITS ANTI-CHEAT IS RETARTED. All you do to get banned is play offline that's all you need to do to get banned.
Negative,"Servers are down for a week;From software never really cared about cheaters and exploits for years, and the only reason for them to be so adamant in fixing this right now is because someone made a really serious exploit public. Their laziness in fixing extremely easy exploits has come back to haunt them and its poetic."
Negative,"Cheapest enemy encounters in history of gaming. But biggest shortcoming besides stupid stamina managment and slow ass repetitiveness after dying again and again while trying to collect your souls or make progress, are the controller controls. The game is a clusterfukk to play and navigate through its menus. I feel crippled right from the start and the pain never ends switching between items and weapons on the fly while watching creeps doing broken attack pattern and ganging up on me from all around the corners, from behind trees and up on the ceiling there are. fukk you!Oh yes i forgot all the builds of Characters u could do. Awesome, eh!? WRONG, because all the game wants from you is to become the fukking Monkey King of Lordran rolling around the place to impress your toxic PVP buddies. fukk your Iframes, fukk your memes, fukk you toxic kids and fukk you Dark Souls!"
Negative,"Cheaters ruin the experience, but developers seems to do nothing about it. The game itself is fun though."
Negative,It's really bad for PC
Negative,Too many enemies use the stock Hollywood zombie sounds.
Negative,A PC game with hints just for a controller. I do not have one. It is an absolutely terrible experience to be looking up the keyboard bindings in the menu all the time.
Negative,The tips for the controls are absolutely idiotic for a PC game. It is really lazy programming to give controller symbols tips for a keyboard+mouse setup.
Negative,If you prefer to play with a keyboard and mouse dont get this game. I love the Dark Souls games but even Dark Souls 2 had better controls than this one. Even key instructions are displayed using X-Box controller configurations when you are using a keyboard making it impossible to figure out how to perform moves except through trial and error. To top it off you cant even change keybindings...
Negative,"I wouldnt recomend this game right now.Why because it costs nearly 90,- and than the PC implementation is realy realy Bad if i buy a Game which has such an High price than the PC implenentation should be finished.I dont want to se my Moves Explained with Controller Buttons i mean i am playing on a PC and it is a PC VERSION so it should show the buttons on your keyboard and Mouse. If that would be fixed it would be a good game."
Negative,"The lore is a mashed together mess, it doesn't really add anything significant and relies too heavily on ""Hey remember this from Dark Souls 1?"" or ""This item from Dark Souls 2 is here because uhhhh time is fucked up and the world is ending""The combat is boring and easy. You just use you 10k iframes roll to dodge any attack in the game, which you have to do since they pretty much killed off poise so that the shitty weapon arts could have a function in the game. Magic is nowhere near as fun as it was in previous games, and if you want to do a pure mage build, say goodbye to healing items.The pvp is an awful R1 spam mess with worse net code than Dark Souls 2, and even when you do get an invasion with a decent connection, you will undoubtedly be up again a host with 2-3 phantoms all with a seemingly infinite supply of estus.Overall this game is an overrated piece of trash, and honestly so is the community surrounding this game."
Negative,"A lazy PC port. Buttons are not even changed from the XBOX controller. ""Press A or B"" Hold R2 for strong attack, stuff like that. Cant really speak for the rest of the game, but if they cant be arsed to do a proper port its not worth my time either."
Negative,"So i can't recover souls because of a glitch where i was in the ladder tower in anor londo, hit the switch to go down and was summoned for an aldrich covenant invasion and when i spawned back into my world i fell from where the tower was initially and now i see no reason to even play this any more. Like i damn near want a refund because of this but i know i won't get one and i know from wont ever see this or give a rat's ass. This is some bullshit bye bye over 700k souls at once.I'm salty as fuck, how was this not patched?"
Negative,"This game sucks so bad, black holes are suing for copyright infringement"
Negative,"While I don't think this game isn't worth your time, I can't help but feel like the souls series has gone down in quality since Dark Souls 2. (Excluding Bloodborne)"
Negative,"pretty unplayable with keyboard and mouse, very lazily ported."
Negative,I draw the line at games that cause me physical injury.
Negative,"Worst anti-cheat detection on Steam, and no support to help you get your legit account back online even after a false multiplayer ban. Glad to say I'm not buying another FROM SOFTWARE game after this sham."
Negative,wheres Sean Murphys bean?
Negative,"Fuck this game(7 Hours later)Fuck this game more(33 Hours later)Nameless king can suck my balls(62 Hours Later)Ursurpation of Fire, Blade of the Darkmoon, and Mound makers can suck my balls(8 Hours Later)Mound Makers can lick my big tairy hesticles(idk anymore)i should have never killed yuria"
Negative,"I can understand why so many people are having issues with the PC port of the game. I am pulling off 60 fps @ 4k, but as a result, my computer is being pushed pretty hard. My PC is running from 70-80 degrees, and I have never come across another game that makes my computer this hot. It still doesn't look THAT great... so yeah. Kind of dissapointed in the port. Still, this is a great game! Just going to wait for a patch."
Negative,"Gonna commit one of my regularly scheduled blasphemies real quick.Dark souls 3 is the worst dark souls. If you are interested in hearing why and maybe are the 1% of people who never played it, read along. (And if you don't mind massive text walls)To begin, I have to show a statistic. Dark souls 2 sold 2 million copies. Dark souls 3 sold 10 million copies. There really is no question dark souls three sold VASTLY more copies than both of the previous games combined (before the remasters) Why is this important?Simple. The vast majority of the people who played (And praised) Dark souls 3 never played a dark souls before it. This leads to them having no basis as to what the game should be. Surf any forum on the game and you will find that every flaw the game has is construed as an intended feature by a legion of people who think they are experts on the souls series for playing the most popular game. This is not an irregular occurence either, super popular sequels suffer from this kind of self-affirming echo chamber pretty regularly. Even super successful games with no sequels such as say, Cruelty squad, get this problem. To put the problem in words, ""Armor is bad because you arent supposed to use it"" ""Magic is bad because its a melee game bro"" ""You were meant to play the game naked""Continuing the cruelty squad analogy, that game recieved a patch that broke armor values. They simply dont work. It has not been fixed. Ask why, and people will spew out this idea that it was on purpose, a sort of symbol that armor is not how you are SUPPOSED to play. This same echo chamber mentality exists with the community of people who only played Dark souls 3. Every flaw in the game is interpreted as an artistic design decision meant to punish players for wrongthink.Now, if you can step outside of this box for a second, ask yourself, if you played say, a CoD title and picked up an AK, and upon firing it, found it did no damage at all. Would you consider it a screw up, a balance issue, or the incredible manifestation of some genius dev's artistic vision? ...Duh, right? But because so many people played DS3 first and wanted to be in the know about a popular game (Gotta be up to date with the fad) You couldnt say anything wrong about it. Same as the initial launch of say, Fallout 4. People wanted it, people got it, new people thought it was the best thing ever because they had no comparison point, now it's generally recognized as the modern series worst entry. Couple this with ideas such as the concept that getting turned invincible for dodging is somehow more skillful than trying to use a shield and stamina effectively (And everyone wants to be skilled, of course) and you get what we have now.I have babbled a lot on why this game is often heralded as the best souls game, but I haven't yet talked about what is wrong with it. Put it simple, outside of the fact the game is gorgeous, Dark souls 3 is incredibly shallow. Magic, heavy armor, great weapons, bows/crossbows, any non-medium/light build has been nerfed with a sledgehammer compared to its dark souls 1/2 iterations. People complained about magic, and they got what they wanted. Dark souls 3 introduced limited non-regenerating mana, that you have to sacrifice your health source for, and magic as a whole might as well be useless outside of specific PvE encounters where it can help to cheese stuff. Heavy armor and poise do almost literally nothing other than make you fatroll, and since rolling grants you total invincibility for multiple frames, and lighter rolls more of them, you can see why any build that harms the ability to roll cannot be used seriously. The devs seem to have decided at some point that they wanted to do bosses more like bloodborne which reward you for being aggressive with your dodges, but at the same time did not give the players the same boosts bloodborne did to allow that. The camera when you press up to a boss makes it nearly impossible to predict their next move so you can time a dodge, but you have to be aggressive because the devs wanted you to because it earned Bloodborne praise (For reference, in older souls titles the battle premise was usually to attack then dodge AWAY, not INTO the targets) This system being forced onto enemies that are reused from games not meant to have it causes an enormous amount of pain to players who are trying to fight a reskin of the first boss from dark souls (Asylum demon) in a game that has forcefully taught them to be very aggressive. This works poorly because that same boss, which uses its same moveset from dark souls 1, was designed to PUNISH players for being too aggressive. See the issue?The total focus on one playstyle coupled with the aggressive lean leads to a very shallow gameplay loop. Attack, dodge dodge, attack, if you mistime a dodge or misinterpret the attack the foe is doing (cuz yer camera is usually up their rectum and that makes it hard to see) then you dodge away to heal, then dodge in. Dodge, attack, heal, repeat. It is as shallow as it gets. That is not to say that the previous titles didnt include that, but build variety allowed players to add their own steps to the loop. In 3 doing so is almost always only going to reduce your efficiency.The NPC character interactions are extremely easy to break, which can screw the whole run just by talking to a character before you open a specific door. The game is hyper linear, whereas the first two were very open. Enemy AI is still pitifully dumb, glitches and exploits that have never been fixed abound and make common shows in PVP. The game is literally in a state where its servers are offline because the weird punish-you-for-coop invasion system is literally so unchecked that people were able to join your game and reset you to the beginning of the playthrough. Modders have made anticheat for this game, From soft. will not do it. For all of that ranting, I concede that dark souls 3 is a gorgeous game. The art direction and the work behind it show through in every enemy, every area, and every piece of equipment. It is fantastic. But that being said, dark souls 3 is a souls game telling the same story that has been told for 2 games now, you need to go light the magic fire for reasons. Takes place in the same environments, with many of the same foes. So at the end of the day, you end up playing a Very pretty, but linear dark souls 1 that has no build variety outside of medium/light armor and melee weapons. Standing alone, dark souls three would have been an absolutely fantastic first entry in the series, and since it was that first entry for many people, it was well received. But for those who did play the first two before it, everything outside of graphics feels like a pretty heavy downgrade. As players we have got to realize that if we praise bad game design, howl at people who point out flaws, and hold up flawed games as icons of perfection, that we are going to get more flawed, bad games because we are giving positive feedback to negative things. We are the positive reinforcement for teams of developers, if we give a thumbs up to mistakes, oversights, or whatever, they cannot be blamed for repeating those errors. It is our fault."
Negative,Wouldn't spend 5 minutes on this game.
Negative,"Seriously, that's such a shame. The game is great, i did it solo on PS4, out of online, and i had a good feeling on the gameplay. The main issue is the online system... My experience got so ruined by trying to play coop... It makes no sense. Such a waste. First you can't easy connect to your friend (shitty ember system...) but OK. I accept it and play by the rules, having to do TWICE the same area. And not being able to come back with a mate after doing it both of you... It's already annoying. And with that, you have invasion... Ok it's nice having challenge, but it make no sense. You have HL hacker that come to pick you non stop, one shooting you. So all you can do is go ALT F4 to avoid those, that kill you and get you to stop your coop. So fun when ALT F4 is the only way to save yourself...Seriously WTF !!! Give us a good coop !!! That shit ruins the experience !!! I never got so much angry at a game, because it has such a good gameplay, but so shitty system. It's like a billionair that would shoot himself in the head !!! DO SOMETHING !! Give the people who just wanna enjoy the adventure a NORMAL COOP SYSTEM ( i connect to my friend and we move together normaly) !!!!!!!!!!!!!! I beat the game once. It's not a ""difficulty"" affair. It's just a shitty system that ruined my experience of the game and the one of my friend i wanted to initiate to the franchise. How am i supposed to make my friend like Dark Soul without a proper coop mode, with permanent invasion of HL player that OTK you, needing to do twice each area, not being able to come back inside with your friend so the result is each one of us wander alone when backtrack is needed.... I never got so pissed off at a game damm, and for the wrong reason. Game is very good. Multiplayer system is the worst EVER. And i am not even talking about the FPS drop issue... Anyway : that's my warning ---) If you want this game for multiplayer --) DONT BUY IT !!! else it's ok.At least until we get some new multi coop system. Or a mod...So sad, so much potential wasted."
Negative,Git Gud casul

Negative,ikyge9sadirfadsidsa9i 9i harddd
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 is very good; but a very small/short game. The PVP is good, and the bosses themselves are somewhat difficult. Though, this is artificial; as most of them use some form of automatic tracking system; easily visible by trying to side-step a bosses' attack. If it lacked the auto-tracking attack system, it would be best game ever."
Negative,"As amazing as my first impression has been, I flatly refuse to recommend this game while the damn tutorial and all the key prompts for the STEAM VERSION of this game are those of a fucking XBOX CONTROLLER with no apparent way to change it! If you can make a game like this, you can fix an issue like that, sort it the fuck out!"
Negative,10/10 would play again
Negative,HORRIBLE GAME. (no sex)
Negative,I enjoyed parts of the game but the hit boxes and just the over all combat gameplay is so frustrating that I can not recommend.
Negative,Still can't fathom why you need a shield to parry. Devs are stupid?
Negative,"it was kind of to be expected. As RobotVadge put it ""Nope""the tutorial was nice though"
Negative,"Early game invaders are nothing but high level twink players, have yet to have a single invader in level-appropriate gear. The combat is quicker than DS1, but it feels a little braindead. It's less of a chess game and more of a spammy brawl."
Negative,"It hurts to leave a negative review for this game. But it is sadly unplayable on my pc. Even though I have a 2070 super. In the ]oad screen immediately following character creation I can hear a bit of audio that sounds like the ocean and it crashes. I have tried all guides and tricks I could find, but none worked and I could find nothing that relates to my issue."
Negative,"You can't fucking aim. The ranged enemies can snipe you from miles away, but the second you try to aim at them the camera does a 90 degree turn and your character shoots to completely opposite side of where you're trying to shoot. The asshole who designed the auto locking in this game actually needs to get cancer."
Negative,"I love this game, but this is ridiculous. the servers have been down over a month, and we were told they would be back the day ER released. Either they have much bigger issues than they let on, or they lied and have no intention of fixing the issues until they've milked their new property, From is headed down the same path as activision/blizzard, keep it up and you can put a new game out every 6 months and it wont save your fan base."
Negative,"npcs look kinda cool, combat is ok, not as bad as elden ring where bosses just hold for minutes, still most of the combat is only difficult because youre fighting multiple enemies, because you have to fight in an impractical place or because bosses are so big that you just cant see shit. that kind of poor artificial difficulty just is not fun to me. PVP is absolute garbage and just annoying. this game has the worst netcode you will ever see, people just roll around for minutes. i know some people swear on these games but i think they are extremely overrated"
Negative,"My friend bought this game for me and honestly that is the only reason i gave it a try and i regret it heavily. The developpers were too lazy and incompetent to even make controls prompts for keyboard and mouse and instead left it all to xbox gamepad controls. One (ore maybe even more for all i know) of the starter classes limits the possibility of passing the tutorial, thus nullifying the very purpose of the class (thief) given that they cannot defeat the tutorial boss with any level of skill someone who just started the game would have. I found that with the assassin class i was able to beat it in one try without failure, which emphasizes the fact that an entire beginner class of an RPG video game was shat on from the very get go. A lot of people attempt to claim that this game requires skill, and in the time i've played and seen my friends play (who are diehard darksouls fans) i have seen but two buttons be pressed, spacebar and left mouseclick. It is absolutely depressing to see people attempt to defend such a broken game. Especially when a game who's main focus is PVE has AI so simplistic, that the majority of the 'grunts' will literally lock on, and if given the chance, pull a 720 whilst swinging their weapon in one attack, just so that their lock on can reach the target. Now to get on to the fact that a game focused on PVE is a rinse wash repeat of killing the same grunts over and over so many times you would believe you're playing dynasty warriors. IF anyone is thinking of buying this game, i highly recommend pirating it first to see if your diseased brain has some sort of affinity to this game, then at the very least waiting for a 80-% off sale to even begin considering letting it sully your steam library."
Negative,Dark Souls III prepare to glitch/bug/crash edition
Negative,"Tried to do coop, got passed the first boss. 5 mins in we get invaded by a twink player and killed us both. Cant do coop anymore cuz you need to be embered and that costs 2500 souls. Returned after that."
Negative,This game made me hate dog i kicked him down the stair he broke every rib in hit body and i felt great about it
Negative,IT'S NOT DARK SOULS 1IT'S NOT DEMON SOULS0/10 DIFFICULTY0/10 WOULD NOT BUY
Negative,Don't pick up foreign objects
Negative,"the game is probably good, but I don't have a controller & don't want to be bothered with Xbox instructions. this just shows how lazy & unbothered the devs are. if a game this big is out on PC, they should make it so that you see keyboard instructions unless you plug a controller in. it's stupid that I even have to state this out loud like that because, you know, common sense?"
Negative,"Not as bad as DS2 but this series has devolved so much it is now purely about I-Frame dodging through boss fights. You learn their moveset, press the dodge button at the right time then punish until you win. Every single boss is the same, almost all of them are giant armoured dudes (or ladies) with massive weapons and you play skiprope with their weapon. There is no need to use your brain, almost none of the bosses have weaknesses you can exploit or tactics you can utilise to get the upper hand. Just dodge, mash R1, rinse repeat. I hate to repeat myself since the game does so much of that itself so I'll leave off by saying you might like this if you are really that desperate for a Souls lIke game."
Negative,undoubtedly the worst game ever made bar none.
Negative,"Foreign friends, have you met can't killed the invasion of the player, that's what we play here with piracy, modifier, attached to the original server players."
Negative,tired of getting invaded by ONLINE PLAYERS when i have the ONLINE MODE set to OFF. i do NOT want to be raided by chudlover_69 while im fucking exploring.
Negative,Garbage fucking game
Negative,"BandaiNamco ,it's very necessary for you to update your server,or the terrible feeling of online gaming will disappoint lots of chinese players.It's a great game and do not be the sinner."
Negative,"Don't even think about buying this piece of garbage game if you think about playing  online / completing it 100%. If oyu want to get all achievements you either have to farm 20+ hours and literally kill the same two enemies over and over again OOOOR: You play online and get matched against players who live on the fucking moon with their 20000 ping that stab you from across the map. Hackers galore too, but why would you implement an anticheat right? I mean the game is supposed to be difficult, and this definitely makes the game difficult to enjoy lmao2/10 Trash gameSingleplayer is fine though"
Negative,"Genuinely the worst souls game out of all 3, they have dogs that will literally rap you whether they are on screen or not. Horrible fucking game when it comes to enemies but the gameplay gives you aids in the ass until you die. good game but awful enemies"
Negative,"It's like Dark Souls 1, except it's just frustrating to play.This game is basically left overs from Bloodborne disguised as Dark Souls. This obviously wasn't properly tested before release. It has all the bad parts of Dark Souls, along with the WRONG part of Bloodborne. The rabid enemies from bloodborne do not mix well with the slower combat of Dark Souls. It tries to succeed in being both Bloodborne and Dark Souls at the same time, but it ends up succeeding in neither of the two, and instead is a mix of unbalanced garbage where the superior PvE tactic is always spammy straight swords, and in PvP it is stunlocking Ultra Greatswords and estus chugging.The weapons feel really good to use, but most of the fun ones are found at the end of the game, so you barely get a chance to use them unless you always want to go to NG+ and beyond everytime you want to make a new build. And even then it's all rushing through the game to get upgrade materials so you can actually kill the enemies before they have time to start their 45-hit stunlocking combo.Poor enemy design is the major flaw of this game. (See Cathedral Knight with giant 300kg swords that they swing like a butter knife, Man-Serpent that do not care about there being a wall in the way of his chain-axe, he WANTS to throw a giant axe through it, the never-ending spam combo knights of the Boreal Valley, the spammy thralls that contribute nothing good to the game whatsoever, the cheating invader NPCs with infinite stamina/magicka that can parry you while drinking estus, the giant black pus snake-hollow-things that just murder your camera so you can't see anything, and many more)Also, disconnects from servers frequently and this can penalize you.Also, Darkmoon Covenant doesn't work lol."
Negative,"It's not as good as expected. It feels weird, a hybrid between Bloodborne and Dark Souls.I don't like the fact that there is no Steam Cloud. That's it."
Negative,good but steam advised to remaster my review
Negative,"This game is one of the most disappointing games I have ever played. Combined with the first two installments, I have a little under 800 hours of Dark Souls experience, and I've beaten all three multiple times at this point. Suffice to say, I have plenty of experience, and I know what I'm talking about.PVEOn my first playthrough, I built my character like I have in every past game, as a glass cannon. This has almost never been a problem, as it would allow me to one or two shot most enemies while still being able to take three or four hits before I died. I traded survivability for damage, and this higher risk higher reward gameplay was what I was seeking in DS3. This is not what I got. I spent the entirety of the playthrough getting one-shotted by every single mob outside of the first village, and my damage was not coming even close to one-shotting the enemies. I eventually beat the game, but it took a considerably long time, and I missed a bunch of stuff because I was really afraid to explore anything. Fast forward to the second playthrough. I create a knight, and pour all of my initial points into vigor, leveling it up to 30 before starting on anything else. I then beat the game with a total death count of 3, two of which being from falling to my death, and the third being from getting corner trapped by a really fat npc for literally half a minute. I could survive even the most unfair of attacks from enemies like they were nothing, and then I would just use one of my 16 estus charges to heal to almost completely full again. The game doesn't play like the others, you either play like a fucking turtle or you die. This is a recurring theme throughout DS3. Boss fights, arguably the pinnacle of the souls games are attrociously easy. Using the dried finger, you can now summon three co-op partners and just sit back in the fucking corner while your sunbros beat it for you. That's not to say that I didn't die on certain boss fights, there were still some that took a couple tries, but it was mainly because they had some really annoying gimmick, not because they had a challenging mechanic to try and overcome. This is also a recurring theme. After beating a boss in DS3, I didn't feel the wave of accomplishment that I've felt with the other games. The first words that popped into my head weren't ""Oh my god I beat it"", they were ""Finally, that was obnoxious."" Time and time again, I felt annoyed playing it, and coming back to what should be one of my favorite games of all time felt like a chore. That's the real failure of this game, it doesn't feel challenging, it feels vexxing. There are some new mechanics, such as the weapon skills or the mana bar that are really nice changes, but they don't outweigh the rest of the trash heap. Many enemies are ripostable but not parryable, the animation on backstabs is terrible, they took away the shield break and replaced it with the inferior kick, and armor isn't upgradable anymore, which is an awful idea.PVPThis is probably the worst installment of PVP yet, and I've lived through zweihander giantdads and helix spear mastodon halberd power stance. They've made some changes to the matchmaking, one of which being that invaders are significantly more likely to invade a host that already has at least one phantom. This is a terrible fucking decision. They've taken one of the worst pvp situations in the game, and made it more likely to happen than before. Dark Souls at its core, is a game about stats, and the player uses their weapons and timings and whatever else to make their stats overcome the other persons stats. In a 2v1, or a 3v1, or even a goddamn 4v1 (which has happened multiple times to me), there's almost no outcome where the 1 wins. The only way the invader wins, is if other invaders happen to invade, which makes it a 2v2 where you can hurt each other at best, or the other side majory screws something up. On top of that, they made healing much more prevalent in pvp. When you invade, you get half of the estus that you would normally have, and while other summoned phantoms get the same, the host gets all of their charges. Combined with the shitty kick that we have now, it is completely possible for someone to just hide behind a greatshield and dump estus down their throat for like twenty minutes while their seventeen other friends come in and beat your ass. Invading is slow, it's obnoxious, and it's not fun. On top of that, parrying does way too much damage. You take slightly less damage, and no poise damage whenever you miss a parry, which is stupid, and if you hit one, you can basically just one shot your opponent. Every single match devolves into two walking tanks spamming parry, and backing away to heal to full life fifteen times until one guy hits the parry and insta kills the other guy. It's just like the meta at the very end of Dark Souls 2, and you know what, it was fucking lame then too.ConclusionWhile I've certainly said some heated words in this review, anger isn't the first emotion that's popping into my mind; it's sadness. I've been looking forward to this game for long and I wanted so badly for this game to be great, but it just did not deliver. My enthusiasm was met with one-shots, ultra-defensive pve, terrible pvp, and a framerate that makes the game completely unplayable at some points. I am incredibly frustrated, but more than anything, I'm just disappointed. I'm going to 100% this game, and get the dark soul achievement, just like I did with Dark Souls 2, and then I'm never going to touch this garbage ever again. Best of luck to you if you're wishing to buy it."
Negative,"You know I really did enjoy this game, I came over from xbox about a year ago and picked this up again because why not. Unfortunately while this is an amazing game it is plagued by hackers, you will see plenty of people using god mode, infinite damage unarmed, ect. My main character at SL120 is now softlocked in an infinite you died loop because of some stupid hacker. Good job wasting my time fromsoft"
Negative,best game ever
Negative,"This game is utter horse ***. It is cheap, unfair, and ultimately just the masochistic manifestation of game designers who delight in making players angry. I hate every stupid minute of this absolute turd and I constantly screaming ""WHAT EVEN THE ****?!"" when things don't go my way (which is often). 10/10 can't stop playing."
Negative,"Good game and everything , i like it however buy it if you want to get banned for using PS3 controller or EGPU solution of NVidia Shadow play , or by just starting CE you will get permantly banned , i bought the game with dlc and now iam going to ask for refund ."
Negative,"The game itself is quite fun...not as fun as ds1 but still...- level design not as near as close ds1- poor optmization and bugs (crashes)- Bandai Namco+ OST+ weapons specialsBut i would not recoomend it...because it has awful performance...fps go up and down like crazy...it crashes near bonfiresThere are cases of corrupted save games due to crash..controller incompatibility ..it is painful to play with keyboard+mouse..some people the game does not even run..stay with white screenThe main reason i would not recoomend it is : Bandai Namco...Japanese were suppose to be polite and efficient right? Well these guys dont give any useful feedback to its community, promoted the game via streamers/youtubers and got the game spoiled..japanese release was way earlier and yet the game was launched with problems and no patch are nowhere to be seen without mention they would change the requiriments frequently..they rose the prices in several regions..more than once in some of them, I got banned from bandai facebook for asking a satisfaction on those matters and i was NOT rude..matter of fact I was very polite"
Negative,"The over all game is amazing but nowadays with the game the way it is and so close to the launch of elden ring I wouldn't bother picking it up because of two reason 1. ELDEN RING2. HACKERS, the hacking problem in this game has gone far beyond SIMPle trolls and has reach people hacking into my game and modding my character against my will and making them un-playable unless I wanna be banned to the cheaters server which is a hard pass for me pretty much unless your gonna play offline all the time don't get this game just wait for elden ring."
Negative,"Stop looking at the review, just buy it."
Negative,Silly game takes up all of your free time 'cause it's unrealisticly good
Negative,"Grand Archives finally made me quit.I could only tolerate this game so far.I guess Dark Souls 1 really was an accidental masterpiece.In terms of artificial difficulty this game is actually worse than Dark Souls 2.There are way too many gimmick boss fights.In fact the only two boss fights I genuinely enjoyed in this game were the Dancer of Boreal Valley and Dragonslayer Armour.Because they are a test of your skill to dodge,attack and counter attack unlike all the other bosses.Even though in the Dragonslayer Armour fight you are bombarded with missiles by Pilgrim Butterflies that you can't reach and kill.You have little to no poise even wearing the Cathedral Knight Armour.Attacks feel weak.Rolls and backsteps are weird.And It doesn't have the feeling of a realm that is slowly dying that only you can save.Even DS2 did a better job at that.And this is coming from someone who is not a fan of Dark Souls 2.Doesn't feel fair,doesn't feel fun,doesn't feel like Dark Souls.EDIT:I gave this another shot after having played Mortal Shell.Somehow it was even worse this time."
Negative,10 poise out of 10.
Negative,It took my balls and scratched them
Negative,"I cannot recommend this game in its current state. I have had 15+ crashed to desk top in less than two hours of play. This dissapointment is only punctuated by the fact that this is otherwise everything I am looking for in a Souls game. I have tried all of the ""fixes"" that the internet recommends and have had no better luck. This is not a $60 game in its current state, it is not really a game at all considering I can't even leave the tutorial area. I expected better."
Negative,"People need to stop pretending this is a good videogame, most of the time you get invaded by hackers or tryhards with cheese builds that feel acomplished for killing you with the most sweat setup.It has even more ganks than DSII and obnoxious enemies. Boss lineup isn't even that great to begin with."
Negative,"The game is just outright broken. There was simply put no Q&A (that’s quality assessment if you didn’t know) done. Like at all. PC gamers got shafted with a version of the game that just outright crashes every time you get close to a bonfire while you have a shield equipped.Let me walk you through it: You face an enemy – obviously you have a shield equipped – you die, you respawn at the last bonfire, you still have said shield equipped, the game crashes. You restart the game, you spawn at the last location the game placed you at, which is the fricking bonfire aaaand the game crashes again. When they told us about the never ending cycle of the Dark Souls world I really had something else in mind. How can this pass the Q&A? Why was this not addressed? How could endless players and streamers have the game and none picked that up? By the way, I’m far from the only one who encountered that bug. Look at Steam. I really love the franchise but I cannot play the game past the first bonfire. It crashes and crashes and crashes. I mean sure, I could do a no shield run, but since this is my very first time playing DS3 that would be a hard thing to do. Sure, I love me a good challenge but … come on. The problem is, that FromSoft obviously places no worth in the PC community at all. Look at the facts. DS1 was released – no one rushed them to it, they had all the time in the world. The game was completely broken and was only fixed by the modding community. DS2 was released – one whole month after the consoles got their version. It wasn’t broken but half of the promised features were missing and they had to re-release the game as the scholar of the first sin edition in order to implement them. Now DS3 is out. I would have loved to make a review, but I can’t. Since I can’t progress through the game. So yeah, that was my little bug report/appreciation message for the stellar job FromSoft did with their latest game. Maybe it’s awesome. Maybe it’s a masterpiece that dwarfs even the likes of Half Life 2. But unfortunately I don’t know that. So thanks again. I took a day off from work only to stare at a crash report screen for hours straight."
Negative,"No 3440x1440 support, what a joke (trying to set up a mod fix without success...)"
Negative,faith sucks balls
Negative,-i thought itd be shit but turns out its not shit!
Negative,"Spent the first day trying to stop it from crashing.  It's pretty fun once you get past that, but it's not worth the hassle, especially not at full price.  Buy the console version instead, it's more stable."
Negative,DeS > DaS1 > BB >> DaS3 >DaS2fite meAlmost the worst of the series. Stay away unless you've beaten all the previous Souls games and really need a fix. Inexplicable performance issues alongside widespread balance problems plague the game currently.
Negative,"While the game can be very entertaining, there are numerous flaws such as the horribly done multiplayer where invaders will almost always get ganked unless they're twinking, and the unimaginably awful connection. The level design is a step down from the first two games. It's fairly linear and not very open-eneded. Perhaps if the game dropped to $40 I would reccomend but the $60 they ask you to fork up isn't really worth what the game gives you. 2/5"
Negative,"If you enjoy being angry for hours on end and then maybe eventually beating a boss and feeling wonderful for 5 seconds and then doing that all over again, this is a game for you.Don't buy this if you have anger issues / you're already too stressed out.  It's not a fun time, it's a difficult time with fun in between if you play with people."
Negative,"I have tried so many times to get into this game. I can't. People complain about ganks in DS2, but this game has far more, and they are worse. The combat tries to replicate Bloodborne and fails, staying in a weird in-between of it and Dark Souls style gameplay. Not to mention the very linear levels are a chore to get through, and despite this game supposedly having all the best bosses, only half of them are good. After my fourth time trying to get through the game over the course of multiple years, I can't take it anymore. Disappointing."
Negative,"As previously stated i would update my review, based on my three full runs of game 2 on PC and one on XBOX one its still very much a thumbs down and here is why.Over all of the 3 instalments of ""Dark Souls"", number one had a great adventure and was super cool for jolly coop. The one thing ""Dark Souls 2"" did better was mechanics, they brought the game to life for a MUCH better combat imo.While the story wasn't great and the world was a bit small and oddball it was not enough to be deterred from a gazillion hours or play.How ever ""Dark Souls 3"" the best way I can describe this to you is like so.........If poise worked the same as it does in ""Dark Souls 3"", in the ""Dark souls 1"" edition. And the same ridiculous crap was happening as it does in the third instalment today, I would NEVER have followed the series to where it is now. ""Dark Souls 2"" may have added more stats like agility etc, but they worked as intended. And the over all mechanics were better, I also understand the need for changes to CERTAIN THINGS. But to the fundamentals of what made the game what it is, what do you think kept the vets coming back ?And the new guys coming ? The HYPE was real, and for the first 2 games that stands true, and it was we VETs who put the hype their. But alas the ""Dark Souls 3 "" finale is a Firm FLOP imo.With a miserable 3 runs in total under my belt 2 on PC and 1 on XB1, my attention spanned to doing fight arenas. Which unfortunately just made it even more noticeable, how poor the mechanics really are in this edition of the game. And thus I haven't played ""Dark Souls 3"" for at least the last two days, what a sad farewell to a game so dearly loved by many and expected much more for a finale."
Negative,"I suffer from clinical depression and to make things worse I recently lost my job and my wife left me for a man clearly better than me in every way. She took the children too and they love their new dad, because he's a better dad... that added a lot of hurt. I poured every minute into this game as a means of escape from my miserable existence. Guess what? Even with nothing else to do in my stinking bedsit and driven by rage I Couldn't kill the first boss."
Negative,Too hard for my small brain
Negative,"don't reccomend it. EVERYTHING that attacks you staggers you. poise now only effects roll i-frames. it's basically a net negative the way it works.FROM can't be bothered to say more than 'we made a few changes to a couple weapons' in their patch notes, and for some reason prioritize nerfing weapons that don't really need it, over the ones that do.the entire heavy armor class is useless, not enough defence gain for the weight, and heavy weapons are pretty much the same way.since everything staggers you, and combat is now so damn fast, in pve it turns into stun them before they stagger you. it's also extremely annoying when you come up against a group of enemies which can stun lock you easily if they hit you, often turning into a death sentence"
Negative,they killed the servers for some reason.
Negative,"If you prefer keyboard/mouse playstyle, go somewhere else. The controller controls are also too janky for me."
Negative,"Not mine - spent about 120 hours to came up to a conclusionDifficulty is not to be skilled... its to go stupid farming to get your lvls to beat something. Ok, you can do quite everything without farming but the fights talke a lot of unnecessary time then.The fighting feels so sluggy compared to other especially fighting gamesCamera movement is a pain...You can only reskill your charakter 5-times for ever play-through. And you have to free up the place to do it... just another time consumer.Its a good idea to lvl up your weapons and armor but again you have to go stupid farming...They tried to mix an Action Adventure with a Fighting Game. It's a good idea but lacks a lot of balancing (fighting, equip/stat ratio, bosses, etc.). And not maintained anymore today.Pro:Level, Sound and Character Design is neat and was the main reason to keep playing. Over this they did a good job by scripting quite every corner and you get scared/thrilled very often. But playing through 1 time is enough for me.All in all everything in this game feels like unnecessary time wating. I know some people like exactly this but for me it's not up to date. Maybe Sekiro would be better for me. After all these years the best Soulslike for me was ""Severance: Blade of Darkness"" so far.Even after 5 years it's fair to do such a comment if they still wanna take the full/high price for it. Really FromSoftware if you want that high price after all the years go on and maintain your stuff. And over all implement an anticheat like othes said.I can not recommand it especial for that high price tag for the reasons aboce. Also if your a casual gamer wanna just play throug a game you probably get frustrated cause the difficulty might be hard for you."
Negative,i want to kill my self playing this
Negative,"So, it is a popular game, let's try it right? No, don't do it, unless you extremly good in action games or you is a masochist.I personally prefer strategy games, logical games where you need to use your brain, i know my reflexes not the best. Still, sometimes i want to play some action game too. Because of my preferences i not doing it often so if you like me avoid this game at all cost.For me this was the worst game i ever tried/played. Even shovelware games have more entertainment value. How come?First of all, when i playing something on steam, on a PC platform, then I would like to see at least keyboard and mouse icons, how to navigate in the game, on the menu. The first challenge was to figure out how to leave the options. Iam not kidding, ESC not worked.Then it continues on tutorial: every single action, combat moves, EVERYTHING is shown how it need to be done via controller.... while playing a PC version. Ok, another challenge done, trying to translate those at keybindings. Believe it or not, changing the keybindings was also a heroic task. If you set everathing you need to figure out how to leave the options again. First time not managed to figure out, while i was at menu, but this time ESC worked! Hell yeah. Uhh, ok why my changes not worked? Everything on default again! If they create a PC port then they should at least learn how menus and actions work for other games OR at least show the required buttons instead of showing controller buttons i can't use.Ok, now i can control everything properly, sound adjusted to an acceptable level and it not killing my ears anymore, killing monsters easily, ahh, this is just the tutorial. Then we get to the tutorial boss..... Ok, he coming with a 10m long halberd, impossible to dodge anything, you also get hit while dodging, and he attacks again so fast that you still can't move yet because of the previous hit and you got hit again. Boss literally 1shot you. I know many interpretes this as ""hell, the game is hard, it is cool"" but actually for me it looks so that the whole game is just bugged and not working properly. No, iam not that guy who giving up on everything fast, but the fact that nearly never managed to dodge any attack, no matter to what direction i dodged, it still hit me, stunlocked me and killed. The only time i managed to get lower than 90% was when i just kept running away and attacked twice fast when jumped to my previous location. Still died because this was a time consuming method and still changed insanely fast to another attack form and killed me again while i was rolling/dodging away. Why do they even have a button for dodge? Perhaps not even the developers know the answer.Probably 90% of the players finishing/playing this with trainers, but where is the fun to play like that? Easier to choose a real, good, entertaining game, instead of this.Some friend told me the goal of this game is to make players to rage. Well, this should be on store page then. Unfortunatly i don't like to rage and if i buy something i want to be entertained."
Negative,vittu muuten osaa olla perseest
Negative,this game will not get you laid
Negative,Crashes constantly at the first bonfire. Unplayable at this point!
Negative,"Buy the game to play with friends, doesn't let me. 10/10 Would waste $60 again."
Negative,"Terrible latencyThe gimmick of the game is that it's hard. It's not hard because in that it's challenging, it's hard in the sense that horror movies with pop up scares can be considered horror."
Negative,Do not buy until it's fixed. The game is unplayable as of now.
Negative,"Game is amazing, but fuck this game. Suddenly I got banned for literally nothing."
Negative,"WORST GAME IN THE FUCKING WORLD, IM GOING TO FIND YOU MIYASAKI. YOU WILL FEEL MY WRATH"
Negative,no human being should suffer that much
Negative,"The devs have chosen to appeal to the more toxic types of players, and as such invasions are now irredemably fucked, and they have no idea what they're doing with the balance. if you're still interested for the singleplayer, just grab ds1"
Negative,"Absolutely terrible controls if you don't like controllers. Games that are hard because of the controls and not the mechanics should not be praised for their difficulty, it feels like you are trying to play with a guitar hero controller. It doesn't help that there are no icons or tips for keyboard controls."
Negative,"SHITTY STUFF, AFTER 2016, DO NOT PLAY!!!!!!!!ГОВНО ТУПОРЫЛОЕ , ПОСЛЕ 2016 СТРОГО НЕ ИГРАТь!!!!!!!!"
Negative,"if you enjoy putting your cock and balls in a red hot iron vice grip, this is the game for you."
Negative,"it sucks really, i mean you get to almost the end of the fucking game and killed the twin princes, restart a new game file and you can't even kill the first boss. its just kinda rigged tbh"
Negative,Worst combat balance of the 3 games. Not really fun to play more than once.
Negative,"very unpredictable performance. hope they fix this. does not matter how good or bad your computer is. getting a decent FPS is more about luck than performance. forums are filled with ppl that cant play due to low FPS with very good computers, and ppl being able to play with fine FPS on a toasters. wait for upgrades."
Negative,"The combat is improved from the earlier games, but I realised here that the combat wasn't a very big part of what I loved about Demon's Souls and Dark Souls 1 anyway. There was something else, like a mystery to the world that is now missing. I don't see the purpose of beating Giant Royal Humanoid Swordfighter if I'm not excited about what's coming after. And for that reason I'm out."
Negative,"The game itself is fantastic. FromSoftware... is a bunch of cock sucking fuck monkeys that need to eat a large bag of turds. Wasted 60+ hours on leveling characters and playing through ridiculously hard levels only to randomly get banned out of no where. You might think the soft ban is not a big deal, it's a single player game after all.... WRONG Every covenant in the game relies on multiplayer, Some areas are damn near impossible without assistance. The whole grind isn't about finishing the game. It's about reaching the meta to test your pvp mettle agaisnt other people who have sunk countless hours into the game. And now thousands of people are sittign with a $60 hunk of nothing in their steam library. Thanks FromSoftware. Love you long time."
Negative,"I have never cheated in a Dark Souls game in my life. As many others have stated, it is likely that I was banned to an alternate server, only I was never notified and have no idea why. A day ago, the high wall of lothric would be littered with signs, orange and white, as well as invaders popping up every few minutes. Now, the game is like a ghost town. As much as I love the series itself, I also love the multiplayer. I did not pay the full price for 50% of a game. This is horrible. Bandai Namco can't do their jobs correctly and the players are punished for it with no repurcussion to the company. I also feel bad about writing a negative review but they deserve a 0/10 for banning people for no reason. Until the problem is fixed, this game is not worth buying because chances are that you will pay full price for half of what the game is stated for."
Negative,"Don't buy the game if you want to play it with a mouse an keyboard... it's all bugged, everything is for a controller, every prompt is for the controller button (ex: press ""B"", from controller, to go back... it's actually ""Q"" for keyboard).The camera is fucked, sound is fucked, aiming is fucked... everything is wrong control wise.DO NOT BUY IT!!Yeah, you can reset it, but to spend more than 60$, including DLCs, then getting this shit. It's practically a scam."
Negative,"Difficult for the sake of being difficult. Enemies have infinite stamina so they can just spam attacks forever until you run out of stamina rolling and they hit you, looking at you borreal outrider. Played through DS 1 and DS 2, 3 has beautiful graphics and sound design but the gameplay feels crappy in comparison. None of the enemies do attacks that would appear natural, making them extremely hard to read and hard to predict what they're gonna do next, which I guess is the point, but as someone who only has an hour or 2 a week to play games, I don't have the time to sit and learn every enemy's attack patterns, or remember what I was even supposed to be doing after not playing for a week. Pushed to get past Wolnir, forgot what I was supposed to be doing or where I was going, got wrecked in the city after the crypt area and gave up on the game. Sad I won't be finishing it, but I really can't be f#cked to load the game back up."
Negative,This games frame rate is honestly the worst its fine at some points then it slows down to a legit crawl. I know it just came out but this isnt a very good start to the 3 game. I will continue to play but its hard to when i fight a boss it goes down to about 10 fps and when just running around 50-60 fps. Then when you go to firelink you run 23fps all the time every time. I'm sorry to say but stay away for now.Overall if you can get this to run or can play past the bugs then go for it i love the series and have loved it. Honestly Fromsoftware will fix it but this needs to be pointed out now. The game is graphically pleasing and is honestly lovely. Also changing from high to low does nothing but save me 2 fps. As i have now been informed and have tested this works better on my integrated graphics card wow lol.                      PsThis review will change with time and fixes but stay away till fps is fixed.
Negative,It was a great game when the multiplayer portion existed. They've permanently disabled the online aspect to push everyone to Elden Ring. Do not buy. Pirate this game instead.
Negative,"Awful game dont try, awful tutorial just sucks in general"
Negative,"Literally cant play this game anymore, no thanks to the fuckers at Bandai-Namco! Wont even fix their game running rampant with hackers and modders. Thanks for nothing. Dont even give these fucks the time of day."
Negative,"Maybe my least favourite DS game, beaten them all DS1, DS2, & this with max achievements, but damn this was a grind to finish with some poor design.  Ridiculous enemy spam and stun lock, making some of the regular mobs harder to fight and kill than the bosses.  Poor frame rates on a high end PC.  I love it because, well it's Dark Souls and I want more, but please do better than this.  I'm voting no recommended hoping they don't make the same mistakes again!"
Negative,"I'm sure this game is great. However, on two completely different computers now that are *more* that powerful enough to run it (Ryzen 2600, GTX 1070, 32 GB of RAM  and then Ryzen 5600x, RTX 3070ti, 32 GB of RAM) it's had an annoying issue where every few minutes it will freeze for a second or two four times in a row. I've searched and tried nearly a dozen solutions at this point and haven't been able to fix it. I'll probably just play the game on my Xbox now, I don't know."
Negative,cinder is so bad dude
Negative,"Game CRASHES almost everytime I try to interact with a bonfire or get away from one! Personally, I defenitly can not recommend this game because it's a broken mess and almost unplayable."
Negative,"I heard this game was hard, but I can't even get past the menus without wanting to pummel myself to death with my keyboard.0/10 for playability11/10 for difficulty."
Negative,nameless king is bullshit fuxk this game
Negative,be shedat tokhmi.
Negative,"Buy it for console, you'll probably get less fucking frame drops. 980 Ti SLI, 5930k. Frame drops are constant and usually what end up killing you.Fuck From Soft, never again."
Negative,"Same as DS2 as far as general gameplay goes but a bit of a downgrade I reckon with several features removed like bow infusion, armour upgrading, torch lighting and pvp is terribly implemented this time around with no opt out. Areas aren't as well designed either.Usual souls style of no story/lore ingame which is a bit disappointing although expected. Still no quit to desktop option either.I'd say get Dark Souls 2 over this if you want something from the souls series although if you're just after souls-like game, go for Code Vein."
Negative,"Game is just fan service for hardcore DS1 enjoyers. Miyazaki went above and beyond to make this game everything that people hoped DS2 would be except worse. Story and world are mid, only redeeming quality is the gameplay, which is super tight and fluid. DS2 remains the best Dark Souls game."
Negative,"Sadly, PvP is completely broken these days. 8 out of 10 invaders are either twinks, laggers or cheaters (or all together). And that's not an exaggeration, but real numbers from an experience.Years ago, it was way better; but nowadays you can easily find ways to abuse the gameplay online, and devs don't seem to care at all. Until they at the very least implement a working anti-cheat in their product, I can no longer recommend it."
Negative,PVP is completely and utterly ruined.
Negative,"completed on ps4, refused to launch on pc despite 2x 2080TI's and  Amd Ryzen 9. Did every fix I could find, nothing worked. Not cool. No crash, no freezing, just literally not launching at all."
Negative,"All preset characters are not even close to looking like humans, plus they removed the best homeland, Dark Souls 2 was way better."
Negative,Worst target system of all series
Negative,it's bloody imposible
Negative,"honestly a complete downgrade from 2. build variety sucks donkey dick and the combat is zoomzoom ADHD shit where you map every possible thing an enemy could do to memory so you can I-frame it. the combat in this game is the worst in the entire souls franchise/series, its complete and total garbage. there's no spacing, there's no walking around things, there is only rolling like a spastic retard because most of the oxygen deprived playerbase thinks that I-frames are a complete substitute for actually engaging gameplay.TLDRdark souls 1/2: enemy swings overhead, you walk around them.roll souls 3: enemy swings overhead and rotates on a pivot forcing you to roll through the attack like a shitty QTE with a followup gap closer animation that covers the entire rooms length several times over with guaranteed pancake."
Negative,"Maybe this game is decent on console, but on PC the camera movement is too erratic to make it really playable. I have also seen the same hit tracking issue other users are reporting with enemy attack movements. The game is very slow to get going at all, and once it gets going it still feels like a slow going game."
Negative,"Worst movement mechanic and key binding options i have ever seen you roll/sprint/jump with the same key and u cant change it, like i would like to sprint with shift but nu huh u cant, brain dead movement mechanic game is awesome but the movement mechanics are the WORST i have ever seen i've never seen a worse movement mechanic than in this game"
Negative,"the game would be great if not for all the invaders, all i want to do is finish the game with my mate but every 5 seconds we get invaded and it just becomes a waste of our time. Invaders coming at you with max gear and 20+ healing, while we only have 4....... absolute garbage.  All invaders are trash and i hope every one of you get cancer in the ass"
Negative,"Plain truth is I just suck at this game. It is waaay too difficult. I've died over and over again fighting the first two bosses, never beat them. I guess this is totally intended for those who played the first ones and are good at it. BTW the performance wasn't very good even on my 290X. I asked for a refund."
Negative,2023 and it doesn't support cloud saving
Negative,"Elden ring is certainly good, but where is the MULTIPLAYER! Where is the game I paid for!"
Negative,"Terrible game, shit souls 1.5. Cope playing the baby game of the series while the chads play Peak Souls 2. Ahhh, the emerald herald is calling my name... Goodbye.. Noobs..."
Negative,"Please fix online security issues, then i will recommend!"
Negative,S2m böle oyunu
Negative,The art and environment are well done but the combat is clunky and tetious at best. The progression system is incredible slow and uninteresting. If youve ever played a game and fought a specific enemy and thought to yourself. This enemy is super annoying and not enjoyable to fight. Im going to ignore it and go back to the fun parts of the game. thats every enemy in this game lol. To sum it up overall its a large amount of time and effort for no rewards other then to tell people you played the game.
Negative,"Arena is the closest form of balanced PVP. I don't think the game mechanic of invading was intended to be as it is right now. You spend most of you time waiting to invade. 1/3 of the time this gets canceled due to timeout error before you actually arrive in the world, 1/3 of the time there is an error once you arrive in the world, or 3s later the host starts the boss. Seriously Fromsoft? There is 5 seconds prior to invading, 5 seconds of loading and you actually make people come to worlds were the host is 10s away from the boss?If you actually arrive in a world, you have more chances to be against a gank squad than to be in 1v1.The offline design to achieve the 100% achievement is the ensure farmers full-time occupation for months. It's such a smart design."
Negative,"For the sake of equilibrium - 1/10, there's really enough spitlicking sycophants greasing the Miyazaki hypetrain already. What really gets to me is the fact that there seems to be one department tasked to turn every otherwise stunning looking environment/biome into one big, HIV-infested shithole after another. Either by placing poison /toxic sludge everywhere while not even giving you the chance to equip gear to overcome said impairment (Rusted Iron Ring, where?) or placing ridiculous mobtypes on chokepoints - or both of the aforementioned conditions. DS1 felt challenging but rewarding from the beginning to the end. Skipped DS2 because it looked like the wrinkled back-end you'd imagine on Lothric Castle Emma..This time however, everything feels worthless. Skip Armor, Skip + to loading weight and resistance, because the shit they've placed along the line will kill you anyways. It's dodge-roll extravaganza with the occasional ""Ion Cannon - max buff mode"" for bosses, end of story."
Negative,"Why is poise turned off? Edit: They changed poise, it's better than it was - poise is now basically hyperarmor, but it's still pretty bad so meh. I'm just gonna keep this review negative for now since it took them so long and it's still kind of weird and heavy armor still seems pretty shit.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
Negative,"No simply bcs of invasions existing in co-op. Don't care about being ""casul"", can beat ds rather easly, save for super fast huge/knight type enemies, tis the pvp that gets on our nerves. Not only just want to co-op and there are forced invasions (literaly game is multiple times easier when playing offline), but most importantly, invasions waste our time, can't progress bcs they will get in the way, can't fight them bcs they hide behind mobs, less than 1/4 of invaders is of our actual level/skill/gear level, had a pleasure of being 3 shoted multiple times on high wall of lothric... with just caestus or whatever those gloves are while them taking like 40-50 damage only and their healthbar being something made of like 1,5k. Most invaders have fully upgraded estus flasks so they can heal and heal, some even didn't ever ran out of healing even after half hour+ of beating them, today even met a guy who would take no damage from host, he would also not target us, the only damage that took from them was from their aoes, otherwise they just hunted down phantoms then waited.EDIT: Half of theinvaders that getting now are invulnerable to being hit by any means other than phantoms but still taking damage from them, is like, the further going into the game, the more glitched it becomes in terms of mulitplayer.Another EDIT: Finished the game, eventualy solo as had sincererly enough of invaders wasting our time when reached half of lothric castle. Some enemies and bosses cheesed with range or glitches bcs playing the game for fun, not a secondary school of when is safe to strike once in the constant onslaught of attacks from poise god knights or bosses with infinite stamina. Feeling bad that considering self a good, quickly learning in games and adapting player but was not patient enough for this to do it melee and oh, the magic sucks in this game, same with bows. Champion gundyr, lothric prince, soul of cinder, nameless king, slave knight gael, halflings (and later propably fredie and whatever else breaths there) were impaled by rain of crossbow bolts, with lothric being cheesed by the no agro glitch on stairs bcs devs decided to screw over anyone who isn't using ultra or penetrating weapons as the only way to win that boss is killing the small prince which only drops down for 3 seconds after killing the big one which ressurects, pontif was cheesed by phantoming him, yeah, tbh coop and to some extent npc phantoms take away from the experience and in some ways also make the fight worse (such as useless sirris and orbeck for lothric fight, both dying on first, maybe at the start of second phase and leaving a health/damage boosted monster boss to solo), gael could propabl fight without cheese, almost won against him but ran out of estus at the end and just wanted to win and being a filthy behind shield turtler that is scared of hitting in risky moments and waiting for perfect time when enemies run out of stamina so he could deal considerable damage by chiping thro with elemental damage so just did the first phase normaly and the other 2 with bolts. Soul of cinder also, npcs for first and most of second stage then bolting for finisher.The vanilla game is mostly fine, save for the multi enemy gangbangs, especialy in later stages of the game, is very fun to get staggered to death and whatnot and also enemies have... actual poise, player doesn't have poise, is a meaningless stat that is truly only working if using special few abilities or ultra weapons, the devs suck ultra players so hard they propably are now impotent, the game is basicaly about either fast straight swords or ultras (best choices), other weapons are also viable (a casul beaten it with just a basic halberd and a shield for entire game), it doesn't mean they are good choices, fast weaposn doesn't need to care about poise bcs they are... fast, if got into fight with a fast enemy or with invader using short weapons, welcome to the stunlock, they don't need poise, however they fight for the ""best"" position with ultras which have poise when attacking and ultras are basicaly either be a dodge into backstab or parry pro or be able to trade with them. So yeah, being anything other than those 2 like a middle ground (such as halberds/spears which trade speed, poise and damage for range) is just gimping self, also players don't get staggered when hitting shield with fast weapons, amazing. Another thing are enemy humanoid npcs that were given the roll ability, there's no way to hit them, best would be ultra poising thro them tbh since npcs won't stop attacking unless being out of their range so easy squash for the ultras. Last thing, infinite stamina enemies/bosses, also rare like the poise and gangbang and roll gods in vanilla but still exist, any type of a knight other than wall lothric knights and cathedral knights will just perma attack untill out of their range, red eyed lothric knights?, perma R1 R1 R1 with sporadic stance finisher that goes thro shields, thankfuly they can be staggered..., just like the pontiff knights which are considerably much less spongy thank gods, but vanilla have things like darkwraiths, worse silver knights... and the worst of the kind, black knights, black knights could propably even resist an ultra with their poise, srsly, past champion gundyr there's like 5 of them with ultra greatswords and on top of that a shield, they are harder than the boss himself. (ah, also forgot about the ascended winged knights, as if one wasn't infinite stamina/poise enough, there's 3 of them, had to bow them down)Another thing, ranged combat, wish things, especialy the pathetic damage crossbow/bows would be fully homing on targets like in teso for example, why?, bcs roll exists, roll exists there too, but rolling takes so little stamina... can even just walk to the side and those things become useless, extremely situational weapons, especialy bow which roots player when drawing the bow then slows to a crawl while also slowing stamina regen and have to dual wield it... for like 20% more damage over a crossbow?, pff, don't get started on greatbows, those things are just some invasions montage material at best. Spells also, mana doesn't regen, healing is almost useless bcs if being almost dead... wanna heal now and can't heal in mid-combat bcs of oraoraora enemies, all of them so gotta drink estus, damage spells are almost all not homming like arrows, easly rolled away from every single of them and on top of that if wanna see damage that an ultra can do with nothing but 40 str and dex then have to waste all ring slots for magic damage boosts, a weapon of choice for damage buff like staff or standard or something, possibly a head slot for super ugly helmet if using sorcery, 60+ in int or faith with high dex to cast quickly... on top of every other stat to not be a squish then spend big chunk of mana and even then they propably gonna roll away unless will succefuly trade damage.Also wish there were more bosses like dancer or abyss watchers, their themes are cool, their fights are not infinite stamina bs etc (gundyr kinda too, but the champion version have infinite stamina so screw him, some ugandan soldier with supa kickas), even soul of cider was kind of fun or gael (which is from dlc).Gonna include dlc ratings, also negative in separate reviews since ran out of space here, dlcs are like, pure sweaty tryhard evil, it already takes a sweaty, perfect rolling, melee only, naked, sl1 pros to finish vanilla in end game with no cheese (there are literaly ppl who did entire thing with 0 damage taken or beaten things like midir first try)"
Negative,"TLDR: if you enjoyed the previous souls games where you had to position and space yourself appropriately in combat depending on your build and playstyle, and what enemy you're fighting, do not buy this game. 90% of the PVE combat is reliant on rolling through an enemy's 3-6+ attack combo and then punishing with a roll attack. gone are the days of spacing, movement other than rolls, and identifying good blindspots in an enemy's moveset to stick to, outside of a tiny handful of specific rare attacks. If you liked bloodborne or sekiro style dodge-and-parry-based combat with fast weapons, then you may enjoy this game.fromsoft has yet again made a game where: the characters are good, the writing is good, the music is good, and the atmosphere/art is great, but I must ask: what the FUCK did you DO to the COMBAT god DAMN.Slower weapons are gimped hardcore in this iteration of souls because of how most bosses attack fast, and often in long, drawn out combos, with some touch-of-death true combos thrown in for good measure. This, coupled with more enemy damage across the board, near-perfect attack tracking from enemies, and weaker armor options both in resistances and poise, makes anything short of a straight sword, katana, curved sword, or spear practically unuseable on ng+ and up, and a hit-trading slogfest in ng where you'll regularly get punished by most bosses and enemies for attacking LIKE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO during an opening. Assuming you use any medium/large weapon, you'll be seeing yourself winning boss fights with no healing left, IF the game decides to give you good RNG in that attempt by not having the boss counterpunish your slow recovery every time you attack an opening. The only boss that I enjoyed in this game was nameless king, because his first phase played like a dark souls 1 fight where you could figure out blind spots and timings to run in and out of attack ranges and position yourself to deal damage while being safe from retaliation besides one or two attacks, but then phase 2 starts and most of that gets thrown out the window, becoming yet another roll-through roll-attack one-dimensional slog (though there were two rarely used attacks in phase 2 that rewarded spacing and smart movement, so they did at least try on this one.)fromsoft is just trying way too fucking hard to make everything bloodborne-style combat, not realizing that souls is not built for this kind of thing unless you remove all the slow weapons and shorten the roll queue time. I cannot tell you how many times I have both died to, and seen other players die to, an attack that they mistimed a dodge on, which causes that dodge to get queued and immediately performed out of stun, and FORCE them into a death from an enemy's delayed followup attack. You can't just port the roll buffer straight from ds1, a slower-paced game, and expect it to work well with no changes. The attack buffer has this same issue, by the way, but you likely won't be pressing that when you see an attack coming in.If you're fine with only being able to use medium/large weapons for PVP and small, easily stunlocked enemies, or you're fine with summoning phantoms to pull aggro for you so you actually get an opportunity to attack without always being counterpunished, then by all means, try this game out. after I finish this game, I'm probably never going to replay it again, and only use the one character I have for pvp, but then again, even dark souls 2 does that better.Side note, I've noticed that elden ring plays practically identically to this game. It is very likely that elden ring will have the same identity issues where fromsoft tries to make a souls-style game and force a bloodborne combat pace on it, and combat will largely boil down to ""roll through attack, roll-attack, repeat"" with the occasional enemy that requires delayed rolls. large weapons will likely be unuseable against most bosses in solo play unless these new jump attacks are fast. fromsoft, this is not the way. your artists, modellers, level designers, etc. do good work, but holy fuck you need new programmers and gameplay directors, or you need to hire more playtesters, cause I'm legit confused as to how you managed to regress souls combat to basically be a 2 button game (roll, light attack), when ds2 was supposedly more rushed than this and yet made the combat BETTER.addendum Post-DLC: all the bosses in these DLCs are closer to a ds1 experience. what I mean by this is that they have movesets that can be beaten with a combination of clever movement and careful observation of what angles the bosses' moves cover, also there are no moves that come out faster than you can realistically react, unlike some of the base game bosses. it was actually pretty fun. I don't think it's a good idea to pay full price for this game just to fight the DLC bosses, though, and it may not be worth slogging through the base game just to get to the DLC."
Negative,we need the server back or we riot
Negative,"cant beat first boss, this game suck would not recommend"
Negative,"It's impossible to play this game without pad. Actually it is impossible to change settings for keyboard+mouse without pad. Luckily had one to find more shitty stuff in settings.- you can't sepratly set running, rolling etc- you can't use half of your keyboard to set keys (num, inserts etc. - had these on my mouse and rly tried to make it work)- you can't mix other keys than shift+something and ctrl+something- you can mix ctrl+left mouse but can't mix ctrl+right mouseActually I can't believe that somebody who created this have ever been playing mouse+keyboard.And yes, even tho I have pad I really don't like using it and this game is not fcking hardcore because of game but because of shitty controls.DO NOT BUY AS PC PLAYER!"
Negative,"Dark Souls III seemed like an interesting, challenging game. I was looking for a multiplayer game to play co-op with a friend so we gave it a try. After playing only 3 hours, I realize this game is not for me.Multiplayer sucks all my fun away. We can't progress through the second area without getting invaded. I just got this game, I'm a noob that just wants to enjoy the game with a friend. Apparently, that is not possible because you HAVE to put up with players invading you if you want to play co-op. Online forums are full of people defending this mechanic and I understand that some enjoy might it, but I also don't see any reason why there can't be a PvP toggle option. It makes no sense to me and simply leaves me frustrated. Who cares if that makes the game optionally easier? At least I and many others would be able to enjoy the game. Bottom-line: If you like hardcore PvP or you are looking for a challenging single player experience, this game might be for you. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
Negative,RCE exploit makes game unsafe to play fully. Company refuses to listen to the community and fix it.
Negative,I despise this game with a fire that burns hotter than the First Flame.
Negative,"Got the deluxe edition, had great expectations but mechanics made the game unplayable to me. Frame rate is capped at 60 and ingame helps gave me the infos in controller keybindings and I couldnt figure out a way to solve that porblem. Might be fun on console but the game feels like the devs didnt care about the pc aspect of the game. Btw camera is buggy too."
Negative,"I'm going to be straightforward with eveyrone. Darksouls 3 is a great game, just not for the PC. Hacker check. this game is overpopulated with hackers and the developers really aren't doing much to resolve it. Don't misunderstand me, not everyone you come across will be a hacker. Some players are really good and have spent hours perfecting their playstyle and then there are hackers. I've encountered some hackers that just don't care and outlandishly cheat in a way that is absolutely ridiculous, and then there's the dirtbags who cheat and try to pass themselves off as good. seasond players know what I mean but let me explain. Some hackers are so cheap that they alter their stats to have things like extra defeinse or attack. some individuals will do unlimited stamina, my all time favorite is preventing death. That's right, taking so much damage then preventing their health from reaching 0. So it's only natural for players to get banned after being reported that way the rest of the player base doesn't have to suffer.I wish it were true, but that same hacker that invaded your game two days ago is still invading in the same area and crashing your game, and sending them into an infinite death loop. Without video proof of the hacker in action, it takes a massive amount of reports before steam will look into it, and even than theirs no guarantee that the hacker will get vac banned. so either get gud at alt F4 or deal with it.Ok, maybe not deal with it. again the game is great! I spend hours it and every time I learn something new and find a different way to kill other players without the use of hacks or cheats, but hackers kill the game. Fear not because DS3 is on multiple consoles and on consoles, they perma band hackers, and cheaters.  So buy at your own risk it is your money, and if you think its worth hours spent dealing with hackers and cheaters then fire away or avoid pvp and being emberd which kills part of the game its self."

Negative,"Fuk developer, this game is good, I bought this game for co-op, I spent a few hours having fun with my friend, until today, I did not even see anyone to co-op, I'm sure this is a bug from the developer's server."
Negative,Me and my friend cant connect together and plyHe cant see my summon sign even when the password is usedSo far we only played together twice and most of the time he cant see my summon sign
Negative,"This is a great game.I can't say it's the best of the series, because I found that it's relatively easier than Dark Souls 1&2. The game is good but if you like ""soul series"" DON'T buy it here..Why? Because PC version lags constantly. I have a pretty good computer; and never before had any problems with a game. But this game has small freezes at autosaves (when you kill a monster it saves; when something drops to the ground it saves), it has some freezes when you rotate camera. I never seen a cheater online yet but I hope they'll deal with them sooner. So if you like ""souls series"" go buy a console and play there."
Negative,It's Dark Souls what else do I have to say?
Negative,This is a frustrating experience just don't play this lousy game.
Negative,played for thirty hours just for my save to be wiped by a hacker :(edit: just finished the game and when you dont get hacked its really good
Negative,king k rool approves! grod game! love !!!! i am make so happy with videwo UwU
Negative,"this game is a bit old however ive been playing since release on other consoles, the game is in a terrible state if youre looking for pvp fun, dont waste your time. the game is filled with exploiters glitchers and because its pc its also filled with hackers. little to no one doesnt utilize glitches or exploits the game is broken badly. if you just want the storyline aspect of the game go for it but ds2 story line is alot more fun to play through"
Negative,"Quick:1/5.  More disappointing nonsensical eye-candy masquerading as a deep, meaningful, fair, and challenging game-play experience; Dark Souls 3 is yet another disheartening descent into the franchise.  Hoping against all hope, and interested in seeing what so many other people adore from this IP, I have once again, against my own judgement, journeyed into the realm of questionable design and antiquated game mechanics that, in this instance, are commonly justified by a theme.  This game is better than its' predecessors, yet so similar in all the wrong ways, that it only reinforces my previous criticisms, and confirms my suspicions that the core game-play loop is broken... or at least idiotic.  This entire franchise is held aloft by talented artists, writers, animators and musicians... all the while, being subdued by gimmicky and goofy game direction.  This game, Dark Souls, and Dark Souls 2 are not good games.  In fact, they kinda suck.  Time will inevitably confirm this.  These games will not be played by new generations of gamers, and looked upon fondly.More:The artwork, animations, music, and lore of this game are amazing.  When you step into a new area, and look around, you will be often captivated by the beauty of this world.  Enemy designs, specifically bosses, are so outstanding that it's worth dying to them just to get a good look at them, sometimes.  There is so much about this game that I recommend you experience.  However, there is infinitely more about this game that I wish dies and never returns in any game ever again.  I hope that everything that has to do with the game-play of the Dark Souls games is eradicated from gaming as a whole, and becomes rightfully ridiculed in the future.At every turn, you the player, will be tricked while playing this game.  No... I do not mean to say that you will have your expectations subverted.  I mean to say that you will be tricked by the developers.  In more ways that I can even remember, now, I found myself thinking... ""what in the f*ck was that?"", while playing these games.  Enemies are strategically placed to get the jump on you all the time.  Bosses have moves with timing so strange, and awkward, that you will have to reprogram your brain to anticipate how things in our universe move.  There are traps, and surprises around almost every corner... so much that you begin to roll your eyes while anticipating them.  Enemies constantly mob you, swarm over you, and attack you repeatedly, denying you a chance to retaliate or get away.  You will find your health bar reduced to a sliver by an enemy move that you have no idea how to dodge.  Curses, toxins, poisons, and a myriad of other status effects will pop up from time to time, diverting your attention from the main objective, and forcing you to backtrack, or navigate a clumsy menu to fix what ails you.  This game should not even have weapons in it, because you're incentivized to just run past every enemy in the game, until you find the next bonfire.  This is always the most efficient way to play, and the least enjoyable.  Why would a game developer make a game less enjoyable to play on purpose?  This game is sh!t, and I will not be devoting anymore time to this franchise.  Dark Souls should have been a movie or a TV series... not a game.To quote one of the best game designers of all time, Sid Meier... ""Often, when a game's not working, we will ask, well... you know... who's having the fun here?  Is the designer having the fun?... or is the player having the fun?... or is the computer having the fun?  You know... if it's not the player that's having the fun at this moment... then something's wrong.""  No one is having fun in Dark Souls.  Something is wrong.  I've never had one moment of playing these games that was fun, in any sense of the word.  The only part of this game that I liked, was exploring the world, when not being chased or attacked by enemies.  Rare as it may be, it is enjoyable... but not fun.  If I was playing chess with someone, and I didn't understand the rules, I would feel the same way that I feel when playing Dark Souls.  Imagine that you think you're putting your opponent in checkmate, after sixty iterations of play and you think that you actually know what checkmate is... only for your opponent to inform you that he or she can switch the position of their king and any of their pawns on the board when they're in checkmate... because they're playing with the black pieces.  That feeling you would have, after being told this... after investing time into the game... after planning a strategy around the rules that you assumed were correct... that's the feeling of playing Dark Souls.  The feeling of being tricked.  Everyone has an innate sense for betrayal.  That sense will be tingling the entire time you play this game.  If you've ever had a friend that thought their pranks were the funniest thing in the world, and they performed them so much that you became irritated while correctly predicting them... then you've probably been friends with one of the developers of Dark Souls.This game is all about not explaining to you what is really going on, and expecting you to conduct a trial and error exercise repeatedly to finally make your way through it.  Dark Souls was not created with the player in mind.  It was created to stroke the egos of developers, and to hijack your reward centers in your brain to trick you into playing, and thinking that you're having a good time.  Why are the stats that you're leveling up not explained in-game?  Why are the covenants that you join not explained in-game?  So much of this world is just not explained... which is fine from a lore point of view... but not from a game-play point of view.  I should not be guessing what stats do, and what symbols on the stats screen mean.  I should not be wondering whether or not joining a covenant will change something critical to the story-line or not.  This game is a joke.  It is a fad.  It is a gimmick.  It will not stand the test of time. People tend to consort with raggamuffins and no-gooduns who are in no way a benefit to them.  When you ask these people why they bother with the dregs, they often respond with something about how the person makes them feel.  The socially marginalized has the greatest social perspective.  Meaning, the person on the outside of a relationship has more perspective on the relationship, than either of the two involved... because they're on the outside.  I watch people who play Dark Souls, and claim to love the game.... and I want to ask them... ""why do you keep doing this to yourself?""  There are better games to play.  Other games that will respect your time, and not trick you into wasting money, are everywhere.  Games that are actually fun... are everywhere.  I want to say things like... ""You deserve better..."" but I don't say these things.  If they want to play them... so be it.  However, I do take umbrage with the act of spreading the notion that these are good games.  They are not.  If you want to play them... fine.  But, don't drag the rest of us into your world of meaningless horror, and waste our money, to bolster your opinion that you're doing something worthwhile or fun.  You can date or befriend your deplorable miscreants all you want... but don't introduce him or her to my friends or family and expect me to not sound the alarm. Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2, and Dark Souls 3 are garbage."
Negative,"Love the Souls series but FromSoft has the implemented the same controller config issue all the other pc ports have. The fact that it even plagues Sekiro, an extremely young game is even more disappointing. Couple that with the fact that things like sudden camera spinning and loss of control have no consistent fix is also a minus."
Negative,Doesnt support steam cloud saves
Negative,It seems like they put the minimum effort into porting this to PC. Very frustrating to play at times because of all the clunkiness in the KB+M controls
Negative,"Coming from DS1, I find the design of DS3 to be inferior.1. Low boss variety. There are three duel-wielding skinny bosses; dancer, watcher and pontiff. Many humanoid bosses, and very lackluster, plain, vanilla, final boss (who the hell is this guy). Pales in comparison to Gwyn's aura and presence, because the entire DS1 is built on his story, so players know they are facing the legend. DS1 bosses, many being huge monsters, have more presence and feel more intimidating.2. Bad bonfire placement . Many are within walking or even viewing distance from each other. Appearance of bonfire after a boss defeat feels redundant. Loses the feeling of finding a haven out of a long and risky journey. It would be much better if every area has at most two bonfires, with one just before the boss room.3. Weak map design. DS1 again has more variety and feels more grandeur. Valley, forests, demon ruin, Lost Izalith, Anor Londo, Sen's fortress. Just compare the scope of Smoldering lake to Demon Ruin, or the DS3 catacomb with Nito's home.Overall, I'd give DS3 a 7/10. Still recommended to Souls fans but I'd suggest you play DS1 if that's the only Souls game you are gonna play."
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 on the PC is probably the worse I have played in a long time. I've heard great things about the Dark Souls series. But the PC is just a direct port from Xbox version. Your given instructions on the tutorial on how to play with an Xbox controller when your playing with a keyboard and mouse.Secondly, trying to change the key bindings to play the game is hectic. Two many functions for one key such as sprinting/rolling/etc. Not being able to change it where I can have one function to one button wasn't working out for me.The graphics and quality of the game may be good and the level design was great but overall the ease of using the controls ruined this game for me.If you plan to play this game, use a controller. It may work out better for you."
Negative,"Played this for three hours, got passed a boss to get to town and struggled with trying to link up with a friend to play co-op. Menus were a nightmare but at least it was fun to fight the monsters. Every time we managed to get together to play an area in co-op however, someone overpowered would come along and basically n00b stomp us. I don't mind the game being crazy difficult, we were expecting this, but when you're trying to get through story with a buddy it's disheartening to have a random person come in and literally slow walk at you because you can't hurt them and kill you in one hit. Every time one of your team dies, you have to go through the summoning thing again to rejoin your friend. You can't play co-op with your buddy without constant harassment and you can't just LEAVE the invader and go someplace else. Uninstalled, got a refund..."
Negative,"Game runs like absolute cr*p no matter the settings, runing it on low on a RX 570 I still get frame drops. Also the online is absolute garbage, the game's unbalanced, the anti-cheat is ineffective and it lacks a ping filter."
Negative,"I've been a die hard fan of this series since Demon's, Dark Souls 1 and 2 were satisfying and memoriable. Dark Souls 3 is just beautiful and recycled. The boss fights are harder with added mobs and broken patterns. Every f#ckn door you want to open doesnt open, and every summon doesnt summon. Not a matter of being salty or ""get gud brah"", its just broken. DS2 introduced new game mechanics (also from part of the DLC's) and completly new lore and world to explore, great armour and weapon designs, and kept the same spells settings. DS3 just seems uinfinished as you re-explore a ""DS1 remastered"", and weapons skills are only intriguing and limted to difference. There was a huge transition on changes and new introductions to gameplay from DS1 to DS2. Everything that was added has now been taken away in DS3. You can upgrade your weapons and sheilds which remains untouched, but you can not upgrade the most important factor of all, your armor. Many things arent carried over from DS2 which is a shame.Heres a rundown on what DS3 didnt carry over from DS2 and should've kept or at least expand a little more:- hex magic- new spells from DS2 that where either replaced or not added into DS3- ability to reduce the stat requirements of spells using spices- killing an NPC and resummoning them via gravestones and still talk and such- Pharros' lockstones- soul vessel- puzzles and platforming mechanics (such as the pillars in the Sunken King)- knocking down trees, breaking walls with firebombs- All new armor, shield and weapon designs (I may sound critical, but DS3 boss soul weapon and most greatswords almost all look the same and do the same skills. As for armor, DS3 recylcled many sets from DS1 and only the Farram set from DS2)- Rings, +1 and +2. This is can only be acquired from new game + and ++ in DS3. For the matter it wouldve made sense to have kept the Bonfire Ascetic, but that didnt carry over.- PVP arenas- PVE based covenants such as Pilgrims of Dark- Dual weilding was stat based, meaning you can dual wield any f#ckn weapon you want. - You can infuse boss soul weapons, such as fire infuse a Thorned Greatsword (already with a base lightning infuse)- The Bell Keepers- Life gems- Twinblades and Reapers and Lances. DS3 kept the reapers class, but only three scythes. And one lance. - A REAL epic dragon boss fight.Dark Souls 3 is a good game, one that expands on nostalgia and lore of DS1. But gameplay wise, its very linear. The only difficulty to the game is being overwhelmed by enemies with an endless supply of stamina and unsteady, unpredictable patterns. Poise stat is unbalanced and not working. Althouigh fan service is satisfying, I dont feel it being appreciated in this third installment."
Negative,"If you're a casual gamer, avoid this as it's pretty much halo 1's ""the library"" on legendary for the entire game. Be prepared to memorize every enemy location, and map layout after attempting to complete a level 30 or so times.The user interface is clunky and non-intuitive, the npc's flat and utilitarian. This is not an RPG, it's an action game. Know what you're purchasing here, I'd compare this to kingdom under fire, the circle of doom where the story was superficial to just wacking things with a new weapon; except everything can one shot if you miss a dodge or parry due to stun lock.For those who don't care about traditional RPG elements, there's a robust weapons system as dark souls has this in spades. Be prepared to grind however as the 'side quest' system is convoluted and highly conditional per playthrough if you missed certian events. The game offers no aid in terms of where to go for level layout or how to progress. It's very hard-core in that sense that there's no hand-holding, so new players will find themselves looking at walkthroughs by others to figure out what to do.If you enjoy the 'figure it out' and 'pure combat' aspects, then dark souls excells in that area above, and at the expense of all else. Just be prepared for the old-days punitive failing as opposed to the modern 'failing forward'. Also expect to lose hours of 'work' upon death if you can't reclaim your souls; so spend them early and often."
Negative,"My review will be negative until they fix all of the game's crippling performance issues.FROM software said that if you could play Scholar, then you could play DS3 just fine. My FPS in Scholar was constantly 60, yet in DS3, it drops down to less than 10, depending on where I'm looking!DS3 even auto calibrated my settings to high, indicating that I SHOULD be able to run the game effectively at those settings, yet the game still suffers terribly. Even when all of the settings are changed to LOW, the performance doesn't change! This means that there are serious problems originating from the developers, and that they must be fixed before you consider purchasing this game.Stay clear for now."
Negative,"This game was nowhere near ready to be released yet. Multiplayer is almost entirely unplayable. Other players appear to have no animations whatsoever and instead glide around the world and stare at enemies until they are dead. Crashing at almost every bonfire due to lighting bugs. This is insane. I would have expected these bugs with DS1, but this is the third game in and is easily the least polished of them all."
Negative,The game started crashing after about 40 hous of play time. My save file might be corrupted. I don't know but it's making me not want to play it.
Negative,this game fucking sucks
Negative,How do I roll?
Negative,About as fun as p*****g your pants and then being kicked in the b******s straight after.
Negative,Try index finger but hole
Negative,"The latest and greatest in the Dark Souls series is still unfortunately mired in FromSoftware's unique brand of incompetence. A boring combat system and intentionally frustrating level design make the game a chore to play from start to finish. It can be summed up as walk/roll behind an opponent and mash R1 till defeated. Occasionally, you'll need to raise a shield as the devs have opted to use attacks which can strike behind or immediately to the side of the enemy character (150°~180°) in order to compensate for this glaring design flaw.New to the entry are enemies so large they take up the entire screen. Yes, the age old FromSoftware problem of an odd and uncooperative camera makes a grand comeback in Dark Souls III, now with the issue of being unable to see much of anything at all! Early on it's some kind of odd goo creature emerging from common enemies, much like the mid-fight change of the first boss. Later on it's just very large creatures which jump all over the place, break your lock-on, and attack relentlessly. Speaking of, if you want to know the greatest improvement between DS3 and Sekiro it's the enemy stamina bar. Yes, the absence of other players ganking you in the middle of play is a very welcome change but your enemies   not  swinging relentlessly while your stamina bar slowly depletes or you attempt to roll away only to find yourself caught on some piece of terrain has the incredible ability of making FromSoftware's boring combat tolerable!And as they swing, of course they could never do any damage to one another, only ever to the player. Not only is the combat implicitly  not  designed for a melee of more than one enemy at a time due to the block feature only accounting for a rough ~35° area in front of the player but more importantly due to multiple enemies swinging through each other and blocking the player from moving around some obstacle or another. On exceptionally rare occasions the enemies will be designated as antagonists and can damage one another, most often when small mobs are a part of a boss fight.All of this critique neglects the very apparent acts of intentionally griefing the player as designed by FromSoftware themselves. Most notably in this work are the archers on some parapet or roof relentlessly firing arrows towards the player: The later you get, the worse it is. There's still the age old and tired, ""watch out for that pit, oh the enemies knocked you into it, lol,"" nonsense that made DS2 the worst in the series but not as much as before. All in all, Dark Souls 3 is a boring, simplistic game whose only challenge comes from the enemies high damage numbers. Cut them in half and this is an easy game with a lackluster combat system and convoluted mechanics. Is it worth your time? Not if you have anything else to doIs it worth your money? Maybe ~$10 for everythingRating: Very poorIf you want a third-person action game with a lock-on system, difficult combat, and an excellent story give NieR: Automata a try.If you want a better FromSoftware game with similar mechanics then I would recommend Sekiro. It might only be a 60/100 but it's much better than this mess."
Negative,it doesn't go on sale
Negative,"game crashes for me too much to progress, for some reason this is the only souls game that crashes. Will update review when game works fine with me."
Negative,"Game won't run in 21:9 resolution. There's a mod that supposedly fixes it but that didn't work either. Nor did editing the .exe with a hex editor. Avoid if you have a 3440 x 1440 or 2560 x 1080 monitor.Edit: I finally got the game working in 21:9 with the Souls Unsqueezed mod. It was a hassle but it worked. Now the main problem is the game itself. There is no mode for playing co-op with a friend that doesn't involve getting ganked by player killers. Very disappointing and unenjoyable.Edit 2: I don't play the game online otherwise and here's a great reason why: A friend of mine nagged me until I went online and embered in order to fight him in PVP. While waiting for him to put down his summon sign, I was force-summoned to someone else's world without any option to deny or refuse, and then forced to accept multiple items with names like '?GoodsName?' and icons that were just a picture of the red words 'TEST DATA.' I cannot drop or sell these items either, and am simply awaiting being banned from playing online as a result of having hacked items.Fuhuck yourself From, you are the shitest of game developers."
Negative,lower the price on these oldFromSoftware games!
Negative,THIS GAME IS A RAGE GAME IT SUCKS (I realised i was in caps) i hate it with all my soul
Negative,Server always down. Less love given by the dev for pc gamers. Don't buy.
Negative,Playing this game makes you sound like your having a fight in an empty room.....
Negative,Too many enemies crowded and too many ambushes.
Negative,bring the servers back and publicly execute cheaters
Negative,"Game was advertised as ""Available on Geforce Now"" and then 2 weeks later they remove support for it even when recently they tweeted out saying how Geforce Now has their support, Pretty scummy and clear that they only understand $ figures."
Negative,"Really love having my save deleted 23 hours in. Super neat. Great game, guys."
Negative,it took 100 hours form me and in return it gave me ptsd fuck this game
Negative,I have the iq of a pickle jar
Negative,i love this game however the game Stutters often enough to sour the whole experience. trying to fix said stuttering hasn't lead anywhere so i cannot recommend this game.
Negative,"Used to be fun. PvE is still great.Play offline if you're new. Even if you're not new, play offline until NG+ unless you can get someone to drop you decent rings and gear because every single invader and every single host are twinks.Tip for new players: The size and shape of your weapon has little to do with the area it actually hits. Your actual range is determined by whatever randomly sized hitbox the devs decided to give it plus or minus your ping (it can go either way)"
Negative,"If you want to play this game, get it for console. The PC port is abysmal. it's single threaded so youhave to change your bios, your graphics card settings, your bios settings, your application settings, and essentially hobble your PC to play online. save your money buy something else."
Negative,"I want to say I really enjoyed DS3 up until my 3rd New game+ where I got banned for ???????!?????

Negative,"Far shorter and smaller in scope than darksouls 2.Yes Its very pretty in places but itjust seems to half bakedNPCS have very VERY little dialogue. leval types repeat, Bosses are uninterestingCountless features and items from previous games removedLors is ignored and not even attempted to be balanced.Worth a play but a terrible end to the souls series"
Negative,People get banned for playing in offline mode / 10
Negative,why tf does this game no have cloud saves???
Negative,"Man Dark Souls 1 was so fun I wish I could buy it again, So I bought Dark Souls 3."
Negative,"Dark Souls III is one of the best entries in the series, beautiful visuals, remarkable story, and exhilarating combat. I 10/10 recommend you play it. But not on Steam (PC), the game heavily favors consoles in the realm of support and features. For example, THIS GAME DOES NOT SUPPORT STEAM CLOUD SAVES. Such a basic feature is still missing if you plan to play this on multiple computers or switching between your Steam Deck and PC that's NOT (I understand as PC players we have work around's) going to happen. FromSoftware makes great games, there's no questioning that, but they also tend to rest on their newly found laurels, they lack support, they take a long time to fix errors and bugs and treat PC customers as second-class citizens. Even on the console side they tend to favor PlayStation over Xbox. If you're looking to get into souls and PC is your only option, try Dark Souls Remastered, if you have a console get it on console. If you love to tinker and none of this fazes you, great! No worries here, just be careful because even the slightest modification or self-fix can & will get you banned."
Negative,"This game has great visuals and a cool concept but what made me not like the game is the limited mechanics and controls the game offers. For mechanics, you can only do light or heavy attack and dodge in combat, maybe use an item to make your weapon do slightly more damage. The controls almost made me stop before I got to the end as the camera can go crazy on some boss battles and the lock on is very lazy as it will quickly stop locking on as soon as you move a little away from an enemy to heal. I understand why people can enjoy the challenge this game offers but for me I want a little more variety and better control."
Negative,"Bandai seems to lie about what is a ban-able offence and how long a ban last I tried to change the controller icons from xbox to pc and got ban, the ban seems to never lift."
Negative,"I own all three games, and though I desperately WANT to like this series, I just can't seem to.For me, it comes down to my character, not the enemies.  Swing a weapon, and you will find yourself doing so much slower, and with a lot more vulnerable paralysis than you will in almost any other game.  You feel sluggish.  Your parries and dodges have to be perfectly timed, and you also have to dodge in the correct direction.  I play a game like Dragon's Dogma, which has enemies that are also impossibly large, have wide, sweeping attacks, and move quicker than the player.  But it's a lot more fun because my character is more responsive.  If I die, it's because I made a mistake, not because I was waiting for my character's animation to finish so I could do something again.But worst of all is the stamina.  This game is all about resource management, as stamina is used up in everything you do.  Attack, block, dodge, run.  And once it's gone, you can't do anything.  So on top of trying to fight, you constantly have to keep one eye on your stamina bar to make sure it doesn't go too low.  It's just not fun.The 'difficulty' comes from the fact that you frequently face opponents with very wide hit areas in small, cramped spaces, that once you get hit, you are absolutely PUNISHED for it, frequently combo-locked until the enemy is done with you, and can be hit repeatedly before your character has even stood back up.  It also comes from the fact that enemies respawn if you even look at a bonfire too long while thinking about whether its worth it to try and use it to heal up.  You die, you drop all your souls.  You die on your way to get those souls back, they're gone forever.  You get a pitiful amount of souls for rather difficult enemies, requiring you to farm repeatedly, with the constant risk of death.  And you will often fight the camera, and find enemies that will jump out at you with an attack from vantage points your camera can't possibly see, or who are in areas you may not be able to reach if you don't have a ranged attack.All of that does indeed add up to 'difficult', but difficult in the way Ninja Gaiden for the NES was.  That game, too, was very difficult, as every time you tried to jump over a pit, a bird would fly in to try and knock you down it.  It's a very cheap-feeling style of difficulty.  And let's face facts:  Exactly zero people enjoy farming.  People program bots to get out of doing it.  This game requires it, and requires a LOT of it.Bow and Magic take a back seat to Melee.  No matter how you build your character, you won't be anywhere near as effective as a melee brawler is.  This severely hampers what initially appears to be a wealth of options down to one:  Melee character with bow/magic support.  And that's a shame, because I dearly love a bow, but everything from the severely limited lock-on range to the rather shoddy first-person cam on the longbow shows that ranged combat was pretty much an afterthought in this game.Have a controller, because while this version is FINALLY playable with a keyboard and mouse (only took them three tries to make a proper port), it's certainly sub-optimal.I have tried very, very hard to like all three of these games, but I just can't.  My biggest regret is that I didn't learn from the original, and kept thinking they would get better.  It's really just more of the same as the last two.If you still think you'd enjoy it, wait for a sale with a steep discount."
Negative,this game needs guns i dont care if this takes place before the industrial revolution add guns!!!!!
Negative,Online play an interactions are completely jank despite the game being out for so long.
Negative,Cant sex firekeeper
Negative,"DONT BUY THIS GAME.The single player is good... 10/10I bought this game for me and a friend. Suddenly after I got disconnected from steam, I get banned from the online servers.   Now I cant see any summon signs, only messages on the ground. This is not acceptable for a game to this price. The ''cheating'', Penalty system for leaving games whitout pressing ''QUIT GAME'' is fucking hilarious. THIS IS PURE SHIT! 0/10.THIS GAME IS PURE GARBAGE if you want to enjoy it online.THE END"
Negative,"It's ok, I played it through, did every boss, got gud etc etc. It was average.  It's 'console-hard' plus 80s game design.  Pve is just a)fighting the sucky ass camera at all times and (b) repeating the boss until you remember all his moves, just straight up rote repetition.The fov is set to 43!  One level is all monsters with human heads and bug bodies, the next level is bug heads on human bodies. otherwise its mostly skeletons, zombies and  poison blobs.  Its just odd and eventually boring.The art design has no actual theme or reason for it because there's no actual story.  There's bits of lore on all the weapons etc you pick up but even with that it doesnt really explain anything.  Just look at the wikis, its mostlty peoples interpretations from the disjointed bits and pieces.  There are like 8 quests total and none of them have any sort of markers. explanations, introductions, or official rewards.  You'll pick up a ring or a weapon or you'll miss it and the 'quest giver' will die and you'll get to loot them for their armor or something.I mean I got all the quests done because I went slowly and with wiki on a tablet to maKe sure I got everything.  I even got the 'good' ending which is a 2 second cutscene with no dialogue, exposition or anything else.  I still have no idea what  is going on or why anything is the way it is."
Negative,"1/10 Game doesn't know what it wants to be. It's a terrible mix of Bloodborne and Dark Souls. It took all the great aspects of both games and tried to combine them into a great one but failed to give any kind of forgiveness for mistakes. Before you say git gud, I have NG+7 character on both first Dark Souls games. This game felt disrespectful to my time, every single encounter is spam roll to get out of a death combo or get nearly one shot. Combat was way too aggressive and felt really unrewarding. 1000 health fells like it's meaningless."
Negative,"The soulsborne games are masterpieces of level design and story, and Dark Souls 3 is no different. It's an excellent game with difficult, rewarding gameplay and a rich plot with plenty of side quests and hidden areas. There are a bunch of walkthroughs and boss tutorials online that should help make it a challenge instead of an exercise in futility for new players.That said, when playing the Steam version, it's very clear that this game was designed for console and really, REALLY wants you to at least use a controller to play. The tutorial area in the beginning has all of the controls and tooltips listed for an Xbox controller rather than a keyboard. The game gives you the option to hook up an Xbox controller an Xbox controller to play, but if you're like me and prefer mouse and keyboard, you're pretty much out of luck. I had to look up how to change weapons because there is now right trigger on my keyboard. If you want to play on more than one device, which is the main reason the PC version of any game is better than console, imo, you're screwed there too; this game doesn't have cloud save. I had to jury rig a way to create a Google Drive folder that contains my character info, then tell every device to draw from that file rather than the normal save data. And yeah, this works, technically, but it also crashes very often and is almost unplayable.In short, this is really an exceptionally good game, especially if you like a challenge and memorable boss fights, but it's also the laziest port of a game I have ever seen. I got it on sale for $15 and I'm still insulted they charged that much for such a poorly made Steam adaptation. If you're really interested in this game, either get it for console, or be aware that you're in for a more than usually difficult journey."
Negative,"Like all of the Dark Souls games this is excellent. The main game is brilliant. The DLC is great. At the time of release I would have given this a glowing review. However, that was then (when the game worked perfectly) and this is now...when it doesn't work, and hasn't for quite some time.I bought it upon day one, and was making good progress. Almost finished the main game, one piece of the DLC, and was making progress with the second DLC. Then I had to restart it all, and as I was getting my butt kicked I stopped playing it for a long time (about a year and half passed till I tried it again). When I eventually decided to start it up again...it does the sum total of sweet FA.Every time I try to load it, it just twiddles its thumbs for thirty seconds and then dies on me, and I haven't found any solution for fixing this. Not everyone is affected by this problem, but I can't really recommend a game where it's a crapshoot as to whether it will play or not. When the publishers / developers don't bother to sort it (and by now never will) and there isn't a fix or a mod to get it working, then you could be wasting your money.With steam refunds you'd have nothing to lose if it doesn't work, but as someone who had made a fair bit of progress through all of the content it's rather annoying that it's now useless. So a negative it is!EDIT: I should clarify the difference between the time of review, and the time of playing. For the best part of, I'd say, two years, this wouldn't work for me at all.Then, for whatever reason, it began to work, but I am permanently banned from online play. Despite never actually doing anything wrong in the first place. I cannot summon anyone to help me now, as the means for reversing the bans has long since stopped being active.With this issue remaining I will not change this to a positive review. The game is great, and I have been able to play it since, but in a compromised state."
Negative,"Honestly when playing through Dark Souls 3 i feel a lot of the same things i feel from my extensive experience with Dark Souls 2. Unfinished, unpolished, and underdeveloped. whole systems are missing or broken in service of design shortcuts so the devs could make enemies that not only are not fair; theyre blatantly anti-player to the point where certain areas actually feel like theyre trying to get the player to quit. Not worth buying, for either newcomers to the series or old veterans."
Negative,"I don't get the hype, the lighting looks terrible and everything is flat and gray. Also the games controls are pretty weird and not quick to respond for how difficult the game is. It also is just an ugly game. There are two colors in dark souls 3 grey and washed out gray."
Negative,"not enough bosses and glitches, not worth the price"
Negative,I just got perm banned before leaving the main menu after I plugged my PS5 controller in and reloaded the game lol. Fuck 'em
Negative,not that hard
Negative,Elden Ring on crystal meth
Negative,"I beat this game out of spite of the annoying ""git gud"" community. I got good, but the game never did."
Negative,">:(   MAN I CANT DO IT!!!! I want to play this game but these retards didn't set up a pc system for it. So your stuck guessing what the controls are and its soooooooooo bad I couldn't even figure out how to log the f out of the game!Even though i could look past the fact that the character looks like trash no mater how long you spend trying to fix him up.The game still is not worth playing not even for FREE till they fix the controls for PC, btw dont go on my word youtube it!There are videos showing how bad it sucks on pc with these controls"
Negative,"It's funny. 5 years after the game was released. There is still no update to support mouse and keyboard keys.The manufacturer reminds us that I do not care about the mouse and keyboard.The camera is not really useful in this era.Witcher 3 was launched in 2015 and has done an excellent job in this regard.From now on, I will try not to go to Souls Like games and not buy them.They all use the same core and highly nerve-wracking camera.I bought this game at a discount, even at a discount it was not worth buying."
Negative,"This game is totaly retarded.1. It is horribly buggeg: graphical artifacts all the time, sometimes locations not even load, phantoms are often not able to join boss fight and other ""funny"" bugs.2. Bonfires are EVERYWHERE. If you killed more than 5-10 enemies and haven't found a new bonfire something went wrong. There are often 2 bonfires in a row even without any mobs between them, you have to walk 10 meters to reach 2nd.4. Enemies are animeish (no in a good (Jojo) way).4. It is EXTREAMELY easy and short. New game+ is easy mode. Bosses are trivial.5. Target locking system is horrible, if u lock on someone and make a step back (or he does) you loose target.6. If u slowly step back most of enemies will miss with EVERY attack.7. NPCs have ALMOST NO dialogs.8. Network: often phantoms are not animated at all and don't get any damage from enemies.9. Most of game mechanics are now adapted to be used by degenerated ppl. For example, roll gives you INSTANT invulnerablity even if it is a fat roll, if you come from back side of enemies you will do backstab almost always.TL;DR: Slightly better than DS 2, but a horrible game. It is a bonfire litting simulator. You must be a retard to like it. DO NOT BUY IT. IT DOESN'T WORTH ITS COST."
Negative,"I love the game but cannot play it because of low FPS, even on the lowest settings I'm only getting 30 FPS. And even after that I am still having constant frame rate drops. Can someone please help, nobody else seems to have any issues but me. HELP!!!"
Negative,"The game is good. The world looks amazing, bosses are very good designed and the combat is decent enough.The only reason why this game recieves a downvote from me is the fact that From once again pushed out a poorly optimized game. So poorly that it literally went to poop as soon as it did hit release.75% of the community were upset about the mess and it toned down after a while. Now its only 25% consisting of mainly AMD users which still get lag from hell due to their bad job on optimization.Intead of working on a patch to fix the lag for the rest though, they push out balancing patches for weapons or the overall game.After the big banwave they actually started working on a serious issue, which is good. The ban-hackers have to be dealt with. Yet that is no excuse for the time before.We are one month and a few days more in and the game is still unplayable for most AMD users, including myself.I am forced to play on 20-25 FPS on any resolution or graphical setting with heavy stutters.,which forces me to play offline. This is a big issue as singleplayer is only a tiny part of the game."
Negative,"The game itself is awesome, and I really enjoy playing it. However, my experience with the admin and tech support has been terrible. After a hacker destroyed my character, I reached out to support to explain the situation, hoping for a solution. Unfortunately, despite providing all the details, I was banned for no reason. When I contacted support, they told me that if I was banned, it would be permanent, without considering the circumstances or the fact that it was due to a hacker. It's frustrating that the support team doesn't seem to care about the players' issues or the situation with the character. This has been a very disappointing experience. I love this game very much and still play nowadays... offline of course."
Negative,"God awful game- Metal looks like charcoal- Character creation is limited- Physics are comical - Animation is below par- Camera gets stuck in bad positions constantly- The combat is point move attack not look at attack which makes your character attach backwards to where you're facing - which is just stupid.- Bosses provide a challenge but are too hard with the poor game-play mechanics.- User Interface is boring and a convoluted- The lighting is far far too bright for a game called Dark souls- There is zero stealth- Much too linear - fight this enemy or don't proceed- Very Very poor for PC, they didn't even bother to take out all the dumb console button tips"
Negative,i am cool
Negative,Babby's first mildly challenging action game
Negative,this game fucking sucks
Negative,Elden Ring was first dark souls game I played. Then played Sekiro. Sadly this game is too outdated.
Negative,"Writing this review while fighting the dancer, and the dev team deserves this"
Negative,"By far, the worst souls game in the series. PvE is unfun and tedious, PVP is cancer and gank squads fill every area. There are no redeeming features to this game. 100%ing this requires either braving that absolute toxic bullshit, or farming for 8+hours for covenant drops."
Negative,beating dark souls iii (three) ((3)) made my penis big
Negative,Game was too difficult and STUPID. I spent 173 hours trying to beat that funny Gunder guy and gave up. They should add an easy mode so game reviewers like me can play the game good. 10/10
Negative,pvp can be super broken
Negative,this is great for wasting time. literally nothing else
Negative,Played this game for 2 hours. Killed the first big boss and attacked the second guy in the throne room. I don't know If I was supposed to kill him but i kept dying. I'm pretty decent at video games and it doesn't cater to those learning the game very well.
Negative,"Before you buy this game, you need to understand this game is for serious hardcore gamers. I'll be honest, you need a lot of skill to play this game and a hack like me just wants to casually tune out after a hard week at work isn't good enough to play this. You get killed so often if you don't learn the battle dynamics, the camera angles can really suck when dealing with multiple enemies or a large enemy. There is no story to this game. You just go around completing stages and cut scenes don't really have any depth. I think the hardcore gamers love the challenge but if you're not that serious, then this game might not be for you."
Negative,"Great game, but some major problems like the anti cheat, if you play offline or play when steam is down,as it does happen from time to time, and you make decent headway you can be flagged as cheating and the great multi player game goes to single player only. Couple that with the fact the publisher will not unban you even if your saves are deleted and your game is reinstalled. They have zero interest in working with you to solve any problems. I would suggest you dropping your 60-85 dollars elsewhere, as I myself will not be buying another game made by disinterested developers that have zero customer service. Sadly I did spend the $85 for the deluxe, don't make my mistake."
Negative,"still trying to understand why they randomly decided to put an ear piercing loud scream into an empty room, this game is supposed to be somehow better than DS II and idk on what planet that is true on because the only metric this game exceeds at is amount of weapons to pick up and even then, most of the PvE isn't susceptible to the cool things those weapons do, it's still FROM and so it's still way better than a Soulsclone but this is the worst thing these devs have ever released between now and 2009 this game is so bad i refuse to even dignify it with punctuating this review"
Negative,"After The Ringed City and thousands of patches later. I don't recommend this game. Because Fromsoft caters to whiners and casuals. When it used to be Git Gud, Fromsoft nerfs everything. I'm going back to the first Dark Souls where it isn't touched by From's need to make everything easy."
Negative,if you are any sane person you will not buy this game. It will suck your life away while leaving you with a strong possibility that you will break something. all in all tho i hate this game but its like a drug i dont want to get rid of
Negative,"Dark sword is not renamed Dark Dark Sword upon Dark Gem infusion, I believe that this has not only failed the gaming community but has failed me on a personal level as well 10/10"
Negative,"Few Games come with co-op, but the co-op in this one, specifically with a friend leaves a lot to be desired. Stranger dynamics are slightly better.The story is that I get invaded constantly by cheater modders and the game does not facilitate quitting, but the devs punish you for it, threatening you with bans and inability to connect with your partner. The game facilitates these cheater kids who have gotten bored with the normal gameplay and just are looking for PvP constantly, overwhelm you in numbers, presumably the rewards for it are completely worth it. The game is destroying its storyline and fairness and fails to consider PvP consent.The game makes my partner very weak, even if we aren't even getting invaded, and the lag on his side is very high, as he's probably joining a closer server to me when he co-ops with me. Definitely not a game for co-op with people from Nz, Aus from what I read and gather."
Negative,"If you're like me and played Elden Ring before this, you will be extremely disappointed. Essentially, Elden Ring is Dark Souls 4. Huge portions of this game's mechanics are copy/pasted into Elden Ring, which sounds great, but unfortunately it took them 4 games to get it right... -You can't level up at campfires. You need to fast travel back to base to level then fast travel again to get back to where you were.-Campfire placement is awful. I need to fight 20-30 units to get from the nearest campfire to attempt the boss again.-Trash mobs have a confusing risk reward balance. There are special units around that are often more difficult than the bosses in the same area because of the area you need to fight them, but these special units don't drop anything. Why are they here?-There is no map so exploration is deterred even if you want to explore.-The jumping mechanic... just wow lol. Have you ever seen a cooking show where the judge will say if you messed it up don't put it on the plate? They should not have a jump mechanic in this game. It's that bad and serves no real purpose. For some reason it reminds me of mount riding in Diablo 4.This is sitting at like a 6/10 right now for me, but maybe that will go up with more play time."
Negative,"Well, I gave this game a try, despite my experiences with Dark souls 2, and I am disappointed in DS3.To the loyal Dark souls fans; I probably won't convince you to not buy this game as you've probably already bought and enjoyed it, but I can tell you that you should still get the Watchdogs mod if you want to PvP or remain offline. The hackers still seem to be an issue, even after 4 years. I'm sure the hackers have calmed down a bit, but it's still getting downloads so I'm sure it's still relevant.To anyone who might consider buying Dark souls 3: Know that the game has a lot of issues, even compared to previous games. Therefore I cannot recommend buying this. Try Dark souls 1 instead, it also has issues but isn't as immersion or game breaking.Here are some of the issues I encounter in Singleplayer: The character creator is bad.It's a ported game.Game has input lag and queuing.No PC control tutorials.Unfair balancing, even for a souls game.Enemies hit through walls and other enemies.Every room is a trap, which gets annoying rather than challenging.Lack of direction (good and bad).Multiplayer issues (PvP and Coop), I only tried coop and got ganked once: Coop matchmaking isn't good and is like that as a design choice in all souls games. It's much improved since DS1 and 2, as you can get a password to only summon your friends. Though, it's still needlessly difficult as story progression is not shared like in most other games. So you'll have to go through the levels twice if you want to progress together.Gankers are everywhere, especially after a sale, and the PvP balance is atrocious. If the ganker is an experienced DS3 player, he would have already gotten all the best weapons and armor. This isn't skill based, it's literally just pushing two buttons and winning for them. Not saying that beating them is impossible, just saying only a DS3 veteran can beat a DS3 veteran. Which is honestly not very fun and ruins the coop experience when that happens.DS2 and DS3 has a hacker problem. There were hackers in DS1, but they weren't as malicious as they are now. In DS3 they can literally ban you from playing PvP ever again, by giving your player character vast amounts of souls and extremely powerful equipment. It's the game's way to stop hackers, which can remove non-hackers too. It's completely ridiculous and shouldn't be happening. Yet it has been happening for 4 years and is still happening.Even with all these negative points, there are some parts of the game that are good.Positives: An interesting grim dark story.Interesting characters.Amazing looking armor and weapons.Cool and expressive animations.The world looks great.Fantasy setting.Structured RPG system.Final statements: I didn't play the game for long, but I have known the warning signs from playing Dark souls 2. It seems to revel in being unfair for the sake of being unfair. Dark souls starts off the game like that, but the game isn't defined by it. Dark souls used to be games that reward skill rather than pure knowledge of the game, which doesn't seem to be the case for the early game in DS3. Even DS2 had a level of reward for skill!I can still understand why people like the game, but I simply don't like it and can't recommend it because of it's many issues.."
Negative,A very bad port from console to PC.  All the tips in game reference controller buttons and no not match the keyboard settings.
Negative,Input buffering from hell /10Its a cesspit of fan service from the previous games. 80% of weapons and armors are just rehashed from previous games.This one is a disgrace.
Negative,"Is a game worth my limited time? (Trigger Warning for fanboys/girls) This is a question I have to ask myself every time I want to buy a new game. When I looked at Dark Souls 1 a while ago, I asked myself the same question and bought it, although I was worried it might disappoint me because of its difficulty. What I got was a great RPG with an amazing interconnected world and tactical combat that made you think and learn every time you made a mistake. Sometimes it killed you, but most of the time you had a fair chance of getting out of a bad situation. It wasn't over until it was over. With Dark Souls 3 things drastically changed. Instead of an open world, I got linear level design, a less complex story and a more action oriented R1-spammy approach to combat. Every mistake was immediately punished with death and a 1-3 minute walk back to where you died. The walking was the same and sometimes even worse in Dark Souls 1 but in that game it didn't happen so often, and I always knew what was the reason for my death.  Dark Souls 3 has many weaknesses in comparison to its predecessor, but the most glaring issue for me was its way faster combat. The thing about DS1's difficulty was that it punished greed and carelessness with damage, resource loss and sometimes even death. It wasn't meant to be super hard, it just became that way because of its mechanics. DS3 on the other hand was made with the intention to be super hard. Often it felt like the developers saw the ""DS is so hard"" memes on the internet and decided to just focus on that instead of an overall good and fair game. Every enemy has some superfast out-of-nowhere attacks, which are not only super deadly, but also super unpredictable. This made combat much more frustrating than it should have been, while at the same time didn't add anything good or fun to my experience. It was just difficult for the sake of being difficult. This issue became more obvious with the bosses of DS3. DS1 had some amazing, some ok and one very bad boss (Bed of Chaos I hate you forever), but they were all manageable. The reason why that was the case is, because they gave you room and time to observe their moves. Even the faster bosses like Artorias or Gwyn left the player with enough time to think about their next action. In DS3, mainly because of its fast combat system, this is not the case with most bosses. You either react correct instantly, or you will most likely get one-shot to hell and back. They rarely expose themselves to attacks, and their combos last so long that you will eventually make a reaction mistake and immediately die for it. Where Dark Souls 1 was about resource management and learning from your mistakes during the fight, DS3 because of its superfast combat is all about reaction speed. You die, and then you learn from it (or not) which makes the fights more frustrating and annoying than they had to be.After I finally (after 12 attempts) beat Vordt of the Boreal Valley, I only felt exhausted and was in a bad mood. It wasted so much of my time that day that even the final blow to Vordt did not feel any good. I was just tired and shut down the game. I carried on, seeking for the fun in the rest of the gameplay, but it did not come. Instead, the village area made me realize what I hated about the exploration gameplay in comparison to Dark Souls 1: the normal enemies. Nearly every enemy in DS3 is capable of killing you within 1 to 2 hits, and it was designed to be this way because it had to be ""SuPeR dIfFiCuLt"". While this was also the case with some elite mob in DS1, the normal foes you encountered in the first game existed mainly to test your planning and resourcefulness. If you got hit, then it rarely meant sudden death. You had to use a healing item, learn from your mistakes and move on. If you get swarmed, it was probably your fault and you would learn from it. In the village area of DS3 there are 3 enemy types that are specifically made, to kill you: the mages, the saw dudes and the pot dudes. Their attacks are so fast, unpredictable and strong, that one hit most of the time meant stun lock to death. Getting killed by these mobs often without a chance of attack stunning or evading them, I got so demotivated to go on an exploration trip that i usually just ran straight to the next bonfire to skip these enemies. Then I reached the icy-sword-hand doggo in the basement below the big elevator tower. It was yet another very strong, very unpredictable enemy that was just designed to check if you could react fast enough. There was no planning, no resourcefulness needed to kill him, just reaction speed. AGAIN.This was the moment when I realized that I did not enjoy or will ever really enjoy any part of the game. So I quit the game and uninstalled it and I don't feel ashamed, but relieved. To all those who now shake their heads and say: ""you are weak"" or ""git gud"" I reply: I easily beat DS1 so no, I am not weak. I just don't enjoy the game. I understand that many people like the more action oriented, fast and reaction based combat in DS3, but I don't, which is why Dark Souls 3 is sadly not worth my limited time.I give Dark Souls 3: 55/100 (most points go to graphics, animations and the fact that it works as intended)Hope I didn't trigger any of the elitist DS3 players.Darken0id"
Negative,"While I've enjoyed the previous Dark Souls series for its cooperative elements and occasional PVP, Dark Souls 3's implementations have completely ruined the game for me. This is a terrible game to get into as a new player or anyone who wants to get into it for cooperative gameplay, with the lack of a small soapstone in this game regaining embers (humanity/effigys in DS3) is very difficult and limited early on. The lack of soul memory allows low level characters to be easily equipped as a twink. As a run through with my first character I kept track of a majority of my invasion fights; don't be fooled by other reviews or threads regarding pvp. The game would be so much better, PVP included, if there weren't so many people trying to newb-bash.Play this game if you enjoy being killed by:- Permanently invisible greatbow users who nearly oneshot you from the rooftops within your first two hours of the game.- People with three times your hit points and twice as many estus flasks uses as you, oh, and their potions full heal them while you have to drain all of yours to full heal. - People who like to swap between five different boss weapons with different augmentations to bypass your shield through the course of their epic tumble-and-estus circus-clown battle with you and your starting gear.- People who are there to troll you. Not only with their superior equipment and estus flasks, but with their endless supply of consumables and ammunition, they'll lolligag around near the big monsters in your area to prolong a stalemate until you get bored and try to push for progress.- A community of people who want to add you on steam to trashtalk about how you should 'git gud' because you only have five hours with the game compared to their five hundred.- People who really like gymnastics. (Based on actual gameplay)"
Negative,"I love Dark Souls 3, but I have to give a bad review because of the major inconvenience I'm experiencing just now.There is no Steam Cloud save, yet the first game had it. The game save was located in the roaming appdata folder. (whoever thought this is a good idea can have their teeth kicked down their throat)If you reset your computer via the built in Windows function your game will be deleted unless you retrieve your app data from the Windows.old folder within 30 days of your fresh install. 87 hours lost. So mad at FromSoftware."
Negative,this game is cancer
Negative,It just ain't worth it.
Negative,"Pros------Decent fan serviceGreat dialogue and voice actingBeautiful graphicsMusic is fantasticBosses looked visually stunning and had smooth animationResponsive PVE combatCons-----------All enemies, including bosses basically felt like the same fight over and over againDLC is meh, up to Dreg Heap was good the rest seemed lazyArmour has a tiny impact on your characterCovenants are no funLost interest in PVP super fastHonestly in my opinion I just wanted this game to end after getting about half way through...Not sure where I even stand with NPC story lines to be honest, its half and half"
Negative,Multiplayer component is just a shit show with clowns hiding from you and ruining imersion.
Negative,Never ban cheaters. Victims are banned everytime though. 'dahell is this policy?
Negative,No FOV slider? I dont support Devs who refuse to put basic game options into their game and then Ban people for adjusting their FOV with a mod. The narrow FOV combined with wonky camera controls are nauseating to anyone who gets motion sickness easily.
Negative,"Crash Souls 3 is a memory leak/crash simulator. It is advertised as the sequel to Dark Souls 2 but is clearly meant to be satire as I was actually able to run that game longer than thirty minutes before a major crash. One might say that the crashes are a ""Feature"" for ""added difficulty"" and while that is a sound argument, only viruses regularly crash a program so hard that users get blue screens of death or have to unplug their computer to unfreeze it. All in all, Crash Souls 3: Bug Boogaloo could have been an amazing game if it wasn't a joke entry."
Negative,"I want to love this game, but I can't. The Parry system is garbage and the only way to hit anything with a ranged attack is to target it, and the targeting system severely limits your FOV and movement/dodge capabilities. I probably shouldn't have played this after Greedfall, but it is what it is."
Negative,"Basically the Star Wars reboot of the Souls franchise.It's a huge letdown that they brought the action oriented combat from Bloodborne to the Dark Souls series and transformed it into a fast attack spam fest.Gone is the poise and risk of enemies trading with you and coming out on top, now you just R1 spam like a room temperature IQ people-person and win.If you ever wondered how someone can have thousands of hour in TF or Train Simulator, this is me with Dark Souls. I am very passionate about Dark Souls and have well over 1000 hours in the first game and hundreds more in the second, played the rest of the series too. I was very active in pvp-ing (dueling, twinking, invading) and cooping (summoning people and being summoned). Attempted speedruns and a huge variety of builds (from Pyro SL1 to fist only or the standard Quality or mage build). I think this somewhat makes me knowledgeable about the series.While Dark Souls 2 tried many new things and it succeeded with some, failed with other, Dark Souls 3 really does not try anything new and sticks to the familiar characters, lore, world and feels like a huge pander. And this is the point of it all, it has become a pander to the ""hardest game ever"" and ""so many deaths"" meme brought by casuals and journalists and they artificially increased the difficulty by increasing the number of enemies while one on one feels very easy due to the already mentioned R1 spam stunlock. Meanwhile bosses are a joke with just either strafing to the right while hugging their balls or figuring out the gimmick and easily doing the ""puzzle"" fight. Only few stand out (Nameless King or Soul of Cinder)They also show that they do not understand their core hardcore audience by punishing build diversity and PVP. 1. Invaders basically being at a huge disadvantage and 2. offering a lot of buffs to summoners. Meanwhile weapons feel the same and R1 spam applies to PVP as well, so there is no reason in ever going with anything slow and heavy hitting, when straight swords stagger just as well, are faster and have around the same attack power. I must admit that I did not participate in many ""fight clubs"" (as we call duels in the community) in DS3, but that was my experience with random invasions.The first play-through on release felt very satisfying, but then you realise that ""that's it"". No more looking and theory crafting builds online to bring them to lower level invading or duelling . No more thinking what your next run might be, because you'll just feel like you intentionally ""gimp"" yourself by going with anything but a Straight Sword R1 spam quality build. If you are someone that plays this as a casual and just goes for 1 playthrough of each entry in the series, this will be a good game for you and it will be fine. If, on the other hand, you really are in this for the love of the series, I can't really recommend this as this will disappoint you. I am very sorry that the series peaked with Dark Souls 1 (and 2 for pvp) and stayed there, never surpassing the legendary standard the first Dark Souls has setup."
Negative,"Played the 1st and didn't like it, but people kept telling me this one is SO much better.It's not. It's the exact same, the player character feels unnaturaly sluggish, with all of the stamina of an overweight, asthmatic 90-year-old. Playing a spellcaster is still not viable, since doing anything but attacking in melee locks you in place for ages and mana doesn't regenerate, making it no different than ammo for a ranged weapon.If you liked Dark Souls 1 this game is for you, I assume, though I fail to see the appeal."
Negative,"To fight Dancer or Dragonslayer's Armour with single-digits FPS is a whole new level of perversity.Thanks for the optimization, From!"
Negative,very bad game my boss was at 1 shot and i got stuck in the pillar and died the worst game ever
Negative,not as good as other souls games
Negative,"Pros: The artwork is stunning and the game is overall beautiful.Cons: This game has a reputation for being difficult, but the reasons behind its difficulty are honestly just frustrating and not enjoyable. Save points are inconveniently placed and so far from boss fights that you end up having to sprint past enemies over half of the map to get back to the boss that you WILL die 10 times fighting. Difficult combat is not something I would be upset about on its own, but with save points 30 minutes apart, at least, you end up with a sense of relief at not having to play the same stretch of map again rather than accomplishment. Also, I was very disappointed with the combat mechanics. For a game that is entirely a melee combat game, the combat itself is clunky and not very varied. There isn't as much rhythm to the fighting as I had hoped, it really ends up amounting to ""spam dodge, wack with sword."""
Negative,"It doesn't surprise me, really.  FromSoft had a great thing going with DS1, and instead of just improving on it, they throw the entire thing out and make DS2.  DS2 actually ended up being pretty okay, but why fix something that wasn't broken?  Well, they repeated the process with DS3, and unlike DS2, DS3 is garbage.Level design is great.  Monster design is great.  Some of the bosses are even pretty decent, though most are garbage.  I can't speak about the lore because DS3's obsessive edgelord focus compared to previous titles turned me off in a hurry.But the combat is just fucking terrible.  Instead of realizing Bloodborne is its own thing and should stay that way, they tried to marry Bloodborne with DS1 and the result is a goddamned mess that has none of the strengths of either system, but many of each system's weaknesses.Worse still, there's very little authentic difficulty to be found in the game.  Instead, it just heaps tons and tons of monsters that are hideously overpowered and some that just outright cheat and calls it good.  This is a lot easier to make than balancing monsters appropriately, which isn't surprising considering they're shoveling a game out every single year.  Quantity over quality, for sure.I just gave up after 25 hours.  I kept waiting for the game to be fun, and it just never happened.  There are too many huge issues that are part of the core gameplay and therefore aren't something that can easily be remedied... not that FromSoft or Japanese developers in general are known for doing much of anything in regards to fixing things post-release unless it's packaged with DLC (like DS2's Scholar of the First Sin upgrade.)I very much regret buying into the hype and pre-ordering this, and wish Steam had a more lenient refund clause so I could get my money back... or at least give my copy of the game to someone that will actually enjoy it.  DS3 will be rotting in my library alongside the other poorly-made games.  FromSoft clearly doesn't know what they're doing anymore."
Negative,This game will keep your friends from playing beat saber with you 2/10 fun game
Negative,this game is ass and makes me wanna dip my nut in penutbutter  and feed em to a crocidile and thow up my insides
Negative,"TLDR Avoid like the plague, worst PC port in the history of mankind. I wish I could get a refund, this is a 0/10, non-functioning defunct product. Worthless piece of software. The pirated version actually works, but I am too angry to play it. I never want to see this game again.Excellent game, but this might just be the shittiest PC port I have ever had the misfortune of trying to get to run. The amount of third party software, fixes, mods and IT gymnastics that I have to do just to let me play this game with a PS4 Controller, with PS4 button prompts, borderless windowed, with uncapped FPS /AND/ to not have it crash every 5 minutes is insane. How can anyone slap a price tag on this and sell this? This is first time I am playing DS3 after 100% Dark Souls Remastered (which I loved, and just because of the technical aspect alone, I would recommend over this piece of shit) and honestly, while I can see how much improved the gameplay, UI and everything is in here, the technical aspect makes me hate this fucking game. If FromSoftware cannot release games on PC (other than the Dark Souls Remastered, which I believe was touched up upon by a different Polish developer even), then they should stick with consoles. What the fuck is this.EDIT: Oh and that is nothing to say about how they deactivated the online part of the game. Fuck that too.EDIT2: I also forgot to mention, that in order to use the fucking PS4 Controller, the built in Steam Config does not work, you have to download DS4 Windows and set the profile to an Xbox controller. Which kills your vibrations."
Negative,Kind of scummy of them to turn off the multiplayer to discourage people to play this and play Elden Ring instead.
Negative,"A someone who has 100% this game, I absolutely despise every pixel and coding of this game bro. The grind for covenant items is something I would't even make my worst enemy do. 1/10, only 1 cus fire keeper bad ash."
Negative,"It starts quite well, lots of references to DS1, fast paced combat which is fun. But then at the Cathedral+, the devs asked themselves how to fuck over the player in the most sadistic, rage inducing, most unfunny ways possible where you HAVE to die or do fucking google researches all the time to actually pass it. Even knowing the garbage awaiting for you, the Catacombs of Carthus is designed in the way to spit on the playerbase. It's not hard, it's just RNG bullshit sometimes with the enemies and their movements, and everything is made so you're fucked no matter what you do, and you NEED to pile up on heals and tank garbage at times.Now I'm gonna finish the damn game, but those 2 zones back to back are making me wonder if the devs stopped asking themselves what would be fun and instead thought ""oh yeah DS is supposed to be hard let's make artificial difficulty by making some BS up"". Wasted game. Even if the zones afterwards are good or better to play, fuck you. I don't have a problem with difficulty, I did DSR and had no issues, finished a lot of hard games before, but this game is half actual challenging parts that are hard but fair like DS1, and half bullshit that's terrible game design made by buffoon clowns."
Negative,"If you enjoy this, you listen to mommy asmr and sound on a daily basis and should have your right to vote disabled since you clearly don't know what a good thing is even if someone comes across you and smacks you in the face. I know that everybody who enjoys this game has a kink for being dominated and stomped on by women with more testosterone than them and likes their guy friend better, as well as liking to watch on the weekends since they have a small pecker. People that enjoy this game get 0 play since all they do is stroke it to fire keeper hentai and edge and let mommy put them in a chastity cage so that their cock gets smaller so that way no woman would ever want them, and that way they enjoy the pegging session from Tyrone since he has a real man's dick, which is something that they will never achieve. Edit What have I become"
Negative,"good one I died to the first boss 20 times.Edit: put dark souls server back up you promised us after elden ring you would have this fixed it has been months, and no word no update, nothing. fix your damn game. until you say anything on the matter all my dark souls reviews will be downvoted. #darksoulsmatter edit: also raised the price back to 60 dollars which is crazy elden ring is really getting to their heads. Im downvoting all titles until they get their shit togetheredit: you fixed it great job took like 8 months but you did it, game is 60 dollars and it came out in 2016 disgusting business pratice after elden ring sucess just like every other game company that gets their dick wet."
Negative,deleted my character with no explanation. game was not uninstalled
Negative,"Absolute nightmare experience: zero effort pc port, 60 fps lock, no ultrawide - the ultrawide fix actually gets you banned, stiff and clunky controls, no M&K support and they have the audacity to still make this 30€ during sale without dlcs. This studio technologically lives 10+ years in the past at all times - elden ring also has 60 fps lock and no ultrawide, joke game studio"

Negative,"One step forwards, two steps back at every point. Not convinced this is skill based, definitely not for casual play. You can win, just rinse and repeat...101 hours in game, level 96, Journey 1 completed. Can't see how armour/weapons make much of a difference...wasted code really; most of the game just used one sword and armour set. Linked the last flame; think i missed the point (i was reading/listening, but still managed to miss the story.) Off to muse Elden Ring now??? Nope, I'm going to detox in Stellaris or Assassins Creed.Online play isn't working for me; server not available. Not that i'm interested."
Negative,"It's like trainspotting or collecting stamps, it's for a very specific kind of person, and odds are that isn't you."
Negative,shits hard as
Negative,Story is all over the place...wait..there is a story or just killing around ?.. lol
Negative,too easy for me.
Negative,"Played both the first and second entry. First game was amazing. I gave up on the 2nd because of the disgustingly hard difficulty, and it's also the same reason why I'm giving up on this one. Glad I got it on a sale, as it wasn't worth it.Okay, I get it. These games are meant to be hard, but it's disgustingly hard."
Negative,Every Roll. Stun. Heal or attack have such a long ass animation that ruin every join to play this game. And every single A.I. in this game have like 200% faster movement. A stupid long animation that delay every thing between a player and character is one of the most stupid thing in game history. sekiro are much better
Negative,"Beautiful game.  That being said, If you're on a PC using a keyboard and mouse, don't bother... you'll just end up spinning around hitting rocks instead of your target or casting fireballs at cliff sides.  Even the tutorials are controller specific."
Negative,"Honestly, its a great game but for whatever reason i didn't enjoy it. I loved DS1 and Bloodborne but DS3 just didn't click. The level design is disconnected and it felt like it was confused whether it wanted to  be DS1 (weapons, bosses) or Bloodborne (movement and level design) while failing at both. Probably because i love DS1 too much"
Negative,"My first try of a dark souls game after playing Bloodborne. The game itself was challenging as always but the beginning and the end made me want to just say not to bother.  Not much practice and no method of leveling up before the first boss was brutally punishing and I was very close to just returning the game at that point.  However, I did make it past and went through most of the content in the game.  The enemies were varied and interesting with challenges throughout.  However, the end boss was brutally challenging for no reason and not that interesting.  And totally lost interest after the ending.  Congratulations on beating the game, now play again.  This is the end to a series?  Meh, onto another better formed game."
Negative,Removed from Geforce Now Fck u
Negative,No poise no party
Negative,"I want my jolly cooperation back, duck your profit and elden shit."
Negative,"I loved the game, but the constant crashes are really annoying and ruining the gaming experience for me. If the game had better working port to PC I would honestly  give it a good 9/10."
Negative,"Its a fun game but the anti cheat is garbage! since i play with my friends and i dont want to get invaded i close the game, and now i cant play with them anymore so yeah fun game with friends but not when you cant play with your friends cause you dont want to die from invaders."
Negative,scary spider things
Negative,"Absolutely dreadful PvP currently due to latency issues. It is infuriating to get invaded and all of your attacks to phase through the enemy while he connects every single hit. If you are so proud of your PvP and force it on players at least back it up with dedicated servers, you miserable fucks. This is especially true since the launch of Dark Souls Remastered.Yes, I am salty, becaue I actually like PvP and can`t enjoy it because of this shit."
Negative,"Opiniated point of view incoming.I've played Dark Souls I, II and Bloodborne in that order, if that's any help. Played the third one last.Tried 5 times to get hooked on it. Dropped 4 times then went as far as I could recently but I cannot, for the love of god, finish that game. It just feels off to me.That may be me alone but I've pocked around some posts here and there and that doesn't seem to be the case, yet we aren't that many to not really feel it.As to why, err, I'm not really really sure. I have game design experience but what I feel about this game is too subjective, or I may be too inexperienced, not sure either. I just feel bumped down.Maybe it's a mixed feeling of not really achieving the idea of separating the community from this game, which can be both the most precious thing that can exist and the most toxic thing that ever struck humanity. Maybe it's a feeling of feeling cheated by PvE that sees way ahead of your actions. Maybe it just boils down playing a mage and being too stubborn to change. A mix of everything.Try this game still. It will be way worth your money. Whether you like it or not is up to you."
Negative,"Thought it was alright, fairly challenging, and enjoyable. But I bought this game for co-op, and the co-op system is such a mess thats its basically unplayable if you plan to not do a solo run. And when you do ask for help, the community turns toxic and starts spewing things like: ""Thats the reason this game is so enjoyable, its special that way!"" (refering to how broken the multiplayer is) or ""You're just another noobf*g who's salty he's not good enough to play alone."".How I wish I could have refunded this gem of a game before I even preordered it.And now the community is going to downvote this like crazy, proving my point..."
Negative,"Where do i even begin...... There are absolutely no redeeming qualities about this train wreck that some people call a game. I would rather skin my whole leg than be forced to play this game for a single hour. Every night I go to sleep praying that this whole game was just a bad dream and every morning I wake up depressed knowing that the game is still available on the steam store. Every second I've spent playing this game is another regret I'll have to confront in the final moments of the lost potential I used to call a life. There is no redemption for me and it all started the first time I launched this game. Curse you from software, curse you Bandai Namco, and curse every person that has even had the smallest amount of association with the creation of this tragedy of a game."
Negative,"The game is great, as a Dark Souls game. As a fan, the game does very well. However, there are big issues:1. Framerate drops, are semi often and VERY jarring. Apparently has something to do with saving game files. I run at 60 FPS and it plummets to 1-2 for a split second, which can mean death at some moments. Very annoying. 2. Poise is broken, there is a poplar post on the community forums right now, where players have found game files indicating poise has been turned off in the game. This was likely a last minute call on Fromsoft end and gives the game a fast pace Bloodborne combat feel. This is fine, but makes heavy armor builds pointltess and ANY enemy with ANY weapon can stagger you. PVP is very frustating aswell where fast weapons with good reach are very unfair to face. Once you get hit once, you will get it over and over.  You really have to be on point with dodging.3. Soft banning players... this is a huge deal. Fromsoft has pretty much soft banned half their player base at this point if reading reedit and community forums are any indication. Like me, and many others, completely unwarranted. This oddly splits the community where soft banned players are now playing seperately to those who avoided the ""ban wave."" Online play is completely borked because of this, and I may suggest people avoid buying the game until this is fixed. Not to mention, the warning messages nerely instructs you to delete your save file or risk being banned - which many people have, and Fromsoft goes around telling us deleting the save file will do no good. 4. Magic balancing issues, in the past magic builds have been an easier alternative to melee builds for people who just are not on point with dodge timing. This was fine in the past games, but they went ahead and made magic completely unviable - at least in the early game. If you want to play a caster, don't bother. Weapons regular light attacks will do more damage than a slow casted spell, and every boss has an aggressive gap closer. This is pretty interesting as Fromsoft has stated difficulty was never the point of Dark Souls.... so why nerf magic to near uselessness? New players who pick a caster starting class have to be having a hard time with this. Once again, this is not Bloodborne, allow us to use magic from the start to the end of the game. 5. NG+ is pointless. It was never the point in other souls games, but here, its literally just to get rings which give you a very minror boost to overall power. No new enemy placement, bosses are all the same. You get some red phantoms, whoohoo. You are better off just starting a new character with a new build. I understand the game is still getting updated and patched and a lot of this will get addressed, but we are WELL into launch at this point, not to mention it was released in Japan prior - which is another thing I take issue with. Take it for what you will, the game is good and I'd rather play over most other games, but god they manage to screw up very obvious stuff in these games."
Negative,"I do not like this game, but I would not go so far as to call this game bad. The main reason I don't find it fun is attributed to the fact that the bulk of the game play involves a loop of roll, attack, roll, attack, roll, attack, roll, attack, and so on with little variety in effective strategies for taking enemies down. Sekiro does a much better job with allowing more maneuverability, parrying, and tools to make the game faster, and more varied, but this is not why I do not recommend the game for general consumption.What drew me to the game were theme and enemies since I'm a fan of dark fantasy settings, I also quite enjoy many of the weapons and armor, but the reason I do not recommend the purchase of this game is due to the fact that the mouse and keyboard controls are astoundingly awful, for a AAA company especially. There is no excuse for the menus to simply not recognize that you are using a mouse and keyboard, and to not display the proper prompts for them. Absolutely no excuse for a PC port to include such dreadful and lazy mouse and keyboard controls that the game hardly provides any indication as to which controls do what, and to make using a mouse and keyboard the most anti-fun and clunky experience I've had in a PC game. Its not the most difficult step in the development process, and they could spare just a small amount of their millions to implement it properly, but their brainwashed fanboys will attack anyone who asks for it, so the developers do not feel in the slightest bit obligated to do so. I don't care if you think the game was never meant for mouse and keyboard controls, its on the PC now, and that is a function of the PC. I should not have to buy a controller if I do not own one to play a game I bought for my PC because the developers decided to come out with a PC version of it but did it lazily since they can rely on their loyalty blinded fans to worship them and attack all requests for a proper PC port."
Negative,"Really disappointed ... I kinda thought, since I bought the game on Steam, the game would actually be somewhat converted to PC ... but ALL tooltips are for console, nothing gets properly explained and the controls are cumbersome and annoying. In a game that relies so much on doing the right thing in the right direction at the right time, these controls are just terrible.I kinda wonder how everyone else was able to play that BS - do you all have controlers to do it like you would on console? Or are you in fact playing on a console? Is there Steam for console? I might just be too much of a PC gamer, but for me, these controls are just BS and I regret buying that thing ..."
Negative,"worst souls game easily, but compared to most action rpgs its pretty good. It has its upsides but everything it does well is done better by another popular souls / souls-likeif you want a fast paced soulslike: get nioh / sekiroif you want more accessible pvp / coop: get ds1 (dsfix with original is better but remaster is ok if you haven't played ds1 before)if you want better pvp and don't care about pve: get ds2if you want nice graphics and visuals: get mods for ds1 or get sekiroif you want dumb shit and bad balance: play dragons dogmalike i said its not the worst game ever, but its the worst soulsborne / soulslike i've played. in the offchance you've played everything else and want more, go ahead and buy this one, it's not blow-your-brains-out bad unless you do pvp, but don't expect to be pushed to your limits as a gamer."
Negative,"This is one of the laziest fucking PC ports I've ever seen. Not in terms of graphics and the whole not crashing thing... more in the controls.You know how Dark Souls has a reputation as utterly unforgiving, and die, die, die again?This is compounded by the fact that, even if you set in the options that you are using keyboard and mouse, and NOT a controller, the stupid game will still tell you which controller button to push, not the keyboard mapping."
Negative,"don't waste your money if you dont have a controller, developers are beyond lazy with this port. i'm on pc and it still shows command prompts for xbox....kys firm software"
Negative,this game is fucking garbage shitty fucking port twice now i played through the game and everytime i unistall the game it deletes my save fuck this game do not even glance towards it
Negative,The developers couldn't even be bothered to replace the controller button prompts with the appropriate keyboard button prompts. Incredibly lazy development.
Negative,"Looks and plays better than Dark Souls 1 & 2, but is still the worst of the three."
Negative,"Very cool art, lore, and atmosphere. Too difficult and based on perfect execution to have any real investment in the story though. 15 hours played & I can confidently say not interested in playing more , don't need the stress."
Negative,"Oh dear, another controversial review. I'll quietly put this one next to my Dark Souls 2 review, so that I can put my cards on the table.Dark Souls 3 is a sequel to Dark Souls. It is also, ostensibly, a sequel to Dark Souls 2— something the fans and developers seem to find far less appealing. Just about everything related to the previous game is gone, scrubbed so completely from the world that I initially thought that this game took place before Dark Souls 2.It's a recurring theme with this game. Poise, an integral mechanic from the previous two games, has been completely removed in favor of a super armor mechanic with the same name. Armor is less useful, and cannot be upgraded. Heavy weapons and magic have been nerfed— heavy weapons in terms of functionality, and magic in terms of sheer numbers. Dual wielding has been simplified into the floor. A generic mana bar replaces magic charges and allows for unique weapon skills, which likewise oversimplifies many of the unique weapon movesets. Multiplayer mechanics have been tipped far in favor of co-op over the presence of invaders. Areas are very neatly designed to call back to classic Dark Souls areas, making them feel repetitive and uninspired. The list goes on, and on, and on.It's like the game has been flattened. It's still a Dark Souls game, but that feels more like a surface-level connection than anything else. And the worst part is that across the playerbase, I don't think very many people were bothered by the changes at all. Recent reviews are at Overwhelmingly Positive, for goodness' sake.If you've played the previous games, you can probably pick up this game and have a fine time. You can probably play it for much longer than I did without getting bored. To be perfectly honest, you probably won't even notice most of the mechanical changes depending on how you play the game. But that's not me. Not recommended, for personal taste."
Negative,"Probably the Weakest entry of the Souls Series. Abysmal level design coupled with putting too much emphasis on the weakest part of the Souls Series, the combat, make the game a slog to play through without much fun sprinkled in."
Negative,"Pretty sure no one will read this, but here goes nothingPeople have been saying ""Oh man, Dark Souls the hardest game ever"" and crap like that, and I finally got to play dark souls 3. I was expecting it to be a ton of fun because of what I've heard, and it really disappointed me when I played it. Basically the enemies attacks are like freakin magnets - doesn't matter where you dodge, it's like they know where you're going to be at the end of your rolling animation. Another thing is with their attack animation - some are obvious but some are stupidly hard to read, like I'm attacking the enemy and all of the sudden that same enemy somehow counter-attack me while looking stunned, which is very confusing. The biggest thing that makes me dislike this game is how it's basically a hit and run game - because you literally can't do a combo of some sort without getting hit by a bullshit attack animation you can't see.So yea, those are my complaint - I mean this game is pretty good, but I just hate how bullshit it is. I like the classes and the many different type of weapons and armors you can have, and also how you can't use the bonfire everytime to restore your health after you clear all the enemies because that respawns the enemies again. But - again - what I really dislike about this game is the hit and run tactic that YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO DO in this game - and that's quite boring for me.So yea... if you got to the bottom of this boring review then gratz or somethin"

I read a lot of stuff how to try to fix it on the internet and there are people with high-end PC's which have that bug too.If you only want to play it Singleplayer, buy it, it's worth the money."
Negative,If you will buy this game for pvp just take a look at this SS http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/269467742823892778/E7C5A850C4DA6961D1BCA5F73309EA5C4B4D7C36/this is how every single invasion looks like there is 4 kids with their r1 spam weapons waiting for you.Also you can add Seed of Tree Giants to that picture too.There is no balance : a SSword is doing same damage with a 20 unit weight Ultra Great Sword(USG) and they can swing that SSword R1 spam shit for 10 times while you can only swing a UGS for 2 times.Also a caster can get a full one shot to your 1200 HP.There is no poise : If you get hit by a R1 spam weapon you will surely get 2nd hit because there is no fucking poise.Parrying is really easy and riposte is broken: A scrub who doesnt even know what he can parry or he cant will one shot your 1200 HP if he gets a parry with his mindless parry spam.Auto summons not working at all : It has been some time this game is out and Auto summon covenants not working at all.DS2 problems still exist : You can get spam backstabbed while you dont even in that position and there is way to much players with phantom range/Gliding/Invulnerable.You can get banned for no reason at all while some hacker can play the game with no problems.But if you re after some pve and will play the game offline go ahead and buy it.It has a really great story.

Negative,Remember when Dark Souls let you use magic? Well if you liked the magic system before avoid this like the plague. Magic is so gimped its unusable until you are already max build and have to respec into it. There is one shield and one sword you should use the enire first half of the game. We waited a decade for this. I waited 3 years for patches. It never happened. Thank fuck they remade demon souls
Negative,"黑暗之魂3已死。DarkSouls3, once popular till 2020, is fading.官方的不作为导致联机环境乌烟瘴气，你可以想象当你正在练习PvP，却突然被召唤到灰烬墓地（游戏的初始地图），紧接着就是源源不断的作弊物品被塞入背包吗？As a result of the inaction of Fromsoftware,the situation of multiplayer mode is getting worse.Can you imagine that you're practicing PvP,then suddenly get transmitted to Cemetery of ash(the starting map in DS3),and countless illegal cheating items appear in your inventory？即使是回档无法免于不幸，当你在下一个星期三登录游戏时，你将无可避免地看见“YOU HAVE BEEN PENALIZED”Even the luckless innocent player try to replace their game data to backups,they can't avoid the fate to see the information ""YOU HAVE BEEN PENALIZED"" when they login DS3 in next Wednesday.这是怎么了？为什么作弊者利用游戏封禁机制的漏洞，明目张胆的剥夺其他玩家的正常联机权利，破坏他人游戏体验，却能毫不受到应得的惩罚？What's happened to the game? Why those cheaters who did blatantly cheating to disqualify others from online games are not being punished but rather getting away with punishment they deserve triumphantly?而游戏的网络联机也相当不稳定，难道就只是因为它不再能带来盈利了？In fact the online experience has been unstable just because it is no longer profitable?黑暗之魂3，一款最烂的游戏！DS3, now kicks the bucket, rather than be the hit."
Negative,"graphics are quite bad even on highest settings (boss monsters look good tho, but the environment like rocks and trees are like a mess), practically unplayable on PC because of insane mouse look speed, they didn't even bother to 'translate' beginners tips to keyboard buttons. For a game this price, I'd expect some effort...Character creation is a joke, there are classes, but close to zero information about them, I had to google 30 minutes before I could pick something, and I couldn't even find out what stats do there are just small logos but what are they... no idea... etc... It's like they expect everyone starting the game already knowing everything about it.X USD and 30 minutes of my life I wont get back..."
Negative,"just play Elden Ring, the grind for souls is a full time job everything in this game is just a cheap one hit or too many enemies place between you and the boss. weapons are way to demanding for stamina and playing anything other than status build or mage is pointless. This is one of the most hardest Dark souls i've played"
Negative,"Many of the negative reviews for this title focus on optimization, online issues, and similar problems. However, I haven’t seen many of these reviews delve into the overall experience, so I decided to write this review as I have a somewhat unenthusiastic view of this game.I want to preface this review by stating that my dislike does not come from me “not being gud.” As you can see, I put a lot of hours into this game – I completed the base game + DLCs, and defeated all the main & optional bosses. But even then, I have absolutely no love for this game. From the beginning, this game was merely an experience to play a “hard” game for once (I will discuss the difficulty shortly). However, the primary reason I lack any fondness for this game is the absence of a clear story.If you want to learn more about the world and the lore, you have to read all the item descriptions to even begin understanding the story’s direction. The game makes no effort to provide at least a simple main story, which would help players start piecing together the world’s narrative. Their more recent game, Sekiro, does a much better job at this than any of the Souls games, mainly because it actually cares about presenting the story in a less convoluted way. Obviously, there are players who enjoy reading and exploring every inch of the game, and that is fine. However, having a simple main story would not detract from the experience of those players and would enhance the enjoyment of players like me. This is why I say I have no love for this game – I don’t have the time or patience to sift through numerous items to understand just a small part of the world, so this game ends up being a challenge of “roll, attack, kill” for me, with nothing more to it. (Quick note: ask any Dark Souls fans about X or Y lore, and they will surely tell you, but ask them how they know that, and in 99% of cases, it’s because they watched a 10-hour lore video on YouTube).Setting aside the issues I have with the story presentation, there are a few things I want to discuss regarding the gameplay, one of them being the difficulty. Although one of the main reasons From Software’s games are popular is their difficulty, I don’t think Dark Souls 3 is particularly hard, except for a few bosses and some random enemies. My issue is with how this game is balanced. VERY often, you will find that those ‘random enemies’ take longer to kill than some of the bosses. It would happen quite often that I would defeat a boss in 1-3 tries, and then there are ‘normal’ mobs that absolutely destroy me after fighting them 10 times. I do believe this is not entirely bad, as it makes exploration more exciting (you are always somewhat anxious about what kind of strong monster might be in the next area). However, I do think it’s either a bit overdone, or the “easy” bosses should not be that easy (looking at you, final boss).Another big thing that I dislike about the overall gameplay is the existence of hidden walls. Miyazaki, please, for the love of God, stop doing this. I genuinely believe this to be the worst game mechanic in their games, and the reason is simple: banging against every single wall is NOT fun. There is a certain amount of excitement that comes from discovering a hidden path, but I do not believe that hitting your head against every single wall, causing you CTE, is worth that dopamine. If From Software does not want to remove them (they still exist in Elden Ring), then a small fix would be not hiding important stuff behind those hidden walls. Put like 5 Embers in there or something, but instead, they hide actual important stuff, like for example one wall having an entire boss behind it as well as an item you need for one of the endings.Speaking of hiding stuff in obscure ways, there is an entire area + two bosses hidden behind you having to do an emote in a specific place in the middle of a road. Just… why? There is no way more than 10 people discovered this without reading online forums. If any single player game makes me check the wiki for progression or something as important as this, then they have significantly failed.As for the positive aspects of this game, honestly, I don’t think this review needs to mention much. From Software is one of the most beloved companies nowadays, and there are plenty of good reviews on Steam that highlight the amazing aspects of this game (gameplay loop, combat, boss design, music, scenery, etc.).In conclusion, I believe that Dark Souls 3 is a good game. If you are one of those people who doesn’t mind reading all the item descriptions, or watching half a day long videos on YouTube, then you will probably love this game (love, not like). However, if you are like me and don’t have that amount of time or patience and see From Software’s games as “roll, attack, kill” experiences, then just go and play their best game, which is Sekiro. My thoughts after completing this game are that I did have a good time, but at the same time I think to myself “I would have preferred to spend that time playing like 5 indie games.”"

I have an OS SSD and a game holding SSD, I simply check the box on the pagefile.sys menu at the top that said ""let Windows manage all these devices"" and then the crashing stopped.I'll keep the negative review as it is unacceptable for a studio to release something in this state but i'm too much of a fan to not play it..."
Negative,Having added more time after my first review. I have to say... Still no.
Negative,This game crashes ALL the time. I cannot proceed past the first boss becuase opening the door to go on to the next area crashes my game no matter what I have tried to do to fix the crash bugs.
Negative,"Hyper armor is cancer and poise doesnt existUPDATE: I earnestly cannot stress that the amount of hackers is ridiculous. If you were looking for a fun game to mod, feel free to mod poise back in for the rest of us as you fly around and insta-break our gear before insta-killing us and pointing down lololUPDATE: In all my time of Dark Souls III, I have come to detest a certain many things about this... game. But as I grind through more and more saves to ready new PvP builds for the arena, I've come to fall in love with the Quick Step skill on the dagger all over again. It perfectly transitions from the running animation, adding minimal stamina cost to what could have otherwise been a mediocre roll, changing the way I grind through the *fake* poison swamp area. It even makes that blue bar underneath my health bar.... deplete. I have never seen this before and I truly believe that the blue bar is the Quick Step invincibility meter, making it lose its invincibility frames once the Quick Step bar is out. Some have made fun of me for my devotion to what they call a ""useless ability"" but I have found much viability for this game-breaking feature.And besides, if you think that's useless, wait till someone tells you about Poise...."
Negative,"At first I enjoyed this game. Until I got permantly banned for no reason at all. Now I cannot enjoy the JOLLY COOPERATION. Which is why I bought the game in the first place. Do not buy this game if you want it for the online play. From what it looks like, they didn't release the updates properly, and this caused hundreds of accounts to get banned. This is a warning, if you want to go ahead and buy it, go ahead. You have been warned."
Negative,"Armour LITERALLY does nothing,Wearing a full set and sacrificing half my equip load, die in two hits.Literally naked, still die in two hits but at least I get all my i-frames when I dodge.There also isn't any poise in this game, your ""poise"" is entirely determined by your weapon cause only certain weapons get hyper armour."

Negative,"+ Good game, really hard tho. Feels extremely satisfying when you complete something.- There is no tutorial instead just messages everywhere with controls. - Graphics are not what you would expect 2016, a little better than skyrim but not much. - Ragdolls flying everywhere when you walk over corpses- I got lucky my game only crashes 2 times / hour, mostly at bonfires. It helps to turn down lightning effects.- Almost impossible to play whitout gamepad/controller.Do not buy this game until there is a patch fixing bonfire crashing and all the bugs."
Negative,"To be honest, the game controls are a horrid port from console. DS III might be great, however it is apparently meant to be played with a controler. Or to be purchased for console in the first place. Since I currently have neither, this isn't for me. Furthermore, the tutorial and the interface shows only controler keymapping. While this can be remedied by mods, character and camera controls currently cannot. In conclusion, one can play with keyboard and mouse, but that is a significant increase in difficulty. I hardly ever refund games and it saddens me to do it with one so critically acclaimed, but I cannot recommend it for players who prefer keyboard and mouse."
Negative,"If you like to PVP look elsewhere, the game is full of hackers now and it's ruined this great game.You can report as much as you like, nothing happens.Not only do these trolls have access to skills not even in the game, flying through the sky, unlimited health etc they can also ruin your stats too.. for example, i like to PVP in Pontiff but i can't now as a hacker joined, used curse on me and gave me every boss soul on the game. This will also probably result in a softban due to my stats being changed. Good graphics and gameplay.. just don't play online.Starting to get the feeling, if you can't beat them join them and i'm guessing due to lack of any moderation in the game, most of the community have also.F Dark Souls."
Negative,For PC the key binding system is terrible. cant re key bind anything. 700 hours in elden ring here. 30 minutes in dark souls 3 Its not meant for anything but a controller. not cool.
Negative,"Want to play single player?  Go for it.  Want to play multiplayer?  Don't.  Community is toxic.  Players with end game gear will invade you and slaughter you.  When you die, you loose your ember.  Without your ember you can't co-op.  You go to buy more embers, but the shop keeper only has 3.  Want to figure out how to keep safe from invading?  The only way is to play single player only- ""un-embered"".  Get embered?  Get invaded.  Playing with a friend? Well, it turns out playing with a friend makes you more likely to be invaded.  Single player experience  - 7/10.  Multiplayer -  1/10. Edit - See comments section for excellent examples of this games player base."
Negative,"Dark Souls as any other ,sadly too much disapointment for me personaly......Can't recomend it ,feels rushed and unfinished ,they are counting on too much nostalgia inducing locations ,NPC's and such and tottaly changing the lore making the previous ones that started the series absolite,meaningless and pointless.Game play wise yes is Dark Souls lore wise ...is some nonsence....Not to mention that the online interactions didn't improve in fact right now is even worst than the previous ones sadly.I may reconsider my rewiev if they do something on thouse isues which knowing how well they handled previous tittles ,well you can say i don't expect that to happen ever ....Excuse my english is not my native language.And they still refuse to do sale on the DLC's.DLC are maybe better,then the actual game,tho it didn't fix my issues with the story,it actually made it worst."
Negative,"---- update at 2024-03- game world look good- game just disconnected and logout when I was fighting with BOSS- as I progress the game, I find out more trolls that developers put in game than challenges to make player die on purpose- of course they won fix the tutorial key display cause they don't care about PC gamers---- update at 2020-06Why the tutorial only show the controller buttons instead of keys when I was playing on PC?Maybe they didn't care about PC players.I don't think it's fun to be killed over and over again. Enemy attack is so deadly which will kill you like 3 hits. So if you want fight to the end, you need understand every enemies attack and make no mistakes. It means you will spend lots of time to try and die. It just not worth it."
Negative,"G.R.I.N.D.That is all.Jk. If you want a game where you can get chewed up and spat out, this is the one for you. Levelling up means seeing the same maps, same character models, trying the same moves (except just before this, or just after that (this time)) over and over till the game wearies of seeing you and lets you pass.I like games. But I don't like grinding. Eh, Ymmv."
Negative,Why does it seem like i bought the console version of this game? It wont go into fullscreen mode all the prompts are for a controller! IDK i've never have had this happen from a game purchased for here before! i really wanted to play this game smh!
Negative,If you have a controller - I am sure this is a tough but fun game.  With a keyboard and mouse - save your money.  I have wasted my money on bad games - but never on a game with bad controls.  Don't expect a refund from Steam after two hours of trying to figure out how to make the controls work for you.  Steam is a great company - but they have lost my business.
Negative,Re-purchased on PC. Constant early-game invasion by end-game players makes this not worth playing. A shame.
Negative,the invasions in this game are damn near broken constantly getting hit by attacks that are no where near me they should not give the advantage to the invader
Negative,only problem i have with this game is the controls still suck if your using KB+M. There is no way to change stuff to were it is not all on the same key so it will end up fucking you over more times then you can count. Example... fighting a boss need to hack and slash him to kill him right? well to fucking bad for you that your going to randomly KICK the boss to brake his shield guard that he doesnt have and do NO DAMAGE but still waist your stam so then you get ass raped by the boss because you cant dodge or block now. OR hey there are bad guys with shield that you have to kick to brake block and then attack.... TO BAD FOR YOU its all on the same key and RANDOM when its going to do it so you can just get fucked.
Negative,"As someone who adored DSR, I hated this game. It's not a bad game at all. The combat is slightly more fluid and the customisation options offer much more variety. In addition, some bosses are pretty cool. However, x3 more enemies in each area, the excessive amount of ambushes and traps, at least half of the chests being mimics and so on make this game easily overwhelming and even, annoying at some point. It feels like this game is solely made for people to rage on Twitch. When it comes to the original fanbase in the era, the game provides tons of fan service mainly from the first game even though according to the lore, it takes place many years later. However, even this fails to save the day."
Negative,I should have read the negative reviews. Game sounds great but YOU NEED A CONTROLLER. It's quite possibly the worst keyboard/mouse port in the history of gaming.
Negative,"A lot of invasions are now just hackers and you can only have invasions off by being not embered or playing in offline mode. Either way you cannot summon helpers. Being embered also gives you a +30% hp boost, so having to go without that would really stink."
Negative,YOU ARE FUCKING IDIOTS I HAVE PAID BEFORE 3 YEARS 60 EURO FOR THE GAME I HAVENT PLAYED FOR 2 YEARS AND SOMETHING I LOG IN NOW AND I HAVE BANN FOR WHAT REASON?. IM TRYING TO CONTACT SUPPORT TO UNBANN MY ACCOUNT AND THEY DONT ANSWER ME FUCK YOU BANDAI NAMCO
Negative,"DLC is good, base game is not. 1-2 cool boss fights, other than that random mobs have bugged hitboxes, boss fights are too static and the map designs are just doodoo. Overall, the game is okay, but not worth the hype for todays' standards. If you like ""oldschool"" games, go ahead. Otherwise just play ELDEN RING or Sekiro instead."
Negative,"I don't understand the hype around this game franchise. There's no fun gameplay, it's only scare jump and memorising path/pattern. Please, don't tell me that you find it fun to roll 90% of the time.I had less trouble killing bosses than the first mob in the game. They are easy as fuck because of their dumb hurtboxes and you can predict easily what they will do.The gear/leveling curve is dumb as fuck. There's no feeling of upgrade. Yes i know, there are some build when you reach lvl32403++ but between the early and end game you can't do anything interesting. Armors are useless. What an exciting choice. Will i wear that +5 def armor with that +15 weight or will i wear that +0 def armor that weight nothing? Well, i'm going naked because it makes 0 difference, i'm going to get two shot anyway by that undead farmer.The game just wants to frustrate you and when it succeeds you die again and again.People will say ""Get gud"" but LOL there are bonfire everywhere. If you beat that game it's not because you are good, it's because you had the patience to beat it.I'm not wasting my time anymore on that.EDIT : In fact i've wasted my time a little bit more, i'm at the final boss right now, i've done everything but the DLCs, and that didn't change my mind.It's worse than my first review. The input buffering made me table flip. It's at least 30-40% of my overall deaths. Seriously, ok i got it, i won't button mash anymore but 3sec buffering is insane. Who thought it was a good idea to do that ?The only OK tier thing about this game is the level design and the scenery. I won't talk about the lore, i wasn't curious enough.TL;DR : Pure garbage. Don't buy. Even at 11€ like i did."
Negative,"Dark souls wont load its a white screen then kicks me out, when I went to install it didn't say how much space it took up. It's like it isn't there."
Negative,"Hackers everywhere. Not worth playing online with friends unless you're doing a private server these days... sad. Such a good game. Ah, well, at least there's Elden RIng."
Negative,"You fight the camera more than the monsters. Specially with mouse and keyboard. Figured they would have learned since the last game.. I was wrong.. Also full of other bugs, glitches, controller issues.Just check the forums for a convenient list.Some of the main issues is that they removed poise yet left the stat and items in the game for it. After last patch everyone experiences a .5-1 second freeze every few minutes. Range of longswords out rangers greatswords. Auto summon covenants not working. Theres a bunch of stuff. Just hit the forums and you'll see all the shit people are complaining about. They already got our money so it seems like they really don't care to fix anything.  They just say it's working as intended."
Negative,its to good
Negative,"I am still playing it, but so far it feels so much worse than Dark Souls 1 or Elden Ring"
Negative,too hard :sob:
Negative,Dark Souls 2 is better
Negative,"I've had this game for quite a while, and I remember, watching streamers play it before I started playing it. But I never came to it because I didn't like the game and the enemies. Games like this are made to make you rage and break controllers and keyboards. Because it is not difficult to the point where you have to be better at the game, it is difficult to the point where you literally can't do nothing and then with luck and a miracle you might kill the boss. Not because you got better because you got lucky. I am speaking from experience of playing games and understanding how games are made and why are made in a specific way. I am not joking or anything and in my opinion this is one of, if not, the worst game that I've ever played in my life. You start in impossible first level when the game is walking you through to learn the game. LOL First enemy is the warrior that when it turns to a snake it becomes impossible, I can do it if I waste 12 hours of my life trying to master all his moves and how to dodge them. But why? after it imagine what there is and even harder enemies...... imagine the last enemy of the game!!!! Again, the worst game that I've ever played in my life that has been made to rage players and waste their time. Now I know this doesn't mean anything because this is a very old game. But I just wanted to give my review for the first time trying it. And for maybe future buyers who knows."
Negative,"Fromsoft in their infinite wisdom decided to remove poise, so now you can get stunlocked to death with knives while wearing heavy armor. If you ever want to use a heavy attack or a sorcery that takes longer to cast, you will just get interupted 9 times out of 10. Victory or defeat just comes down to who gets the first swing. If you want to play a good game just go play dark souls 1."
Negative,Does not have ADP. (Dark Souls 2 moggs this game to the grave)Second to worst build variety in all souls game (Dark souls 1 takes the price).all other positive reviews are gonna be cope.
Negative,I COULDN'T EVEN EDGE TO THIS
Negative,"this game will make u wanna kill urself, if u wanna live dont play"
Negative,"More annoying than fun IMO. If I could atleast respawn outside the bosses I would not have to do the same 1 minute run 100 times over. Thats not challenging, only waste of my time."
Negative,skit spel ba dör
Negative,erm.... nobody told me this game was going to be hard
Negative,it's mid. Only 3 Bosses were actually enjoyable. edit after i tried another playthroughoverglorified bs
Negative,"Compared solely to FROMSOFT's other titles I've played (Elden Ring, Demon Souls & Bloodborne) Dark Souls 3 is the bottom of the barrel.This was my first Dark Souls game and aside from the few cool bosses the overall experience was quite monotonous."
Negative,this is not fun
Negative,"Unfortunately, the controls were designed by the antichrist. Roll and run are the same button, so your rolls are always delayed until you let go of the button (pretty big deal when some attacks are not telegraphed at all). Kicking and jump attacking require awful key combinations with insanely strict timings and ridiculous limitations like not letting you kick if you turn your camera slightly. Dual-wielding your left-hand weapon requires a long press, which makes it unresponsive if you try to use it in combat. All your spells and your tools, including your heal, have to be accessed through a horrible carousel system that has you desperately mashing down to try to find your estus before you die. And of course, you cannot change ANY of this, even if you play with a keyboard.Also, online is dead."
Negative,Game has been offline for a while now. Bandai Namco dropped the ball since the release of DS1 remastered.
Negative,"screen sizing glitch, massive framerate drops, dont reccommned"
Negative,I spent 14 fucking hours in a loading screen
Negative,"Thanks for showing us that we don't actually own the games we paid full price for, and with a snap of their fingers, the devs can shut down the servers, stripping the game of half of its value. You can't even play with hamachi, because they purposefully disabled the use of multiplayer items when servers are down. So yeah, not buying Elden Ring, nor any other titles from this company, they clearly don't give a damn. And don't get me started on what they did with the first dark souls."
Negative,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/912269074862596128/931281645372309604/This-feature-can-be-the-worst-sometimes.jpg   basicly this
Negative,"Clunky and awkward controls on PC. Unplayable with a keyboard & mouse. If you don't have a controller, don't bother getting it."
Negative,giant enemy bad
Negative,"After the desastrous performance of DS Remastered, I thought I'll try DS III because I've heard it performs better than DS:R and it's on sale at the moment.The game doesn't even start. It boots up into a black screen and shows up as ""not responding"" in task manager. I don't want to waste my time with such bullshit. Refunded."
Negative,Great game with really interesting fantasy lore and atmosphere. Difficult gameplay that rewards people who don't give up.However the mmultiplayer functions of all the Dark Souls games do not work. They took down all of the servers due to an exploit and said that they are not going to open them back up. Selling this game at full price is deceitful and criminal; especially when they advertise the multiplayer aspects of Dark Souls.
Negative,The game is grate but the main hate i feel for this game is the pvp its on e of the worse lag i have ever seen on this game and i pray the sun that Elden Ring gets treated better with no poor connection between players.Like i said the game it self is wonderful the reason i would not recommend is the bad connection between players.
Negative,I'm sure this is an excellent game for some people and I really wanted to like it. But I've tried twice for 90 minutes to not get killed over and over and over and over and over again by Gundyr. It's just not fun and just not for me.
Negative,"Third entry in the series and the netcode still sucks, and two of the covenants rely on multiplayer to rank up and get items for the achievements.People complain a lot about DS2 but at least you can buy the missing spells at drangleic castle on NG2+ instead of grinding a lot or getting angry on multiplayer. Some cool ideas from DS2 were also ignored because why not.Just play the first dark souls instead"
Negative,"i used to be able to play it, now for the past 2 weeks no matter what i did it doesnt even launch, i press play and nothing happens, not even the application loads, i reinstalled it 3 times, i even moved to to my ssd, i undated my c++, updated my graphics, turned off my DNS Software but to no avail, im very disappointed, i wanted to play this game since it Halloween just passed + i saw a streamer play it and reminded me that i never completed, i would have given it a yes, but due to the factor that the game doesnt even load im going to have to give a no"
Negative,"Not yet.. Maybe If I can not suck so much at it. I feel like the game is just trolling me for not being good, which might be deserved, but I can't recommend a game I can't enjoy.I will keep trying it and hopefully one day I can break through the barrier."
Negative,possibly the worst game i have ever played.
Negative,"Filled with shit people, shit hackers, and literal shit. Some dickhead sent me to NG+ against my will.Fuck PC gamers. You are the worst kind."
Negative,SAVE YOURSELVES FROM THIS HELL
Negative,Can't disable haptics with a switch pro controller
Negative,wtf???? my save is lost what a suck game
Negative,"baddest part of soulsso many rolls, poor magic mechanics, fast bosses, stages, toxic pvp, weapon artsthe only part where I don't care about server shutdowns and game deathunfair pvp(red players can heal with estus)"
Negative,"I know that I am going to get a lot of angry comments for this but I am not going to pretend that everything is fine. The game overall is a good game and fun to play; however, there are a lot of frustrations and problems with this game that keeps me from recommending it to annoy unless you love the series greatly.Firstly, I don't mind when game developers reuse a game engine that they used for another game and sometimes you can barely tell at all unless it is explicitly revealed to you. In this case, I really don't like how lazy it feels. It feels like a heavily modified Bloodborne game done by professional developers. The sound design of ""footsteps"" (which I find for some weird reason to be extremely annoying sometimes when there is total silence as it sounds like I am wearing some very unconventional footwear when I am in metal armor head to toe), which is just the same one used in Bloodborne. The framerate of this game is very taxing on my computer for seemingly no reason when I can run other games that are much more graphically and memory demanding than this game just fine at higher settings. The voice sound muffled on speakers requiring me to have to use headphones in order to hear what is being said. I know that subtitles are an option but I don't like looking at subtitles to understand what someone is saying. Some enemies feel very cheap and unsatisfying to fight and are usually the ones that don't only appear once when slayed. Human A.I. ""player"" enemies do not feel fun to fight against. Whenever I get invaded, unlike the other games, instead of mentally thinking ""Oh! Another!"", my mind thinks ""NO! NOT NOW!"" or ""NO! GO AWAY!"".Another thing that becomes an issue because Dark Souls III is literately just a modified Bloodborne game is that Armor feels somewhat pointless. You cannot upgrade it like the past two games. Using armors for different stats gives you a ""slightly"" better defense against things. Lastly, the armor provides a percent reduction in damage, not a flat defensive value. Why? Because that's because how it worked in Bloodborne.I do really like this game; however, I cannot safely recommend this game to a friend. In addition, I don't know what happened between Dark Souls II and Dark Souls III; however, if another player has poor internet connection or is lagging badly it is glaringly noticeable as they will teleport or hits will not land because, as far the game is concerned, the other player is no longer there.I love this game...but I don't see why I should recommend it for someone else to experience the same learning curve as me."
Negative,"basically unplayable garbage. i wanted to do a luck build with hollowing but apparently killing anri before yuria appears fs up that questline. also the dark sword on darkwraiths is just their skin texture stretched over the sword, from soft can also bite me for charging 80 bucks for a 5 year old game that is so easy to min max in a goat could do it."
Negative,This game is a great game played it on console but This game came out in 2016 and it doesnt have support from fromsoft the community boards posts are complaints that online is flooded with hackers and for me the game doesnt even launch and i cant find official help about issues like this. They have done nothing to combat the hackers or fix performance of the game.
Negative,didn't like it
Negative,i want to die
Negative,"if u love life, dont play this game"
Negative,"it`s just Dark Souls I but way worsemost bosses where super easy, for some you didnt even need to be skilled bcs there was a built in mechanic to kill them so all the grind wasnt worth at that point.there are spots to farm endless souls very fast and many crazy weapons which i believe are op for pvp but i could never try out pvp cause online service didnt work while i played trough the whole game..wtfi played ultra great weapons and was never possible to add poison, holy, fire or any other buff/enchantment to any of the strength weapons i found, so all the material grind for nothingi couldnt weare any clothes bcs of the new skilling system so i had to use smaller weapons.. so i could atleast wear something instead of looking at this bone bum...i couldnt wear the set i wanted nor wield the weapons i wanted nor using the shield i wanted nor using the spells i wanted. maybe i should have grinded to lvl 300 ?( I was lvl 120)even doe my weapon had S scaling in Strength i would only make +29 dmg by adding 15 levels to strength.. how? that by knowing each level costs ++90.000 souls ...killed every boss after few tries. except the nameless king who took me 16 tries after i gave up bcs i had to switch weapon or skills to beat him.. all in all game looks nice and makes fun to progress. but for me it wasnt worth its time...yet another try( bcs online works now), i played as Knight with armor and shield and a sword, came to finish easy and fast at lvl 104 (farmed about 5 level so i could use a good armor) didnt make any fun except the overall progression and ""char build up"". PvP was bad one side allways OP, I was fighting some not good players, and sometimes crazy nerds with one-trick pony builds. but hte worst of them all are the bad connection ones, where you hit them 6 times, while they are in range, they get no hits, then out of nowhere(while you didnt even attack or hold the shield) they do a parry move and kill you. very frustrating. Also there where people pvping early game with crazy damage and lategame weapons, i dont understand how this is balanced. PvP for me, big downer. Time waisted again."
Negative,Hahahaha i love this game
Negative,"Cool Lore, weapons and visuals.Dogshit design and gameplay; grindy test of endurance.  Massive health bosses with movesets that only allow you one strike at a time.Huge time sink for little payoff."
Negative,Bsically dark souls 1 and 2
Negative,They will perma ban you if you use a switch pro controller.
Negative,I am not sure how safe it is to give your players stockholm syndrome. I don't think I need to list all the ways this game isn't player friendly. The poor UI is just to make up for slow moving bosses shortcomings. Everything is very intense when you're scrolling through your item wheel. The enemies will sometimes damage each other and sometimes not. This game could be fixed if you could climb things and had a better UI
Negative,It's really good
Negative,"Got Banned on the servers for no reason, Never cheated once nor picked anything up from an invader/phantom. sad."
Negative,unironically and easily one of the worst games i have ever played
Negative,Another lazy port by FromSoftware I suggest getting it on Xbox if you don't have a control because the pc controls suck.
Negative,5/10Hit and run gameplay
Negative,Played on Xbox for 3 years. No Problems.Played on PC for 33 hours. invaded a hacker. got banned. You're better off playing on console.
Negative,"If you care about online play, do NOT get this game.  You can and WILL get banned through no fault of your own.  I just received a ban because of invalid items on my account that I never picked up.  They were 'injected' by an invading player.  Does Bandai protect players from that?  No, they just ban the victim.  Don't give this company your money."
Negative,"DS1 but worse. Enemies don't have unique movement patterns, or attacks. It typically just feels like 90% of the enemies at least in the early game, just flail toward you and it turns into dodge roll central. Some bosses fall flat as well. That tree boss was kind of Blood Bournie. Now that I think about it, it feels like most of the game is trying to be Bloodborne when both games operate in completely different ways. There are literal rehash places from DS1. I'd rather play DS 2"
Negative,"I like the game and the play style, it's just as difficult as the memes say it is. However, although this game is infuriating through the difficulty, it has a shitty downside. At any point in time, a hacker could join your world and ruin the online experience for you. Just picking up a modified item could render your online days over, and it would take at LEAST a month for you to even have a CHANCE to play online again."
Negative,"Will this enemy hit your shield once and then be staggerd or will he hit multiple times? Nobody knows. Die 10 times trying to find out, only to be pinned against the walll by the next boss, unable to see or do anything.It looks great and the story seems good, but that could have been paired with better gameplay."
Negative,Piece of shit
Negative,ONLINE MODE SO FULLY HACKER HACKER EVERWHERELEAVE IT NOW
Negative,i literally only want to finish this game so i can have the right to call it bad
Negative,Terrible optimisation no difference in performance between good and bad hardware
Negative,Way too hard. This is not the game for me. I would totally return this or gift it to someone else if I could.
Negative,"This is by far the worst one in the entire series. It's whole lore thing about time repeating is just a cheap easy way to ret-con certain lore aspects from other games. ( Nashandra's picture in irithyll, smough, orenstein) The game has always had major balancing issues and the anti cheat system is awful. Poise has nevver worked in this one unless you used perseverance but that also forces you to either use a certain weapon or waste a weapon slot on ceastus. Don't even get me started on how easy it is to smurf and min max in this one. The weapon scaling system makes it even easier  and that is a major problem. You can be a newbie with a un upgraded weapon and get blasted by a dude with a dark hand. Certain weapons (i.e. Ultrra paired greatswords) were completely broken and were never really fixed. Not to mention it's community is some of the worst people, They don't know PvP manners such as not drinking estus during a 1v1, bowing or gesturing before fights, not knowing how fight clubs work, running into 1v1's and ruining it by helping a person get killed. By far this game is the worst in the series. If you still buy this game at full price then you have a serious mental disorder."
Negative,"If you want to have fun, avoid this game"
Negative,what the fuck
Negative,"The weakest entry in the series. It's still a very good game, but it just cant live up to DS1 in any way, and it has very limited viable build options compared to the very different DS2. Play it if you have played the first two but else dont bother."
Negative,"This game is what happens when a studio relies on artists and advertisers -- you wind up with a wonderful art piece that barely functions as a video game.The engine doesn't perform collision detection properly:- Hitboxes rarely line up with meshes. Nothing seems to ""connect""; sliding against invisible edges is common.- Enemy attacks teleport into your hitbox if the engine feels the enemy should land the hit.- Inconsistent movement. Edge yourself off a ledge to demo. You'll fall on a different pixel every time.- Animation interpolation is virtually non-existent. This makes enemies twitchy and unreadable.- Poor optimization/LOD logic causes hitching on non-SSDs. I have 32GB of RAM, why is this game ever looking at my hard drive during a fight, at all?- Camera takes control away from the user. For example, running forces the camera to follow your forward view. As well, there is no way to put the camera into ""noclip"" mode.- Invulnerability during animations on specific frames is rampant. This is a technical limitations of the 90's born out of a lack of motion capture and generalist programmers. Could they have paid for one less armor piece, and spent some money on development???As far as the game itself goes, it was designed with the express intention of angering players by ganking them with gimmicks and jank. The only two ""challenges"" you will experience is not having foreknowledge of enemy attacks, and struggling to make your character do what you want it to do while it's colliding against invisible hitboxes.This is a Bethesda product with a different set of neuroses; manipulative marketing; and a very strange fan base comprised of ostriches who like to shame others whilst their head's in the sand.Don't buy :)."
Negative,lost all my saves that i spent hours of my life grinding for after i logged out properly10/10
Negative,Everyone told me to try Dark Souls. I couldn't get past Iudex Gundyr.I hate souls-like games...
Negative,Definetly not. twice.
Negative,"up, up, down, down, left, right, left, left, right... oh and DODGE. not fun for me. Evidently fun for some."
Negative,"Just want to play the game, but invaders make that impossible."
Negative,"hardest thing about this game is backing up saves. it wants to fight me even when im not playing it. sadly im going to have to not recommend this. game is good. beautiful art direction, music, fluid and satisfying gameplay and difficulty, online is buggy but still fun to play co-op or invade peoples games. sadly these same systems cause it to be rife with hackers (of all games, in dark souls?) corrupting peoples save data and today it finally happened to me. save your money and dont buy this game at full price. it hurts to say because i appreciate the work put in by from software but theres goes two of my characters NG+. only buy with a heavy sale, as blasphemous as it sounds I would buy this off another site, $60 and $84 is wrong especially when theres a risk for players entire progress to be deleted because someone was running hacks. dont charge full price for a product that can be easily broken."
Negative,"It's the most polished and perfect version of dark souls. It's a really good game, if a little difficult.But it doesn't support widescreen, so auto negative review. I don't give positive reviews to games incompatble with modern hardware."
Negative,all it is is to get screwed by invaders over and over again by people atleast 3 to 8 times your level cant play hate this game put a time limit on invaders or disable invaders period will not play until fixing this garbage
Negative,"PC controls are clunky. Enemies can be in melee range and your character will still flail wildly doing no damage because he's attacking 20 degrees away unless you lock on, but once you lock on to an enemy all movement (and the camera) circles around them, which makes retreating to sip flasks clunky unless you unlock again. The combat is fast-paced and unforgiving enough without having to fight the camera movement and controls too.Also, all the instructions in the tutorial show moves using x-box controls, which makes them meaningless to a PC player. There are actually a lot of combat moves to figure out, you can't just spam attacks. Figuring out everything by experimentation was not pleasant.If you've never played a souls game before.... buyer beware."
Negative,This is a terrible port.  I can't recommend buying it on Steam at all.  Play it on a console if you really want to play it.  Even before you get to the actual gameplay the character creation screen is buggy and the character preview repeatedly freezes requiring you to restart the game.  If the developers cared at all about this port they would have fixed it by now.  The game is also effectively unplayable with keyboard and mouse.  They didn't even try to remap any prompts with the keybindings.  The camera controls with keyboard and mouse are buggy.  I've had the camera get stuck in terrain.  There is an auto-target but it doesn't reliably trigger because you either need to be very close to the enemy and it can be thrown off by elevation changes.
Negative,"The game in general is fun and challenging. However i bought the game wanting to play co-op with a friend; and we just cant get over how stupid of a design decision it was to make invasions obligatory; at least give me the option of turning them off. I don't care for the invasion side of the game, i don't want to invade, i don't want to be invaded. I don't find it a fun nor engaging part of the game, so just let me opt-out. I want to like the game, i really do, but with invasions being obligatory... no, i just hate it. Why are they (the developers) actively discouraging players from enjoying the game? Some people seem to think its due to ""creative vision"", to that i say ""I don't give two shits about their creative vision. Giving me the option to play the game the way I like to play it doesn't hurt the 'creative vision' one bit."". And to those saying ""just get good"", don't bother."
Negative,Game freezes like a bitch when playing with an XBOX 360 controller.
Negative,"took 2 hours to figure out multiplayer and then it was disappointing, couldn't refund because i played 3 hours and not 2...very angry!"
Negative,"Just an unfun game that feels like a chore and is not even correctly ported to PC platform, dull and boring graphics without the slighest change of scenery very slow paced with the same painfully repetitive fighting patterns."
Negative,"I seriously do not understand why people like this game.First, make no mistake: the PC version is garbage. It is a VERY poor port of the console version; they do not even bother to show you the equivalent keyboard and mouse commands during the tutorial -- you're told to hit the ""left button"" to guard? Oh, I see, you mean the *right button*. And the other commands are even more frustrating: you seriously have to do sleuthing to figure them out... one of the top Googles for this is ""what are the keyboard and mouse commands?""I cannot use game controllers for long; they kill my carpal tunnel syndrome. But hey, the reviews were great so I caved in and bought a USB game controller. Okay, at least the buttons make sense now, but not everything works... ""right plus B equals dash?"" Um no, it seems to equal ""roll.""Next up, and more importantly: the game is *boring* -- I'm not drawn into the story at all; there doesn't seem to be any engaging character or hero. Nothing for me to *care* about. Just a generic arcade game in a fantasy scenario.Finally, the game is *ugly*. Even after turning my resolution to max and every setting to ultra, the game looks seriously blocky and ugly, even by 2016 standards. I've played a number of games from ""back in the day"" that were, and still are, seriously beautiful, for the most part. Let's say... the Witcher 3, anyone?So, confusing, frustrating, boring, and ugly. HOW is this a top-selling game, again?"
Negative,"went trough most of the game whitout any issiues. but toward the last streatch for the prince boss, the game starts o zeases, hangs, and crashes so ****** frecuently, its neer impossible to play.  had to re do the grand archive 6 times due to crashes."
Negative,"I get invaders down to 10% health, they roll heal before my blade is even swinging, we do this dance again and again and again then they have me down now and so i heal finally oh boy only 2 drinks left better beat him now, well have they drink 10 more times i need to drink again, surely they're almost out of estus, nope and now im out and they're still drinking! ya this isn't dark souls, I'm not bad at the game I'm being punished for not having all the estus yet.TL:DR You get punished for not having all the estus yet, get gud does not apply here.Let me also add, I enjoy the game itself, just not the broken pvp. Enjoyed the pvp in ds2 and ds ptd"
Negative,"It's a really bad port. I have a decent gaming rig that handles every other game in my list perfectly (like DOOM everything on ultra 300+ fps, etc.) unless it's also just a crappy port or poorly optimized like 7 days to die, but Dark souls 3 takes the cake.It stutters every now and then and after a recent update it even started to freeze. In some areas it freezes for a few seconds but if you revisit the area it is suddenly fine. At first I thought it was the Xbone Controller, but nope even without any usb peripherals it does the same thing. Tried all the various fixes on the internet, even put it on my SSD. It's still just a bad port.In some areas you're taken back to the glory days of games like Morrowind where the game froze to load the new areas on the map. That's how it feels. No smooth transition just choppy and laggy situations or even complete freezes. And it didn't do that when I first played it, at least not to this extent. It must've become like this after some of the updates. It's just not fun to play a game that requires fast reactions and quick responses when it lags and freezes. Scholar of the first sin runs without any issues at all. They somehow must've made the engine of DS3 worse than it already was, I have no other explanation."
Negative,"This game stinks of mediocrity.Very bland and repetitive game play.Story.. What story ?Is it hard ? Kinda i guess but as long as you roll on the floor like a prick you're fine.This game leveling is rat piss annoying, and becomes a grind fest very quickly.No PC controls.... Last time i checked computers come with keyboard and a mouse not a game controller...If you never played a souls games don't bother, this isn't your typical fantasy game, you don't get a sense of progression you just move from an area to another with bosses in between, even the regular trash mobs are deadly and fighting more than one enemy at a time is a big no no.Doom 2016 on ultra nightmare (permanent death) was more manageable and fun and that was way harder because you were 2 hits away from death, more mobility meant many ways to deal with things. I know the games in question are different but the point i try to make is even when i died in Doom i had a motivation to start over because i got killed by my fault but Dark Souls 3 when you die it feels like the game screwed you over, the difficulty is bottom of the barrel hard.This is the most unforgiving the most insufferable and hard game ever but for all the wrong reasons...  Dark Souls 3 is very restrictive, stiff, and grind a lot for souls to level.It's a shame because it could be a good game, but the game can't be bothered to explain how certain game mechanics work, example is (parry and kick, rolling and many many more) i have a feeling these developers are very lazy you can tell by the crap port they slapped Xbox button prompts on PC and the game ""tutorial"" if you can call it that... it's just explaining very basic stuff like camera movement or blocking, yeah thanks that helps a lot.. How about telling me how the I-frame works when rolling, that would be a far more helpful information to tell me than push a stick to move the camera...This very reason is the cause of 90% of new players giving up on the game, my guess is they made the game too hard and it was too late to re-balance the game or adjust the difficulty and they slapped this immune when rolling thing at the last second.It's the only explanation i can think of why every bog standard trash mob in this game can kill you so easily."
Negative,"Srsly, no cloud save? Thanks for notice!"
Negative,very buggy and cant connect to controller that works wit other games so yeah took the cash back option
Negative,"Pros:Game is hard.Single player is fine and you can choose to NOT take part in PvP.Graphics... eh who cares. It's fine, maybe even good looking.Storyline and lore... I don't really care about the lore here but it's not annoying BS. Fits the game. Con:Co-op is a lot of the time NOT FUN, especially in the early game as you can't turn off the PvP element while you are still wielding a club and sporting no items worthy of mention and when you constantly get invaded by people that have spent 1000 hours making a low level ""twink"" by passing on NG+ items from their other characters, reinforcing their weapons and min-maxing their builds for newbie crushing purposes.You CAN kill them. It just takes a million years because they have a ton of HP, they hit like a train and keep healing up with estus even though you have used one of those undead charm things THAT'S SUPPOSED TO NOT ALLOW ESTUS HEALING. (I suppose those would be cheaters, but hey, add that to the list and make it plural.)It's a major pain in the ass when you can't progress in the game because of constant invasions by these no-life people, so it ruins the Co-op experience.Inb4 Notes:There's supposedly a mechanic where characters with improved weapons can't attack characters with majorly less improved weapons... Well it doesn't work because the balance is still broken. At low levels a gap of +2 is enough to mean the other one kills you in 4-5 hits while you might need 10-30 depending on the invader's hp etc.Of course I have to mention there are items to make mobs attack the invaders etc. But, they are not available from the start and also a few mobs are not going to stop these mommys little supermen.And of course it doesn't help that there is bound to be a skill difference between someone who has played thousands of hours of DS games and some ""newbie"" who has played a max of below a 4-digit number of hours total between all DS gamesI suppose this problem will be less pronounced when a new DS game comes out and the cellar dwellers move on to start making their twinks there.If...A. there was an option to turn off PvP from the menu...(maybe you could have it limited so you can have it off until lvl X or something??)B. there was a minimum level X for getting invaded...C. there was some cheap newbie item like the undead charm thing that would be more penalizing for the invader AND ACTUALLY WORKED (assuming it wasn't a cheater), with perhaps a level cap to when it can be used...D. there was a mechanic that if you have NG+ items or have a certain amount of playtime on a character, you couldn't invade people with practically no time or items on their character......then the co-op experience would probably be a lot better without ruining other game elements."
Negative,this isnt a game compatible with PC. all of the settings are for an xbox controller and when i play with a keyboard and mouse the movement controlls autorun backwords.
Negative,way overhypedreally dont get whats supposed to be so special and fun about this game
Negative,"Suprisingly, I couldn't get into this game.I enjoyed it for awhile, but I find myself going back to I and II.Maybe I'll try it again some day, but it just didn't hold my interest."
Negative,"Gameplay: A hardcore RPG with great combat mechanics for its type of game. It offers very little forgiveness and the possibillity to do anything you want with your character. You're put into the game with only knowlege of the very basic controls. There is zero hand holding. The game has some weird minor glitches from time to time, but rarely anything major (In my 400ish hours of playing the game I've had 1 major glitch where my computer crashed in the middle of playing the game, and when I rebooted and relogged into the game all my saves had been deleted, but there is a very slim chance of this happening).Graphics: A beautiful and horrible world, filled with beautiful and horrible art to match it. Each weapon in the game has a grand attention to detail, the armors are beautiful...your character...well thats up to you , but the overal apearance of the game is great.Multiplayer upon release: An amazing co op experiance with tons of people looking to do anything anywhere. This includes other players trying to invade and kill you for your ""ember"" (the spark that allows you to connect to other worlds and gives you an health bonus).Current multiplayer: Constant hackers, I've recorded about 2 hours of in game footage of hackers running amuck ruining any form of PvP or PvE (with freinds). These hacks include people instantly killing you in the PvP duel arena, people flying in the air and shooting a spell that travels much faster than it should and instantly kills you...the list goes on and on, about 1/6 people I invade/get invaded by, end up exploiting or using some form of hacks. The reason for this is because player items/status can be edited with a downloadable online editor. This editor has been around for awhile, but in the past 2 weeks it seems like the majority of people who are using it are no longer getting banned.This sole reason is why I cannont reccomend this game. I look to Dark Souls as a online focused game, but it has now started to slip into a downward state because of the game exploits/hacks that are ongoing. (such as enemies invading in boss rooms, being instantly cursed by a giant storm a player summons, invisible spears killing you, the list goes on and on).On any other account I would have to reccoemnd this game, but if you want to seek to have any online play at all, I would steer clear of it now. If you want it for only singleplayer, then feel free to get it."
Negative,"This game is 10/10 if you want to Co-op with friends. It's 7/10 if you want to PVE solo one playthrough. It's 5/10 if you want to solo and PvP. Why? Because invasions are broken. There's no longer enough people that play for you to be matched with people in your immediate level range. Invading another person's game works like this, you can invade people 5-10 levels lower than you but you'll also be able to invade people 20-30 levels higher than you. With a low population this means most of your invasions are going to be against guys that take way less damage than you and deal way more. 120 used to be where everybody stopped, but now at 120 most of your invasions are going to be agaist 3 level 135+ players. If you're a god I guess this doesn't matter, but if you're looking for fun you're not going to find it after your first playthrough of the game. They're going to be using the heaviest armor in the game, a meta weapon, and buff that thing to 700+ damage easy. For example, if you play a 120 strength build (gigantic clunky sword) you will be out damaged by somebody with a straight sword who is 130+. Now imagine invading 150's all night. No this isn't recommended."
Negative,If you want to pvp this is not the souls game for you as of the date i am posting this
Negative,"Fix your game From.Edit: They fixed most of it, but I still don't like it."
Negative,this garbage has nothing to do with dark souls
Negative,REFUND REQUESTED:This game was/is not release ready. FROMSOFT seems to be falling the way of Batkman Arkham. Game is not fully optimized for all rigs and even top end rigs run below 20 fps at times. I was unable to get past 5 fps and I could run DSII 60 fps @1080p....Will update as news comes in.
Negative,"Frame drops, bad collision. You're more likely to die from an enemy pushing you into wall geometry than you are to anything else. This game has a lot of artificial game lengtheners, you know, things put in specifically to make you waste time: super long unnecessary ladders, open empty spaces, waiting 30 seconds before showing your death after you've already died. I have honestly died more times to being pushed into wall geometry than anything else in this game, it's not a sign of high difficulty, it's a sign of poor programing."
Negative,"I have tried to enjoy all of the Dark Souls games at various times in my life, and I cannot for the life of me understand the hype.You can count the number of seconds I've had fun playing the franchise on a quadruple amputees's digits."
Negative,"This game truly sux balls, should never of been released for the PC with this control system, If I wanted to play with a controller I would of baught a fucking console.When the controls are this crap it ruins any chance of a good game IMO.This is the true definintion of a console game, Of course Ill rate it badly its not for me , waste of my time and money.60 fps capped what a joke.Think I'll go back to Just cause 3 or Fallout 4, maybe wait for doom."
Negative,"There's 3 kinds of people in this world.1) People who like DS1 and 22) People who like DS33) Normal people who don't play DS.I'm in the 1st camp.  I love a frustrating challenge, but I get no joy from twitchy grinds like Super Meat Boy.  DS3 is just that... an absurdly fast paced time suck.  Some like that; I didn't."
Negative,I was invding a world and the person I was invading fucked my game and I lost over 100+ hours of playtime on my main chracter and theres not point in even making a new character and Im furious. FUCK THIS GAE
Negative,"FromSoftware needs to fix this exploit, its way out of hand"
Negative,Worst controls ever in a game. Makes it unnecessary hard and clunky.
Negative,turning your own despair into some kind of fetish?Abnormailty dosen't begin to describe this social experiment of a game
Negative,Dont buy this game if you dont have a controller. Absolute garbage PC controlls/support
Negative,"Can't play yet! Ultra or Low, no difference, still 9 FPS!!!!"
Negative,No way to disable invasions. I just want to coop through with my friend but the game is unplayable. Be ready to be CONSTANTLY invaded by higher level more experianced players. There is no way for us to progress. We are not good and cant pvp. This is so stupid. I love losing my limited number of embers bacause other players like to kill new character.
Negative,"Tl;dr DS is mostly hard because of the terrible controls. If you were actually in control of your character the game would be way easier and fun.First tried to play with mouse + keyboard but the tutorial of the game only shows the controller symbols. After trying to figure it out for a while I gave up and switched to my old Xbox 360 controller. Controls are still terrible with that tho. For example you have to hold left stick + B and then press the left stick in to jump. Another example would be parry being on LT which only registers after you pushed it in 0,5 cm which obisously is terrible for things that need timing.Due to the controller you also can't strafe which might really fuck with your movement if you aren't used to not strafing.Also it feels like all my character input is delayed. If I press B to dodge my character does nothing for half a second, then gets hit and then after that does the roll when I no longer need it and wastes stamina by doing so. No action feels responsive in this game, like there was a built in delay for everything. The world and artstyle is really nice so if you feel like getting used to delayed character controls you will have a great world to explore.EDIT: After another 13 hours I switched back to mouse and keyboard which made the game a lot easier for me after figuring out the buttons. Most of my complaints still apply tho. Because sprint and dodge are on the same button (you can't bind them to different keys) theres always a delay because the game need to figure out if you are holding the button to start sprinting or if you are releasing it to roll. Also you can't rebind kick and I still have no idea what combination of buttons makes me kick since the tutorial was only for controller and I can't look it up in the controls (since you can't rembind it it isn't even listed). So now I just sometimes kick randomly and I don't know why.The input queue is really REALLY annoying too. If you press the attack button before your attack finishes it will automatically queue another attack even if you didnt press again when the animation of the first attack finished. So you end up rolling / attacking when you don't want it sometimes.That makes the whole experience needlessly clunky."
Negative,Looks like a nice game but I had to return it because it doesn't make sense that when you start the game on pc it shows you how to play the game on console.. what? Dude if you gonna make a game for pc at least show me how to play it.
Negative,play 2 instead
Negative,Control scheme doesn't carry over to PC very well.
Negative,"This game is GREAT FOR MASOCHISTS.(Reason for label Negative is on the bottom)Here are my complaints and other... things: The game is hard, indeed. The shields are pretty much uselless shit but you need it to fight groups of enemies with higher AS. Rolls are terrible technique. You can roll in full armor all the fucking time even with practically no stamina and guess what? It's the only thing that works. Everything MISLEADS you and only a little is explained. Items could have better descriptions (and I don't mean damned stats, you can shove them up your ass).  I accidentally killed an important guy because he talked shit about how he wants death. Then I found out the guy can be useful but there is no way to bring him back so I had to play it again. Things in the game looks like their only purpose is to fuck up with you, like it wouldn't be enough that there are hidden powerful enemies, mimics and other stuff all around. So far, where I said to myself ""fuck it"", there is pretty much no story. Along with endless rolling, runing here and there like retard after dying, analyzing movements of your enemies over and over, and dealing with the same shit without a change the game gets boring, especially when a great frozen fuck gets you because you have no way to block a shit n you dont roll fast enough. Again, the REPETETIVE goddamn running here and there because you die or have to buy something or maybe go to another place without fighting annoying enemies is just awful. FIGHTING is weird, along with earlier mentioned rolling like a damn armadillo and shields with use of trash can lid, even the ""weak"" enemies can deal you great amount of damage and after that you have to spend your sacred estus so you can survive another fight if you god forbid it get a random stun lock (if you aren't killed instantly lol). And ranged aiming seems weird to me but you may be fine with it, idk. AMBIENCE is great but gets boring when you are stuck in one location. DESIGN is not bad at all, some are weird but some are really great and realistic. MUSIC is cool but I really hate how it gets really deep, fast and on 300% volume in moment you enter bossfight (for me it gets annoying after moment, makes your focus worse and I have to decrease the volume right away - subjective!). I usually do but at this game, don't even remember how did I get it. Generally tho, for 60€ it seems like a damn sick gamble between greatest game you have ever played and absolutely terrible piece of garbage.I know there are people who love this game, good for you. This Review is marked as Negative because there is nothing in between and I recommend you to purchase this game only if you are sure you will like it, and if you still don't know, to be sure you stay in the extent where you can ask for refund.Good luck and hope you will enjoy it, praise the sun."
Negative,"stay away from this game, even on the lowest settings frame rates will drop to nothing either pause the game or crash it, even on high end systems, terrible performance, seem to be cutting off the cpu."
Negative,"First time playing the dark souls series. If you like endless repetition and learning how to do something the exact right way then this is the game for you. Personally I found this style of play boring and frustrating. Also annoying that the in game tutorial are all geared towards controller and not mouse / keyboard how hard would that be to correct, just lazy IMO."
Negative,"If issues can just develop out of no where that stops this game from running, don't buy it. Dumped 500+ hours into a game that decides it doesn't want to run anymore, literally out of the blue. Keep your hard earned money, don't bother buying this."
Negative,Kb/M support non-existent. Game spammed my screen to use controller inputs even though no controller was plugged in and then the game would completely lock up requiring me to hard exit the game. Tried with controller but simple actions require button combos that make zero sense and only makes gameplay frustrating at best. I really wanted to play this game after all the great reviews but this port is nothing more than pure laziness and I refuse to put up with it.
Negative,"While the gameplay is good and enjoyed it enough to 100% the game, the keyboard controls and online play are supported bare minimum.To play online I had to buy VPN. Even then it takes me more than 10 minutes on average to join someone else's world.In other words I paid double the game price to play online for a limited time, which comes with 10 minute wait time every summon.Also the game doesn't go on sale for a game that is 7 years old."
Negative,Was able to do multiplayer for a while. However the second time around I got banned for just existing in the game. I literally did nothing wrong. It's a good game but don't do multiplayer cuz you'll get banned.
Negative,server down game down
Negative,"okay, imagine lubing up some roller skates and trying to have a swordfightthat's how this game feels"
Negative,bok gibi oyun
Negative,getting it to start on launch in 2019 is harder than the actual fucking game
Negative,"After few hours on this game, I guess I'll post a review of my humble experience of it. Well, at first, I'd like to say this game is really...SER_PERCEVAL'S REVIEW HAS STOPPED WORKING"
Negative,"I like the part where the game crashes! The first boss was fun! I wonder how the others are! Ohh wait.. can't get to them, because you cant even link the main bonfire."
Negative,"this game blows all i do is spam r to heal and i get killed while doing so because my guy is too busy drinking his flask to dodge, and all the npcs are more depressing than the general vicinity of the losers i work with. fuck this"
Negative,I start the game up for the 1st time (I've yet to even make a character). The 1st thing I see ? Caution you have been penalized invalid game data remains present on your account. What sort of anti cheating is in this game to see that the 1st time you play the game. Anyway this puts me off playing the game for now. All the game files check out so I'm out of idea's about what happened.
Negative,"Wtf! I changed my mind. I didn't have to buy it. If you are masochist dude, well, this game was made for you. If you don't like punishing yourself you will be dissapointed when you meet the first boss."
Negative,LET ME PLAY
Negative,dogshit game don't buy
Negative,its actually 1400 hours across my console playtime and alt accounts
Negative,just play ds2 man
Negative,NO MF STEAM CLIUD WTFWTWFWTF
Negative,"Its a fun game dont get me wrong but their anti-cheat is utter bs. Pick up an item from a suspected hacker and your account gets flagged and banned for ""modfications"" apperently seems to be a common thing. Can't play online anymore which is really the only fun reason to play this game"
Negative,"i have been baned for seemingly no reason at all probably because i encounterd a hacker in pvp and that automaticly penalizes you for some reason, contacted game devs and they said nothing they can do about it bacuse it not their fault (blam shifting to antoher company on the other side of the planit) and my account is still penalized to this day even with 0 charachters on it (yes i deleted all my charachters so i could hopefully get un penalized but to no avail) so my solution to this is to not buy their future product because if they dont care i dont care :)"
Negative,"I would request a refund If I could I used to have fond memories of this game hence my larger than normal hours played however upto 2 minute pauses have rendered it unplayable  I have trawled forums for hours and hours to no avail my specs are GTX 1080 8GB ,i7 4770 , 16gb ddr4 RAM My machine used to run this buttery smooth rolling back my drivers didnt work either , I run far more graphically and Cpu intensive games no problem so I place my problems squarely  at the games feet its all the more frustrating as I used to adore this game , now its wasted HDD space"
Negative,"My first playthrough of Dark Souls 3 was very enjoyable and let me put it straight its a good game all by itself . But its not even close to the quality of Dark Souls 1 .  I have no itentions to bash this game but everything about Dark Souls 3 feels flat or functional . Even Bloodborne's engine fails to recapture the atmosphere of Lordran . The levels just feel varied enough to push through the game but not even a single location is noteworthy or memorable , most of the areas are castles and dungeons and swamps and forests , not that they are badly designed  but they don't really overwhelm the imagination and leave you in awe like  like Ash Lake , Painted Worlds , Lost Izalith and so many others from Dark Souls 1 .And the enemies are a mixed bunch, many feel like they don't even belong in the world of Dark Souls . For Example : Giant Crabs ! I expected more from FROM SOFTWARE . Where is the magic gone ? Ultimately Dark Souls 3 feels like a Dark Souls game lacking the mood and the atmosphere of what made Dark Souls a unique gem and does nothing to add to the original's legacy ."
Negative,"Game was almost cool, kinda annoying how some bosses are hard to kill even after playing through the game 4 times... IMHO."
Negative,Base game is fine. Being an invader is impossible.
Negative,Banned me for picking up some items ffs shit support
Negative,I can't wait for the game to be finished.
Negative,Althought the game has some nice features and is a well story driven game the factor that allows invastions to happen while trying to co-op the game ruins it and any drive to play
Negative,"The controller support isn't there tried 3 different controller, tried half a day fixes from the internet, still no sucess. And i am by far not the only one, I am sorry but the game for me at least is not playable without controller."
Negative,"I really dislike the dark souls games and i've been trying to figure out why for some time, for a while i bought into the idea that i just wasn't smart enough or skilled enough to play them but now i think i've figured out what my issue is with them.What it comes down to is how you learn a games mechanics, in most games you are given a choice of difficulty so you can start of at a lower one so you can both learn the games mechanics and stll enjoy it;s story and progression this is generally what keeps me invested in a game and keeps me playing.But in Souls like games this approach does not work and i dont think is intended, so for an example lets take a boss, what i like to do is take my time and learn what works and doesn't work against them and in most cases health is sufficient to take some hits and practice fighting the boss, but in souls likes it doesn't allow this kind of learning you are expected to either get it right or die and they expect you to learn from this and try again, this goes back to how older generation games tended to work where you would repeat the section over and over until you figure it out, but growing up with those games i generally came to dislike this approach, and then i played doom with its difficulty options this for me was perfect as it gave me a bit of space to figure things out while still enjoying the game, this is what from software is missing and i hope that in the future they will understand that not everyone learns the same way, so until difficulty levels are implemented in there games i cannot support them which is sad to me because i love the art and the lore in these games but the way they work is just not suitable for me and others who learn like me, i dont think that these games are difficult they just dont allow a gentle progression which is what i would love to see in the future."
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 has a very old fashioned static maze like game design. What this means is there's really no way for you to know anything about the game except via trial and error or you look it up via a 3rd party like Youtube. Luckily it's a very popular game so there is hours upon hours of guides. Whether that be the story line / lore of the game /  explanations of what stats do / hard and soft cap (break points) for stats / or ways to cheese bosses during fights.The dev team did a good job in recapturing old game design like Super Mario Bros. You gotta get to the boss as healthy as you can be and you better know what the boss is going to do! When you die go back and do it again getting a little better at the maze each time until you beat it. They also have several easter egg type mechanics that can make certain fights much easier if you're observant (or if you look them up in guides).The controls are very unresponsive and clunky. There's no way to switch the default keybinds from console keybinds to PC keybinds. So you'll have to memorize the conversions of Console to PC commands and most likely have to make new binds. I think if you're looking to buy Dark Souls 3 I would go out and find a USB controller to play with. In MMORPGs and RPGs I generally always play casters and I found the magic in DS3 to be very lack luster I'm use to playing casters with upwards of 30+ abilities keybound. This is the main reason I chose to not recommend this game. However, I would recommend this game more for people interested in hack and slash style game play rather than magic. I think if you like God of War / Darksiders type game play you'll enjoy DS3. It's a throwback game design that was and is extremely enjoyable to a lot of people. Personally I prefer magic focused RPGs and the magic/caster elements of this game don't have enough depth to really keep my attention.TLDR: Buy a controller for this game         : At the very least look up what each stat does and its hard and soft caps"
Negative,you guys need to make it easier to play with friends bc this is straight up retarded i cant even get my friends sign to com up in my world and i did everyting right then when we were finally playing together all of the sudden it kicked me out of my own game so fuck you
Negative,"I highly recommend it to players who want to play offline. I haven't played the game in about a week and I've been banned for nothing. Therefore, I do not recommend it to anyone, even if it is a good game. I thank the developers for losing 90 euros."
Negative,eww ugly game !!
Negative,"estus glitch ruining pvp, infinite was ok but still punishable, the new is so toxic, u cant punish them drinking..."
Negative,this game sucks every kind of dick
Negative,tbh its about as fun as jaking it with sandpaper.
Negative,"GameReady™ Nvidia®™ GayWorks Dark Souls 3 "" 2013 drivers works better than new"" Blocked GPU®™ Please B.U.Y. NEW ONE®™"
Negative,"no servers, game is bad"
Negative,"Only buy this on sale. This game goes downhill real fast after the first major boss, much of it is very rushed.If you are unlucky enough on purchasing this game you won't be able to play it due to the numerous counts of crashing, instability and poor framerate.While this game is fun, it does not hold up well against the other souls games and I recommend spending the money elsewhere."
Negative,"Great game , love the difficulty and mechanics..Only 1 giant problem....Character save files are kept on your hard disk... Meaning if you by any chance get fucked by ""soft that is also so micro""  or anything else really and need to reinstall your OS or anything in similar manner youre fucked.And i found it the hard way...I own deluxe edition which is fuckin 85euro, yet doesnt have simple thing as cloud saves... Thanks MiyazakiI still highly recommend to buy the game, hell even older titles in series (fuck the DS2 sotfs doe, get ""vanilla""one instead)"
Negative,"Originally bought this on the PS4 at launch and played for maybe 20 hours before losing interest, and recently came back to see if my opinion had changed. Sadly, I have definitely soured since then, and I can say that I don't like it all that much. Dark Souls III is the worst Souls-style game From Software has made, by a country mile. And that includes Demon's Souls' original version, Bloodborne, Sekiro, Demon's Souls Remake, and Elden Ring.It's not a terrible game, per se, and some fun can be scraped up by the devoted, but I certainly have no affection for it. More often than not it's just annoying and sloggy, and feels like a much worse version of Demon's Souls with more than a slight nod to Bloodborne's twisted, Halloween version of medieval fantasy.Bonfire distance seems random. They are often too close together when engaging in general traversal, but are too far from actual boss fights. It gives the feeling of being coddled during normal play, but feels almost abusive when confronting a challenging boss. It feels untested and rushed. Speaking of bosses...Bosses are bullshit. My biggest issue with the Souls games usually comes down to poor camera control and stability. A lot of Dark Souls 3's early bosses are focused on tells that happen off screen if you are locked on, because they are too high in the air or the boss is simply too big. It leaves you to rely on sound cues, which ""could"" be good game design, but it feels cheap here. I had to rely on this tactic for the witch boss in the woods, and what I ended up doing was just spamming the dodge button when I heard the airborne attack bursting above me, and then I just mashed it in between attacks when up against the boss and she died easily. The victory felt so cheap because the more I tried and paid attention, the more I died... so I just yeeted in there and yolo'd my inputs and the boss crumbled. Terrible. But that's not even counting the glitches and general jank. Your weapon will bounce like a ricocheting bullet off of any surface that isn't a destructible object, but frequently, large enemy weapons like polearms will have no collision detection with the environment whatsoever, which gives the impression that you are playing by a completely different set of rules than the enemy. Want to try to bottleneck an enemy through a doorway? Lol, idiot, they can just cut through the wall and take half of your healthbar. This applies to the Deacons of the Deep bossfight, where I was doing fine, had the boss comfortably down to the second phase, then I made a bad move and got struck by an enemy (my fault, that's fine), which was follwed up by a gigantic enemy magic attack that soared right through a 30 foot wide object in the middle of the room. No collision detection. No warning. Nothing.I think my biggest issue, though, is how terrible the lock on system is. It's ps1 levels of garbage. It frequently breaks for no discernible reason whatsoever, and quite often cannot find someone I am 10 feet away from, have the camera pointed at, and have my character facing. It's absolutely maddening.I also had a few enemies clip directly into the environment or get stuck in the air during fights. All of this gives the game an unpolished, unfinished feeling that I can't shake.Ultimately, that's where I tapped out on my return to this... fiasco. Dark Souls 3 is even worse than the frequently cheap, annoying, tedious game I remembered. This series is near and dear to me, but Dark Souls 3 foists upon you a depressingly unfun experience that leans into all the worst aspects of the series. For every moment of fun I found myself having, I had at least one or two moments where I was simply exhausted trying to look past all of the problems rubbing themselves in my face. Irritating status debuffs, tanky enemies, horrendous camera, janky lock on, poor collision detection, and a small, sometimes bland world all conspire to leave you with something that feels less like an engrossing adventure than a game of inches."
Negative,"I don't like the changes in ds3. it's more like bloodborne than dark souls. PvP is based around meta weapons. it's hard to defeat opponent with meta weapon. healing for invader is a bit too much, it makes most invasions too long (ds2 solved it in a better way. invaders can't heal but phantoms too). about the pve the bosses are fine, but locations become boring fast,especially that progress is much more linear than ds1 or even ds2. (after dlcs it's a bit better). the plot actually is not that engaging comparing to other games. there're some interesting quests and lore but most of it is just ds1 fanservice put everywhere."
Negative,"After putting considerable hours into this game i'm already done with it.The main story is riddled with highly missable things that are borderline integral to making an otherwise bland boss-run of a solo game actually enjoyable. And regardless of which, it becomes painfully hard to play after the third playthrough. Add that to the fact that many enemies become overpowered due to the lack of poise and it becomes pretty unenjoyable fairly quickly, considering the game is only a few months old.Now for the multiplayer.Wholely unenjoyable, but thats down to the community really. I loved Dark Souls. But this one is just one big snoozefest. The NG+ game is too easy, the covenants didn't work until only very recently and more often than not if I am autosummoned to a world i'm sent right back due to the fight taking shorter than the summoning time!"
Negative,"Dear developers, your game looks and feels amazing, I would recommend it to everyone, because of the challanges the game gives you.But this is a angry review.Reasons:Network glitches: Getting help or summoning others is impossible unless you use a Ember. Allso most of the time when me and my friends try to get help or want to help then the servers use to much time to send us help or send us to the person that needs help. Allso, that anyone can at any time just invade your game when you only want to run around and experiance the game with some help and have some fun.Mob/NPC glitches: I've come across, normal mobs, bigger mobs, small bosses and big bosses that respawns instantly as soon as you kill them. There is a bug in the programming that is so bad that I want my cash back for this game.Buttons: Locking people is very hard, unless your character actually is turned the correct way and is looking at them you cannot lock them, but the npcs for example can shoot you with spells and arrows fromt he other side of the damn map, while yourself has to move within 3 meters of them to be able to target them.And the jumping? Which idiot remapped the keys in such a horrible way that people who actually could do DS2 without leveling cant even get a single item because they have to use forever to find out how to jump in a game."
Negative,not enough sex with the hot male population0/10
Negative,Very poorly optimized. Don't bother at all.
Negative,I feel like the fandom of this series is some kind of elaborate trolling conspiracy.
Negative,bad PC port
Negative,Why Your Dark Soul Server keep disconnected . few min disconnected for server how to play this game please fix this problem!!!
Negative,"I am beyond aggitated with this game. i baught to play co op with some friends using the new password link ingame. we all thought it would be fun and enjoyable, we were dead wrong. if you arent max level with all the best geear NEVER EVER JOIN ANYONE JUST PLAY OFFLINE. we were instantly killed every 10 seconds when trying to get a group together by people ""invading"" our private, password protected session. All of us were new so we were low level with no good gear, and would get slaughtered instantly. As long as there is no way to play co op without being invaded, i will never purchase this game again."
Negative,"This is a great game that has been rendered unplayable by the most recent patch, 1.08. I was loving the game until it was patched and now it crashes so often that it is practically unplayable. From, if you fix this I will change my review, but at this point I feel like I have wasted $60. PLEASE fix this because I would love to play this game!!! I am on the last boss, the ""Soul of Cinder."" The game crashes whenever I die. The loading screen never shows up, the game just goes black and then stops working. Don't waste your money on this game until this gets fixed. I am honestly very dissapointed with From Software, because I have read that many other people have had issues with this PC port."
Negative,"I mean it's a Dark Souls game, the game is not meant to be easy. The game is fun and challenging at times, and grinding makes this game a breeze. The only reason I won't recommend this game period, is Invading.Invading is such a toxic thing that really ruins this game. It always happens before a boss and someone invades, kills me and I have to fight to get back to where I was. I wish I didn't have to unplug my ethernet cable everytime, someone either invades or forces me to invade. Like do these people just have that terrible of a life that they have to share there misery with me. No thank you. TBH people who do this, deserve a death worse than any in this game, and so do the devs who thought this idea was good.Outside of my saltyness on that subject, the game is fine. Just play this game offline and ignore the co-op, it is a lie, and you will be fine."
Negative,Worst soul game...
Negative,pkcs fun weapon :cowboy:
Negative,Does not support windowed fullscreen
Negative,lothric made me neglect my mental health and despite this game being very good in some aspects i highly reccoment you dont play it if you care about your sanity DS3 < elden ring
Negative,"PC port's shite, the UI still uses xbox buttons for some reason, considering this is the third entry in the series you would think Troll Software would actually care to replace a couple of textures. Not to mention many people need to lower the lightning and effects quality in order for the game to not crash every five minutes. Problems with anti-aliasing persist and apparently framerate is still linked to game logic... GTX 1080 7/10Anything else -1/10"
Negative,"I get that it was designed to be played with controllers, but jesus fried christ you could have at least implemented button prompts for keyboard players.I got this as a gift because friends wanted to see me suffer. Read other people's reviews if you want something with more substance."

Negative,"This is from the perspective of someone who has never played a Dark Souls game before. Only 110 minutes played so I could return this.Pros:-First and foremost, the difficulty... is amazing! It really follows the whole ""hardest game"" thing and I love it. That is a big bonus for this game.-Beautiful sceneryCons:-The pros are unfortunately completely overshadowed by the fact that this game has the most clunky half a**ed and terrible porting of any game I have ever played. -Keyboard and mouse controls are terrible and clunky. You cannot accurately move in the direction you want to and feels like a pokemon game.-All and I mean ALL in game tips and keybinds show xbox buttons. This means it says ""press A to continue"" or ""press B to go back"" for example. Meanwhile you are left to your own devices to figure out what keyboard button does what within in game menus.-The complexity of the controls on keyboard make the console versions look like a cake walk. Want to move in dodge and swipe from the side? Better hope you are perfectly lined up enough for your 90 degree directional facing to put you in the right spot while you utilize a mix of keys between holding shift, pressing space bar and clicking X mouse button to perform simple attacks, while consoles press left bumper. ==Note, you get the hang of it eventually, but the keyboard is so far behind controllers you are literally handicapped and unable to perform the variety of tactics possible unless you purchase a controller to play with due to the precision of the thumbsticks, meaning an additional 40+ dollars if you don't buy the steam controller bundle (which has it's own problems)==The list goes on, but this is what needs to be said the most."
Negative,All I wanted to do was play with my friends and i've been penalized. I deleted my save and waited a few weeks yet i'm still penalized. the game itself can be frustrating but this is just infuriating.
Negative,- No controllers working.- Pathetic PC port.- Bad performance.- You can't access your characters on another PC cause the save file is local.How embarrasing to release a game in this state.
Negative,if you buy this game to coop with your friends or your brother. I recommend that you do not buy this game your coop will be disturbed with other player became dark spirit
Negative,I had a controller. HAD.
Negative,"20/10 game. Much more than a Dark Souls clone. In fact I would say this game far exceeds anything the Soulsborne franchise has to offer. My character broke her spine walking around the main hub. My friend Jeremiah says I am dumb for playing this game, but he is the dumb one because he plays the souls games and they suck. I win hehe he sucks. This game rocks my world. <3"
Negative,"Logged in and my save data was wiped!? BDT / BDH data files look to be the same size as last time i logged in, so guessing an update corrupted them!? already started from scratch 3 times due to lost data & no cloud save. Not doing this a 4th time. rip"
Negative,"Save your money, a complete waste for a large number of people.Unpayable crashtastic mess. Is the game hard? who knows when your dropped every other min back to main menu.Maybe in a year or so they will work out the bugs so you can actually die."
Negative,"The game has its ups and downs but there is something very important you have to know before you decide to purchase the game, the anti-cheat system in this game is a complete failure, it will suspend or ban you if you decide to use graphic mods such as iGP11 or the like, you will also get penalized if you interact with a cheater in some capacity, something that you may not have full control of (since they can invade you), unless you plan on playing offline for the rest of your life do not pick this game, it will be a waste of money."
Negative,"Sort of requires a CONTROLLER, the intro zone teaches you controller functions even if you use keyboard and mouse.  As a newbie to DarkSouls and never playing a previous version it was too much of a pain to try and figure out the keyboard and mouse functionality.  I regret purchasing this product and will not purchase any of their future products if they are going to half ass the keyboard and mouse functionality.1. New players will need a CONTROLLER2. Keyboard and mouse is not intuitive3. Newbie zone teaches CONTROLLER even if you use keyboard and mouseIf you are a keyboard and mouse gamer I do not recommend unless you want to put in extra time learning the functionality that is not taught in the intro.g4. I do not recommend the game if you are a keyboard and mouse gamerThis is my personal opinion.  There are people who have mastered the keyboard and mouse for this game and say it is easy but most of those had played the previous DarkSouls games and had a foundation for the keyboard and mouse functionality.  I said most, not all."
Negative,"Fix multiplayer.  Everyone else just slides around, and we can't tell what each other are doing.  Stupid."
Negative,"Absolutely fucking impossible to play on a computer. Support usb controllers, my ass"
Negative,My save data is corrupted and after getting close to the very end after 80hrs my only option is to start over.....
Negative,"dont buy it.game is broken right now.the game suffers from massive framerate drops all the time, unplaylable."
Negative,You'll be strongly put off by other players if you're just joining. Play offline.
Negative,You can only easily play with 3 friends. Having a fourth is extremely time consuming and difficult / only works in some zones. Pvp is terrible: Poise does not exist. No punishment for drinking. Spells weight as much as lead are extremely slow. Super armor from special attacks puts people in cut scenes in which they cannot take damage while they dance around like anime.  dark souls 1 and 2 are better.
Negative,"GTA:SA Lançado em 2004.Um modder com PC da xuxa fez o jogo iniciar em menos de 3 segundos.DS3: Lançado em 2016.Empresa gigante decide demorar uma eternidade comparável a GTA V para iniciar o jogo.Se o tempo de vocês é lixo, então joguem.E eu nem estou considerando que o jogo fica em tela branca no início porque ele quase crasha, fica dando click para aparecer janela do Windows, huh.Esse jogo quer atenção.

Negative,"Pros:Great graphicsInteresting conceptRuns smooth without crashes or GPU overheatsCons:No discernible story line at allNo maps (a massively dumb idea for an RPG)Weak magic systemWeak crafting systemBoring fight mechanicsTerrible tutorials and even worse key mappingOne word that would describe this so-called RPG, LAZY. I bought this game based on the positive reviews it received and I was fairly disappointed. I have never played any of the other games in this franchise, but if they are anything like this I will pass. This game is basically an RPG made for console players. The keyboard mouse controls are completely unexplained leaving it to the user to figure out the key mapping, no tutorial or helpful prompts at all except for gamepad controls which is ridiculous since a PC player may or may not actually have a gamepad.  It literally has zero story, and I mean ZERO story. There was absolutely no connection to your character and the world itself, the adversity facing your character, nothing at all. Nothing but a bunch of nebulous, vague talk from NPCs that never really explains what is happening, why you are there, or what you are supposed to accomplish. There are no quests, no maps, no quest waypoint markers, literally nothing to guide a player from one objective to another. You basically wander around killing every creature you encounter until you inevitably find a boss type character. Occasionally you find gear or unlock a hidden area, but the whole thing seemed completely unfocused and pointless. I got all the way to the very end and was shocked at the complete lack of payoff. I had absolutely no idea I had finished off the final boss because the lazy writing that went into this game. Everything about this game seems lazy, the script, the objectives, the combat, everything seems created to entice the dumbest dregs of RPG fandom into playing. All you have to do is create a character and immediately just run around and kill everything you encounter. You can even kill the helpful NPCs and it has almost no consequence on game play whatsoever. The combat is very boring, you have maybe three different weapon attacks, and that is it. The magic was completely ineffectual against powerful enemies, the crafting/forging system was so basic and rudimentary I thought I was playing a game made in 2001. The concept of being undead in an undead world is intriguing, but the complete lack of explanation of literally ANYTHING detracts from any of positive points of this game. Even as antiquated as Elder Scrolls: Oblivion is, it is still a better game than this one because at least you knew where you were going, why you were doing it, and had an overall objective, close the Oblivion portals and Oblivion is over 15 years old. This game has absolutely none of the things that makes a good RPG, no character development, no intriguing story, no quests, no maps, it is a sub par RPG made for people who lack the intelligence to do anything other than kill enemies. I probably would not have given it such a bad review if it had marketed itself as a hack and slash RPG, but it tricks you into thinking you are purchasing a legit RPG only to be left wondering at the end of the story ""what did I accomplish?""."
Negative,"I want to be clear: I only bought this because I have a lot of faith in FromSoftware and I believe in them, so I wanted to throw money at them.Let’s get this out of the way: this is the worst Souls game yet out of all 3. This game was, is and will ever be a mistake from FromSoft, but I forgave them because they are good people and great developers. But they have been lazy and greedy on this installment of Dark Souls.Now then, this is what is good about this game:- Irithyll- Meaningful references to previous Dark Souls and Demons Souls- Great animations- Impressive weapon and NPC models- Mostly great and memorable boss fights- Sword artBad stuff? Oh boy...- Uninteresting NPC dialogs and interactions- Shallow story (not lore)- Copy/Pasted enemies (Not bosses)- Mostly boring level design, everything looks the same except Irithyll- Amazing bullshit factor and broken hitboxes- Meaningless covenants- Massive input inaccuracy due to a stupid AF input queue system (who the hell’s idea was this?!)- Some bosses are extremely unbalanced- Most weapons have the exact same design and movesets- No love given to casting classes at all, almost no major armor and spell upgradesThis game doesn’t require skill for a player to be good at it. It all depends on luck. Some of the bosses are genuinely challenging like Aldrich, and thats one of the rare stages in this game that I actually thought I died because of my own mistakes. Thats why after 3 times and identifying all my mistakes and rectifying them, I beat him easily. 80% of the game is NOT like that. Dancer of the Boreal Valley? Yeah, she can grab me even if I’m a mile away from her. She even hits behind her even if her swords don’t go there.I realize most of Souls fanboys aren’t exactly the brightest people around and they will rage, but Idgaf, if I can go through this bullshit of a game just because its a souls game and I have to play it, I can handle a bunch of idiots raging on a sincere REAL fan of the souls series. Playing the game doesnt mean I HAVE to like it. Welcome to the 21st century."
Negative,I member dark souls 1!!!!!!
Negative,Barely able to connect to anyone if you're a high level person.
Negative,very bad all characters were gay and firekeeper was cute aand i died too much because it was gay please play this game.
Negative,"Game is a difficult, tedious, hell-ish slog I wouldn't want to replay I would recommend Bloodborne, Sekiro or Elden Ring instead, similar titles I enjoyed and have replayed."
Negative,Wheneven i blay this game i go into a blind rage and destroy my room. i have broken 3 brand new gaming pcs and i would not even recomend anyone buys this game because it suck and it makes everythang bad you might even inflict bodily harm on your pets ( not saying that i have of course )
Negative,"The fights take ages because now it's actually designed for people to constantly heal until they run out of estus chugs, with a fast animation that's almost impossible to punish.  Just like BB's blood vials.PvP in BB is the worst of any recent Fromsoft game in large part because of this, but apparently Miyazaki didn't notice."
Negative,"This game feels like a lazy sequel designed to appeal to the O-Muhzaki-sama fanboys and is full of little issues that only become apparent after sinking time into the game.-Most player animations are recycled from DS1 or replaced with something wrist breaking like the two handed curved sword R1.  -Rocketboots rolls.-Weapon arts range from mostly useless to gimicky.-PvP feels like a side note.-Covenents are shit.-Borrowed the wrong ideas from Bloodborne and discarded too many good ideas from DS2.-MUH ONIONBRO-Too many throwbacks for that matter.-Player character is a manlet.-Repeats all the mistakes of DS1 plus more!-Muhzaki is a hack who I am convinced stumbled into success with piecing together DeS, recycled DeS into DS1, handed DS2 off to somebody else so that he could work on his new baby Bloodborne, and would have rather worked on Bloodborne 2 than DS3. Based off the lack of effort put into the game, I also don't think From will do much patching like they did with DS2.  I could go on, but, much like Muhzaki, I would rather not put in the effort.Edit:I lied!  Here's more~~~-Why are players forced to mostly trade when using great weapons?  Evading them is too easy.-Why does wearing heavy armor only allow you to take 1 to 2 hits more versus medium armor?  This also hurts great weapon users.-Why do most R2s not combo with anything?  This significantly reduces options.-Why are i-frames and stamina usage on rolls so good?  Because the game was balanced around lazy PvE design, wait and see play styles are too rewarding in PvP.-Why is 69.99 the optimal weight percentage? We used to have a sliding scale.-Why are fast rolls worse than medium rolls in most respects? Medium rolls get freaking hyper armor. -Why are small weapons so fast? They do not deal much less damage than great weapons."
Negative,First game I ever bought where all the bug fixing required was such a massive barrier to entry I just refunded it.Awful audio problems with ambient sounds.No borderless window mode without installing 3rd party software.Unexplained crashes within 30 mins of starting the game.No other game I bought and played has ever behaved like this.
Negative,"I want to enjoy this game, I really do, but the X-Box control icons for everything on a PC game is completely ridiculous.  I spend more time trying to figure out which F-ing button I need to use.  I enjoy a challenge and really wanted to play this but I will need to get an X-Box controller to do so which is just stupid.Thumbs down as this is a PC game, it should be able to tell if I am using a keyboard or a controller.Is it a good game?  Maybe.  Others say it is, but this controller stuff is backwards."
Negative,"Being a huge fan of the series, I found this game boring. After beating ng and moving on to NG+ there was no welcome to NG+ kind of vibe. I thought it was going to be more like dark souls one, where they difference between NG and NG+ was going to be far greater and it somewhat disappointed me. It felt like just the same game just a little harder enemies. It was fun for the first 48 hours but after that I simply will just wait for DLC content to further see if this game is truelly worth it. I don't believe it is."
Negative,Unplayable on pc without a controller.
Negative,game crashed one time it a bad game. also has a better online connection than nintendo
Negative,",...Stuttering Issue it's unplayable"
Negative,would be fun with friends but constantly bombarded by high level pvp try hards invading and exploits
Negative,"Doesn't handle high refresh rates or resolutions super well, input feels a bit clunky and non-responsive, play something like Sekiro instead."
Negative,if you like getting bent over in the first boss fight for the first hour you load the game up then play it. If you value your sanity play anything else but this game.
Negative,"THIS GAME IS TERRIBLE. I spent countless hours searching each water source, each lake, each ocean, in this game only to find out there is not a SINGLE fish much less FISHING! absolute trash and shouldn't even be looked at!edit: I AM FULLY AWARE THERE IS CRABS BUT YOU CANNOT FISH A CRAB IN SHALLOW SWAMP WATER!"
Negative,"653 hours spent in this game. 400+ in one character. All to have it taken away with zero explanation and zero response from anyone other than playing tag. This would have been game of the year of they weren't so shit with customer service. As such, don't bother getting this full price, if at any price."
Negative,"i bought dark souls 3 for me and my girlfriend so she could get a feel for the souls games before we get elden ring so i have someone to play with. i love dark souls especially 3 its just sad that its honestly looking like we will never be able to hop into the same world seeing as i bought it on steam on the 24th. im dissapointed and honestly feel cheated and scammed outta the experience and so is my girlfriend. i wouldnt have bought it if i knew that bamco was just going to take down servers completely and make it solo only and remove all coop tags for all the games except elden ring. it feels like a huge waste of money since before buying it twice on steam i bought it 3 other times for xbox, playstation and for a friend. i wish i could refund it to be completely honest. again its a damn amazing game just not as much without coop and pvp."
Negative,I HAVE DONE THE SAME BOSS 50+ times I HATE MY LIFE LOL
Negative,"Really wanted to like this game but it just feels like a random console game ported to PC, i dont like the character movements, just feels off."
Negative,get fast weapon and spam light attack: the game
Negative,The message cannot match the keyboard layout. It doesnot teach any useful information. Don't know how to play it at all.
Negative,0 Stars. No mommy Quelaag. Worthless game.Edit: I found her hair. among books of our places. 2 stars.
Negative,"It's visually the least appealing in the series and gets weaker the further in you go. I don't hate it but I did come away with a strong ""meh"" feeling."
Negative,over hyped and not hard absolute snooze fest
Negative,"PVP is absolute garbage. Bad hitboxes, Phantom range, one shit parry, shitty connections, etc. The fact that the devs have not fixed many of these issues in the past 4 years of this games exsistence shows how little they care about their series. Game is okay but avoid PVP because mostly people abuse the shit out of this games poor fucking netcode"
Negative,"The game has absolutely no support for key board and mouse players. Heres what happens when you first boot the game.""you must press A to continue or B to go back"" nothing on the key board works as a control. you can navvigate with the mouse a little bit but once you're in the game you cannot move without a controller. I know that it is recommended to play with a controller but this doesn't mean the keyboard and mouse shouldn't even have support."
Negative,"Recommend the game - it's been great for over 1,000 hours. However, I'm not buying Elden Ring until they fix multiplayer in DS3. No more money from me until I can play DS3 with my friend - I bought it for him for Christmas just for the jolly cooperation.These exploits have been around forever. They only care now because someone used exploits against streamers to raise awareness, and I assume these exploits affect Elden Ring as well. This game is Hollow without multiplayer."
Negative,Totaly ripping off of Elden Ring. This game even copies ER's animations and sounds. How is this even legal?
Negative,its a cool game i guess. I honestly regret the time wasted with this though.
Negative,"This game is......I don't know what is the best word to describe it.....it is so mixed feeling what I have after 20 hours I cannot find a proper word for this.I have to add that I never ever played with the DS series. I saw it one of my favourie youtube blogger playing with it and I checked it if it possible to play in coop since I only play games with friends. I never or very rare occasion when I start something in single. Anyway........I see big letters on the site, CO-OP. Ok, lets see.First of all that the huge suck that I had to live through with start of the game to even start playing with friends is one thing. I died I think 80 times. Ok, I'm a clumsy f*ck you can say that and I can accept that I'm not that good player after 37 (around 25 years of gaming) years. Lets say I'm not for this game type. Anyway, after this the real pain started when you have to trick the game of even see my friends sign to invite. Literally we spent 1-1.5 hour sometimes to even see our summoning signs. No user friendly system in any way. And most of the fans saying this is because this is game is hard. No....the hardness is note same with dumbness I think. No real guide in any way. Yes we figured it out ok. So be it. After this whole server lag issue that I found guide with information like 'please do not go to there to put a sign because it is possibility that a not open door could cause an issue with summoning'. Are you kidding? Really? Maybe I should sacrifice a chicken in the kitchen ritually to have lucky enough to summon my friend in a CO-OP game as on the official site saying?No....I don't even start the fact that after we finally started to enjoy the game and accept the fact that we need to kill three times the current area boss to move forward together (because WE WANTED TO PLAY cooperatively and this is why we bought it) after the tree boss a sequence arrived where all of us had to move forward and kill a smaller boss and move toward an area where you cannot invite anyone. Really? A co-op game.......really? Ohh when finally moved forward again summoning issues, 2 of my friends cannot join, only one of them, lets try other way, I can join to one of them but the 3rd one cannot. Another 1 hour pure suffering and brain damage. Ok, lets see if we use that damn thing which needed for 4 player (just a reminder we are 3) but who knows wtf is going on in this japanese madness. Yeah......suddenly all the summoning sign appeared and my friend managed to summon us. OMG so great! (no guide, no user friendly explanation wtf is going on since we are 3 not 4 so why we needed that damn Dried Finger but lets move forward......).Then again a fun part since now two player can invade our game where simply wanted to play a story mode co-op game. We manager to kill two invaders. In matter of fact usually we managed to kill all the invaders previously all the time. We can say it is fun. After we killed one invader a counter started probably and we managed to play this twisted co-op (in between us we are not allowed to say this word co-op about this game, it is forbidden.......) nicely. Ohh this also ended probably since we are experiencing that after we killed two invaders suddenly again two appeared we have no clue why or maybe when one of us died and re-invited the counter resets and again new invaders arriving. So basically now we couldn't managed to move forward with the story together (in a so callod CO-OP game) because invader pvp maniacs attacked us all the time and they just simply not letting us be and play a damn story together. Nice! So you win and kill everyone without death or you fcked basically. Just forcing me to play PVP (I don't remember if I mentioned earlier: IN A CO-OP GAME as the website saying) without any option. Yeah I know. I read it. Switch off online and pull out the internet cable. Yeah........and play singe which I won't cause I bought this because it is saying Co-OP....maybe I mentioned couple of times, sorry.And you know what? I love the game. I love the atmosphere. I love the view. But technical point of you it is a poor designed poor programmed joke. Or ok......remove the co-op section from the marketing section. And never ever mentioned until you understand what does that mean. p.s. ohh the fact that you have to set the settings all the time because if you don't the game just crash the fck out......lightning detail stuff to low but anyway nothing have been saved if you set up and quite properly. It just put things on random sometimes. When you start the game again.Thank you and sorry"

Negative,ds2 way better in every aspect other than the world. This game is such a disappointment
Negative,all i have to say is Poise.
Negative,You can't stop random overpowered people from joining your campaign and killing you unless you play offline. Other than that its okay.
Negative,everything about this game is 5x worse than the other souls games besides the boss design.
Negative,Rubbish 0 Stars
Negative,"game not hard, tons of screen tearing, horrible action queuing, and no jump. games not for me"
Negative,The dragon part run fuck the part where dragon burn and you run fast but die (i hate dragon part forgot castle name)
Negative,"Uhmmm... so it seems like uninstalling the game and installing it back again just makes you loose your save file. Is this something common? Games like Rogue Legacy, Bioshock and literally everything else I have on steam just keep their save files upon uninstall"
Negative,"Love souls games but this game is unplayable trying to use an xbox controller on PC, it disconnects in the middle of fights and at random times making the game frustrating and unfair. My controller works with every other game, I've just gotten to the final boss and now it wont connect again at all meaning I can't finish the game."
Negative,Abyss watcher is a bitch that should die in a housefire!
Negative,"controller doesnt work for this garbage game. worked for DS1, DS2, and Elden Ring but apparently not good enough for DS3. Fuck my dualshock 4 i guess. absolute trash."
Negative,audio killed itself 30 hours in
Negative,still unfun. wild
Negative,оно вам не надо...
Negative,fucking way worse than elden ring
Negative,SHIT game and couldnt play it was 2 hard

Negative,stupid ass game wont support a ps4 controller shit is dogwater actually love the souls series just hate steam gives me issues connecting my controller wouldnt recommend to anyone that likes playing on controller
Negative,Cant have anal with the curse-rotted greatwood
Negative,Too ez mun
Negative,"Its harder to get to the boss fight than to fight the boss. if you still wanna buy this just play this first before 1 and 2, this thing disappoints. and pls dont make ds4 i dont want boss fight health bars for mobs."
Negative,"Got into the Soulsborn pretty late, with Sekiro and Elden Ring. I love them both so much, I decided to give this one a try since it's so beloved. I forced myself for every single minute of those 10 hours, this game is utter trash. Inferior in every single way to Elden Ring....can NOT recommend, I regret every cent spent."
Negative,"Extremely buggy for a third part of any game. Enemies hitting through any wall, controls are clumsy, camera is awful( really awful, you gonna die very much just because of camera),  graphics are ok but optimization is terrible.  most of the items you will gather are just useless, that includes armor and weapons - yep, most of them are just useless.most of the lore you'll learn - is useless.Sometimes this game could be fun but most of the time it is just boring or/and punishing.it is not a game it is a job that you pay to do."
Negative,still on first boss ):edit: still stuck ):
Negative,No Sol Badguy.
Negative,После босса-судьи игра начала сильно зависать.
Negative,more bad than good for sure
Negative,Is having all the control tooltips in controller buttons not mouse/keyboard part of the inherent difficulty? Cause i had to spend more of the intro in the settings decoding controller to keyboard than playing the game.
Negative,"Average players left in this game: Fat people with potato PC who can't play Elden Ring, with boosted characters making invasions."
Negative,why can i get randomly invaded just because i killed a boss? which means i fall down a lift and accidentally uninstall the game.
Negative,Abyss Watchers ive come to bargain
Negative,do not purchase this shit it will make you want to kill yourself
Negative,This game made me hate console ports to PC.
Negative,got bored lol
Negative,game is good but way too much overpriced and they keep increasing the price its 7 year old game and still on full price not recommended
Negative,Great game. Way better than Elden Ring. Internet connection errors are annoying tho.

Negative,"I really really wanted to like DS3 I loved and put so many hours into DS1 and DS2 but something about this game just did not click for me. I really wish I could point out something in particular, but I just can't. Seeing as how I did not enjoy Elden Ring either I must conclude that this series simply isn't for me anymore sadly."
Negative,"Look it's not bad by any means but it's just a deeply unpleasant experience for me. Easily the lowlight of the trilogy in terms of how much I enjoy it, though it's so much more technically competent than either of the games which came before it that it isn't funny.Full acknowledgement of bias here, I played the first two before I played this one and beat the first two before I'd gotten even halfway into this one. Yes, this was the last game of the trilogy for me to get to, and I was already deeply in love with DS1 despite that games' many faults, so this had some things to live up to. But the problem for me is more of a difference in philosophy than anything else.See, Dark Souls 1 is an action game in the way that Fallout: New Vegas is a first-person shooter. That's a technically true description of it, but it's disingenuous to call it that. Dark Souls 1 aspires to be an RPG first and foremost in the same way that Demon's Souls does. Those two games share more in common philosophically with King's Field than they do with DS3 and Bloodborne, even if the core gameplay is fundamentally unchanged. What I mean by this is that they're games that very rarely put you in a room with a big strong man and don't put a twist on the fight, then call that a day. There's always SOMETHING, because it's a throwback to the days of (cryptic bullshit) discovery in retro gaming. It's an attempt to make the experiences of those games translate into a game of modern scope and budget. And the problem (or appeal) of both Demon's and Dark 1 is how much they have to compromise to achieve that vision.In Demon's Souls, you have a boss that's an unimaginably powerful dragon. But you can't just fight him head-on, he doesn't give you the opportunity. The fight is about solving the environmental puzzle of hitting two buttons in order to incapacitate him and bring him down to your level. It's not a good fight, but it's a great example of the way that Fromsoft had to design things back then. Your dragon bossfight is you dodging projectiles from an unhittable enemy until you reduce him to a stationary hitbox that can't fight back.In Dark Souls 1, you have a boss that's an unimaginably powerful dragon. But you can't just fight him head on because he constantly flies overhead and spams fire at you. The fight only becomes realistic once you find a giant archer who cripples one of the wings and forces the dragon to fight you down on the ground. I personally hate the fight still, but it's another example of compromise. It also just so happens to make for a more interesting interaction with the world than if you just fought this dragon straight up. Because you can make a fight with the spectacle of a powerful dragon arcing through the sky and lancing fire at you while you dodge him until he lands, but that doesn't mean it will play well.Anyway, in Dark Souls 3 you fight an unimaginably powerful dragon who has his full moveset and no gimmick and the result is a boss that spends a lot of time stalling while you play the rhythm game of dodging his spam. Because it turns out that just being able to fight a dragon one on one in a straightforward arena leads to a fundamental mismatch of capabilities and movesets and the result isn't very interesting.This is an action game built around spectacle. Any semblance of RPG mechanics are fully and truly dead. It's a fucking good action game, and the spectacle is basically always top-notch, but I personally do not play this series for that. If I wanted that, I would play Bayonetta or Nioh. There is  a fundamentally unique experience that Fromsoft has been able to offer with this series, and I just do not find myself gratified by it with this one.There's a hundred other little complaints I have, but there just isn't really a point in listing them. I have a million complaints about Dark Souls 1 as well, but I enjoy that experience still after 100% completing it and something like 250 hours. Meanwhile I find myself fatigued and bored by about a third of that time spent with this one. It was never about getting a polished, flawless experience from the franchise, it was always about getting something I couldn't get anywhere else. With this game, I can get what it's doing elsewhere. The embers remain, but the flame is gone for me. It's too much candy, not enough meat."
Negative,I CANNOT CONNECT WITH MY FRIEND CARL AKA IMMAPUTSOMEDIRTINYOUREYE AND HE CANT SEE MY DROPPED SOAP AND I CANT SEE HIS DROPPED SOAP. WHAT ARE WE EVEN DROPPING THIS SOAP FOR? ITS BEEN HOURS.
Negative,"overall, my experience wasn't that great, bummed when you die 2 times without soul collecting all your money is gone, but honestly its a decent game"
Negative,press space sim
Negative,Aldrich is an a$$ fight with the same 3 moves
Negative,WAIST OF TIME
Negative,"Like its predecessors, this game seems hellbent on delivering a demoralizing and gruelling experience devoid of any true enjoyment. Though the combat mechanics, weapon variety and motion controls fell tighter and more responsive than previous titles, the situations and enemies combine to create curated scenarios of pure frustration for the player. The player is prevented from feeling confident or emotionally invested in the game beyond a dull resignation toward their inevitable countless deaths due to unforseeable, often comically contrived circumstances. The retrying of areas and runback to bosses serve to pad playtime to a disproportionate degree. After beating this game, and it's DLC, let me be the one to tell you that there is very little actual fun to be had while playing this game."
Negative,Prepare for fun to die edition :(
Negative,this is bull shit!!! fun but bull shit!
Negative,uck my fdick[]\
Negative,"Update: I'm thumbing this down because not only Elden ring wasn't on spring sale 2023, this 7 year old game is being sold at full price. What a joke of a company.My first Dark souls game and mostly enjoyed it except for farming the *$#%ing Darkmoon Blade (good luck getting this after 2016). It's probably the only souls game that still holds well in 2023 with it's fluid mechanics."
Negative,This game did not help my depression.
Negative,This game is like poking yourself in the eye with a stick and pretending you enjoy it.
Negative,"I would not recommend it for players that suck, such as me."
Negative,"boss with always bad timing of swing, DON'T PLAY WITH BAD NERVS"
Negative,Dont Play This Bullshit
Negative,"good game, but all of the controls said to press buttons on an xbox controller, which made me get confused."
Negative,Fucking ganks everywhere mate!
Negative,"This was probably a damn good game in its day, but if you are considering buying this game after Elden Ring expecting a continuation of the high you will be disappointed. This game plays like an absolute dinosaur at this point. Probably still going to finish it though."
Negative,"I'm sure this is an amazing game, I've heard great things about it after all, and I do like a difficult challenging game.However I can't recommend getting this on steam, the port is terrible, it is in no way suited to keyboard and mouse control and I've presently been unable to find a properly functioning mod to do what the developers should have done in making tooltips actually be able to tell you the keyboard inputs instead. Even after working out some of the inputs, the keyboard controls are really nonsensical and it's very obvious the devs spent not a second concerning themselves with that. So if you don't already own and have setup on your PC a controller, then this is not the game for you."
Negative,"I've always loved the aesthetics in the Dark Souls, and I feel that Dark Souls III is probably the best out of the series. However, I've come to the the painful realization that I find the game more fun to watch than to actually play it myself. The combat's surprisingly bland for a long time and couldn't keep me interested. I didn't like the control scheme either which still feels awkward after spending hours with it. However, my biggest gripe with the game is the lack of a map for places I've visited, which has me running around trying to find my way due to my poor sense of direction. Also, the game seems to not register my achievements for some reason, though that could just be an intermittent Steam issue.Ultimately, Dark Souls is for individuals with an abundance of patience and time. If you have it, you should totally ignore this review."
Negative,"Oh you'd like to play coop? Ok, but you'll be forced to play our extremely laggy and unbalanced Pvp too :)"
Negative,Never felt more physically sick playing video game before this fucking garbage.
Negative,Just started the game to get smoked
Negative,this game reminds me of the holocaust

Negative,My 65 hours save that i was going to get achievements on is nowhere to be seen and i have to start again... no thanks.
Negative,Miyazaki doesn't understand the difference between dark souls and bloodborne.
Negative,"I gave this game a try to see if the Souls series were for me and, on net, they aren't. It gets its hooks in you well enough and some of its mechanics are clever, but I would say that the amount of time I spend having what actually counts as ""fun"" in this game was minimal--the Abyss Watchers bossfight about a third of the way through the game stood out for being the first time I actually felt that I was enjoying playing DS3, and the fight's very quality brought into relief how little I was enjoying the rest of the game. Too much else of the rest of the game in my opinion conflates tedium with difficulty (case in point: boss runs) and frankly the game just needs more streamlining (as well as more system explanation. I was 2/3rds done with the game before it was made apparent that there's a button for two handing weapons. This in a game that ostensibly has a tutorial!) Relatedly, there are too many items in this game the lion's share of which will never be used (weapons especially, but also the ratio of tedium to expense to benefit for most consumables) and too much overhead involved in leveling (why not allow leveling at bonfires)Having now played through my first Soulsborne, it's big, parts of it are beautiful, some of its systems are good or clever (and others are complete rubbish and nakedly player-hostile) but as an entire experience I don't think those objective characteristics actually translate into an experiences that I would characterize as fun. For me personally--and I realize many FromSoft devotees will disagree--the negatives bite too hard and the tedious parts are too front-and-centered and core to the overall experience to overlook the arguable positives."
Negative,I don't see the appeal. It's a few moments of satisfaction buried under being slaughtered repeatedly.
Negative,"shit game, shit"
Negative,"First impressions could have been better. For some reason all the control-prompts are for an Xbox controller but I'm playing with a mouse and keyboard. It took a lot of trips to the controls menu and online tutorials to figure out how to do everything since the tutorial and menus display Xbox buttons. I know Dark Souls has strange design choices, but this tops the list. The other thing I quickly noticed was the low frame-rate. It runs fairly normal with a smaller window at the lowest quality settings. But it slows down during intense fights. Maybe it’s a computer problem but I’d change your settings if you're having that issue.Things like laggy or unresponsive controls, over-sized character hit-box, lousy enemy hit-box detection and snapping into an enemy's grapple (despite being far from their grasp) are constants. All of which are bugs from as long ago as Dark Souls 1. Are they bugs or just features at this point? Sometimes the camera freezes in place or sways after killing an enemy for up to two seconds. An annoying new glitch when there's more than one enemy and you can’t control the camera.It feels like it takes the game half a second for it to understand I've pushed something in some cases. Sometimes, the game queues controls I've pressed to implement them when I'm trying to do something else. I'm trying to dodge but the game has attacks in the queue or vice-versa. Sometimes the lag is so bad after my poise breaks that rapidly pressing buttons isn't fast enough for the game to understand I’m pressed anything. Sometimes spamming is slow to react even when poise isn't an issue. I've always thought Dark Souls needs tight controls for the type of gameplay it has, but these games have NEVER had tight controls. You make split-second decisions/movements during combat, but the game sometimes responds at one second per request. I cannot stress enough how bad the combat controls are. It's the real reason Dark Souls is so difficult, not just the enemies you fight. Rolling is also as unreliable as ever. Sometimes the invincibility frames don't work, sometimes it keeps ramming into walls, sometimes it doesn't activate when you need it to. It's embarrassing how half-azzed it is.I'm really don't like how often lock-on turns itself off. Sometimes it doesn't lock-on when enemies are close, sometimes the lock-on range is much longer, sometimes it randomly turns itself off over and over. Which is very frustrating (sometimes every two seconds during a boss-fight). Once had to press lock-on four times at close range before it activated. Not only that, it doesn't acknowledge enemies if they aren't on screen, close to the current target and sometimes doesn't feel like switching targets. Sometimes my mouse creeps out of the game window during combat which causes problems. Sometimes it causes your character to go into auto-pilot and runs off a cliff. The game doesn't pause, so you're kinda screwed. It happens far more often than it should. Like every five minutes to thirty seconds if it really feels like playing up. Sometimes the mouse creeps out and starts opening/deleting things in your desktop while you're desperately trying to get the mouse back inside the game. Playing Fullscreen might fix that but the frame-rate would tank like crazy in my case. Dark Souls really is a unique experience. For the wrong reasons. I swear, these developers are ten years behind in game design. How did they let this slide?I get so frustrated with games that have bad cameras. Here it’s often ramming itself into objects, walls, enemies, the ground. Sometimes it erratically zig-zags, causing you to have no idea what the heck is even happening during fast boss-fights. Sometimes it rears so far forward that your character is about two meters (six feet) behind the camera and completely out of view. In a game this difficult, I don't need to add 'fight against the camera' to the list of things I’m doing. The plot (lack thereof) is not enough to carry a game like this if the gameplay barely holds up. Some games are so good you can look past glitches; this game comes up short in most areas. After playing this game, I finally understand why the camera generally feels awful so often. It hugs your character way too close; if anything is close to you, you won't know it's there. Enemies about to attack you, walls you're about to run into; it's like an old Crash Bandicoot game. It was irritating then, it's no different now.You know a game is poorly designed when it feels like you're fighting against the controls more than the enemies. But after killing a difficult enemy, you get the great sense of relief that I'm so familiar with in a Dark Souls game. Extra relieving when you were fighting the controls to actually work and they finally did for once. So relieving. And I'm very happy there’s an option for offline mode. I've heard hackers can invade your world and corrupt your save file (and steal your personal information). Not sure if that's true but I wouldn't risk it. If it's not the devs, it's the players screwing you over. You just can't have fun with this game, everyone’s against you.I'm so sick of enemies that attack without attacking. They're not moving but somehow, you're receiving damage from them. How are you supposed to avoid attacks that have no animation? Wtf? I now understand why some enemies feel ridiculous to fight. Some are very fast while your character is naturally very slow and clumsy. Your top movement speed of about a third of theirs. No wonder some fights feel very tilted in their favour. I don't know how you could fight bosses with anything like a greatsword or bigger. Medium weapons are sometimes way too slow for how fast those guys attack.I think I finally understand why the same glitches have existed in all three Dark Souls games and why the combat still feels so terrible. It's so simple, if you keep dying over and over for stupid reasons, the game feels longer. If you fight a boss fifty times, it feels more rewarding when you finally beat it. The game is intentionally designed to be terrible for artificial padding. That's genius but awful. The game would be plenty long and difficult without the bugs. All the glitches do is make the game feel terrible. But at least the Developers can say their game has a long completion time. Because apparently length is all that matters in a video game. Not fun, not substance, only length of completion. Go figure. I don't get frustrated like this in any game I know. Closest thing I can think of would be the old Hitman games (man, those things were also super buggy).After previously playing two Dark Souls games, this one feels like same sh*t, different day. It follows the same formula without many new ideas. It feels generic at this point. It's like playing a new Assassin's Creed or Battlefield game and thinking ""Hmm. Feels just like the last game they made...and the one before that"". Granted, it isn't identical but it still feels the same. Only thing worse is knowing Demon Souls, Bloodborne, even Elden Ring also follow the same formula without mixing things up. I'd hate to imagine playing six very long games that all feel the same.I'm so glad the final boss-fight wasn't as disappointing as Dark Souls 2. It was what you want from a final boss-fight in a hard game. A cool design and challenging gameplay. It wasn’t as difficult/epic as the first game, but still, it was a big improvement over the last. Until I found a way to cheese it which made it laughably easy. Still, very unique boss-fight that I really enjoyed (when I wasn't getting frustrated at the consistently glitchy combat. There are some things that will never change in a Souls game).Welcome to Dark Souls. Prepare to die...from glitches. And ""You just suck at the game"" is the cheapest excuse ever to turn a blind-eye to clearly poor game design. There's a huge difference between intentionally difficult gameplay and intentionally buggy gameplay. Just my opinion."
Negative,Where am I even going?
Negative,"I enjoy the aesthetics and the general exploration of the map to a certain extent. There are a few parts I've experienced where it is easy to get stuck because there is only one way forward and you might miss it. E.g. I had no idea what was meant with turning off the beacon's. Turns out you need to put out a few candles, which for some reason then also turns off the beacon (that isn't visible until the cut-scene. Oh.The last two boss fights I've experienced have been an absolute terrible experience. A tree that is so huge that it doesn't fit on the screen with janky hitboxes and a bossfight where the best strategy is to run away from the boss for the first minute or so because it'll get hurt in the process. Furthermore, the having to travel back to the Firelink Shrine in order to level up is a dumb mechanic that was better handled in Dark Souls 1 where you could level up at any Bonfire. I do appreciate the bonfires being plentiful and the option to fast travel and have had a pretty good time exploring. Just these last two boss fights are such rage-inducing piles of doo-doo I'm not sure I want to continue playing."
Negative,"Cleared the game, dlc and allIt was challenging, but it wasnt enjoyable.Enemies are faster in both attack animation and movement speed, this is artificial difficultyIt does not feel satisfying that there is a huge wind up time before your character starts to swing the weapon, like playing with 300ms latencyYou have to know boss attack animations to decide if you can attack, you have to die repeatedly at a boss to know what moves they might use. There is no attack cancelling, any player that has good reaction time now has the front seat to watch the disaster happen. Enemies attack animation is illogical, delaying attacks, semi-floating in the air before suddenly crashing down, how else would anyone know the timing unless they die once or twice to them.Lastly, a roll with an inbuilt iframe as the main dodging mechanic, either a sword hit my character without actually touching, or I can just roll into the sword to avoid any damage.Never have I see any games that require the players to git gud while dying countless times just to progress the game"
Negative,"What a piece of junk. It is 2022, this game was released in 2016 for the PC among other platforms. Five years later and they still have not fixed the PC version. You start the game and it immediately dumps you into a server connect. But surprise, they have not fixed the servers (after five years) because they are busy with Elden Ring... So you wait and wait and hit cancel when it finally appears because no, you can't connect to a server. That will finally get you the option to play an offline version.The hint of another problem appeared during the character creation screen. None of the hotkey tips that popped up worked for the PC. I figured out how to proceed (right-click for a drop down menu and you get the choices). I figured ok, there must be a setting to give me the PC version prompts. Nope. I got into the game, took a step, it said hit a particular key to read a glowing message on the ground. So  I stupidly hit that key and I drank a potion off my belt instead. So I did some investigation and found that they had never put in prompts for the PC version (ahem, five years). I looked up the keybinds and scribbled them down and they were completely different from most keybinds. That was enough. I did not feel like going through and rebinding every key (ie, A is ""ok"" on the controller and ""move/turn left"" on the keyboard). I tried to quit; hit escape and after scrolling through the list found exit. It insisted on saving upon exit, done. AND it dumped me right back into connecting to a server screen.So, I just stopped it from Steam and I am uninstalling it after this review. I know some of you will say - hey Bhue, why don't you just get a controller? Well I am physically unable to use one - it happens. Anyway do yourself a favor, don't waste your time playing this game to try to catch up to Elden Ring or to see what the gameplay is like. Luckily I got this as a Humble Bundle gimmee in a monthly sub so I paid less than $1 for it. I would hope that they did better with Elden Ring. But after reading some of the reviews, I shelved the idea of that game also. (If I can cheerfully play Star Citizen then you know how this game must rank.)Really, vote with your money. Don't buy a game that is not properly optimized for the platform you intend on using. I can see getting something from a company with a history of  optimization, but obviously this company cannot. Stop listening to any kind of hype and vote with your money."

Negative,i run at 5 god damn fps
Negative,It need to use vpn to connect to the game server. What a stupid game!
Negative,"The second worst Fromsoft game since Ninja Blade, it tries to succeed on the merits of cheap nostalgia and overly streamlined game-y systems, terrible/bland PvP and a horrible community that spelled the end of the Souls community and its golden years of 2012-2015."
Negative,"It's frequently closer to frustrating than rewarding. Play Furi or something similar to have fun.Can be very annoying to die to many lesser enemies on the way to the boss, while the actual challenge is easier than navigating cramped hallways with instakill jumpscares or walking a tightrope and falling to your death"
Negative,"Good:Customization: 9/10:You can select between several different characters when you start up.Graphic 8/10:It's good graphic and interesting looking bosses.Bad:User Interface 1/10:User interface is a horrible experience for PC players using mouse. It's the worst UI I have ever seen for a PC game.Gameplay 1/10:When you try to move around with mouse combined with keyboards the characters moves very weirdly so you often struggle moving the character in certain directions. The camera also automatically moves around very strange from time to time especially during combat. Sometimes the character also doesn't jump to avoid hits, even if you press the jump button. Developers have invested almost none effort to make a smoth experience for PC gamers. If you are a spell caster you have to lock the target otherwise you will miss 90% of the spells and locking a target causes you to feel extremely unathletic moving around. These issues makes the game almost unplayable. Compare movement with any greater FPS like game for PC and you know what I mean.Summary:It's an extremely bad PC port and the developers should be ashamed."
Negative,"ok so after seeing a bunch of videos and hearing people talk about how hard it is , i finally bought this. I gave it too much respect at first and died fast like a little sissy, but I took  it seriously and started appreciating its difficulty, i got the STUFFING beat out of me  until I learned how to fight and which class suited me best. ok i settled for the knight of course.  I started to like it , then love it... But ...The one flaw that makes this game unplayable is.,  the  aimbots the ai gets after you start leveling up... after you start leveling up and improving. the ai will gain an unfair advantage but what i don't like is cheap lazy programming .  after you get tp like level 15-ish the enemy gets like an aimbot. How? you ask? After I noticed the enemy was literally changing direction mid-swing and trajectory, . their hit box and yours interact different, you can no longer roll and time their attacks, they just home in and follow your movement no matter your timing,I thought OK, maybe Im trippin, and went back to grind a bit to gain souls. nope i proved this by going back to old save points and fought the weak enemy.  THey also NOW had this aimbot thing and they were tougher?! my equipment was not  damaged, nothing like that, i checked, it's just lazy game developers hoping young players dont know . ive played games since the og nintendo,i know a cheat program when i see one.  I uninstalled it btw Sekura does NOT do  this,  most people complain about it being hard, that's not the complete story. Just being hard is fine. It has to be fair , but I cannot accept an already challenging game that literally cheats. no thanks.  games ruined."
Negative,just wait for elden ring
Negative,"the controls frustrated me. if this game had proper mouse + keyboard support, as it should be expected of a pc port you would actually have enough buttons for all of your different attacks"
Negative,the gameplay on pc with a keyboard and mouse is unacceptable garbage. if youre going to make the port this bad you should have stayed on console.
Negative,"I hate this game. Matter of fact I loathe it. I have never hated a game so much in my entire life. I like Doom Eternal on Nightmare, I don't like this game."
Negative,its too hard.
Negative,"This isn't a game, it's torturelet's start with the basics, everyone knows that dark souls is supposed to be extremely difficult, hell that's what its KNOWN for, with almost every video game reviewer saying any game with any amount of difficulty is ""souls-like"".I will admit that i could not progress much in this game without outside help.I'll start with what this game has done well.The art style is great, the gothic style of a world that almost looks like it's rotting away perfectly suits the difficulty and gameplay style of it all.I don't consider high difficulty a positive,(got the game because i thought it wouldn't be so bad with a friend) but I know that lots of people who play games do so to get past that difficulty, in which case dark souls has lots of it for those masochistic playersThe levelling system is well made, so that if you NEED to get stronger, it's not too difficult, but you won't be gaining levels passively until you're strong enough to beat every enemy out there.;As for the parts this game could improve on,I initially got this game to play with a friend, only to realise that multiplayer isn't allowed without using a consumable item that is limited in stock, and deactivates when you die (which you WILL die A LOT), which also connects you to all the hackers, and people who've played this game for years and will kill you as soon as you see them.On the topic of the other players, the game seems to push the idea of multiplayer, with people leaving notes around the map with messages that could either be a helpful tip, or nothing at all, but the nature of the game itself very much dissuades any multiplayer because anyone who likes the game has played it for years, and will kill a new player on sight. It's impossible to enjoy this game unless you've been playing dark souls since it's release, or you're masochistic.The gameplay itself isn't broken, but is very close to being so. There's a feature that allows you to automatically target onto an enemy, and theoretically attack in the direction of that enemy, but for some weapons (specifically spears/halberds) the targeting is off so that you'll attack just to the side of them. It's especially bad when you add on online delay/lag.If you like difficulty this game should be good for you, but if you'd prefer to ENJOY the game, try something else.tldr: Too difficult, couldnt git gud :( 2/5"
Negative,"The worst entry in the series. Almost every enemy has a spam attack which stunlocks, their stamina is repulsively high. Go for Demon's souls, dark souls, even dark souls 2 for a proper experience of a souls game. I hate how the parries feel. Any time i try to play with my friend, we get invaded by a lvl >400  guy with OHK weapons. Its awful. It happened in the other games but they felt like you could do more against them."
Negative,"nie polecam, pierwszy boss za trudny"
Negative,Not very good.
Negative,Red Lobster disapproves
Negative,Hate this game. It's good do.
Negative,A Modern treasure filled with hackers that will brick your game
Negative,"servers are offilne for months now, can't continue our coop saves.."
Negative,Fix the bow glitch
Negative,"This games stuttering and frame rate issues make it borderline unplayable. I have a 2080, 32 GB of Ram and a 3600x and have tried numerous solutions online. Google ""Dark Souls 3 frame rate issues"" and you'll have enough content to fill a library. Extremely disappointing for such a hopeful game."
Negative,"the most bullshit game ive ever played!there i was, fighting my way to the boss . Suddenly some heck god player drops by and 1 shot me .FUCK U NIGGA.TRASH GAME"
Negative,this game actively reduces your brain cell count
Negative,No native ultra-wide support is a joke. Lazy devs.
Negative,stupid game keeps crashing
Negative,"Awful PC port. Dire controls, and a camera that starts swinging around of its own accord as soon as you enter combat, which you can't disable.Imagine you're holding down+left+run so you're running down toward bottom left of the screen, and you release ""down"". Should you now: A) just immediately pivot to start running left, B) stop dead in your tracks and execute a turn animation, facing to the right now, and get one-shotted by the dumbass boss character who can still stab you from 47 miles away?If you answered mostly ""B"" then this may be the game for you, but ""try and fail over and over until you learn the process required to beat things, also having to re-do the trash mobs along the way each time, *also* depleting your ammo consumables permanently each time"" isn't my idea of either ""skill"" or ""fun"". Complete waste of time just to brag about ""getting good""; no thanks.Ok t'ra thanks for coming to my TED Talk etc."
Negative,"This game plays like a really good fan release sequal, in that it seems like dark souls, but the level desighn is boring, and the posses have good lore but are desighned really poorly. Ashes of Adriel is a neat story, but one of the most half assed DLC's in soulsborne history. I love dark souls and have tried ona  few occasions to get through all the content for this game, and its been a joyless grind every time. The combat is undefinably clunky compared to the other two, enemies have 5-10 hit attack chains with basically no windup or cooldown inbetween, so you spend most of this game just waiting patiently for even basic enemies to finish attacking, because the damage scales ultra high and you cannot upgrade armor. Weapon upgrades are half of what they were in the alst game, and the game is also very very short, with most of its logevity coming from Insta kill traps and crappy level desighn with upwards of 5 enemies at a time in basically every encounter. Play it co-op or dont bother. Also, dont bother because this game has hackers left right and center, and the game will perma ban you for fighting them sometimes, or summoning them as allies on accident. More than any other souls game, this one punishes you for trying to play with your friends. expect to fight 3-4 dark phantoms each attempt at an area, and at least two of them to be hackers with infinite HP and spells that kill you from anywhere on the map.Weapons arts are a cool addition and the spells are interesting, but because of the needlessly high lethality, if you dont min max, then delete your character and start over because you dont get to play the back half. Miss one step on a level and your done with important quest lines, the interesting NPC you wanted to see the story for, they just disappear without any indication of what you did wrong. If you are playing casually, your vendors will vanish and die because of some plot with another character you didint talk to enough, or do some innane thing with, so now you dont get to buy spells or miracles or what have you.This cleans up the dark souls story in a way that barely lines up with the other games, and sort of expects you to not properly remember what happened and where, and leans a LOT on this ""Timelines are foggy"" get out of jail card to excuse the huge holes in logic. That said, there is a bunch of interesting lore in this game, and its at its best when its telling its own story, and not trying to wrap up DS1. There is a lot of neat stuff going on, but the gameplay is such a miserable grind your not really going to want to bother, get in with the lore community and watch some videos, and enjoy it without the game, you will be better for it."
Negative,Can't enjoy coop with friends.
Negative,"I was having fun for about 20 minutes, that's about when the game crashes. The fog wall also has a weird glitch that happens when I look at it. Sometimes it creates a mini lense flair for like 2 seconds, other times it looks like green lightning bolts, but during combat it loves to crash. At this rate it's unplayable."
Negative,this game copied nekopara
Negative,fuck this game
Negative,"The multiplayer is shit, i played with 3 other friends got invaded by 2 guys and we could not even damage them"
Negative,No ultra-wide support.
Negative,Game was fun until some hacker just ruined the whole game
Negative,"4 years later and I still can't get into this. It's just not fun. Loved the first two (yes even 2 despite it's flaws), loved bloodborne but the biting fast gameplay doesn't transfer well to the souls series. Fuck it, just like Dead Space 3, I'll pretend this series ended at 2."
Negative,"Playing ds3 as your first ds game will most likely leave you fustrated and unsatisfied. In short play ds1 skip 2 (trust me on this one) and then play 3.I'm only not recommending this game to people who haven not played dark souls 1. If you have, this game is for you. Don't start the series with this game because it is less of a stand alone game, but a love letter to ds1. A lot of the game is filled with references to the first. This doesn't mean there is less or more reused content but you will enjoy it so much more by playing the first game. This game is also a LOT more challenging and may even feel unfair a times. This is a rly good thing for you if youve played ds1 as it steps up the challenge (the first game is not that hard after the first playthrough). But playing 3 as your first will leave u frustraited (trust me my friend is rly good at games but got annoyed at the challange in this game).In conclution, skip ds2 its just bad. Some people try to defend it but the good things ds2 has are heavily out weighed by the bad. if you realy want to play it do it after the first or 3rd one."
Negative,"(Disclaimer: my review time comes from the Xbox version of Dark Souls III which has only just recently received a 60fps patch. The majority of my play time has been at 30fps. I have also not finished the game, my most recent playthrough made it as far as Lothric Castle).(At the time of this review there is a longstanding exploit for the multiplayer system that will allow other players to softlock your savegame and render it unplayable VERY EASILY. It is highly recommend that you either play offline or install one of the community made anti-cheat mods such as ""Blue Sentinel"". I won't link it here due to a risk of banning).I will lead my review with summation of my thoughts: if you came to Dark Souls 3 looking for more of Dark Souls 1 from a gameplay perspective, look elsewhere. I cannot recommend this game from a subjective perspective to anyone who enjoyed Dark Souls 1 and 2 for the gameplay.Dark Souls 3 is the most recent entry in the series and it shows. It is extremely graphically pretty, it's sound design (in particular the music) is fantastic, the world is gigantic and filled with new enemies and new weapons/spells to face them with, as well as some old favourites. It is the culmination of years of ideas that From have attempted to refine and perfect.So why is my review marked as ""not recommended""? The gameplay. In particular, the combat.Objectively, Dark Souls 3's combat is very well designed. It's tight, it's fast, it's hitboxes are fantastic and the new Weapon Arts features really allow for some interesting fighting styles. Subjectively I feel the combat is designed to ""punish"" the player more than any other game in the series. Dark Souls 2 punished the player due to a mixture of poor design choices and rushed development. Dark Souls 3's combat was designed from the ground up to punish you.You do not get poise, but your enemies do.You can get staggered by EVERYTHING. Staggering your enemies is a stamina and damage check, one you often fail.Your parry windows are incredibly tight, but for enemies it's more generous.Your stamina consumption on blocking is excessive, but for enemies their stamina is limitless.You are even punished for rolling after a hit with LESS i-frames. Your escape tool is less effective when you're escaping.You can't upgrade your armor. Damage towards the end game becomes absolutely ridiculous.Your enemies will not let up. You have limited windows to heal unless you panic roll as far away as possible and even then they will chase you down.Dark Souls 1's combat gave you a lot of freedom to play how you like. Dark Souls 2 (through both an intent of design AND poor design) expanded those options even further (dual-shielding anyone?). Dark Souls 3 expects you to be as light as possible, roll through everything and enjoy it. Your options for ""tank"" and ""heavy"" are basically no longer existent. In fact through a quirk of the replacement system for poise it is rumored that you are more effective when rolling in HEAVY armor than light.I have pushed to NG+7 and beyond in DS1.I am currently on my NG+2 cycle of DS2.I have tried again and again to even finish DS3 ONCE with no success.And that's where DS3 failed for me. It's not a fun experience. It's a punishing slog where each victory feels Hollow because what comes next is going to be even less fun.I'm quite certain i'm in the minority with this, and that's perfectly fine. If you have more time, patience and skill than I do I can absolutely recommend DS3 especially if you've played the other two and want to finish out the series with a bang. But from a personal perspective I can't stand DS3 and wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
Negative,"First experience:Get online with friends, we all made new charactersGets invaded by people with end game gear and get rektok resummon, gets invaded by hacker that goes into boss room with me and kills meyeah... bad game just because of the forced pvp aspect."
Negative,Honestly the worst game I've played in years and I've played MW5 for a while.
Negative,Don't play this game if you value your keyboard. Do play this game if you have unlimited patience and don't like to play games for fun
Negative,Should have cloud save.
Negative,too hard didnt play
Negative,"I don't want to play online, I want to play the GAME THE WAY I WANT TO play it which might not necessairiy be the way you want me to play it. I couldn't give two FUCKS how you want me to play your game. If i want to use cheats and Cheat Engine to enjoy your game, then I WILL, but to have you fucks ruin the game for me and prevent me from playing it but not allowing me to disable online features, is a real cunt move. SO EITHER FUCKING REFUND ME MY MONEY OR LET ME PLAY OFF LINE. YOU BASICALLY STOLE MY MONEY SINCE I WANTED TO PLAY THE GAME THE WAY I WANTED TO PLAY IT, THE GAME I PAID FOR."
Negative,"Havent played in a while, reinstalled the gameAll characters are gone. My entire progress is gone. Look online for answers, get told ""you need to backup save files on pc""So basically i lost all my progress in this really hard and challenging game and theres no way to get my save files back.This is uncacceptable, i shouldnt have to manually back up my save files while almost every other modern game have some sort of backut or cloud system. This wouldnt be an issue on consoles. Because consoles keep your save files in the could and on the drive, unless you EXPLECITELY delete them.Cant recommend this game if you lose your progress every time you uninstall it. Literal garbage"
Negative,"worst game I’ve ever played this game actually sucks so bad, like honestly what is this garbage game who would like this poop game. It is bad everything about it sucks this game should honeslty just be banned from videogame history. I will never in my life but another from software game. Gamer out."
Negative,"if you dont try and play multiplayer with a friend for the first 40 some odd levels the game is alot of fun after level 40 and having left the high wall of lothric you can play with friends in the end though the game get i dunno mean? it starts throwing increasingly cheap stuff at you in the name of ""Challenge"" like basic mooks that shrug off your attacks to get in a cheap shot or a literal wolf pack whose attacks take them out of counter attack range and call huge numbers of there own in the end they seem to just start spamming enemy's which is just no fun"
Negative,"for some unkown reason im oenalized, ive never used any hack or hacking device on this game and ive reset all my character to see if it would fiz the issue but it doesnt and the game tickets might have given em an answer the guy said that something on my computer was causing it the think im using hacks of some sort, i dont even know what so ive given up on playing this gam with my friend i dont recommend it for that reason, its dumb and i dont care. should they actually fiz this id change my review..."
Negative,Constantly microstutters and poorly optimised for PC
Negative,Beat the first first try and then everthing just seemed to ez wont play ever again unless i get 100 hele Piet
Negative,this game is abd
Negative,No cloud save.
Negative,"While I loved nearly every area and boss, looked forward to new armor, and generally just being an all around badass, I can not recommend this game to the average gamer because they are not simply built different like me. Be prepared to pull out your hair while you struggle on Vordt, and I will invade your sorry ass. This games great ur just bad."
Negative,"I have a couple hundred hours on Dark Souls 1 and I just can't get into this game in the same way. This game is very linear and there are several ""quality of life"" changes that make the game worse, like not being able to level up outside of firelink shrine.EDIT: As of January 2022 there are security exploits from playing online. Rather than fix the problem FromSoft just decided to kill the servers, turning my ""meh"" review into outright bad.EDIT2: FromSoft restored the servers at some point, but my review remains the same."
Negative,"Think this game only goes down well with a certain player base.I decided to complete the game before writing the review and give it a fair chance.I would have probably picked a neutral review if it was available. The general gameplay can be quite tricky to get the hang off and feels a little clunky the way your character moves but I think it this type of game if your used to playing something like this then you will be fineItems and gear choice are pretty good lots of options there with a mix of play stylesIt's a very vague game, no quests etc to track or any real NPC conversations, there is very little dialogue throughout the entire game. You simply move to an area clear it and kill the boss and move on to next area and do the same again till you kill the last boss in the game which was nothing special.I personally didn't find the boss fights that hard or interesting, the main game was more of a challenge and fun in comparison.They didn't waste any money on cut scenes to explain / further the story or in paying writers to come up with interesting NPC dialogue sadly so the story is pretty poorly executed.I bought this when heavily discounted - I would not recommend paying anywhere near the full price £40  or don't but it at all."
Negative,"Graphics are really good,  the down side... the game was designed for controller play, trying to get used to the keyboard controls is extremely time consuming. the camera angles and such don't seems to ""lock on"" and you find yourself quite literally facing the wrong way time and again getting your butt kicked,  though i suppose that will also take an extreme amount of time to get used to to make game play less confusing.  have tried all the different camera settings to no avail so im not quite sure if it is a bug or just a combination of settings.   So far ... not so much enjoying this."
Negative,"Bir oyunu zor yapmakla ilginç engeller koymakla iyi ve güzel yapamazsınız. diğer serilerini de istek listemden çıkardım beğenmedim açıkçası ayıca türkçe dil yaması da yoktu orjinalde. Bir boss öyle bir büyüyor ki kendi karakterimi göremiyorum ekranda enterasan bişey. Cheat engine ile item düşürüp gerekli ayarları yaparak oynarsanız biraz daha normale döner. Tavsiye etmiyorum witcher,skyrim oynayın daha iyi. Zoru başarmak deyimiyle hareket etmeye çalışmışlar ama sadece vakit kaybı ortaya çıkmış"
Negative,not that good tbh
Negative,No steam cloud save sync
Negative,"I absolutely love the dark souls franchise, its challenging alone and its fun as hell playing it with a friend for sure......but the pvp absolutely ruins this game, i get invaded by a dark spirit any time i try to play with a friend. That could even be tolerated if it wasnt for the fact that the matchmaking is clearly nonexistent, i get invaded by people who have twice my health, twice my stamina, and twice as many heals. Then while im fighting as if the enemy doesnt already have enough advantages, the servers are also trash so on my screen my backstab animation goes off and im just standing there like an idiot as he rolls away. Bad game, very frustrating, dont buy."
Negative,No se guarda la partida
Negative,too many bugs
Negative,do not buy this game if you are playing on PC and do not want to google controls... Game controls are not optimized for PC and built-in advices tell you about controller buttons...Refunded.
Negative,No enjoyment ahead.Many invisible walls ahead.No story imminent.
Negative,"NO ULTRAWIDE SUPPORT OF ANY KINDYou must mod the game which results in awful FPS, making the game nearly unplayable. The fact theres no aspect ratio option or ultrawide support or aspect ratio support is simply mind boggling, I shouldnt have to modifiy a game to play on whats now a common resolution. The overall support for the game is pathetic, especially from such a large studio. The game itself looks fun, but i wouldnt know, as i never got beyond the first boss due to constant struggles with enabling ultrawide monitor support WHICH SHOULD HAVE SHIPPED FROM DAY ONE."
Negative,"Close your eyes. Imagine you're a goombah. You're frolicking in the hills, enjoying your simple life without a care in the world.  Now imagine you're on fire. WELCOME TO DARK SOULS 3 BABYYYYYFRICK THIS FRICKING GAME HOLY HECK THIS GAME IS A COCK-SMOKING TURBO VIRGIN'S WET DREAM"
Negative,This game is garbage.
Negative,Why is Steam (PC platform btw) offering a game with no keyboard and mouse support? Good one you bunch of eejits.
Negative,Controls for PC just horrible. Even with gamepad
Negative,"it's way too difficult, i only recommend this for people who like challenges and are willing to put in the work and time into the game."
Negative,"I really like this game but fromsoft needs to seriously work on servers and anticheat, because the game is just not fun this way. ;_;"
Negative,they did a terrible job with mnk and capped at 60 fps
Negative,"this game fucking blows, I hate this game iwth a pasioon, I hope nobody playes ths gam. I really lov dying and sol."
Negative,"If you loved the experience of getting destroyed by twink characters in the first games, you'll be glad to know SL200 people can and will invade you the second you try and play with your friends in this in the first levels.  Absolute waste of time."
Negative,fuck you and your EULA
Negative,eh? it was ok
Negative,Can't believe this game doesn't save your data to the cloud just lost all mu data because I forgot to make a backup file like what.
Negative,"By far the worst soul game, and it deleted my save data after 30 hours which although very meta is just too much of a kick in the balls."
Negative,too hard withoout trial x)
Negative,Worst worst game ew
Negative,"Very hard game, frustrating"
Negative,"This game is a textbook definition of identity crisis. It want's to be a hybrid of Dark Souls and Bloodborne and it just doesn't work. It has the fast paced combat of BB with none of the the good features BB had like rallying. It never even embraced the positive mechanics from DS2 like Powerstance and the ability to use the binoculars to  aim spells. I came back to this game after awhile to only realize that it's a shitty hybrid of BB and the other souls games,"
Negative,"Crashes on star up and when it doesn't crashes when loading save data, Just buy it on console it works there.Fixed: had to reinstall the visual C redist form the steam apps shared redist folder"
Negative,"just can't play with keyboard and mouse, terrible"
Negative,more like dark souls pee
Negative,"Game not in my Taste i like chalange and all but i person who realy hate pvp and love play with friends i know people love chalange and all i love it also when you need fight good to do something even in co op i had problems with enemys but fast did lose mood to play this game afrer very few minutes get spawned op players invaders who are too high lvl.Now i dont play this game anymore i must say that invading idea in my oppinion is stupid espesly when game push you to do it, sorry but i cant listnent to people say ""deal with it"".so short for me is bad atlast multiplayer they should not add it if they dont know how make it good.Also i think that this game is moustly for jerks sorry but invading option is in my oppinion made for just jerks who love to destroy other players funso in my oppinion game is good but it would be better without online version and dumb invade idea"
Negative,It's ok not to bad
Negative,"it sucks, but i love it"
Negative,i absolutely hate this game
Negative,"Objectively the worst Dark Souls. As someone who played all of them in order, i was very disappointed by this one. After beating it, i don't want to replay it/come back (i tried), i don't even want to play the DLC's, even though i bought them with the game. Zero replay value. Bad PVP, boring PVE. Enemy design is visually pretty cool at least. But you really should play any other Dark Souls instead of this disappointment.4/8Big letdown."
Negative,"In terms of stability and performance, this game is a joke. I can't even play it for literally 10 seconds without it freezing my PC. Only thing I can do at that point is to hard reset the PC. I have tried every single solution I could find, including contacting Bandai Namco, but of course they said I should contact a local service technician to check my PC. Every other game is running without issues. This is just another crappy console port and money grab, with little to no effort spent on optimization and bug fixes."
Negative,"Es el mejor juego del mundo pero le subieron el precio a 3000 pesos (sin contar que el precio final es muchisimo mas alto) .No tiene sentido, mejor no lo compres(Siempre podes usar Pivigames)"
Negative,"So I tried Dark Souls, and now I tried Dark Souls 3, and same result. I am getting a refund. Personally I just flat out find the game to be hard to the point of zero enjoyment. The combat is awful. The targeting system feels so clunky. The delay from press of the button to swing of the sword is heavily delayed. I died about 20 times on the first boss, and when I did beat him I was just so frustrated I didn't even feel any thrill after beating him just the feeling of wanting to put down the controller, and not even try another boss. I went on to try the next level after Firelink Shrine. I didn't even get to the boss, the regular enemies were enough to make me return this game. They say Dark Souls isn't for everyone, and a more true statement has never been spoken."
Negative,"i fucking love this game. the atmosphere and soundtrack are amazing. the levels and bosses are great and challenging, and the variety of builds you can create add a lot of replay value. its just a shame how flawed some of the bullshit in this game is.  the coal upgrade system is the most autistic garbage. if im mentally disabled and want to make a luck / hollow build i have to play through more than half the game, get all the way through irithyll dungeon and get ganked by the stupid baby monsters if i want to even consider doing decent damage with my shitty straight sword. not even mentioning the online. i die a little more in the inside every time i get invaded and the motherfucker rolls and Z-Vanishes behind me before i can even think about dodging. people will happily buy and play this game running 300 ping and not even care. ive died more to someone lag-stabbing me in the ass than african children have died to malaria. so no, i dont recommend this game. it is great and addicting and i cant stop fucking playing it."
Negative,Namco is shit
Negative,"The core mechanics are good, but there are so many problems when you look closely at the game that it just pisses me off as the game demands more of you, it also becomes less clear with their mechanics and seems to have no desire to be clear with you. Here's my convoluted summary of my experience with about as much structure as the game seems to have:The mechanics fail to be consistent and fails to be transparent and clear with the player.Any terrain that isn't open and clear is to your disadvantage; I've gotten killed through solid walls by enemies who decided to stick their halberd through a solid brick wall (No, there was no window nor doorway in that wall, and the only aspects I can see of them is the weapon they want to shove through the wall) ; I've tried hiding behind pillars to not get shot and the enemy decides to stick their arm right through the pillar and shoot right through the pillar anyways. Apparently the enemies can noclip shit. Oh if your attacks so much as nick a pillar: stop right there, thank you very much, the enemies don't want your undead touch.I've gotten killed by attacks that visually miss me entirely, yet somehow still manage to hit me.I've encountered random invisible walls when I thought I could be smart and flank the enemy, which instead backfire as I go plunging to my death instead.There are some falls that are instant deaths, and some are not instant death, and the only way to know which is what is to die. The fall distance is not a measure of what is or is not death. It doesn't matter that you have ""negate all fall damage"" or not, nor does it matter that you can see the bottom, nor does it matter if the bottom is normally traversable. If the game wants you to die randomly it will just kill you. One fall I took I went down like 30m, no damage taken. Another 10m one was instant death, as in my ""negate fall damage"" buff doesn't matter, the game just puts you into a game over state.Right, then there's the indicators for the buffs, which fail to indicate how much longer they might last. I've had my ""negate fall damage"" buff disappear on me mid-fall and the game doesn't indicate how long my buffs will last. You can hit friendly NPCs, while enemies do not hit each other.I've had a boss generate poison that did not appear on screen so and can only feel the vibrations on my controller to tell that I'm being poisoned, yet since he is surrounded by it, I also can't attack him so I just have to wait an unknown amount of time before I can do anything.Oh and there's the issue of poison, which in my opinion is just a mechanic that disrespects the player's time. Need to go through the swamp? Well it's filled with poison which can take less than 5s to fill up but if you don't want to be damaged by it, you have to wait what seemed like a full minute for it to clear up so you can then traverse normally. So it encourages you to just sit and wait patiently forever; that's a shitty mechanic.And then there's some random area where you will just randomly start bleeding and won't stop bleeding until the game seems to arbitrarily decides to stop bleeding the shit out of you. If the bleeding isn't random, it's not at all clear what's causing it.Also enjoy illusionary walls with 0 indication that it is an illusionary wall alongside those invisible ones that loves to fuck with you.Apparently there are hidden mechanics in some gear which there is 0 indication in game that they would have it (or is not easily accessible, the help function fails to tell me much). The gear has random grades for scaling that are opaque in their meaning and even then have hidden details behind them either (apparently there are multiple grades of C scaling but are all C scale). I've heard that it was to create ""immersion"" or something, eh no anytime I'm looking at gear I'm not immersed in your story, I'm trying to immerse myself in the mechanics of the game, which is telling me to fuck off and look elsewhere.Gear takes forever to level such that I can't just upgrade anything willy nilly and then they can seemingly randomly change their item requirement so that my plan to 1shot random mobs was stopped because it suddenly changed into a different material I didn't have access to.Then comes the random PVP which keeps interrupting me randomly whenever I'm trying to play or sort my inventory.I've encountered random PVP players with infinite stamina who can infinitely roll and attack whenever.I've encountered warping PVP players who can miraculously ignore my attacks that go through their models and then hit me at absurd distances.Oh right backstabbing, I've been backstabbed in my face and have backstabbed enemies in their faces as well. It's not clear as to where their backs are, and it's sometimes randomly not behind them but on their side instead.Oh continuing on the mechanics that encourage wasting your time: enemy groups. See a group of enemies? Better lure them out one at a time to dispatch them unless you want RNG for them to chain attack you from full to death.Also don't forget that the game can LOCK YOU OUT OF AN ENDING without any warning if you randomly do something. Apparently I sent some NPC to their death but no hints were given that I've done so. Thanks game.Then there are the points of no return, like boss rooms. Some are somewhat clear, some are not at all clear as to which rooms are boss rooms that you can not exit from once you've entered.The game probably wants me to play it with others but I have to say no thanks, I want to play this at my own pace, but the game apparently doesn't want me to tell me how to so I guess I won't.Oh and some of the bosses are lots of dying as you try to guess what the devs wanted you to do against the boss but there doesn't seem to be any indication as to what it wants me to do.The game's narrative is completely forgetful, and the characters... are there? Unless they're not there. I met some NPC that seemed like it was bugged and didn't even spawn for me. Well I said I met them, but I just keep hearing a voice when I enter a certain area that keeps talking to me, but there's no one there.Hard games are fine, but they need to be fair. Games that fail to be consistent and clear with their rules are not fair. Games that fail to be fair are just dumb. If you disagree, and want a truly ""hard"" game then go play any game that scrambles your inputs every 5 seconds. Have fun.Overall: 4/10"
Negative,BRING SERVERS BACK
Negative,Camera is terrible
Negative,cant play online
Negative,все еще фигня
Negative,No Cloud Save
Negative,can't connect to the sever and also there's no fix about it.keep trying about 15 mins and i give upbad game
Negative,"Honestly the worst part of this game is the controls. The bosses make sense, but using items, attacking, and just generally seeing what the hell is going on is nearly impossible.The bosses autotarget you and circle strafe but the game is implicitly designed to make that impossible for you.  At slow camera speeds the bosses are basically behind you 99% of the time and your autotarget, inventory and camera management is so bad that the difficulty is not in the game, it is in the controls. I can't believe people actually enjoy fighting with the controls this much."
Negative,"this is game is just like like sekiro! its too damm hard. Software has patched it up to where you cant cheat but all the bosses cheat. you have to be good and patient with these type of games they are very challenging.Nevertheless, as much aggravating this game can get, its addicting."
Negative,"Don't bother trying it on pc/keyboard, finding out the control is an utter frustration. The 'tutorial' (lol) explains the moves/combos mentioning the xbox controller's buttons so each time you learn a new move you have to go to the settings menu and translate the buttons to the corresponding keys. Also good luck trying to jump on pc/keyboard.  Had to google for like 10 minutes to find out such a stupidly basic thing. Auto target, auto aim never worked for me, although they were turned on in the settings (guess you have to manually lock target but never tried it because uninstalled the game after killing the first boss with a sorcerer missing with the spells half the time from point blank range).Character customization is nice, the battle difficulty is okayish I guess if you know the above things."
Negative,"Good game but it has a poor optimization, it has a lot of fps drop when you run into new areas, loading previous areas or just fighting against new enemies. Also camera lock it's bad implemented for joystick players."
Negative,I just woke up...what happened?
Negative,Fuck this game....
Negative,"put ds1, ds2, bloodborne into a mixer, you get ds3"
Negative,"Nobody helps, but everyone wants help. PvP is cancerous and laggy, and unfortunately is probably the only thing keeping this game alive."
Negative,stupid n1gg3r1Ng G4M3
Negative,If you are a casual player then before you buy this game just freeze your credit card so the balance doesn't go through. You're welcome.
Negative,"If you're planning on buying this game after playing Elden Ring, don't bother. From turned off the servers and are never turning them back in order to force players to shill out $60 for a far worse game. I hope someone finds a way to send malware over Ring's servers or, at the very least, I hope From goes bankrupt because this is inexcusable."
Negative,"A gorgeous crown upon the work Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2 gave to construct a world full of intrigue and power plays.Not your power, of course, that's something you've got to forge yourself if you hope to get anywhere.Sure, you'll probably do a lot of crying or yelling, but it's the cost for a type of satisfaction that you can rarely obtain any other way...But also summons are good and there if you need them. There's no shame in some jolly cooperation."
Negative,and now we’ll hug together and let's go catch a ban
Negative,steam is ass it uninstalled from my desktop and i had to start over.
Negative,Best gave i have ever played
Negative,"not for casual player , not torturing yourself"
Negative,"Don't buy the BS that you are lazy and a bad person (TM) if you don't like being killed in one hit , repeateatly, by the first boss. It's designed to destroy your self-esteem so From Software will make money at your expense."
Negative,I played this game for 26 hours 100% loved it nothing really about was bad but my major problem wasn't the game but the developers! I got banned for no apparent reason I try to reach out to them but no way can I now due to the virus so I guess I'm fucked
Negative,"I absolutely love every FromSoft game. DS1 and Bloodborne are my favorite and I've beaten all of them without summoning, including this one with optional bosses (so I've ""gotten gud""), but this is easily FromSoft's worst game. Still better than most games but this game breaks the inherent ""tough but fair"" motto that makes SoulsBorne games the best. Enemies have infinite stamina, a ton of poise and this makes all but the fastest weapons unusable. Also every area is designed the same, filled with a gank squad that you need to kite, which is fine in general, but gets repetitive and uninteresting quickly. Combined with the lack of viable weapons this game actually feels like a chore to play. In summary, easily FromSoft's worst game. Recommend avoiding."
Negative,"The least of the souls series. Tries to ape its contemporary (Bloodborne) poorly. Lacking the magic of the original Dark Souls, the attempted innovation of the second or the excuse of originality the prequel (Demon's Souls) had. Pretty with generic 'epic' music in the right places. It is better on pc than console, but that's not a high bar. Play Dark Souls or its sequel before this sad whimper of an ending."
Negative,"Terrible PC port that is unplayable without a controller. All button hints are for controller, so even navigating the menus is virtually impossible, let alone playing the actual game. Most keys can't be rebound properly, and the ones that can keep resetting themselves anyway. If you happen to have the exact controller the developers want, the game may well be decent. But if you have the wrong controller or don't use one at all, the whole thing is simply unplayable."
Negative,Terrible PC Port.Controls and lack of keybinding accessibility is beyond stupid.Why the fuck can't i use the scrollwheel to change targets?Why the fuck would that Target lock also be tied to camera rotation?Honestly what a fucking joke.
Negative,i didn't lost it shine after a while.Magic system is worse than 2.
Negative,My character got hacked after 60 hours of play had to delete character and than the game. Still the game says i have bad content!!!!!
Negative,"Note: Played with mouse and keyboard. This issues may not be present with controllers.  The game feels like a more polished and refined version of Dark Souls 1 which is great.  However, for a significant amount of time, the camera was making the game functionally unplayable for me.  Even at minimum sensitivity, the camera was far too fast and there was a nearly constant jitter that made me feel motion sick (something that almost never happens). Additionally, the camera seems to absolutely shit the bed on any sort slanted surface;  You want to angle the camera downward or upward to see up or down the angle, but the game seems to fight this.  More than once I've had to fight enemies seeing pretty much nothing other than their shins or just the tops of their heads.  Any camera issues were more or less resolved with mods (thank God for DSFix), but this seems to be unwise, if not impossible, with DS3. From what I've gathered, literally any sort of modification to the game opens you to be banned.  Apparently even a mod that let you remove ""illegal"" items from your account that have been given to you by hackers can put a target on your chest for From's/Bandai's overzealous banning action.  Also, it's worth noting that all the enemies (at least the ones I've seen) move SIGNIFICANTLY faster than in Dark Souls 1. This wouldn't normally be a deal breaker for me, but when I'm fighting with the camera so often, I often get hit/killed by attacks that I couldn't adequately see the small windup of, and then their faster attack leaves me with not enough time to react.  Overall a rather frustrating experience, but if you play with controller you may enjoy the game significantly more.Edit: Finally found a mod which solves the camera issue for me. Unfortunately, the use of it technically opens me up to getting soft banned. So that's kinda shitty. But at least I can play now."
Negative,"If you are progamer and able to play EXTREEEEMELY hard games, yeah this is for you. But if you are an average  gamer this is absolute WASTE OF MONEY you even cannot pass the first boss"
Negative,An ok game but the lag is terrible
Negative,"Если есть много нервов, тогда играй.Если у тебя 4к часов в доте, тогда играй.Если ты любишь когда тебя бьют, тогда играй."
Negative,Too far to go to Boss. It's too boring.I never buy Fromsoftware game ever.
Negative,"If they were going to do a PC port, they could port it to PC properly. They're not some two bit indie company with two devs living on coffee money, so have it use PC controls properly instead of some weird reverse keymapping to a controller nonsense. I'm assured there's a good game underneath, but in order to not risk a refund on the amateur shit I've witnessed I can't waste time digging to find it."
Negative,"I have to say I was curious about this game because I read and heard a lot about it. Also I wanted to play something challenging.But I guess the PC port of this game is some sort of a practical joke... the game will tell you what  controls to use on your playstation controller... and if you use mouse and keyboard, it will still tell you what controls to use on your playstation controller. You have to look up the keyboard controls in the settings and then guess from the playstation control settings what key you SHOULD have pressed before the boss killed you.The sound output is interupted by strange (and loud) cracks, turning down the volume won't help (I'm using a brand new Corsair VOID Elite  headset...).If I had paid the full price for that game I would have called it a rip off."
Negative,"At the point a game is hard, it´s challenging and it´s a nice feeling to get progress. But at the point a game is just frustrating for purpose it´s not a good game. I played this game for a few hours now and I´m in Irithyl.I played it about 70% of the time with 2 friends and it was pretty funny at that time, but alone it´s just frustrating and simply a bad singleplayer game to me. But it´s very cool to play it with friends in coop or PvP i guess. I have to mention that my friends have played this game way longer than me and finished it so they are a little bit over leveled, also in PvP and I don´t know if the game is that easy when you and your friends both just started the game, but in my case it was funny in coop and bad in singleplayer. Hope I could help :)"
Negative,not worth :(
Negative,THis GAME IS SHIT DONT BUUY YUPOLULK NEVER LOSE YOUR VIRGINITY
Negative,"If you're someone who has never played a DarkSouls game and are thinking about trying one, do yourself a favor and buy the first game remastered edition instead. If you have played a DarkSouls game before, this one is the easiest combat-wise yet also the most confusing. Unlike the first one I was constantly telling myself ""Now where the hell do I go?"" There's random, extremely obscure items you need to get into certain areas in the dumbest places. In order to continue the game I need to buy this key from an old hag who never leaves Firelink shrine after giving her an item first. Really?I never had to look anything up to beat the first game, I could just play it and enjoy the challenge. Get ready to use Google to beat Darksouls 3, you need to. I don't like the mechanics changes from DS1, I don't like the map and characters as much, the bosses are almost boring, it's just as hard to play with friends as the first one, and there's nothing that makes me want to continue playing. I was hoping for a game that built upon the first one in a positive way and made the game more compelling and fun for all the hype, but it did not."
Negative,"My game crashes all the time and none of the 'fixes' have remedied this. The idea that in order to play the game I have to put the graphics down to low is ridiculous anyway, when my gpu can easily handle higher. Likewise, the suggestion of 1080p rather than my monitors 1440p (Mine actually defaulted to 4K and downsized and it was fine until crashes). If the game isn't stable at that resolution why give me the option? It's a kick in the nuts when it looks pretty and crashes so I have to try it on potato settings. When it's not crashing it runs very smoothly at max settings. Back when I had a GTX 1060 I ran the game no worries. now with my 1070 Ti not so. There is still a decent community, in fact I would say bigger than when I first played. If you're a new player, be warned that you will encounter many twinked players invading in the first area with much better gear than you. Just do it un-embered and progress, or out-level them. It is a fun game if you're able to play it stably, I'm mainly giving it a down vote because my salt levels are high atm, and the above is something that I think people should know before buying it so they can make an informed decision to purchase."
Negative,"Good game as a single player experience, but online is full of cheaters."
Negative,game is shit thats it
Negative,OOH I SWEAR IF MY SAVES GET DELETED AGAIN. ITS HAPPENED 3 TIMES MAN.
Negative,every time i try to play the game it will start show a white screen then tell me windows had a problem starting it and it has to close the software.
Negative,"This looks like a cool and fun game.  Unfortunately, I can't get past the poor job they did porting the controls to mouse and keyboard.  They still reference all the console controls in the game itself - which means that I have no idea how to do any of the moves that they teach you.  This is a barrier to entry for me, so I can't recommend the game."
Negative,Great game if you like doing the same fights over and over... Maybe its fun for a kid with tons of time. I wouldn't recommend this game for guys that work all week long and want some stress relief.
Negative,cant play with friends without hackers too.
Negative,Why does this not support cloud save?
Negative,got banned for having fun. also poise is 'working as intended' so STR builds mad >:))))
Negative,"no borderless, capped at 60 fps, no cloudsave"
Negative,"I am poorly disappointed with the quality of the game. The developers took minimal time to balance certain aspect and fix bugs that may affect the gaming experience, I have had many failed relationships because of a dog teleporting on top of my character numerous times hence losing my 5200 souls. This game needs better multiplayer so you don't have to suck the pavements c*ck just to play with your mates."
Negative,"Absolutely brutal game, and imho, a total waste of money unless you're just a glutton for abuse. All these reviewers say just get good but that's bull.  The game most certainly does NOT reward perseverance or resilience.  The game is sadistic.  But they are right about one thing though, this is probably the most difficult, tedious, painful game you will play (maybe ever).Don't waste your money if you don't like hours of trying and re-trying, and re-re-trying, and then trying again to get past hard bosses and other enemies.  You can't load an early save and expect to avoid a fight (or just avoid any mistakes) and you don't retain any consumables after loading a saved game (health/ember).  Anything you've done is still in play even if it was a mistake and you need a do-over.  I played (struggled/labored) on the PC version for 6 hours just to get to the fire keeper at the very beginning of the game (just after the first boss).  Then I was stuck in an endless loop of hawkwood repeatedly killing me and then reloading in the same spot just to have him running over to kill me again.The inventory menus are confusing, the controls suck (can't bind some keys like the capslock key), tips and tutorials are a joke and not informative (why do I have to see icons and help for playstation controls whenever I interact with something (even if this is a port), the camera keeps spinning around on its own during combat, and the 3rd person perspective is just a beating to get used to."
Negative,"Just like all teh souls games, watch out for the twinks! There really is no way to deal with that other than go it alone, so, just watch out.There are some really good players that can go through a great deal of the game with low level and gear that allows them to invade the starting players.They will kill you. There is no doubt.""git gud"" is the only thing the community will say."
Negative,what a load of crap all the prompts are for a controller it is sold as a pc game.this is one if not the worst game i have played the only saving grace is i bought during a sale so it was not too expensive all the reviews say it is a wonderful game it is not0 out of 100
Negative,"Horrible controls, not made for PC. Didn't even wanna give it a chance, after I found out."
Negative,No. Just no
Negative,if you play this and get past abyss watchers good luck stoping
Negative,Thank you kanye
Negative,Killing Gudar is good news.
Negative,"I bought the game back in May 2016, been in my library ever since. 3 years later i receive a notification saying my steam code was revoked, what took 3 years for them to screw me over? I haven't been told why, or heard back from steam support. This is modern day thievery."
Negative,"Playing on a pc with a Geforce 1080 GPU, i7-6700k CPU, 32GB of RAM, on LOW graphics settings, and it takes 5-10 minutes to load the game. Freezes randomly throughout the game even when there are no enemies. I can play every other game in Ultra settings with no issues. Freezing will last anywhere from 30 seconds to multiple minutes. Reinstalled multiple times, wiped and reinstalled my OS, changed all my Nvidia settings, windowed and full screen mode doesn't make a difference. This game is pure garbage on PC. Gameplay is great when it works, if only it would work every time I play it."
Negative,"Bloodborne and Sekiro show just how much the online portion of Dark Souls held it back. From one souls game to the next, they'd try to reinvent their matchmaking system and it was always controversial. Be it twinking, hacking, Soul Memory, or just the lag that plagues every single online encounter, it really drags the experience down. Sadly, DS3 also forces you to have to engage with it every time you kill a boss.I tried revisiting the souls games. But by the time I got to this one, I realized just how happy I was that From Soft had learned their lesson and moved on. If you want a better souls like than Dark Souls, just play one of From's other titles. I can tell you that even after hundreds of hours with them, the Dark Souls games are just a lesser experience."
Negative,"Just started this game and i believe this is a great game, but my problem is the false advertisement of being a coop game, me and a friend just bought this game purely to play together and we didnt want a singleplayer game. but coop is a pain in the ass! your only able to join a game if the host has a ember to spend, these embers are rare and  the beginning and you need alot of them! everytime you die you are going back to your own world and another ember needs to be spend, also after killing a boss you going back to your own world and it needs another ember to join. this is ruining the coop experience for us and we asked for a refund for this after find this all out in 6 hours playtime. so if you want to buy this game purely for coop think twice."
Negative,"game is very difficult on keyboard and mouse would recommend a controller, also the game does not tell you the controls for keyboard and mouse you have to figure it out on your own which can take a while, another thing that bothers me is that the hud controls are for the Xbox 360 controller none for PC. i refunded this game because of this and i don't have a controller but if you do then it is a great game would recommend."
Negative,No fun without friends. I can't bring myself to play it.
Negative,Please fix your buggy ass game
Negative,"I love Skyrim,love Witcher..but tihs one. DS is not game fore me..Gameplay,wel confusing..fight hard and boring.sory guys but i dont like the game."
Negative,"welp played for years and one cheater hits me with a weapon and I get banned. great game, yet prepare to be banned because some fuck cant get good"
Negative,Cant play game constant crashes tried all fixes
Negative,Game is fun and amazing. It was my intro to the souls series and because of that is why I don't recommend it. The game is fun but dear god the pvp is shit. Just shit. It's nothing but ganks and even when you take out a gank the host resummons. Yea everyone complains and some say kill the host while they have phantoms. But I can't recommend a game while one if it's biggest aspects and one of my favourites sucks.
Negative,I bought this on sale. I put 40.7 hours into it according to steam. It seemed a lot longer. I enjoy a challenge. I don’t want my hand held while playing a game. I can’t fault the game. I just didn’t enjoy it or get into this game. I played it more because I spent money on it than actually wanting to play the game. I still have not finished the game as it has become a chore to play. It has been relegated to the dusty corner of games that I wish I never bought. I miss the days that game developers would release demos so you could get a better idea if you would like the game or not. In my option it is not worth the money. So sorry I wasted money on this.
Negative,"This is a game that I love to play. Wish that every time that i wouldn't play the game and just let it set the i wouldn't lose All of my saved data. 190 hours into this game for three characters that were all over leave 120 easy. Payed for and beat all the dlc and enjoyed it. However I wouldnt tell anyone to get this game for the simple fact that you would have to restate from the beginning if you ever don't pay attention to it. I really dont get how this game does it, two mouths ago I got one and my data was there and it worked fine got on today and nothing. I done with this bs if I could I would get my money can for the game and all the dlc."
Negative,"I spent literal hours uninstalling, reinstalling and re-optimizing settings and drives trying to get this damn game to open. No matter what I did, as soon as I tried to open the game it would hard freeze and force me to restart my computer. Just get it on console"
Negative,Hands down the worst coop multiplayer feature I have seen.
Negative,"Not really my style, movement is funky with keyboard and mouse... The hype killed it"
Negative,If you wanted to play this game with your friend well dont you will never get a chance too without being constantly invaded over and over again
Negative,"Not what I expected at all, I'd read some good stuff but the gameply just doesn't sit right with me"
Negative,"This game makes me wanna punchy my balls. It's a love and hate relationship, on and off, but mostly fucking hate. I want to take this game out back and shoot it like bambi. That makes no sense, idfc. I am gonna go and play Bloddborne, goodbye"
Negative,"I used to be a really big dark souls fan and a year ago, I probably would've recommended this game, but if you really think about it, the entire dark souls series is just average. The main reason why I think dark souls has become so popular is that it's become imfamous (and also famous) for being extrememly difficult, but dark souls isn't even the best game in regards to being difficult as fuck, but somehow it's the best selling game in that subgenre. The fight clubs were fun though, I miss hosting those."
Negative,"if u get soft banned there not really any point in continuing dark souls 3, there are solutions but they are time comsuming and irritating if you intend on buying this game make sure its on sale. its a great game, being a dark souls fan myself  i love playing it, but the online banning system is trash even if you dont cheat or hack you may still get banned, even if you got unbanned theres a chance you could get banned again and if that happens its permanent."
Negative,I'd love to enjoy this game if the macro stutter stopped being a thing. For now this game was a collosal waste of money. Good thing I got it for cheap.
Negative,"I would love to love this game,, but i cant play it.. it makes me sick, like motion sickness... i have never experienced this on any other game, and no mattter what i try with the setting i can fix it."
Negative,"I went in hoping they fixed the main issues from the first one regarding keyboard controls and was sorely mistaken, there are no instructions involving the keyboard, xbox controls only. The camera is just awful, it's half the battle just trying to use it. You can't look around while mid-swing animation and the camera just goes off in random directions at times. The actions are all delayed from the time you actually want to do them be it swinging your weapon or trying to dodge. The enemies are ludicrously difficult, which would be fine if all other aspects of the game worked halfway decently. The level design is also terrible, making you walk to one end of the room just so the fog dissipates one the other. I know dark souls is supposed to be difficult, but broken is muchdifferent than just difficult."
Negative,"Unplayable!I'm sure the game is great on a console, but unfortunately it's just not usable on PC! It keeps saying to press A or B or L1 or whatever, but I don't have a gamepad - I'm using a keyboard. The only option is to print out the list of keybindings are use them as a reference, since they are not consistently mapped - i.e. in once place A is E, but in another A is Q. unfortunately the list of keybindings in the game only shows you the ones you can change, which isn't all of them. I tried randomly pressing keys, but it kept opening stuff I didn't know what it was, and eventually I had to alt+f4 as I couldn't even find a quit button!I am very disappointed. If a game is going to map half the keys on the keyboard to specific things, they very least they could do is provide a tutorial to start with."
Negative,The EULA was so long I ran out of time to play.
Negative,i get motion sickness of this gamecamera control is utterly bad
Negative,"The game looks fun but the constant stuttering and framerate hitches make it unplayable. I've tried a lot of things and the issue persists.edit, after completing it:It also crashes a good bit. Fun.It's okay, it's sort of fun, and looks and feels good. But I'm not sure why they felt every encounter needed twice the number of enemies, and every boss fight needed twice the number of phases, than would have been actually fun."
Negative,"I've heard good things about the game and the series but I'm just truly amazed at how terrible of a port it is on PC.  It doesn't even change any of the XBox controller icons over to the keyboard/mouse and the camera view mixed with keyboard controls is downright terrible.  I don't mind being frustrated with game mechanics, but the controls take away any possible fun I could have.  Even just backing away from an enemy without showing your back to them can be a chore sometimes.  If you thought Bethesda PC ports were terrible, you haven't seen anything yet."
Negative,"if you like dark souls.. play offline... every player on this (invaders) just runs away like little bitches, not to mention the community is so fucking toxic... so yeah play this offline, players on this are shite, and just look on youtube to find builds! or the mass amounts of hackers that have recently infected the game,from software do not care if you hack so you might aswel..."
Negative,"I won't recommend dark souls 3 to a new player because it has nothing new to offer that the other games did not.It's a new story(ds1 was better in my opinion) and some new areas...Dodging systemThe dodge system sucks! it's so confusing sometimes the enemies hit you while dodging and you character screams but doesn't take any damage sometimes your character screams and dies like it should have been in the first place! :)If you said the dodge system was broken on ds 2 well... this is worse.(i mainly play on dodge rather than parry and using shields so i don't know about that system if its better or worse)Attack systemThere is a ""new"" system with some weapons are acting as dual wielding and some others have a different unique style when you use them on both hands and that goes for all the weapons.Also the weapons now have a  special skill that most times cost energy for some retarded reason it's called Focus points.*it's not new system because it's from BloodborneThe armor stays the same......and now u cant upgrade themThe upgrades on weapons are so easy nowmaking a raw infused weapon could be done so easy it will take about 20 min to do so and 1-2 plus for your first weapon of choice!and since you can't upgrade armor your only focus is your weaponswhich is kinda lame because making your weapon any good especially on ds 1 was waaaaaaaaaaay harder than this...I don't want to spoil the story but you kinda have to die about 10 times to progress one quest linethe game doesn't explain anything as always but you kinda have to it before you progress a lot on the gameand to do so it's harder than farming souls... because now to suicide or to watch the great view from the firelink like in the older ds you have to wait 15-30 secs on a freaking ssd for the game to load that area and even if you were outside and you stayed inside in the bonfire for about 10 secs you will have to deal with the fog walls AGAIN!The fps is ONCE AGAIN locked to 60 and when i start the game or minimize it the it also changes to 60hz and that is causing a lot of screen tearing and you have to modify nvidia settings to fix that bug....The most annoying thing is the enemies screaming.....Some enemies scream so loud and it's so freaking unnecessary.They sound about 10 times more than your weapon hitting the wall!It isnt even scary it's just annoying!I really don't want to support fromsoftware since they released Scholar of the First Sin for half of the ds2 price and didn't include it on season pass it was a big slap to the face for anyone who bought season pass offering about 2-3 items some ""extendent"" story with a better ending and dx11. They made the EA look good...I really want a new dark souls game that doesn't include the same stuff from any other dark souls game i am tired of watching the same ds armor with some reskin and minor improvements from another ds game or from freaking bloodborneok with that saiddark souls 3 is like any other dark souls with a different story the same items and again different dual holding weaponsthat about itthe areas is like dark souls 1 and bloodbornethe traps aren't surprising at alloverall its disappointing for me because a grow tired of the same stuff again and again i want to see something worth paying for if you are just looking for a new experience you won't get much from here! try Nioh(its a bad PC port tho)"
Negative,"whats up with every kill/hit, a japenese font with weapons appears on my whole screen...Tried EVERYTHING! not happy, hope its fixed."
Negative,"Can not recommend on account of the god awful Trash Heap of Ariandel, it ruined the rest of the game for me, i got to journey 4 and just couldn't bring myself to deal with that trash any longer."
Negative,Budget Elden Ring
Negative,woest thing ive ever played.guess its just not for me.
Negative,"Bad port.. Controller prompts only even if you want to play on KB+M. Stuck on 60fps. Wasn't a fan of the second one and although this seems a little better with the controls, it's still hot garbage, especially if you like using keyboard and mouse, or if you want more than 60fps (144hz screen). I don't get the love for this game.."
Negative,"I've sunk a lot of time into this game, so it should be clear that I do like the game itself quite a bit.This port can eat shit, though.Let me clue you in on how the framerate goes with this game. On PS4 (where I first owned it), the game runs at 30 FPS... sort of. It dips and flips here and there, but it's never something that interferes with general gameplay. And lag seems to be hard to come by. On PC? It can run at 60 if you have a good setup, of course, but it will never stay that way in combat. Every time an attack is laid out, it's like the game has to struggle to understand how to output it. And online? Forget it. Even some 1v1s in Undead Match can have lag, where you and the other guy are the only enemies rendered. Elsewhere, the lag is a nightmare. I know it's harder to set things to a standard since it's easier to set something up for PS4s, which all have the same routers built in, than for many different makes of PCs. But certainly it could be better than this?Overall, though, great game. Don't like it as much as Bloodborne, Demon's Souls, or Scholar, but it's still solid, a good 7.0."
Negative,"Such a bad game and good game in one...I hate the map design, you easily miss everything and miss so many Items, in Dark Souls 2 it wasnt like that but therefore the fight system Swords etc. with their abilities in Dark Souls 3 look and feel amazing.However, this game sucks tso bad, people with high end armor and swords invading me in the first ""area"", letting me die +4x (Or even more dont remember...)Kinda sucks, also the map design and the spawnareas of the enemies are really fuked up.... they spawn so bad I do not feel comfy playing this...So in the end I rate this a 4/10 Stars...Also, Dark Souls 2 and Dark Souls 3 are defnitly not the same games nor the title are same....Dark souls 2 play and is completly different from Dark souls 3...."
Negative,"It's a fun game, but incredibly overrated. Numerous sections of the game are redundant, senseless in design, RNG heavy, or just plain bad. Many, many sections. There are several bosses within the game relying solely on a gimmick or RNG, with instances like Ancient Wyvern and Princes being prime examples of just bullet hell luck, or being screwed by the wyvern uncontrollably moving its head inches away for the dogshit gimmick you use to kill it. I cannot genuinely recommend this game to casual, or even most hardcore players. After the beating the game several times, I will continue to play it since I have learnt incredibly stupid methods to counteract the parts of the game which are just plain bad design. If you are new to Dark Souls, don't play this."
Negative,"Perhapse this game would be good on a console by console standards, on a PC this game is just a very poorly made console port.I got this game on a sale which makes it less of a problem that i bought an awfull game, however this game is not even close to worth the money they are asking for it."
Negative,"For some reason my review disappeared so here's another one, albeit abbreviated from last time.In one sentence, it's a promising game and it looks stunning, but it's ruined by flawed controls (which also coax you into using a controller) and no difficulty settings. You can only try to conform to the one difficulty that's present, so if you don't usually play these kind of games, like me, you're not in for a very good time. You're not getting to explore the world because you'll be stuck in fights all the time.It's not like it's enjoyably difficult, either. You're just left to grind each type of boss and enemy 'till you get it right. It's frustrating and unrewarding, and very little else.I don't really understand why there isn't a difficulty setting. It's effectively cutting off a huge portion of your potential playerbase, but for what, notoriety? It makes no sense and is just a needless loss.Visually amazing but not enjoyable due to the high difficulty being the only playable one."
Negative,"I picked this game up with the steam controller bundle, mainly for the controller so I am not inclined to try to love this game but it had good reviews, was on sale, and the controller was cheap.So when I first ordered it, of course, did not yet have the controller, so tried playing with mouse and keyboard. And well, the movement during combat was kinda clunky. Clearly all the menus and tutorial tips were designed for controller so I waited until I got the controller to try playing again and still, really clunky.Its similar to Elder Scrolls combat which I like and prefer to the targeting combat systems of many rpgs, but this game controls just aren't as intuitive as Elder Scrolls.Perhaps with more time invested I could adjust to it but with steam's 2 hrs play time and no refund, I wasn't willing to risk it always being an obstacle to having fun. Additionally, the enemies are not easy right off the bat so looking at a lot of dying just to get used to the controls."
Negative,Very fun game for singleplayer and co op with friends. If your just playing for that your probably going to be fine. But there is a huge cheating problem with the dark souls multiplayer so dont be suprised if you get banned for doing nothing. The publisher repeatedly blames the players for getting banned. Even when its not their fault that someone invaded them while the invaders were cheating causing the host to get banned. This didn't happen to me but there are plenty of stories and videos out there that show that it does happen. Again if your in it for just co oping with your friends your likely going to be fine and will probably find that the game is rather fun and enjoyable.
Negative,"tldr:this is actually not a bad game, but if i can rate in number, this is 8/10but why i downvotes? it because the bad pc portingthe console version, i would rate it 8/10but pc version? its 6/10this game is beautifully designed, and gameplay is challenging. one thing bothers me is some gears or spells are only reasonably farmed on pvp content.but the bad thing is the pc porting, not the actual game design itself. i got frame drops, bad framerate, delayed input, on a lot of areas. not a pleasant thing considered this is very timing tight action base game.also, keyboard input layout on this game is odd, some weapon cannot do weapon arts because of that. better you use that USB game controller"
Negative,Fuck this peice of shit fan fic.
Negative,Dark souls 2 is better :^)
Negative,"This game is super fun and really innovative in a lot ways i dont think i can properly put words to. However, this game seems to put up a lot of issues for a lot of people, me being one. just massive frame rate issues. NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART OR LACK OF POWER."
Negative,"Broken game, drops to single digits on the graphical settings tab until it kicks you out of the game outright for the low framerate that it, itself, caused because it's a broken game. There's no trouble outside of that tab, but you shouldn't have to sit there and pray that you can make your changes before the game decides you're not allowed to play it. Besides, this game blows anyway. Go play Demon's Souls, it's where this game took all of its ""new"" ideas anyway."
Negative,"Difficulty 9/10PVE rating 8/10PVP rating 3/10Server stability/lag 2/10       (unfit for pvp)I can not emphasize this enough:DO NOT purchase this if you are interested in pvp content.  It is highly duel meta focused and group pvp or invasions are highly skewed to the advantage of the person being invaded.If like me you purchased this for the pvp content that many have talked about regarding Dark Souls 2 you will be severly dissapointed and I promise that once you have farmed up all the upgrade materials for innumerable builds you will find that you have wasted not only your time but also your money.I am not a prior Souls player, and so the nostalgia of the previous games and the depth of lore in the game are missed on me a bit.  I don't want to leave a long winded review, however, I would recommend that if like me you are interested in solid pvp content then DO NOT purchase this game.The pve content is challenging as is the consensus for Dark Souls games, however, after trying multiple builds and playing through about half of NG+ I became bored quite quickly.  There are quite a few side quests and I believe I've completed at least 90% of what the game has to offer.I will likely not being playing any more due to the horrid pvp.  It's extremly easy to win by playing the meta, however, you must resort to dueling to have any fun or play with friends and wait to troll invaders."
Negative,"UPDATE: the amount of hackers  has made this experience absolutely unbearable, with the amount of time it takes to make new builds you would be lucky not to run across one if using online. These guys have entire discord servers dedicated to fucking up your game as permanently possible, and the devs do little to nothing to fix the issue. If the nerfs and patches didn't fuck up the invading aspect enough, the cheaters will. Join a world with a sick weapon that used to be able to pick off gankers? Not any more, now you will get pounded into dust within seconds and staggered by straight swords and spears. Even better, if you manage to overcome the hosts friends in a 3v1 and get it down to just you and him he can run away and summon them again and again. Manage to overcome the onslaught of the hosts phantoms he spawns in? Guess what, prepare for him to completely crush every effort you put into the fight and toggle his cheats so he can insta kill you so his massive ego doesn't get harmed. This happens nearly every game and it needs to be fixed. This is not to mention the hackers that can enter your world and kill your bosses and important npc's basically forcing you to replay the entire game again, or the ones that corrupt data or break all of your gear forcing you to repair. Look at the nearly 600 hours i've put in after my older review and understand I love this game, especially it's single player offline aspect. But this game has chosen to favor the assholes and hand hold the host more than I ever thought it would end up doing so. The duels are nice but invading was my favorite.With nearly 300 hours sunk into playing this game and learning it in and out I'm confident I can recommend it and say it's a must buy. First of all the thing keeping a lot of people away from the souls series is intimidation. While the gameplay is different and challenging I would not let this keep you from giving it a try. The game is entirely fair but does require skill to succeed but in turn it rewards you heavily.To summarize dark souls 3 I would say that it is a challenging game set in a mysterious medievil universe filled with monsters, magic, epic characters, and amazing levels. Combat requires quick thinking and learning from your mistakes. You can block, roll, dodge, attack, counterattack with the many different weapons available in the game. You can pick different classes at the beginning but you can also level any stat so as the game goes on you can turn your character into anything. Mixing and matching weapons, spells, shield, and even items for your character adds an insane amount of replayability especially due to the multiplayer. The game is like a mix of zelda, metroid, elder scrolls etc. The level design feels like one long journey and is the best and most masterfully crafted of any game. Shorcuts are cleverly placed into the world and make the game feel even more connected, and some of the scenery is downright breath taking (in a destroyed and medievil looking way). This is a game that never holds your hand, and explains the story and mechanics through the gameplay itself.PVP works by in game items that allow you to team up and join other people's world via a white stone (white phantom). Or choose to face the odds and invade another person's world with a red stone (red phantom). This is all done in the hosts campaign and enemies will still very much attack you. This makes for some insanely chaotic and fun battles seeing as how red phantoms can turn on team mates as well. While this opens up the possibility of being double or even triple teamed it's still fun and you can turn the odds in your favor with the right amount of skill.This is a must buy. If you are hesitant don't wait. Get some hours in before the last dlc rolls out and experience this series. Learn about it and become addicted like I and many other fans have."
Negative,"1, 2, 3 and you are out. Dark souls has been a terrible line of pc ports and while this may be the best yet it should in no way be praised. Once again, key binding is limited and some it offers don't straight up work. I have heard this game being described as hitbox P*rn, after an hour in and realising both i and a skeleton could hit each other through a thick stone wall which shortly followed by a dragon who breathed two types of fire, the one you could see and the one you couldn't, gotta say dropping dead because nothing hit you, no effect around your character, is one way to ruin one's experience of what is meant to be a challenging game based on skill. I done a quick look incase it was my pc and realised, no, it's just the game.So rant aside, if you could like and play the other dark souls then this one might be the best yet.Graphics are poor for a AAA game of the time, art style is good though.Combat is same as it's always been, bugs, pixel errors and the most common, impatience is what will kill you, the actual fighting is literally just be patient and be ready to roll. (Should note i have completed DS 1 on console and played probably just short of half of DS 2, so i may not have the fully developed opinion on the matter but it hopefully it is enough.)You NEED a controller to play which is irritating but nothing new and sad for a game this popular.I do wish FromSoftware bad luck in the future, 3 bad pc ports for a game that is meant to be all about challenge, unless this is their cruel joke for making it harder for keyboard and mouse players then it's just stupid. A tag should be put on the game to warn it is controller only as what it offers is not enough to make it playable with keyboard and mouse and the lack of visual support for it would be enough to chastise an indie game but for a AAA it is just depressing..I have seen indie games do better ports and it's bug's + pixel errors ruin it, dying because you didn't know what was about to happen or because you miss stepped is fine, dying, being put back 5 mins because the game was terribly developed yet wants to charge £40?! That's just about enough for me to justify refunding it for."
Negative,"Shit Souls 3: Prepare to Read EditionThis game is great but the more I replay it the more I realize its insufferable, glaring, un-fucking bearable flaws. Dark Souls 3 could be great but it chooses not to be. It's no more than a shitty monster mash of bloodborne-themed enemies with ""dark souls"" gameplay. The result? An unbearable pissing mess. Rolling should not be fucking spammable. I fucking hate how shitty and weightless my rolls feel compared to the first game. I fucking hate how there's no incentive to go for a fast rather than a mid roll. It's fucking stupid and unnessecary that every stupid fucking enemy has to shriek like a banshee before engaging in combat and HAS to have a stupid fucking endless combo attack. It's no fucking fun how obsolete some of the weapons and classes are. People who say this game is easier than the first game gave up the first game the first couple hours they played, or because they never stopped using straight sword light attacks. Even the world-record speedrun is indicative of this. Most enemies and bosses give you such a tiny fucking window of attack that the game either keeps you waiting or forces you to take hits if you don't want to wait like an asshole. People don't realize that the first game is superior in almost every aspect because of bum software's delivery of the product, with their pristine Prepare to Crash Edition and the exquisite De-Mastered. I don't want to have to do the fucking Macarena with the dragon every time I go to grab the claymore. I don't know why the bony blue carpet skeleton has to have two thousand fucking hitpoints. Even if the game has good graphics it's invalidated by the fact that every fucking environment, weapon and armor piece has the same grey raggedy shitty ass cum-washed colour palette. Dark Souls 3 is an unpolished shitfest that could be great but refuses because its goal was to appeal to the mainstream as a trendy ninja fortnite dance rage BDSM in my asshole game. If anyone has the retarded urge to tell me to ""get good"" despite me having beat this game and the first multiple times then just know that you are the target braindead dipshit audience for this game. Fuck you."
Negative,"当我被禁封没有中文提示，这是种族歧视When I was banned and there was no hint in Chinese, it was racial discrimination."
Negative,"2/10Pros:- YOU CANNOT FINISHED THIS GAME IN 10 HOURSCons:- MATCHMAKING IN PvP LIKE SHIT, MOST OF THE TIME LAG HALF OF A SECOND OR EVEN WORSE 6 SECOND"
Negative,"Everything about this game is wonderful besides one thing. Early game pvp. You will almost always invade people who are higher level than you with another higher level frendo, or three. New players can invade people who are in new game plus and even with the scaling system that is in place will still get destroyed. Once your higher level late game this problem solves its self since you now have better levels and equipment but early game you will constanlty be fighting people who have way better set up then you. Its maybe about a one in six chance that the person you are fighting before You reach the aldrith covenet is the same level as you are. Everything else in the game is wonderful, the graphics are stunning and the system runs so smoothly, it is a really good party game. But the pvp is broken"
Negative,"This game is straight up cancer.Twin blades- cancerkatanas- cancerfanbase cancerpoise-fukn goneinvasions-unbalancedpyromancies- just kysweapon arts- mostly useless and very few unique onesblue sentinels and darkmoon- why two of the same covenant?running attacks- yo dawg I heard you like i-frames with no risk and massive rewardonly hope- that dlc actually does something good so I can finally have fun with this game like the last two dark souls games without playing with friends (didn't actually redeem instead it added more cancer)in summary- From screwed us over and gave us a bag with the festering corpe of a rat instead of the glorious, epic, adventurous game we were promised as the finale of the souls series"
Negative,"This game is broken on my i7-5820k + EVGA GTX770 SC . It keeps crashing every 2 minutes even with EVERYTHING set to Low . Dear FROM SOFTWARE, please stop making games and start a career elsewhere ."
Negative,"If you're planning on playing with a friend, don't bother. I did 3 playthroughs by myself and wanted to take my girlfriend though it. We could SOMETIMES play together, waited 15 minuted to see eatchothers summon sign at times and still nothing. Good game for solo, terrible for playing with someone you know. Fix Matchmaking."
Negative,"AMD users do not purchase just yet because the game is really badly optimized for AMD.Just wait three months because thats how long it will approxamatly take for fromsoft to fix the performance.If you dont believe me just buy it if you already have the money in your steam wallet and try it yourself, just dont play more than 2 hours! It has great potential but is not enjoyable to play just yet."
Negative,"Started off good, seemed like a promising entry into the Souls series.Then I beat the first boss, tried to open the gate, and the game crashed.Spent about fifteen minutes playing around, trying to figure out a way to get around this bug- whatever is causing it- but nothing works. Looking it up, apparently this is an issue that has been known since before release, and the devs have done literally nothing about it.I am obviously upset about shelling out $60 for a broken game that does not work, and I wouldn't reccomend anyone buy it."
Negative,"Taken all of their expierence from the last 4 games and made this piece of perfection. Needs some balancing and tweaks. But other than that it's awesome.***EDIT***I can no longer recommend this game. The main problem with this game, the reason why i stopped, is the roll invincibility and the inability of heavy weapons to exploit rolls. 70% of the time im using a Zwei or Club and its fucking impossible.  If you like this game, ok, good on ya. Use your Carthus and Frayed Blade. Im going back to a Dark Souls where rolls cost stamina and poise isnt broken"
Negative,Can't summon other players. It fails always 100%. Bandai support give a sh**.
Negative,"Really did not like how every control dialog is setup for controllers, even though it is a PC game with keyboard and mouse..."
Negative,"60 hours playing multiple characters finally get one im happy with and whats this?! cant see any summon signs or be summoned or invade, no fixes no notes no warnings nothing just stopped working f*** this game"
Negative,For anyone who has an ASUS G74sx gaming laptop; it will not run.
Negative,"Half arsed job of creating pc controls/key bindings, if you use any kinda keyboard/mouse combo then give this game a miss. Grpahics and game play mediocre, class/weapon combo's good addition thought but nothing to make this game worth it in its current state"
Negative,Can't even play it. Apparently there is a game breaking glitch where if you have an AMD video card then you can't damage enemies and they can't damage you. Hopefully Bandai Namco fixes this soon. I was really looking forward to playing this.
Negative,"You would think for a game this popular, they would attempt to make it playable on the PC. Joke is on you! The entire tutorial uses the Console controllers so you have to constantly look in the menu to see how it translates to PC controls. I am okay with dying, but dying because I have to constantly remember what each and every control is because the damned tutorial wont tell me isn't okay. That is just lazy programming.The way the game stands, you have to shell out money to get a controller in order to play it well. That should not be a requirement for a PC game. I have already submitted for a refund. This game is trash."
Negative,"This LOOKS like it could be a great game, however, I've found it to be currently so buggy as to be unplayable. I've got a decent PC setup and yet DS3 crashes CONSTANTLY with no apparent rhyme or reason to it. Despite spending hours researching possible solutions and tweaking my PC settings, I've never been able to play for more than a few minutes without it crashing to desktop. I've not had this issue with any other game I've played so it can only be down to faults in DS3 itself, especially as I can see online that thousands of other people are having the same issues.Very, very disappointed. I'm just glad I didn't book some holiday time off to play this, as I'd been planning to!"
Negative,"Dark Souls 1 gave me best gaming adventure i ever had with amazing world,outstanding music and fun a bit tactical gameplay.Dark Souls 2 gave me great game with many possible playstyles and a tons of fun in multiplayer.Dark Souls 3 gave me Bloodborne 2 with fast action based gameplay with limited possible playstyles,generic cinematic music and chaotic multiplayer.It's about beautiful visuals and arcade combat with monsters at every step.Overhyped by popular crowd."
Negative,"No keyboard and mouse prompts and the entire interfaced is jammed with Xbox™ symbols. Sorry, it's lazy and not good enough. I'll wait for an official fix or a mod (which I'm sure will be made ""illegal"") before I can go any further with the game, which I'm sure isn't bad besides this."
Negative,"I cannot beat the Pontiff boss for the life of me, I'm deleting my steam account."
Negative,"$60 to change my weapon, approach a bonfire, and crash my game. Best ever. 8/8"
Negative,"Crashes, FPS drops and low textures galore. Running GTX 970 and intel i5 6600k.Can't give the game a pass considering I payed so much for it."
Negative,You'd think they would fix proper controls for mouse and keyboard as Dark souls 3 is the last game in its franchise but nope
Negative,This game won't start it'll only give me a white then black screen with a cursor only to tell me later that it's not responding
Negative,This actually isnt a review since I can't play the game with the controller.
Negative,"Game will not start and I'm not the only person having this issue.  I searched my problem on google and there seems to be no fix that worked.  I don't think it should be my responisbility to download 3rd party programs to fix this game, they should have patched it day 1 when it didn't work."
Negative,"I'm about 1 more failure away from refunding. The lack of support for DS4 controllers (best rated controller by about every news site out there) is absolutely infuriating and depressing. Should I find a way to make my DS4 work, I will happily flip this review, but currently, I've paid $60 for a program that is only taking up 17gb of my harddrive."
Negative,"i cant even start the game.  i have a very up to date rig and the screen starts up WHITE and then BLACK and then NOTHING.... i updated my drivers and i am so confused as to why i cant even see a pop up screen or SOMETHING. im jealous of the people that are playing and get to get crashes from the bonfires and such i cant even get a damn menu to open up for me.right now , this game is not optimized for PC . seems like the master race is put on the lower end of the importance spectrum"
Negative,"YOU CRASHED !TO AVOID BUGS, I HAD TO CUT /game TO ROOT DIRECTORY AND DOWNLOAD A PIRATE DS3 ON-LINE PATCH : )"
Negative,"No matter how I change the graphic settings, the game is literally running at 2 or 3 fps on a pretty strong PC.Completely unplayable for now :("
Negative,no support 21.1 aspect ratio  Same old graphics 1+2 no new
Negative,wait for a few more patches before buying this on PC
Negative,Causes my PC to crash every 5-10 minutes. 1 year old PC that can run any other new AAA game fine. I would not recommend this game in the current state until the bonfire crash issue is fixed.
Negative,Meat ment made
Negative,"a game more about memory than actual using skill, spamming ""roll"" and learning attack patterns of bosses is what this is all about, the combat is clunky and poor, infact this whole series is so ""mehh"" I cant even be bothered typing any m...."
Negative,"After playing darksouls2 I can not recomend dark souls 3. The combat system is fun, I like how you dont have to upgrade armor but the story is lacking and the way the developers placed an overabundance of enemys in an area as a time waster makes the game not fun. Im currently trying to run up hill vs 5 greatbow dragonknights. The game feels like it was rushed and had strong enemys grouped together to make it ""hard"" instead of actualy hard. Most of the boss battles that ive done were easy, hit a specific thing but there was allways a gimic, something that I had to do during the boss battle or else the boss took no damage."
Negative,"I would say hold off for now if your on PC. The game looks absolutely wonderful.But seems like its crashing for many people on PC at various points. For me started right as I tried to open the door after first mini boss was defeated. Now anytime I hit a guy it crashes. Makes me sad.If you're on PC I would wait until a few more fixes are released to avoid the frustration and a bitter taste to the start of your game.I'm running Win 7 64bit, with an AMD 64 FX Black Edition, Radeon 7800, 12gb ram"
Negative,"WARNING FOR THOSE SENSITIVE TO MOTION SICKNESS AND NARROW POV IN GAMES:The FOV is very very narrow. It's currently locked around 40, and I can't play games with narrow fields of vision or I become nauseated. DS II was around a very acceptable 75. I returned the game and hope they fix it at some point, cuz I really want to love this game."
Negative,Here is how it works1.play multiplayer2.meet a hacker3.get banned and cheater unharmed4.get a bad support message5.not fixed after 3 years
Negative,Just plain bad. Not a fan of this type of game so you'll either hate it or love it. Too monotonous
Negative,The PC version for this game is an utter joke.It plays okay but the fact that the developers could not be bothered to change the control references from the consol is apalling.
Negative,"Navigating the map and identifying where you're supposed to go and what you are supposed to do is the hardest part of this game. When I think about the difficulty of the Dark Souls games, I don't think of the bosses; I think about the times when I couldn't understand what to do next. Those are the most frustrating parts of the games for me. You're just stuck wandering around trying to find what you missed. Don't worry, though. There's a million guides for the Dark Souls games, and that's because there has to be, because the game doesn't even try to make sense.I beat the game, but I'm more proud that I overcame the map, not the challenging enemies."
Negative,To add salt to the wound regarding being banned for no reason.2 Days ago i got banned for installing the game after a few monthsBandai Namco support simply told me to delete my beloved  character after 30 + hours (no one should ever do that it doesn't matter if its just few hours or 9999+h it breaks the whole experience) i have never cheated in DS3 nor did i used some fancy program to give myself every item or immortality.It only hurts me to see a good game being run by a bunch of incompetent people with their too aggresive anti-cheat Botthat doesn't even protect as from the damn hackers in the first place.As always thank you for coming to my TED talk.
Negative,Sekiro is Better
Negative,While Dark Souls 3 gameplay looks promising I haven't been able to play the game properly as it is poorly optimised leading to constant microstuttering and crashes. In its current state this game is simply not worth paying for.I would recommend buying this game in the future if it's been patched to run properly.
Negative,My cousin died from a dark souls addiction 0/10 but good game tho.
Negative,Play Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing instead
Negative,just get dark souls 2: scholar of the first sin. it's like this but better :)
Negative,really badly optimized
Negative,Bit of a shit game ill be honest
Negative,"This is one of the most overhyped games ever. Does this truth statement hurt you? Good. It feels like playing an old arcade game. You know those old arcade games where they are infested with artificial difficulty just so you keep dying to waste your coins if you want to keep playing. Dark Souls is the same but it wastes your time instead. And coin if you actually made the mistake of buying it. TL;DR at the end.Let me tell you about the reality of this game. It's a one giant troll fest. Just look at all the numerous issues with it:- NO BORDERLESS WINDOW MODE- NO CLOUD SAVES- Extremely bad and outdated combat system. It's a torture to actually use it. And you struggle with it, not the game.- Story is basically non-existent. You don't even have an open world. It's just zones after zones with no goals, no indications why you are killing all these enemies and what the consequences of killing them are. There are no indicators where to go and what to do as well. Your best hope is to remember all the map you have traversed and go to those places you haven't visited yet and hope they let you progress further into the game. After you finish the game you realize if you want all achievements you have to complete it 3 more times...3 more times going through this slog LMAO- Missing tons and tons of content compared to other RPGs, content that would make the game fun to play and actually playable. There are NO spells, NO weapons(basic swords/spears/shields do not count), NO loot(the loot that drops is completely useless as it's just basic swords or basic armor just for the sake of having equipment), Dodge/block/parry do nothing so it's as if they are missing as well. Imagine playing World of warcraft without spells/abilities and just running around with some sword? Yeah, that's what Dark Souls is.- Lots of bugs and glitches that have not been fixed on purpose.- Controls, combat, camera - they are awful on purpose as well, you struggle with the controls and not the game itself. This is an artificial difficulty and not an actual difficulty of the game.- Enemies keep respawning after you die or use the bonfire to heal and save the game. This is the only game that does this just a way for the devs to troll you and think they made a difficult game. It's wasting your time with dealing with random trash mobs and keeping you away from the interesting parts of the game.- Random overpowered enemies in your way that one shot/two shot you to force you into the point above this one. An endless circle jerk where you spend half of the game running around and killing the same trash mobs over and over just to progress the level which often ends up with some random overpowered enemy killing you in one hit, put there clearly by the troll developers.- Random players invade you and one hit kill you, cheaters exist and there is no anti cheat.- Boss fights feel like boss fights but sometimes too much. It's fine for a boss to hit you hard, makes sense. But the game also suffers from the well-known bug every similar game, any third person RPG game, has ever had - the enemy's hit box sliding around especially in circles when you try to get behind the boss. This leads to the boss instantly turning around and hitting you (because it has a lock-on on you) without any animations, looking unnatural when you try to get behind the boss using dodge mechanics. Many other games suffer from this like Kingdoms of Amalur, Dragon age, World of Warcraft. I doubt this will ever be fixed so you cannot do such boss fights like they are presented here, with long attack range and wide area of effect hits. One way I found to counter such behavior in games is dodging into the boss which works 90% of the cases but I am not fond of it because it borderlines with exploiting game mechanics, but hey, if they didn't bother to make the combat properly then it is okay. Bosses must not have lock-on on you is one way to fix this(?)- If you want to play co-op with someone you cannot disable invasions. There will always be some asshole ruining your game or even a hacker that will spawn items and get you banned BEWARE!- Using mods online will get you banned!- Cluttered menus full of pointless options and pop-up menus, AWFUL CONSOLE DESIGN!- Missing basic and essential options from RPG games such as simple stats screen where you can easily compare and swap gear.- There is barely any loot, with 10 hours in I got 3 swords that I cannot equip and clothing gear that is weaker than my starter gear. IN AN RPG GAME THERE IS NO LOOT! (After finishing the game I can say this is pretty much true. I got 2 swords and armor in the middle of the game that I used until I finished the game, making any other weapons and armor loot pointless.)- Every time you die you lose points(souls) that are used for leveling up. And you will die a lot not because the game is hard but because you will fall victim to bugs and bad gameplay design. This means you enter one giant circle jerk where you cannot level up and can't progress at all. Unless you are willing to farm tons of weak trash mobs and run back and forth to exchange your earned points for experience to level up.Of course it would be biased if I don't talk about the good things. Visually it looks decent, the atmosphere is amazing, the world and design of everything is amazing. But you realize that for a game to be good it needs every aspect of it to be good and especially the gameplay which is flawed and I told you why with the truths above.One other good thing that came out of the dark souls series is the ""git gud"" meme which can be amusing in certain situations. This is not one of them. Hence why all comments have to be disabled so the trolls and elitist pricks can't post their manure here(they are pressing the funny button on the review though, and using the Jester reward - proof they are absolutely butthurt, truth hurts them but hey, thank you for the free points!). This game will never be on the level of games like Ninja Gaiden(NES) which is inherently one of the most difficult games ever made, without any bugs it manages to really push your gaming skills and reactions and I have managed to complete those 3 NES games on the old hardware without using modern save states, proving I am indeed on the top of my game.TL;DR - There is no defending the game because all I've written above is absolutely true. When it comes to the score, this gets 1/10. It's a forgettable experience bringing nothing unique to the gaming world except devs who like to troll you and you let them do it while also defending them(to all the trolls and elitist jerks). Pretty sad if you ask me. You could play it but be warned that unless you have A LOT of patience you won't find this game interesting or entertaining. It's a broken mess of a game using outdated engine, outdated graphics and outdated combat system. There are a lot more games that are much more fun to play. But the world and lore are really cool, however, the gameplay lacks and it can be really boring, slow and broken most of the time.If you want to play a good RPG game, do not play any dark souls game. Instead play Dragon Age II or Kingdoms of Amalur. They are light years better than this mess.Here is a list of games I created with the best Fantasy RPG games that are much much better than this mess:https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42021209/"
Negative,"This game is so close to being good, but just isn't. It has so many issues with it that it's inexcusable. You can have fun with it, there are good parts to it, but it's just overwelmingly covered with issues and bad design that all the fun or accomplishment you would feel just turns to frustration and tedium.I'm not going to bother with the good, it's there and it's nothing new from the last games. Other people have already said the good, I'm going to say the bad and why it's not worth it.1. Camera. It's SO BAD in this game. It just does not work, and you will die SO MANY TIMES because it fucked up. And large enemy causes it to freak out and turn oddly, and it's so zoomed in half the time that you can't see what bosses are even doing. In addition to that a lot of regular enemies freak the camera out if you get to close, and cause it to 180 and this not only is disorienty but causes sudden changes to your controls and will easily get you hit/killed. They also have this stupid system called ""cinematic camera"" on by default that only makes your camera lean forward and lock into place on some attacks. Thankfully you can turn it off.2.Lock-on. It's crap. Not only is it a short as fuck range, but it just randomly unlocks all the time. Oh man, and enemy walked behind another enemy/lamp post better unlock. Oh man, that enemy slightly jumped, better unlock. Oh hey, you're close to this enemy, better unlock. Lock on goes above your head on a large enemy? Unlock. How in the world did they fuck this mechanic up so bad?3.Poise. More then enough has been said about this, it doesn't work past the first point. All that one point does is give you access to your weapons hyper armor (that some have) and nothing else. Litterally that's it, no one has found any proof whatsoever that it does anything more. And all we've gotten from Fromsoftware is ""it's working as intended"" which I'm sure is just like durability was ""working as intended"" in DS2.4.Enemy AI. This is largely a problem because of Poise. Enemies just attack relentlessly, over and over and over without stop, and with barely any (if any in some cases) openings to hit back. Enemies get their own poise because ""fuck you"", or just randomly break out of flinching cause why not and endlessly attack you. It's boring and frustraiting. Several bosses, are just walls because they never stop attacking. Ever. Every little hit stuns you making these enemies more frustraiting than they need to be.5.Boss tells. They're really not there. The game is so fast, that they either don't have tells for most of their attacks or they're so fast and similar that you can't tell before hand. The few tells that are there are for the slowball attacks. This is more a gripe than an issue, but still. You more have to guess than actually know what attack a boss will use a good 70% of the time.6.Armor. You can't upgrade armor in this game, and I really haven't found any armor that's better than stuff you get early on. If anything there's more cosmetic armor than actually decent armor. This would be fine, if even the most common of enemies weren't one shotting me since mid game. I'm not glass cannon either, roughly 1k health with the best armor I can use (without fat rolling) and still bosses easily one shot, and most enemies either do 60% or one shot as well. More often then not it just feels like I'm outstatted rather than killed through a misstake.7.Online. Two covenants don't even work right now, or at least they don't work for older characters. Maybe they do now. But in addition to that there's a glitch where friendly phantoms can't enter boss doors. It's not even a rare glitch, and there are some bosses where it pretty much always happens from what I've heard/experienced.8.Parrying. Doesn't work right, half the time even when you do successfully parry (not a partial block/parry, a full fledged knock them back and go into a reposte parry) you still take damage as if you failed. It's not a rare occurance, and it's terrible. In a game where player poise doesn't exist, and enemies spam attacks the one mechanic you could use doesn't work reliably.9.Shortcuts. All of them, ALL OF THEM, are anything but short. Anytime you die and have to redo a boss, or go back to an area it's an easy 2+min treck back to a boss or an area, and that's if you run past all the enemies.10.Area size. The game is huge. Areas are huge, and can get very convoluted. For anyone who likes to explore everything and do everything, this quickly becomes annoying and tedious. You will miss things, npc, whole areas, etc beacuse you didn't notice a small thing/something was invisible and will inevitably have to backtrack and try to find it or just miss it forever. It's also great that some mandatory things are hidden past tiny little hidden areas, that's great. What doesn't help is the games almost obsesive tendancy to have areas that slow you down. Forcing you to a walk/fat roll way to travel and wasting even more time in those areas.This game is easily the worst of the three dark souls games because of these issues. Even the basic systems that worked flawlessly in the last systems are unreliable in this game (camera, lock on). I just can't recommend this, beacuse of all these issues. The game has lost all fun or fullfillment because it never feels like a challenge is hard for the right reasons. The game feels like it was designed with certain mechanics in place and working, and then had them removed on launch. It's just bad."
Negative,"Bought this so me and lilttle brother could play coop together, went to first area and imediately got invaded. We managed to hit him a total of 12 times before he killed us both. He was twinked out and we only got him down 1/2 health. He hit us for 3/4 our health every hit. Wasn't really fun nor fair.No way to coop anymore other than burning our embers. Constantly got invaded by twinked out invaders. One could count to 30 before the next invader came, couldn't even get to first boss. Out of embers have to solo bosses or restart charaters if we wan't to play together. Little brother isn't having fun gonna go play something else."
Negative,"I want to enjoy this game, I really do.It doesn't take much to please me, I played both DkS and DkS2:SotFS, and I enjoyed both immensely, so of course I knew more or less what I was walking into when I bought this game.If you are able to play this game, you can expect everything that made the previous Souls games great, the gameplay, the weapon movesets (which are now even cooler with weapon arts), the boss fights, the story, the gorgeous views, the pvp, the pve, the praising of the sun, loveable npcs, the determined skeletons, and the absolutely moving soundtrackBut oh, god, the port for PC is unplayable...I have never had significant issues running games on my computer before, I don't know if it's just my graphics card or if something more is at play here...Even on offline mode and at the absolute lowest of all graphics settings, the framerate lag is not only a nuisance, but a hindrance to my ability to play the game.And not only that, but something happened whereby after eight hours of trying to push through in spite of the lag and accidentally getting one of the greatest NPCs in the game killed as a result, I can no longer even navigate through menu options.I open the game, and neither my mouse nor my controller will allow me to select anything other than the ""Continue"" option. I enter the game world, and when I try to interact with any menu interfaces in-game, it doesn't let me select anything except the default setting. I can't switch my equipment, I can't use any of the items in my inventory, I can't reinforce my uchigatana at the blacksmith, hell, I can't even exit the game.It has gotten to the point where the only way to exit the game is to close it forceibly from the task manager while it's still running.I spent eighty dollars on the deluxe edition because I knew that being able to play the game would be worth it. But I can't even play it. I have 9.3 hours logged at the time of my writing this, most of which has been spent not even playing the game, but trying to make it work. And somehow it has only gotten worse over time.As much as I love the Souls series and as much as I feel I can love this game, I can't recommend it in good conscience unless you have a seriously beefy computer.I wish I could have written a review about the content of the game, because what little I was able to experience before my menus stopped working was great in spite of the horrendous framerate lag.I'm sorry. I can't give this game a positive review until these issues get patched."
Negative,doesnt even start
Negative,Infinite falling black screen death bug still in the game in the year of our lord of 2020. This truly is the dark souls of gaming.rofl lmao buy the Surge 2
Negative,"Mahiro Yasaka is just an ordinary high school student, until one day he is suddenly attacked by a dangerous monster. Just when everything seems to be lost, he is saved by a silver-haired girl named Nyaruko, who claims to be the shape-shifting deity Nyarlathotep from horror author H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, sent by the Space Defense Agency to Earth. She explains to Mahiro that the creature chasing him was an alien called Nightgaunt, who had planned on abducting and selling him as a slave.After rescuing him from the alien, the Lovecraftian deity falls madly in love with Mahiro and forces herself into his household, much to his chagrin. Moreover, they are soon joined by two others from the fictional universe: Cthuko, a girl obsessed with Nyaruko, and Hasuta, a young boy easily mistaken for a beautiful female. Together, the three eccentric aliens protect Mahiro from the various extraterrestrial dangers that threaten both his and Earth's well-being, all the while making his life a living hell."
Negative,"I've played and finished the game with a controller. It was definitely fun since I played it with friends, so it wasn't that hard. But despite the many good reviews I see about this game, I still don't know how it hasn't received proper support to be ported properly. Button prompts are for controllers. And trying to connect certain controllers just make the game behave kinda crazy. Really? Even games by indie developers have better support. Some of these indie games are even successful across multiple platforms without porting issues. I gotta say that alone is a huge disappointment for me, for such a popular game from a bigger developer.Otherwise, still a fun game to play with friends though."
Negative,epic game but  you increase the price way toooo much on argentina store not worth that muchbtw dark souls remasterd also not worth that price f u bandai namco
Negative,Says I played 3.4 hours and now the game can't be found in my library....??? Wth  wheres my game m8
Negative,Played all the way through 1 and then picked up 3. Just not my cup of tea anymore. Just gets so repetitive after awhile. More power to you if you like it still!
Negative,"It's just watered down bloodborne. Plus trying to co-op with friends is like pulling teeth, not to mention that in doing so you get invaded by turbo virgins who get off on nothing else than making everyone have a bad time who do twink builds that'll just kill you in like 2 hits, which are near impossible to deal with because of the shitty peer-to-peer system guaranteeing that they're always going to be as laggy as possible."
Negative,It is a good game trapped in a console body no ultrawide support and very few PC friendly settings
Negative,Laggy as fuck please fix...
Negative,"Playing this after Elden Ring just made the experience kind of unbearable. I didn't like a single thing about this game, personally"
Negative,개 ㅈ망겜 벽 뚧는 공격 몬스터가 마법을 시전하는데 마법이 모이지 않음 개 망겜
Negative,"I am a huge fan of the series and I actually pre-ordered this product with high expectation.Unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations at all and the many bugs correlated to a bad adaptation for PC makes this chapter unworthy of its predecessors. My opinion on this product is really negative."
Negative,"Can't even make a decent looking character, all of them look like a drained raisin extra from annoying orange.Also Multiplayer is dogshit, let me play a private game with a friend without being invaded instantly by dark phantoms."
Negative,"Yet another stella pc port from namco, once again proving that they just do not give one toss about pc gamers. To elaborate, i got frequent hard crashes to desktop followed by a patonising message telling me how i should quit the game properly. At the moment stability is the hardest boss of this game."
Negative,Game is ok
Negative,shit just straight shit
Negative,Some Achievements don't unlock... Cringepilled :(Otherwise pretty good.
Negative,if you enjoy suffering play this game.
Negative,this game is shit
Negative,"This game is a shitty port, the controls don't handle well at all, and get stuck, the camera has a mind of it's own, the tooltips and the menus havent been converted to PCIt is really sloppy and quite a shame as the concept is interesting"
Negative,"So I'm getting repeatedly invaded by dicks with low self-esteem who can't be targeted, can't be damaged at all or even blink all over the place, but my friend was banned for cheating when he LEGITIMATELY levelled quickly...? I really want to enjoy this game more, but it puts a HUGE damper on the fun when there's a very real chance I could be banned for doing absolutely nothing wrong, yet cheaters get to frequently shit all over me and my friends. Work on your god damn cheat detection system ffs."
Negative,"Bloodborne is the best ""Dark Souls game"" and the only one that`s actually good at all.(By the way, I didn`t play Sekiro yet, so don`t know if that`s good or just another garbage ppl like to worship yet)"
Negative,just lost 30k souls today
Negative,you'd love this game if you love to getting your penis and balls trampled by high heels
Negative,"Good game, meh souls"
Negative,"Okay,This game is actually beautiful, not as good looking as Mortal Shell, but it is beautiful nonetheless.What killed it for me was the combat mechanics. I like to hack and slash tactically, meaning that I like to block either with shield or sword and occasionally when required dodge and roll, but DK3 feels so different from Mortal Shell, which I absolutely adore playing.A few good pointers this game has: The atmosphere and the grimness of the landscape is absolutely superb. I just wish the combat was more like Mortal Shell. Therefore I refunded the product."
Negative,"I never write reveiws.... but i had to write a review on this game. Because its so shit, the secon you start a game you will find out it is a consol port, and guess what... in the character creation screen their is no back button, i was trying to creat a character and i couldnt go back ? and it says hit the b button to go back. so i press b on my key board and nothing!!!!!! you wanna know what key you press ? its not b ? stupid guess because guess what..... its the FUCKING Q BUTTON! the game is broken right from the fucking start please dont by this i sooo want my money back fuck you dark souls"
Negative,"No i would not recommend this game at the moment because they need to patch it, it keeps crashing at key moments for almost everyone. Check the steam DS3 forum and you can see many many people are constantly crashing at the same spots."
Negative,"They removed Family Share. So RIP any chances of playing one of the amazing community mods, dicking around offline with the Cheat Engine to make cool looking outfits for cosplay ideas, or just in general if you got banned because some asshat abusing the system forced items into your inventory that you cannot get rid of. GOOD JOB BANDAI YOU FUCKING USELESS CUNTS."
Negative,"Completely trial and error. There are almost no hard fights where the game gives you clear cues and expects you to take them on. All difficulty in this game will come from the obscurity of information, and once you have all the information you will breeze through it. This creates the illusion of being a hard game or getting gud, when in reality you're just going through a long spanking machine and at the end of the spanking the game says you won.90% of enemies are hiding, the remaining 10% violate expectations to damage you by surprise in some other way (Cant be staggered, weird fast attack after a slow attack, enemies programmed to stand around until you take an action then charge attack you, etc). Side quests are all ridiculously hidden. Maybe 5/12 areas of the game depending on how you count are hidden, usually in ridiculous ways. Item descriptions and game mechanic descriptions are woefully lacking. Leveling up is a long series of soft caps, sudden boosts, then more softcaps, and then discovering a new weapon that's vastly more useful than the old one you built around anyway. The entire game is just about using the wiki and already having gone through it once.It's absolutely not your typical skill based game about practicing and applying general abilities. It's more like the Impossible Quiz. You are completely beholden to knowing a lot of really small things, and you will be told you died until you hit the next checkpoint and everything you learnt is now useless until NG+."
Negative,This game is in no way ready for PC. You have to go through a good half an hour of finding out what the tutorial means. I heard this game was good through friends but it just falls flat with integration into PC. would not recommend.
Negative,"I tried,  game kept freezing. Can't recommend."
Negative,"No Steam Cloud Saves. 134 hours down the drain. Great game!! But as soon as I saw no option for a new game plus, I decided to go on and try another game equally as hard as Dark Souls 3."
Negative,why are the controls for xbox
Negative,Horrible game.It's not difficult - it's just guitar hero with better graphics and (somewhat) a story.
Negative,me: i think this game kinda SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!everyone: ..............WRONG! I BET YOU TOUCH KIDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!me: nah.................
Negative,"I have been working with computers for 30 years, about 20 of them doing software engineering. Never in my life I have seen a program which does not know how to use keyboard properly.Until I launched Dark Souls III for the first time. My character just would not stop. I do not own a controller, nor do I intend to. All I can say is that however released this game on PC - has staggering incompetence."
Negative,"This game can be summarised as not fun at all.Not only is the game no help at all with the controls, with the control prompts being given for controller buttons instead of the keyboard/mouse bindings which were in use at the time, with no controller plugged in, the controls felt sluggish.  Add to that the fact that all the enemies seem to respawn when you die (ok, I can understand that, I'm familiar with checkpoints etc), but also when you rest at a fire.  Those things just add up to a game that is simply not fun.  I'm sure some people will enjoy this type of game, I simply did not."
Negative,"Once again i find myself back to this game, and once again I'm left disappointed. Beat it in 15 hours because of my experience on other platforms, ended up basically killing Dancer right after Vordt and steamrolling the game, which doesn't actually make it any more fun than it was my first time through. What DS1 and DS2 got right, DS3 got miserably wrong trying to copy the success of Bloodborne, the recent release at the time. My worst gripe with this game is straight up just how little creativity there is in the buildcrafting, in PVE yes, but especially in PVP. There's just no reason to use anything but Dex, Strength gives you the lovely illusion of choice with the dragonslayer greataxe, but look past that and you'll realise that other than this and like two other heavy weapons you have to slog through the worst DLC ever released to get, there's no more options. UGSes suck, unlike in DS2 and DS1 where they actually felt like massive hunks of metal and hit like them too. But once you realise you can ALSO hit 500 per hit with twinblades, there's almost no point in using anything else. I frames by default are too forgiving to even land a hit with a UGS 3/4 of the time you're using one, especially if you're going against a dex user who stacked their stamina bar.Bosses are either a complete pushover or nigh impossible, not because of movesets, or damage, or anything like that, simply because of their mammoth sized and (sometimes) triple phased healthbars. Sister Friede isn't difficult by design, she's difficult because you have to fight her 3 times in a row with 15 estus (another mistake DS2 fixed with lifegems that they brought back again.) genuinely, base game is literally a cakewalk, the only difficult fights in the game are nameless king or maybe SoC if you cant parry for shit. The DLC bosses however are some of the most poorly designed boss fights in gaming. (Demon prince, Midir, looking at both of you.) Fromsoftware decided to make a souls game that's geared towards people who THINK souls games are about constantly dodgespamming and being ganked and two shot. It's almost like i should be writing a review for the DLC because they're the biggest crock of feces in this game overall. I get that moon grass and lifegems were removed because estus in 2 was basically a last ditch and demons souls' early game is nigh impossible unless you dupe moon grass, but 15 estus to last for a 10 ish minute fight with bosses that two shot you is ridiculous. DS2 and DS1 had fun linearity and this game ditched that for a bloodborne ordeal of one basic straight line to the finish, unless you count skipping dancer (something youre basically not meant to do) or doing smouldering lake. This game is more bloodborne 2 than it was Dark Souls 3, and you can tell because Irithyll was clearly meant to be something akin to Yharnam. After years of whitewash, especially with this series as a whole being hailed as untouchable masterpieces, it's so clear that Dark Souls 3 is probably the weakest entry we've gotten in the Soulsbornekiroring line, somehow Demon's Souls, a tech demo from 2009, had more interesting areas than this game did. everywhere looks like a replica of the last place, especially from undead settlement to the end of Carthus, which is basically the first quarter of the game. Lothric Castle is also just ANOTHER rehash of Boletarian Palace/Drangleic Castle/Dukes Archives, which is a staple in these games at this point. Play DS2 instead. Genuinely. This game lasts like 15 hours if you're well versed in playing it. I was at archdragon peak by 4am this morning and i'd started at 7 the night before. At least with my replays of 2 or even 1 i can squeeze thirty hours out of those, this is a short short game with mediocre or artificial as fuck difficulty all throughout. Homeward bone yourself to the refund page and get SOTFS instead."
Negative,"I tried it and I couldent get past the first level after an hour, so i refunded it becuause i doubt i was able to get past the first boss . i dont recomend unles you like spending 2 hours on a single boss fight, with a total of 20 atempts. the story looks awesome but i cant access it because of the insanly high beginner dificulty."
Negative,"If someone recommended this game to you, kick him in the balls and shit on his face."
Negative,this shit does not have cloud saving i am not replaying the whole game
Negative,I have plugged so many hours into this game on console and I decided to buy it on PC as well because I have a deep self loathing problem. Please help me.
Negative,I was excited to do another run of this amazing game. Turns out my new 2080Ti and 5800x cant run it above  24FPS despite hours of tinkering. Its a terrible port of an amazing game.
Negative,"This game is amazing. So good, in fact, that I've played through it as many times as I've played through DS1 and 2. The only difference is that DS1 and 2 I've been able to finish before the constant crashes corrupted my save files. I can't attest to the end-game content because I haven't gotten there yet on any of the 5 different characters I've had to make.And the best part is, after all these corrupt files get detected on the server-side, you'll get a soft ban restricting your online activity! The cheat detection system is THAT good!Great work FromSoft/Bamco!"
Negative,I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game I hate this game
Negative,"The game is great, but I cannot in good will support this company when they unjustifiable and permanently softban people. My best friend, that I know for 11 years, simply picked up an item from a hacker and he got permanently banned from playing online. This has been the case a year now. He wrote to DS support about it 3 times over the course of the year and it still hasn't been resolved (they haven't even replied)."
Negative,"TL;DR: If you have a life outside of playing video games, move on. The port to PC is terrible on top of what I consider crap gameplay. ***I write this review as someone who is replaying Witcher 3 on Death March for fun***I do not understand what all of the hype is about this title. Honestly, if you want to spend your gaming time dying, then repeating the same fights over and over and over and over so much so that you have it memorized so you finally don't die again, this is the game for you. For me, it is not. I like plenty of games that are difficult. This is not that. No matter how avid a gamer you are, you are 0% prepared to do well. With most games there is a learning curve that typically takes 1-4 hours to get ~90%, then throw in new enemies to keep it fresh et cetera. Dark Souls is a game where there is no end to the learning curve because each section has a sequence of events that outright own you the first time. Not fun. Killing me as a player because I am unskilled is justifiable. Dark Souls kills you simply because you don't know the future. Repeating the same garbage fights over and over is underwhelming.As far as I got, I saw no plot. That is grievously moronic given that the subject matter would lend itself to some decent writing. Plot is also like the glue that hold a game together. Getting axed 1000 times before I beat the game would feel less arbitrary if I had some story or reason to continue. Dying doesn't feel heroic it feels asinine. Ooops I didn't pre-know the thing that is impossible to discern due to no foreshadowing...epic...epicly lame.What made matters worse is the port to PC is a dumpster fire. I have never seen a tutorial as poorly ported by major title as Dark Souls is. They are literally giving you tutorial tips as if you are playing X-box anyway. No new default key information. So I had to sit there and learn the controls from the settings screen for about 15-20 minutes on my own. Then they didn't really get the camera right, as it likes to do what it wants and constantly gives crappy perspectives. I felt as if I had little to no depth perception with auto lock. Which auto lock was lack luster as well, it breaks off too easily and doesn't allow ranged targeting to maximum cast/arrow distance.  There is no reticle with spells, not even a dot and they tend to go anywhere but where you think they ought to be going.I could keep going, but here is the basic line. Don't believe the hype and save yourself the grief that is Dark Souls 3. If you are a no-life gamer who wants to get leet gamer cred for beating this trash heap, that's fine. Just don't pretend it is good, because it most certainly is not. It also isn't ""difficult"" either, it is punishing simply to be punishing. Difficult does not equal sadistically repeating levels ad nauseam only because through dying can you properly know what to do for every... single... fight...   ***Edit for Commentary***I wrote this review so that non-fanboys would understand what they were getting and to avoid it if they didn’t want it. Everything in the review is factual. This includes the obvious toxic fanbase that is punctuated by leaving such child like comments. While I have initially deleted them if they were non constructive, I have decided to let all remain after this edit. It will serve as a showcase of how toxic the community really is. I will also stop reading the comments, so don’t expect me to respond.     If you are somehow triggered enough by this review to want to leave incendiary comments you need to reevaluate your life. Being a Dark Souls player is not a personality trait. You are acting like you're in a cult and I insulted your cult leader. This game is an objectively bad port with objectively bad gameplay. Stop making excuses for this garbage because somehow Dark Souls is part of your identity. Grow a pair and evaluate it objectively. If you think for one second that if a PC game ported to X-box/PS and it didn’t have new default controls set up properly, or have a camera that worked right with your controller instead of mouse people wouldn’t complain… you are utterly hopeless. Should I say to them, well go buy a keyboard and mouse for your console, don’t blame the company selling an incompatible port for taking your money?Furthermore, who needs to get gud is Bandi/Namco. Their game sucks and so do their port skills. Not to mention their banning skills from what I’ve read from other reviews. Witcher 3 is 10x more epic, deep, ENJOYABLE and gorgeous than Dark Souls III ever will be, while still being challenging. And guess what? CD Projekt Red is going to release Cyber Punk 2077 that will also completely obliterate Dark Souls III, and even the next one. When I hold Dark Souls III up to nearly any other RPG for that matter, it loses. It loses because it is boringly repetitive, not because it is too “difficult.” Just because you suffered through playing something doesn’t make it or you “gud.” It only indicates that you are willing to put up with bullshit for bullshit’s sake. That is not something to be proud of. It is something Frat houses do to haze pledges."
Negative,"Not my cup of tea - I am way to much of a spazz to succeed at this type of game.HOWEVER - If you like to suffer emotionally and mentally, AKA you are a masochist, then please have at 'er.10/10 break your gaming mouse10/10 use a controller next time....."
Negative,Got this through Humble Bundle. These games are just not for me. I can't even finish the tutorial boss. I can kill the mobs in souls games but never bosses. I just can't learn or recognize patterns.
Negative,worst game ive ever played stiff controls and buttons that dont exist
Negative,install the archthrones mod
Negative,imagina querer jugar mario kart con tus amigos y que se meta cada 5 minutos una persona a chocarse con todo el mundo para molestar
Negative,"Dang nintendo, you've outdone yourselves with this one. Best game since lego batman. 2/10"
Negative,Hacked characters invade and kill you in the starting area.  Game is only playable offline.  Do not recommend.
Negative,im literallly crying
Negative,"Do not buy if ur a pvp player!This game is so unbalanced that even the backstabs in demons souls and ds1 toghter are less broken the this piece of shit.The comunitty sucks and they just cant take loosing and if u talk shit bout their cheap tactics they will call u a butthurt.Its a shame 4 a veteran like me see the comunitty crumble.From the friendly guys in des and bb to the butthurts of ds3.Invaders are so weak that even a broken sword can kill em.Everything is spoiled by namco.And there are many edgelords and parry spamers(just to b parry kings).Most of the newcomers seem to have only played minecraft before.Pve is overhyped as well.But the most insulting thing about this game is bloodbornes influence.Parry times are messed up,roll spamming ,and weapon stamina cost.Cowboy said that ds 3 is the perfect combination of ds and bb.No ds game is gud if it is fast and rushed and its not slow and tactical.Why did the devs did not keep the gud feautures of ds1 and 2.Maybe to make bandai more money for making this game easy so casul gamers can play.The only gyd thing was unupgradeable armor.      One final thing:kids,if u have a game it does not mean that its gud."
Negative,Did not play DS 1 or DS 2. Played skyrim on easy. Started DS 3 as deprived.Crashed before dying. Core i7 and gtx 780 sli YOU DIED !
Negative,"Really good game, and fromsoft created one of the best fantasy settings ever but it is locked down behind egregious boss walls that make me not even care to see the world, It is a shame."
Negative,"I would rather drink bleachI only spent 12 bucks on humble for this and I'm still furious I wasted money on it, could of gotten a few gallons of bleach instead.."
Negative,"the game runs like shit, and there's no excuse for it"
Negative,So they fixed the problem and lost all of my progress. No I can't recommend this game. No I don't recommend this game. And don't fix Elden Ring!!!!! I don't what happened. I have more than 3 hrs. playing time. I don't know what happened.
Negative,"SO! Having managed to trudge through this game and actually beat the fucking thing, I can rightfully review it!Not worth the buy. If it's free? Maybe. Compared to previous Souls games, this one has a habit of... removing things. Armor is barely effective and is basically just fashion, most existing shields have had their defense values significantly reduced, and the amount of bosses that can be parried or back-stabbed has been reduced rather greatly. Other issues are stuff like: Enemies getting staggered from being hit but eventually choosing to IGNORE said stagger in favor of hitting you mid-combo. Enemies who simply don't follow the same rules as you (Infinite spells, not bouncing off walls, etc). Overall, while the game looks fucking amazing, has great atmosphere, and really fucking cool bosses, the feeling of ""What gimmick will be coming around the next corner!"" really kills it for me. Every time I started getting into it I'd run into an enemy that specifically punishes you for taking more than a single shot against them before dodging again.Recommendation: Watch someone else play it, it looks better than it plays."
Negative,"Buy it on 28 November 2019, play for few hours and stop... play again on 13 January 2020 for a few hours and stop.and after i formatting my PC for May update 2020, I play again on 14 June 2020, and guess what, I found that I been banned from online for no reason.as if work as frontliner, not stress enough. fix your ban algorithm or something."
Negative,"Terrible on PC.-All the menus still have controller buttons instead of keyboard LOL WHAT ARE YOU F***ING KIDDING ME LMFAOI ALMOST DEMANDED A REFUND THIS HAS GOT TO BE A JOKE. -Camera so static you can't keep it from going up your ass when you're not fighting.-Camera moving around during fights during awkward random times even tho you are just clicking mouse 1 and not moving the mouse at all-game doesnt tell you if you're in multiplayer or not, doesn't give you any information whatsoever about anything except some lucky coins that legit do nothing.-accidentally somehow took away my weapon and shield by scrolling mousewheel up however they appear to be ""equipped"" in inventory and unequipping and re equipping does nothing, furthermore scrolling the mouse wheel again also does not remedy and you are now weaponless and not wearing your shield. God knows where it is because its not on your back, its in some magical inventory like Hermione's purse.  WHY WOULD I EVER WANT TO REMOVE MY WEAPON AND SHIELD WITHOUT ACTUALLY UNEQUIPPING THEM? NAMCO. BANDAI. WTF. THIS IS DARK SOULS NOT THE SIMS FULL HOUSE.-while spamming my keyboard for anything that might help me I found an extremely elaborate list of useable gestures for your character. I can't imagine a situation, aside from simply dicking around of course, where this would not be too-clunky to use as communication tool while facing a real enemy of any kind.  the gestures are worthless because we are here to fight the undead and eachother not make silly gestures this isn't second life come on...So much hype around this game, major let down. See you never, BANDAI NAMCO"
Negative,"No online, wtf?"
Negative,24 november update killed my game. I'm sad now.
Negative,"This game is the worst that has happened to me. You wanna play for that amazing story and for level design, you wanna stay for those amazing armor and weapon sets and countless builds that your character can have, then you get kicked in the balls. Game just gets unexplainably harder out of nowhere after first Lord of Cinder. You used to do damage? Sorry, that doesn't apply here. You used to endure at least two hits from an enemy? Nope, tough luck here, everything one-shots you. Got used to fairly stupid AI? Not here, here you can get surrounded and mauled by three rats. Three. Little. Rats. Did you want to have some ember? Sorry mate, you're gonna use all of them to unlock maybe one more bonfire and one more boss fight before smashing your gamepad/keyboard and mouse/whatever you play with. I wanna spare you this suffering, so I am telling you in advance: If you like the lore, go watch some YouTube videos about it. If you like the level design, go watch a walkthrough and save your time for some better game that won't mentally break you.tl;drtbh game is okay, but out-of-nowhere difficulty raise after first lord of cinder grabs you by the balls and destroys your expectations about the game, so don't even bother playing it."
Negative,too many hackers and cheaters
Negative,"me no like, me like ds1, me like ds2, me no like ds3, me sad"
Negative,I'll consider recommending it when the invasion system is no more and coop actually works.
Negative,not sure why a game would be sold on pc in the controls are functional for pc
Negative,if you want to play this game with a friend the co-op is not fun at all.you have to go through a lot of trouble just to join.. and when any off you die you have to go through the same trouble to join back. so not worth is if  you want to play co-op.
Negative,"Somehow since DS1 on pc they've gotten worse, They've got a menu issue where the graphics menu lags too hard to allow you to change anything, this is with most other things running fine in the game running it on a 1080Ti with an 8 core cpu at 4GHz.Devs usually learn from mistakes rather than gaining incompitence between releases but these guys are the exception to that."
Negative,its just dark souls 2 but worse
Negative,the worst game i've ever played
Negative,im sooo lag.... how do i fix iti play offline
Negative,"beaten ds1 loved it, beaten ds2 loved it, beaten sekiro (holy moly sword saint isshin is awesome), beaten lies of p loved it, I hate this gameedit: beat the game, and still (even though the later game bosses are pretty cool) I am disapointed, it feels like this game has no real affecting build variety besides a dex build, and at that point I'd rather replay sekiro(which rules),  and also this game is surprisingly short compared to all the other fromsoft games I've played. I would give it a mixed rating, but there isn't, so just a down vote."
Negative,"If you haven't played a Souls game before, DS3 is fine.  If you have, it's a tired and uninteresting entry in a series that's out of ideas and should be allowed to rest.  Get ready to dodge roll for the millionth time..."
Negative,"Another departure from the previous games. Much faster paced combat and even more crafting potential.The bad? A very linear world. A very samey-world with a lot of copycat greyscale themes copied from Bloodborne, a PS4 exclusive made by the same company a year prior. Gankfest ambush spawns and high density of enemies harkening back to Scholar of the First Sin and Demon's Souls which are meant to pad your time in between boss runbacks. Many gimmicky bosses also harkening back to Demon's Souls, where you are meant to solve the boss then attack it appropriately until it dies. It takes every aspect of Dark Souls II and amps it up to 11 in all of the worst ways, coated in the guise of a decent-looking game. This is not an adventure series with action and RPG elements laid on top anymore, but an action RPG with explorative aspects and level-ups."
Negative,"Meh. I give it a 6/10I feel like I gave the game a fair shot, mostly because the franchise has a cult following, and I wanted to see what the fuss was about. Partly because I had a very vocal friend who adored it. And partly because it was on sale.I like the game's commitment to difficulty. Gaming has changed in my lifetime, and there are laudable things about being inclusive in game design. But it does mean that some players find that almost every game feels too easy. It's frustrating, and I worry about spending my budget on a game (particularly a mobile game) because any of them might be a cakewalk.Combat in the DS franchise is highly skill oriented. Skill here refers to the kind that comes from memorization through repetition, like playing violin or kicking a football. And just like any skill of that kind, whether or not you'll get bored has to do with whether you can enjoy the practice enough to develop the reflexes, and whether you feel like you've wasted your time once you have. I couldn't get into it. I tried. I wanted to like it. But eventually I realized that I was playing the game for somebody else. I'm not sure who. Maybe my friend who said it was one of the ""best games ever created"". But when I was honest about it, it felt like I was a kid practicing something my parents wanted me to do. I was bored, and hammering out the game like it would prove something. But my mind wandered, and I just could not make myself care what has happening in the game. I always ended a session feeling like I needed to do something fun to offset it. Like I'd done a chore and deserved a reward. That's the precise opposite of what I want from a game.The only part of the game I want to call objectively bad is the appallingly crappy multiplayer. I thought I could put up with the game if I could at least play with a friend. But the co-op system is a feeble afterthought, and you are disconnected any time one of you dies. Which is very often. It's hard to imagine anybody letting that feature through QA without a resignation following. And the pvp invasion mechanic is a confusing and incongruous personal ego-stroking mechanism. I wondered who it was for, until I remembered some of the personalities from the DS community. Then I took the game offline.Summary and ConclusionsYou might enjoy the game if you're cool with playing solo, practicing until you know the game by rote, and can derive satisfaction from knowing that you're individually good at a game that is notorious for difficulty. Or something. If you're of the more toxic variety of player, and can learn to say ""git gud"" like a well-trained parrot, you'll fit in with the subculture. YMMV, so give it the 2-hour trial shot if you're curious. But also remember that this game wasn't designed to be even dented in two hours.-----------------Edit: Like most of my reviews, this one's too long and I've been slowly paring down the fat by removing redundancy."
Negative,"This is easily the worst game in the Souls series by far. Instead of taking the good parts of DS2 and improving upon them, it completely abandons all of them and tries to be Bloodborne 2 when it comes to gameplay, but fails horribly at it. There are too many things gone wrong with the game to name them all, I'm just going to name those things that I hated the most:1. Armor is completely useless and offers barely any protection, you can no longer upgrade it as well. This results in everyone running around in rags and pretty much treating VIT as a dump stat.2. The overwhelming majority of weapons in the game scale exceptionally well with a ""quality"" built character, which eliminates any build variety in both pvp and pve. If you don't have 40STR+40DEX, you're playing the game wrong.3. Instachugging, it's absolutely horrendous.4. Rollspam is pretty much a necessity to beat most bosses, shields are a joke and aren't worth their weight and the needed VIT investment to use them.5. Absolutely linear world deisgn, the absolute worst in the series. It is mind-boggling how bad it is compared to DS2 world.6. Absolutely horrible pvp due to lack of build variety since any sort of magic is completely non-viable and everyone uses a ""quality"" build. Punishing chuggers is near-impossible and invasions are utterly horrible with everyone running around with 2 gold phantoms even before you actually enter their world.7. Complete lack of any sort of incentive to play through NG+ and onward, this is a massive step back compared to DS2, which added new enemies and phantoms as well as added new enemies to boss fights. The only things that change in DS3 on NG+ and onward is the addition of +1/2/3 ring variants, which exist mostly to artificially inflate your playtime if you want to get all of the achievements.8. Complete lack of any sort of interesting phantom invasions. Massive step back compared to DS2.I could continue listing the things I hate about the game, but, personally, this is already enough for me to name DS3 the absolute weakest game in the series and a total letdown."
Negative,"They want 60 dollars for a game that came out in 2016. Don't get me wrong, dark souls 3 is a great game, but I feel like after a certain number of years the price for games should go down a bit so people who are patient can eventually afford it."
Negative,This game is trash.
Negative,I bought for beef jerky . . . no beef jerky.
Negative,HUD on PC is ass
Negative,feels a lil shitty after elden ring and lies of p

Negative,"Самое опасное не боссы а мобы на всех локах тебя убьет стая 5 костяных собак либо конченные крысы во всех дс,тебе максимум что надо зделать это заранить до босса и убить его за пару сек чем просто ныть что тебя убивают мобы которым похуй на вашу атаку и они просто тебе снесут лицо, не ну а так дрочиво атак у всех боссов и мобов никто не отменял)"
Negative,"I am a hardcore souls fan and have played every souls game up to this. The world looks beutifull and vibrant. And the changes made to the game make it feel alot like Demon Souls, the first ever souls game. Having said that though, the game as a hardcore fan of the series is quite easy compared to the others. Having recently replayed Dark Souls 2 SotFS; im realy breezing through it withouth any armor(fast rolling) and the starter axe.Most of the time when franchises get more and more populair their quality and difficulty decreases because they want to apeal to a wider audiance, and I feel like this might be the last in the series that stays sort off true to the difficulty off the actual series, even if it is the easiest one. And I realy hope im wrong.For hardcore fans, you might be a bit disapointed with the difficulty, but other that, its another Souls game, nothing majorly different.For newcommers, eventhough I'd rather say start with the first in the franchise, especialy if you want to get into the story. It is the best one to start with when it comes to the difficulty. IF you are like me though, and you're sick of easy handholding every sucker can do it non-satisfying gameplay than buy Dark Souls 2 Scholar of the First Sin instead. It is argueably the hardest, but therefore 10x more satisfying than this. as for the major bugs and crashes, set lighting to low, and you'll barely have any crashes.And personaly because it is easy, I wouldn't realy recommend this one in the series."
Negative,"dont ask me why i just woke up in a fking steamy mood yea, cause i LIVE in a SHlTHOLE d'ya knowhatimean? UNDEAD SETTLEMENT is a FKING SHlTHOLE! I 'ATE the FKIN PLACE- I FKIN HATE IT. IT's FULLA DICKHEADS- I FKING HATE IT"
Negative,Constant problems w WIN 11 and controller not being recognized.  DS4Windows helped occasionally but randomly malfunctioned.
Negative,Bring Back Servers
Negative,somehow made giant hammers unfun
Negative,Do not buy this POS game because after losing the multiplayer function its ultimately worthless. The story alone without multiplayer is a hassle and the AI of the invaders dont provide a real challenge. the game may never have multiplayer back from the looks of things and honestly the fact i cant get a refund after they took away the one fun aspect of the game is sad and honestly unfair. Truly this game is straight up doo doo now.
Negative,this really speaks for itself :(((
Negative,"ignore my hours played i have over 100 on ps4.better on console, i'd actually recommend on console its rubbish on pc missing features and missing bare minimum optimisations that come with the most basic console to pc ports, unless you desperately need mods which would also put you at risk of being banned."
Negative,"I was excited to play this game with my buddy and experience a darksouls game but alas there are so many cheaters now in this game coming in and killing us that it is impossible for us to play together.  Ruined the experience.  Fix this and I may come back.  Don't bother getting this game if you are in for the coop play.  If you are a cheater, come on in!  Seems pretty easy to mess up other peoples day."
Negative,"Would have been a great game, however the input controls are the worst I have ever seen. Customizing your in game controls for computer isn't achievable without downloading extra annoying ads. Having to hit W + right click at the same time, for a simple kick, can be an easy death if it's not performed simultaneously and perfectly each and every time. Fuck this game."
Negative,"I bought this a long time ago on sale in a bundle with Dark Souls 2, not knowing these were originally console games. I played Dark Souls 2 for awhile, until the grind just got too ridiculous. Dark Souls 3 has not shown that it will be anything different. The game does not transition well to keyboard/mouse controls and the instructions they give even still list the controller buttons to push, instead of keys. The camera controls and views make the game even more difficult. DS2 started with some kind of story/beginning. DS3 just throws you right into the mix with a  few mobs and then a boss fight that does not feel like it belongs at the beginning of a game. I am sure that just like in DS2, I could look up a pattern that would enable me to beat this boss, but I don't really want to just memorize patterns to beat mobs/bosses. This is a large part of what turned me off of DS2. If this is what you are looking for in a game, you may like DS3, but I would recommend using a controller and not a keyboard/mouse."
Negative,"Dont buy it at 60, as the dlc is basically a requirement, only buy on sale, like 50% minimumAmazing game dont get me wrong, but should be cheaper by now."
Negative,"poor graphics settingsEDIT:563 hours played,still poor graphics settings options"
Negative,"Waste of money, the fight system is so bad.."
Negative,So disappointed with Bandai
Negative,i died in pvp and lost all of my souls now i cant beat the game anymore
Negative,It is difficult and I was expecting it. But it is difficult not only in itself but because it is a low quality pc port of a console game that was never intended to be played with keyboard and mouse. No thougth was given on pc players. And focus on enemy mode is plain stupid: you can not evade / side jump while focusing. If you try you'll end up in the arms/jaws/claws of your enemy. I keep on wondering why. Menu is also hard to navigate with keyboard & mouse. ESC key rarely does in the menu what is supposed to do.
Negative,"who the fuck put to kick in this game? if you gonna put it at least give it  a different key for perform not put same button with weapon attack, delivers almost no damage, no stun effect, wastes same stamina and makes you die to very common monsters like an idiot"
Negative,Excellent game design. Horrible emotional palette.
Negative,Its an epic gamer game. Only the most epic gamer's will complete this epic game!
Negative,SUCC :D it's a fun game
Negative,Hackers invaded and put invalid items in my inventory.
Negative,get booted off line constantly and camera control is shit makes it not fun when you can't see much.head blocking view quite a bit too cause camera moves wildly when jumping and swinging
Negative,what a shit fucking game dont risk your mental well being.
Negative,"Welcome to Dark Souls. Gray fog. Dragons. The undead. A flame, a flame. Dark Souls. Can you live through the undead? Through the dragons? Through the gray fog? Will you get the power to live, to survive the undead? In Dark Souls. Dark, Dark Souls."
Negative,If you plan to play this with a friend don't because Co op take so much time to set up and doesn't always work and then after all that you just to get killed by an asshole smurf who joins your game and wipes the floor and there is no way to stop it.
Negative,"5/10Cons:- Some bosses and mobs are trivial and for some game forces you to cheese. This is a sign of unbalanced and poor designed game.- Camera and target lock. Its just confusing and making me wanna puke.- Hitboxes are ridiculous.- Enjoy unskippable intros at the game launch? Then you will like watching those every time you quit the game. Not enough? How about waiting to connect to servers every launch because game is ""online by default"".- There are a lot of locations with a lack of textures, transparent spots etc...- Even with a region lock and decent WLAN connection i am unable to fight online opponents. There is just such a huge lag.- It's highly overpriced for a game of such quality.- You probably already heard of cheaters and bans.Pros:- Some locations are beatiful. Also pleased to see DS1 locations.- Level design is cool."
Negative,"The mathematics: Dark Souls 1 is as great as Dark Souls 3 is terrible. Truly, I wish I could like it. Dark Souls 1 is masterpiece, my favorite game of all time. Dark Souls 3 is a piece of trash with failures so voluminous that I could probably write a book on it. One of the most disappointing games ever.(Too many hours played on PS4, won't run on my PC)"
Negative,"the game looked good, but its not supported the keyboard, if they fix it, ill buy it again"
Negative,I'm glad darksouls is here to gather all the autistic hacker kids in one place and keep them out of all the other games.
Negative,"Bandai just blocked family sharing, so get banned for no fault of your own and be condemned to play offline forever."
Negative,"Waste of money when compared to the two previous games in the series. Very poorly balanced (heavy warriors will suffer much more difficulties than mages, archers or light warriors), short and buggy. Better buy Nioh or return to DS 1 or 2 which are soooo much better."
Negative,"""Preparing to launch Dark Souls III""Is all that I see when I try to launch the game even after a reinstall.As much as I want to recommend this title in the souls series I can't in good conscious advise anybody to download a title that doesn't work anymore.This is coming from a guy who had once killed Midir with a club and no armor just to see if I could and was a nightmare boss fight as a covenant member to the church in the ringed city dlc."
Negative,"Finished Elden Ring then went back to this (which I had stopped years ago).DS3 is way too easy, the map designs are awful, the ""exploration"" is based on wall-hidden areas, hidden elevator levers and double-layered elevators.There's absolutely no reason to play this game if you have Elden Ring. It's a bootleg Elden Ring, extremely restrictive and also much easier."
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 is good if you intend to make one character and just get to the end with a very powerful computer, not caring about quests, PvP, or item collection.If you want to complete quests, you need to outright cheat using the wiki, because several questlines have completely unknowable triggers to end them, and completing quests is mandatory for some of the best items in the game.If you want to play PvP, you'd better not be a fan of large weapons, because Poise is an almost completely superficial stat now. Every single hit guarantees a second follow-up, parrying is easier than ever with the .5 weight Ceastus, and the penalty for being parried ever is instant death, courtesy of a particular element-infused dagger and a ring which boosts ""critical"" hits. Though if you're willing to risk it, you can always spam R1 with a scythe, which seems to get 4 free hits instead of 2.If you intend to make multiple characters, you'd better be prepared to retrieve every single item in the game over again, as there is no communal weapon system. Granted, people artificially use high-level items at low levels for an unfair advantage, but that only means that an internal system which allows sharing between characters, but forces weapons to scale would be even better for the series.The PvE is still solid Dark Souls, complete with cryptic lore and grim chuckles, so the only barrier to that now that Remastered will siphon away invaders will be the terrible optimization. As I said before, you need an incredible computer to play this game adequately, and even then, it has occasional crashing.Even before it was outdated, Dark Souls 3 is only worth getting on sale."

I will still play threw it I got it on Humble Bundle but I doubt much will change.4 hrs in and im pretty sure dodging is the main mechanic in the game.So far the story looks very appealing but immersion is broken by the fact there are so many bonefire with coiled swords in them you just teleport too. Game mechanics at 60 fps still feel very clunky the camera also does not feel smooth and there is plenty of input lag.Items are placed around were you must find a path to aquire that is usually out of place for anything else. The world looks nice.7 hrs in the combat feels barebones. The world still looks nice. The NPC's Enemy Neutral and Allied look and sound very good. The Story is intresting and doesnt seem to break itself.Combat consists of Mostly Dodgeing somtimes hitting rare blocking and I have never found a reason so far to heavy attack, Items are used to convience. Plenty of dead ends and maze style maps.10 hrs in I can tell its a pretty decent game. Its more a puzzle memory game then it is a fighting game. It has a very good atmosphere and story. NPC's are done very well too. Voice acting is also good. Controller Button prompts should not appear tho since Im using a keyboard and mouse.Input lag while it seems to be a feature should be refined in a later installment and removed.

Negative,"Following my brethren and sisters on this, changing my review to negative since they don't care about this game anymore. Fix the servers."
Negative,This game sucks its too hard
Negative,"Dark souls 1 is my favorite game of all time, and dark souls 2 was a disapointing mess. This sequel is no better to be honest. My main gripes about the game could have been easily avoided in the development process.Let's start shall we?  No mother fucking poise. If you are a seasoned dark souls veteran you know the importance of thsis stat, it's a giant part of armor selection and pvp in general. So why take it out? Why change the combat system so drasticaly that I can barley even recognize it as the souls game it is? It may look like the same combat system as dark souls 1 from an outside perspective but if you actually PLAY the game it feels like a completley different game, becuase it is. Spells now rely on a mar instead of limited casts now, which encourages spam and cheap pelting spells vs well timed punishes, there is no such thing a rolling catagories now, its all 1 speed (witht the exception of fat rolling of course). Certain weapons are now downrite worse than others instead of the rule of dark souls 1 : if the weapon does not clearly suck then it is more than capable of carrying you trhpugh the game. Straight swords arebasically the new curved swords and curved swords are now mostly extict. I've NEVER seen a spear used except for the partizan one time but that was only becuase he was doing a cosplay, greatswords/great clubs now 2-3 shot literally ANYONE even in full armor, magic is dead except for like, 10 spells that you just spam and hope to hit with. Fucking forget about using axes since they are statistically worse straight swords. Maces suck dick and whips are downright useless. Anything else i missed are not even worth speaking about. PVP is a go damn mess, there are 3-4 PVP builds that can actually work in invasions and if the host and his fucking army of phantoms are using any of the 3 you're dead as dicks anyway. Ganking is literaly free souls ( for some reason invasions give basically no souls now as well so say goodbyw to that) and invasions in general are just cheese fests with the ocasion brave soul/newbie who doesn't use a op build. The weapon you get from one of the most bullshit bosses in the game (he's insanley hard but for a shitload of bad reasons) is downrite op. *sigh* This whole game in general is just a massive disapointment. They can't even fix then poise issue either. If they did PVP would break. Certain actions have really weird queueing problems. Blocking for one. You block a big hit from a boss and tried to roll before getting hit? Well good for you becuase right after the block stun ends you'll roll aand get butt fucked by whatever the bosses follow up is. Also every fucking boss in this game has ridiculous combos and chain stuns that simoultaniously make me want to puke and cry. Some bosses have weird rng attacks  that if they pop up, will detroy you for no reason. If wolnir decides to vomit mist at you after yuo got close and hit him you're guarnanted at least haf your health. If Consumed King decides he want to do his no wind up random charge attack in the middle of a swing then you're fucing dead. Some bosses are a god damn pinwheel level joke while others are insanely hard for no good reason. Some bosses can fart and half your summons die and you get nuked for 900 damage while others can smash you with a 4 hit combo and you don't even hav to heal. There are enemies that do an abslute fuck load of damage even if you come back at the end of the game with a levl 95 full armor PVE character.Oh yeah, did i mention armor does jack shit this go round? It's better to just go fashion souls from level 15 up than to wear actually ""good armor"" . Don't bother leveling carry weight since as long as you're under 70 you don't fat roll and as i menioned there is no light roll worth mentioning. Dont bother trying to learn parrying becuase it's useless in pve except vs the first boss and (minor spoiler) his second hidden fight later. Backstabs are sill op in pve and in 127 hours i've seen 2 in pvp, both lagstabs in a gank. Charge attacks from Bloodborne are here and boy a oh fucking boy are they op. All in all the only good things are: the music is neat and the story is alright (although there's still an absoulte SHOTLOAD they still need to explain .The one and only amazing thig about his game gestures. There are 33 and it's a totall joy to help an npc and get one in return. BUT! t]The PVP is a mess the PVE is often annoying and only slightly more intersting than DS2. It's not a terrible game, it's ok at it's core, but if you enjoyed DS1 as much as i did, there is only disapointment and shame ahead friend. Yet if you are a true Dark Souls fan, nothing i say can deter you. So go ahead, add this to your collection, and weep when you do. LONG MAY THE SUN SHINE!TL;DR It's a shadow of Dark Sousl 1 and a crying shame that it ended up so badly."
Negative,Requires connection to Steam servers at all times. Went down randomly during a boss fight and got kicked in single player.
Negative,i have the lowest possible sens and i still spin like crazy? can i get some help to fix it?
Negative,grand archives gave me cancer
Negative,"if this is ur first dark souls game then go ahead buy it! its worth it. if ur familiar with ds2 this is simply dark souls 2 with a new storyline. nothing else new is added. co-op system sucks, this still is completely a solo game."
Negative,"Great game, terrible port, as always.Every souls game to date has had major issues on PC, and they've shown time and time again just how little they care about this platform.This is the last FromSoftware/Bandai Namco game I'll buy; though I'm sure they don't care, they already have my money."
Negative,"I want to love this game. I really do.WHY WONT U LET ME LOVE YOUI know my computer is not of the best performance, therefore I've checked the minimum system requirements for this game a dozen times. My computer passed the minimum and then some, but it was too good to be true.For the game's current state, these are definitely not the minimum system requirements.So on top of the very long loading screens, me being on the lowest graphics possible and the lowest resolution still kicks me out of online sessions due to very low framerate.I wish I could even play on offline mode but the framerate is unbareable. Not to mention the screen flickering, the freezes and the various crashes.I want this to change, so that I could write a good review like this game deserves.Please fix the performance issues."
Negative,Meh. Not my cup of tea. Got it for $12 from HumbleBundle monthly...
Negative,"The Souls games are pretty awesome, and this one is by no means bad, but it's just not as interesting. The story is much more straightforward, and without that mystery it isn't really all that good. I'm way above minimum specs, but after about 30 minutes of playing the framerate drops to unplayable levels, and every time this happens I get booted offline and have to relaunch the game to reconnect. Changing settings does absolutely nothing, I can't even see a difference. If it weren't for these technical issues I would at least finish the game, boring though it may be, but as it is I can't see myself finishing this one."
Negative,"Worst pc port and optimized game ever. Even though they are so called AAA game , they are worst then indie devs and heres why:- A game that needs controller does not support ps4 controller.- Displays funny xbox icons when you are actually using keyboard and mouse.- Can hardly perform all the moves using K/M.- Poorly optimized, even though it looks like 2 year old games, lmao Lords of the fallen runs and looks better.- Constant crashes.- Cannot connect to server problem.- Fanbois are blind and most likely disagree with anyone critisizing the game.Bloodborne is way better cause it looks way better and the wepons are awesome. DS3 is more like Dark Souls 2.5"
Negative,"I have played all three DS games and this out of the trilogy was by far the worst in terms of PvP, Invasions, and PvE.PvP - Is unbalanced and extremely dull with the only factor being how well you can press R1 and the Occasional Weapon Art.PvE - Slow and Repetive, at least when you ng+ in others games they added new and different enemies. In this they just scaled the health up. Sick Gameplay.Invasions - 100% awful with no real substance, there has been countless youtubers run away from DS because how terrible the invasion system was.Only pro in my eyes is the Tech.Tech - Nicer looking, better systems in term of soul lvl and not as bad as the soul memory from ds2.All in All the game is bad. 4/10 - Play for memes."
Negative,"Im going to start off saying I have a GTX580, but the specs are better than the min requiments cards.  The fps drops, the lags, just awful!  I have never had an issue and others are having the same issue with better GPUs"
Negative,"game is bad, go play bloodborne"
Negative,"Not for happy gamers. If you are looking for a game to relax you out of work and feeling cool with meaningful training time, then this game is ""trash"" by definition."
Negative,"So I came back to the game after about a year and it deleted my saved character, kinda pissed off about it so imma just quit the game permanently."
Negative,"Easiest in the series, with the worst pvp scene.The legend died with this iteration."
Negative,Couldn't make it past the Online Service User Agreement.  Too hardcore.
Negative,"I went back and played throught Dark souls 1 and 2. After that i came back and played throught this one. This game compared to its pretesesors is pretty bad. it is also much much more linear compared to Dark Souls 1 and 2, and Demon Souls. Bloodborne is just like Dark Souls 3 that it too is very Linear. The lore in this title creates more plot holes than it does fill them, expesially with the Ashes of Aredial DLC. There are things that this game needs to adress; example 1 the UI interface. The first two games it was perfect in this one they took a step backwards, i wont go into detail on this one because i have other thoughts that need to be adresses.  I'm breaking this up into 2 smaller sections after this sentece is finished. This game relies too much on nostaliga. It makes refrences to Demon Souls and Dark Souls 1 and 2. especially Dark souls 1. They recycled most of Anor Londo, and the Fire Link Shrine. They reused gimiky boss fights againts a gaint (Yorm), Dragons breathiong fire off of brigdes, and the most overatted chatacters of all, Sif, Artorious, and Solair, there all recycled, Solair- his armor set is in the game and people do endless cosplay, Sif- AOA (Ashes of Arendiel) DLC is a poor boss fight, and Artorious his Armor and wepon is in the game, and in the AOA dlc after the Sif RIP OFF boss fight, there is a grave stone that resebles Artorious's graveston ein Dark Souls 1. I can't forget the lady in black refrence in the Unteded Graves (she has the fire keeper eyes). In the AOA DLC the Millwood knight refrences the Abyss Dragon AKA Kalameet. If you have played the Old Hunters for Bloodborne you would know Lady Maria, now look at the AOA final boss it it a very similair boss: both female, similair moveset, 3 differnt phases with their own very uniquefatures to their own fight. The PVP is just thrash in this game ( I BELIVE THAT FROM DOES NOT EVEN PLAY THERE OWN GAME, THEY TOOK THE VALVE APPROACH TO MAINTAIN THERE GAME(S), sorry valve i didn't meen to throw you under the bus). Dak souls 1 had a srtong pvp system with a variety of weapons with various weapons to choose from, any build either serious or silly was vaible. Dark Souls 2 any build you wanted you could make and use, it also had the most diversity among weapons, and power stancing (yes please bring this back please) and dual headed weapons ( those were a blst to use). Dark Souls 3, either Strength, Dex, Luck, Quality, Troll builds,  Faith/Intelegence builds ( this includes miracles, Prymancies, Dark Pyromancies, and sorceries). The weapons to choose from are also very limited ( the meta weapons) and majority of the other weapons go unused or untouched. Those are the only builds and weapons at that are available at the moment. This is a hughe downgade. WHY FROM SOFT WHY. It just gets very boring after some time. . . fighting the same builds over and over again.This was supposed to be the final game in the series ( personally i don't belive that this is the final game), but they let the community down. This game was/is a triple A gmae and some people just feel let down on this. i hope you spend more than a year on these things, please don't turn into a yearly COD release for your fans. releasing half finished games it will not be a happy ending.  ( This was written on 11/20/16, After the AOA DLC droped)"
Negative,"I get that it’s a beloved game prized for it's difficulty, but there's difficulty and then there's bad game design that a lot of people mistake for proper difficulty.For example: Enemies having a lot of health, doing a lot of damage, and being difficult to dodge. That’s difficulty.On the other hand:-Getting stuck in a 3 second animation when throwing a firebomb in which your guy takes two steps forwards and then slowly throws it, is bad game design.-Your camera doing a random, slow, uncontrollable 180/360/720 degree spin mid combat in 40% if the fights, is bad game design.-The development team not bothering to dub the control info into keyboard, is bad game design.-Having a spell that destroys armor that doesn't destroy armor, is bad game design.-One of your NPC's dying at a certain point in the game without reason or warning and therefore canceling the spawning of another NPC that therefore eliminates any chance of getting their items until new game+, is bad game design.-People taking damage when they get hit by a fireball but not taking damage when they roll head-first through a fireball, is bad game design.-Spears hitting you through walls, Evangelists bashing you through walls, Serpent-Man biting you through walls, Burning Stake Witches shooting you through walls, Giant Man Serpents with chain axes hitting you through two walls and a ceiling, and dogs jumping in and out of walls, is bad game design.-Blocking lava with a shield, whether it’s a lava pit or lava that you threw at an enemies feet, is bad game design.-An invader being able to make a new character, go into the starting zone with transferred items and one-shot you, is bad game design.-Killing a special enemy on top of a mountain, getting his weapons but having his armor set then spawn on a random, naked corpse on the other side of the world just so the player would have a tougher time getting it, is straight up pathetic.-Getting surrounded and stunlocked to death by a group of rats without the ability to roll over them, is bad game design.-Not being able to roll over a player that is lying down on the floor, is bad game design.-Having “W+Left mouse” as the kick shortcut, is bad game design.-Q, is bad game design.-Spells flying at the enemy on the far left instead of the enemy in the middle of your screen that you are aiming at, is bad game design.-Your spells and bows not being able to aim up or down, is bad game design.-You not being able to look straight up or down, is bad game design.-The player having to go into the roaming folder to manually adjust the resolution because the game doesn't support half of them, is bad game design.-The game not saving to steam cloud, is bad game design.-Having: Shields, Bows, Crossbows ,Whips, Throwables, 90% of all magic, Dragon form, etc not viable in open field PvP compared to generic melee weapons, is bad game design.-Having the “Similar face” option in customization autosave over your current face despite you hitting the “Back” button, is bad game design.-Having parrying not initiate when you parry, and instead initiate when you raise your shield half a second before the animation, is bad game design.-People being completely invincible when backstabbing and riposting, is bad game design.-Having a bugged ring that gives you infinite stamina and never patching it, is bad game design.-Pyromancies not igniting explosive barrels with AoE's, is bad game design.-Having the ability to disguise yourself as a special spirit that can turn on people at any point in time, WHILE SPORTING A SPECIAL WARNING COLOR SO EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU COULD BETRAY THEM, is bad game design.-Bosses with grab moves teleporting you 5 meters into their hand, is bad game design.-People being able to parry someone by turning around and parrying the air, is bad game design.-Implementing a mechanic that makes the players weapon recoil off the wall while allowing every oversized enemy to ignore that very mechanic, is bad game design. -People being able to purposely lower their internet speed and use it as an advantage, is bad game design.-Not having the ability to thrust with most swords and instead having them recoil of a wall because you can only swing them, is bad game design.-Having enemies do 200 points of damage with: kunai, throwing knives, throwable spears, etc, while the player only ever does 20, is bad game design.-Players being invincible during rolling and therefore not using it to roll away and instead using it to clip through everything thrown at them, is bad game design.-Having the world lore not be explained to the player, is NOT bad game design.-Having the player telekinetically examine every single piece of equipment, item and weapon for a short description that explains the world lore, is bad game design.-Having pillars in the Dancer boss fight so that players can take cover only for her to clip her hand through the wall and hit them, is bad game design.-Being invincible while opening doors, is bad game design.-The fact that I was able to list most of the Dark Souls content as bad game design, is bad game design.Frankly, if it wasn't for the aesthetics and the fact that it’s a PvP game I doubt it would be considered ¼ as good."
Negative,Probably some of the worst enemy design decisions of all time
Negative,"The gameplay is fine but the fact that you don't have anything to play co-ops with no invades ""Without a chance of getting banned if you use the mod"" is kinda lame for such a great game, I wish they would take the time to just change that one thing about it.."
Negative,"I genuinely do not understand why this game is so positively reviewed by so many people. It's a nightmare to play it without a controller, and unfortunately I don't have one. The UI and gameplay are disgusting and it's nothing else than a lazy job from the developers."
Negative,"I think it takes a certain kind of gamer to like this game.  I think the game may be a great game and perhaps I am just not the kind of gamer that can enjoy such as this.It's possible.Anyways from my perspective the game is very difficult to control.  Perhaps it was easier on a console but on my mouse and keyboard, being unable to get passed the tutorial after hours of play over a couple of days means I am not on this game's level.I'm not even going to ask for a refund.  I'm just going to suck it up and say to Steam and the devs of the game...good job...you got me...I'm not this leet."
Negative,"The co-op experience is simply bad due to various connection issues. You have to unwillingly deal with other hardcore players which can be frustrating even without the lag issue that is messing up the battle experience. This is 2019 and the grapics quality just doesn't deserve a thumb up any more. And it seems that the producer is not even trying. There is no instructions for keyboard and mouse players. Plainly remembering every single enemy's position and attacking pattern is not fun, instead it is mind numbing. You don't make good games by making it hard in such a straight way. The player is provided a very limited pool of options with a very repeative battling mode. The actions of all the skills and moves are slow with a mediocre performance. I am so surprised that the producer can get such good reviews by making a million players die a billion times with these simple game designs. The reward system is also chaotic and broken. No element in this game is fun enough to keep a player exploring the world all by oneself to obtain all the good/crucial upgrades. The plot is also not significant and the cut scenes are just not interesting enough for me to watch through. Overall this game isn't as good as its fame."
Negative,"Foreword: There will be marked spoilers ahead.This game is terrible.I was hoping that after five games, we would be receiving an omnipotent super-game that would easily blow every Souls game before it out of the water with the amalgamation of all of them melded into one perfectly constructed gift from the heavens. What we received was a scrunched up ball of blatant, shameless pandering to the fanbase coupled with the cheapest enemies that the franchise has ever seen, bosses that have zero creativity, a recycling of its own areas and basic enemies that are capable of annihilating you even if you’re overprepared thanks to their zero wind-up attacks, unlimited stamina and absurdly high damage.I'm going to quickly cover the very few good points that this game has before I tear it apart. To begin with, the Focus Points system, mechanically identical to an MP bar which hasn't been used in the series since Demon’s Souls, is no longer completely useless for melee characters thanks to the new Skills system. These Skills consume your FP to use some kind of special ability. As an example, the Club gets one that grants it a damage boost and the Longsword gets a sideways slash that bats away shields. Focus Points can also be replenished using the Ashen Estus Flask which upgrades alongside your regular Estus Flask and you may divide the maximum charges between them at the blacksmith. It’s a clever mechanic that allows melee-only characters to take advantage of their formerly useless MP bar.NPC questlines are worth seeing at least once, in my opinion. A handful of them will even move around the game world instead of all just ending up in one spot without some kind of conclusion to their own personal journeys, a common complaint about Dark Souls 2.Lastly, after four whole games, they finally implemented a way to hand over multiple covenant items at once. Hallelujah. You can also now swap your devotion between each covenant through your inventory.Unfortunately, that’s about it for the good stuff. It’s actually quite an outstanding game in the first few hours, but it begins to fall apart very early, at Road of Sacrifices.As soon as you enter this area, you are greeted by a large swamp littered with enemies and some areas of this swamp slow you to a crawl. This is nothing we’re not used to, but this doesn't mean it was a good idea in the previous games, either.Even knowing that traversing the swamp is much faster if I equip a weapon that has the Quickstep skill and use that to speed through the parts of the swamp that I'm otherwise forced to slowly walk or fat roll through, this doesn't change the fact that there are enemies everywhere that can all move at normal speed, so the end result is a desperate slow walk to dry land so you can hope to kill the horde that will have followed you. Also, if you’re playing online, you'll have the Watchdogs of Farron player invaders akin to the Forest Hunters in Dark Souls to worry about, as well.Once you’re past all of that for the first time, you get to do it again in Farron Keep. The swamp slowing your movement speed was tolerable, but the fun drops way down into the negative numbers when the swamp is about three times larger, poisonous, you’re forced to locate three shrines and extinguish the fires on each of them and the new enemies here get a weapon that launches about twelve homing projectiles at you. This is about the point where I started eating my controller, the taste of which wasn’t improved when I found out that there was no Rusted Iron Ring.This was not made any better after I hit Irithyll Dungeon, at which point I was introduced to the worst enemy in Souls and possibly video game history: the Jailer. This enemy has the ability to drain your maximum health all the way down to 1HP if you’re standing near him and he has a soldering iron that he will instantly poke you with to ruin your movement speed thanks to a debuff, then quickly perform a grab attack that WILL strip about 1,500 health off of you. There are also eight of them patrolling around a room near the end of the level. This entire area infuriated me so much that I defied my own usual rules with these kinds of games and rushed the rest of the game because I just wanted it to be over.There are also the dogs in this game, which WILL kill you repeatedly because there’s no defending against them. Try to swing and they'll read your inputs and dodge away, try to block and they'll bounce too far off your shield for you to hit them, try to run away and they'll nibble on your ankle the moment you slow down to heal. If there are two of them on you, you might as well put your controller down because you won’t win. Swinging blindly hoping that you'll tag them is seriously your best bet.Most of the bosses, final boss included, are more of a spectacle or something for fans to beat themselves off with using the game’s lore that was hastily stapled onto it for fan service than a genuine challenge on a level playing field. Once I was finally able to kill most of them, my initial reaction was a sigh of relief at the fact that I didn't have to slog through it again rather than what should have been a respectful salute to the worthy adversary that I’d just defeated. For the most part, they’re predictable like clockwork, stunlock-happy and deal way too much damage.Fanbase pandering  is absolutely everywhere in this game and it’s worse than it’s ever been. I can’t possibly go over them all with the 8,000 character limit, but as a few examples: When you first run into this game’s hub world, Andre makes his return from Dark Souls as your blacksmith. There’s no reason for this, he’s just there. Later in the game, you will return to a frozen version of Anor Londo and there are chests dotted around the area that contain equipment that’s all ripped right from Dark Souls. They’re not even boss soul items or picked up through a questline or anything, they’re just in chests for you to find.In closing: This game is actually so bad that after I finished it for the first time, not only did I fully reverse my initial idea that my first playthrough of Dark Souls 3 was simply the exploratory phase and I don’t yet have the first hand experience or knowledge to consistently overcome it, but I revised my initial thoughts on whether I was actually having fun with all of these games, or simply tolerating them so I could squeeze whatever little bits of enjoyment that I could get out of them. If there’s some aspect of this game that I'm simply not seeing that pushes it to the glowing 9/10 scores that everybody else are giving it, then that’s great. I would love to be proven wrong and actually begin to enjoy it again.This review was written before any of the DLC came out, so if the Rusted Iron Ring makes a return and updates make it so the enemies that don’t have wind-up on their attacks are given some, the enemies that can attack you relentlessly are given a limit on their stamina and the damage you receive is toned down to more reasonable levels, then that would fix every major problem that I have with this game and I would happily change this to a recommendation. Until then, avoid this game.DLC UPDATE:Both DLCs consist almost entirely of enemies and bosses that have their stats bumped up to absurd levels, bosses that are either endurance tests or ganks, the latter of which is including one that calls back to the much better-executed Old Monk from Demon's Souls, one more recycled Patches questline and the best reason there is to go through any of it is to play around with the new and almost entirely useless flashy weapons and spells, then get bored after a few minutes. If DS3 is anything less than your favourite game ever, don't buy them."
Negative,bad PC port
Negative,Spend your whole time Jumping around rolling. Really not that fun. All controller support not worth buying if PC player.
Negative,Severe micro stuttering and frame dips and freezes.  Needs a good patch to fix this one.  until then this remains Negative.
Negative,"Written with the assmption the reader is familiar with gneral Soulslike game play.It's alright. I'd give it a 65/100 overall all things considered, because it has some decent stuff, but a lot of awful. It is the same old rubbish, but addictive to play. Story is pretty average and again takes exploration and item reading to get more details etc. Online has some improvements with password matching to allow friends to play together. Twinks are dead now they get matched together not with less geared players. Combat is the same other than poise is dead and there is a stupid automatic 2 hit stun system in place, pvp has devolved into the same 1-2 weapons and builds over and over. Enemies frequently have shitty movesets that are jsut endless spamming with infinite stamina. They are ""smarter"" so backstabs are harder. They jsut turn around on the spot faster basically. Parries are mostly dead due to the spammy attacks of many mobs. Fashion souls rules as armour effectiveness is mostly normalised.Terrible issues with ingame bugs, arent being fixed, were known about before western release as shown by the sudden increase in ""recommended specs"" to play the game. Fromsoft dont give a fvck, they put out a product that has the capacity to be a total potato, work arounds were found by players, but lower the game experience. Fromsoft's solution: ""buy a better computer and you MIGHT be fine"".Currently massive problems with false flagging for softbans, range of reasons why this may be, again Fromsoft and Bamco dont give a fvck as demonstrated by their being no resolution method  in place other than using Steam Family Share (that is literally their solution). Developers have claimed they reviewing the bans on a case by case basis and will resolve false flags. So far no reports of people seeing any action.I would say avoid this game unless you are intent on playing it, it wont rock your world or anything like that, it can be fun if you accept the bugs and crashes and are prepared before hand. If ytou must own it, maybe give it another month and see if the makers actually do something to fix the issues, or jsut wait for a steam sale...a big one."
Negative,Not a fun game if you just want casual play with your friends...
Negative,I hate this game but my friends keep making me play it
Negative,"Honestly, the game is just really boring. 80% of enemies are fodder that die in two hits and will never ever challenge you (unless they gang up on you). 80% of bosses are absolute jokes and can be killed on your first attempt. The Lords of Cinder are extremely difficult though and will take anywhere from 15-30 attempts. Most of the ""difficulty"" of the game is artificial and just feels like padding, IF it's even difficult at all; as I said, most enemies are fodder and a lot of levels don't challenge you at all.You could condense this whole game down to a 3 hour experience fighting just the main bosses and it'd be far more enjoyable. Everything in between is just a waste of your time."
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 might be one of the easiest games I've played. From the straightforward combat to the predictable enemy patterns, there were very few challenges that posed a threat. The bosses? Simply a walk in the park. Overall, if you're looking for a game that requires minimal effort, Dark Souls 3 is the one for you.Great world tho.-Garry"
Negative,"I should preface this review by stating that I like Dark Souls 3 as a whole. What I dislike about Dark Souls 3 come largely down to story and mechanics, namely the massive system changes that occurred from Dark Souls 1 to Dark Souls 3 (and 2, though to a lesser degree).To begin with what I like, the level design is a stand-out, as is the art direction and general graphical effects of the game. In comparison to prior games, 3 definitely feels like the most pretty and most like Dark Souls 1 in terms of level design with sprawling maps that always seem to have a way back to your origin point. It is, overall, one of the best games released in its year. On what I dislike about the game,1. Changes to PVP and Health: In Dark Souls 1, you use Humanity at a Bonfire and become Human. This enables both PVP and Co-op in the world, and you can be invaded at random. There is no real mechanical bonus to being Human outside of turning on these mechanics and you can go the entire game without ever becoming Human.In Dark Souls 2, the whole system is muddied and frankly terrible. There's no distinction between ""Invasion On"" and ""Invasion Off,"" though the game prioritizes Human players to invade based on Soul Memory... It's a mess.In Dark Souls 3, Embering gives you bonus HP and turns on PVP. This means that in order to get access to additional HP beyond the amount granted by Vigor, you have to turn on PVP and risk being invaded at random. You are automatically Embered after every boss kill, meaning that you get bonus HP... But also run the risk of invasion. PVP would be okay if lag and other issues weren't present, but being forced into the system by design means that PVP players go up against unsuspecting PVE players and Embering is arguably more detrimental than beneficial, bar the health boost that can help with tackling later game zones. In a word, the whole system is awful and I can see why they abandoned it for Elden Ring.2. Firelink Shrine. In Dark Souls 1, Firelink Shrine was a sort of hub where you could go to get more uses of your Estus and it was functionally connected to everything. At the same time, you never really had to go back there other than for ease of access to certain zones.In Dark Souls 3, Firelink Shrine is now a necessity. You have to go there to level up. You have to go there to improve weapons. It's all hidden behind a loading screen, meaning slower systems will have to stare at lore on repeat throughout the entire game. The worst part by far is the repetitive dialogue any time you want to level-up. It was a problem in Dark Souls 2, Bloodborne and a problem here. Elden Ring wisely did away with this system (at least for leveling) and that's a far better system. Dark Souls 1 did it better with the Bonfire level up too. It's a problem that never goes away and just gets more annoying the more you play.3. Lore: Dark Souls 3 is too focused on being a sequel to Dark Souls 1 (not 2, it references it occasionally, but it borderline ignores it) where it feels that the focus is on the ramifications and results of the original game and not on the lore of the new one. Dark Souls 2 had this problem to what I would argue is a lesser degree, albeit it was a bit too heavy-handed. Dark Souls 3 just name-drops important characters from Dark Souls 1 and copy-and-pastes an area from the first game into the third. This is okay because that area is still cool, but it feels a bit... Tired. I would have preferred something new, something completely distinct from what we got.It feels like two games. One game is trying to have new lore, new experiences and new things while the other game is trying desperately hard to flash the words ""DARK SOULS 1 IS HERE"" in your face whenever it can.4. Ignoring Dark Souls 2's Cool Bits: Dark Souls 2 is a divisive entry, and for good reason. However, it had some neat ideas, particularly hyperstancing weapons. This basically meant that, with the right stats, you could wield two weapons of the same type and gain access to a new moveset. Dark Souls 3 cans this entirely and gives you paired weapons. While this does open up the ability to use a stat-improving shield, like the Grass Crest Shield, it removes the unique flavor of hyperstancing entirely. Covenants are also back, but I feel that they're a little bit tacked on and less important this time around. No more Arenas for the Blue Sentinels or the Invaders, no more Covenant of Champions to turn on hard mode. There's also no real rewards for a no-Bonfire run (which is impossible anyway due to the design of the game) or for never dying, both of which Dark Souls 2 had.Particularly disappointing is that NG+ in Dark Souls 3 does nothing but increase difficulty (and add higher level varaints of rings), whereas Dark Souls 2 revamped zones with new enemy placements new item drops and more. Dark Souls 2 felt like an entire new game in NG+5. The Bloodborne Effect: This one is a bit more mixed for me. This game clearly has some Bloodborne in it, which is good on one hand because Bloodborne is great. It's bad on another because it feels like they didn't go hard enough on making it Dark Souls and not Bloodborne. The speed of the game is increased, but Shields are back so you can be more passive. Armor doesn't matter as much because of lack of upgrades, and the Poise system being kind of terrible (only activates on swinging some weapons) means that there's less incentive to actually be a big tanky hero like in Dark Souls 1. The lack of a Rally system (damage enemies to replenish recently lost HP) also means that being in close is punished. It's a bit confused as to what it wants to be, in this regard. Workable, as I've beat the game several times, but it feels unrefined. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------In closing - Dark Souls 3 is a sequel to Dark Souls 1. It's not bad, but it's not hitting the same highs as Dark Souls 1, Bloodborne or Elden Ring for me. Bear in mind that, with all of the things I dislike, none of the Dark Souls games are truly awful and all of them are incredible purchases, well worth your time. I just so happen to dislike Dark Souls 3 the most of them all. Granted, most everyone has already bought this game, so this hardly matters anyway."
Negative,They didn't even bother to change keys when porting from console.
Negative,The input delay and action queueing is crazy stupid.
Negative,Not a good coop game.
Negative,It's the exact same game as the last two with the exact same problems: It's a terrible console port that insists you use a controller.
Negative,This game is DOGSUIT
Negative,"This game has a love-hate relationship with me. I nearly beat this game on Xbox One, and later bought the game on PC at one point.The game has a lot of improvements on the formula: allowing heavier builds to still be viable for rolling, making magic regenerative in some ways, etc. However, this game has issues, and one of them I unfortunately have to blame on Bloodborne.Because Miyazaki wanted players to play more aggressively, shields might as well be useless as every enemy has at least one way of breaking your guard or damaging you through your shield. This in turn basically forces a playstyle on the player rather than allowing them to experiment. This forced playstyle is also damaged as HEAVY builds don't work like DS1 and lose their original viability, where players used to tank damage trades rather than being staggered. The DLC content also took a hit, having less obvious connection to the story of the base game and recycling bosses in a way that feels like DS2's lazy design.To make things worse, there's the anti-cheat, which has been so poorly implemented that it has ignored actual cheaters and has hurt normal players for having encountered cheaters.The only thing I can say beyond this is that the team behind the Demon's Souls Remake seem to have identified a lot of the issues with the Soulsborne series while at the same time ignoring things that made the series and Demon's good in the first place, as the combat has returned to DeS's system, character creation has greatly improved, but the visual design of areas has fallen flat and sound design falling short as well. I hope that these improvements stick with future Souls-like games out of FromSoftware and that SONY lessens their grip and allows for a PC port of DeS Remake."
Negative,"game gud, internet full of 'how to fix' guides.."
Negative,"Let me start off by saying that the PvE in this game was excellent.  It was a significant improvement over Dark Souls 2 and I enjoyed most of it.  My issue with the game comes from the fact that poise does not function as it did in either of the last two games.  This wasn't much of a problem in the PvE (except for the small enemy gank/spam fests that seem to occur, especially with rats) but it really hurts the PvP aspect of the game.  If you don't really care about PvP then you can stop reading here but if you do care about the PvP you might want to keep reading.I feel like a good 70% of my issues with PvP could be solved by making poise work like it did in Dark Souls 1 and 2 (though maybe to a greater/lesser extent depending on balancing).  My experience was that most people just spam R1 with things like Estoc or Dark Sword.  Bleed builds are also pretty annoying.  These two things in particular wouldn't be so bad if you could poise through it.  I primarily played on a quality build.  I tried to use several weapons but would default to the Profaned Greatsword a lot of the time for the hyper armor and because the 2H R1 can't be parried.A couple other things that didn't bother me too much but might bother others a lot:1) If you invade someone you almost always end up fighting 2 or more people2) Casters are harder to play as because the stat and gear investment is pretty high.  I don't see too many in PvP and I think it's because of one of those reasons."
Negative,"i have cried, screamed, and built up hatred towards myself while playing this game. I cannot stand the difficulty and ear raped many in a discord call whilst streaming. Lord save my soul from elden ring when i finish this game"
Negative,Great game. i got 100s of hours on PS4Lots of cheaters on pcBuy it for PS4
Negative,fuck this game
Negative,In my opinion it is a step down from previous entries.
Negative,No Cloud Save
Negative,"Game good. But since the devs are being a pain and removing the servers, i'll be a pain as well and leave a bad review. Bring back multiplayer if you want a better one."
Negative,"What with softbanning for no reason and poise not working, I cannot recommend this game as it is."
Negative,Another blatant copy of Elden Ring
Negative,"Props to anyone who can tolerate the PvP in this godforsaken piece of shit. Phantom hits, the piss poor latency that half of the afrikaan tribesmen use in this game and the horrific hitboxes ruin every duel. ""Buh, buh, buh, Beenus, just git gud."" I have, and I've used the broken hitboxes to my advantages and it's not even fun winning at that point. It feels dirty. If you're a huge fan of the souls series, you'll at least enjoy the PvE. PvP is beyond broken and should be removed completely."
Negative,"Honestly, this game sucks. I love Dark Souls. It's my favorite game, but this game should have been infinitely better. It's way worse than Dark Souls, and, I can honestly say, it's worse than Dark Souls 2. Personally, I love Dark Souls 2, but I understand the complaints. It doesn't feel like Dark Souls (1) at all. But... Dark Souls 3? What is it? Well, it's an atrocity. It's atrocious. Ironically, it's also the easiest game in the series. It feels like Bloodborne with a legit shield option, so... not Bloodborne. The game is more linear than Dark Souls 2, so a far-cry from the beautiful and nostalgic level design of Dark Souls. The game is grey. Everything is desaturated. It looks like a Zack Snyder movie with less style. Almost everything is a re-skin of something from an earlier game. The original stuff we get (aside from the Nameless King, even though his area is a discount version of the Dragon Aerie) is dumb: Vordt the fat metal deformed man from ice land (not Eleum Loyce), The Dancer (pretty fun fight actually), Lothric and Lorian... kinda boring. Gundyr is pretty cool, but he's just a different, quicker version of the Looking Glass Knight. The DLCs are a mess. Ariandel is consistently cool, nothing close to the Oolacile DLC or even one of the DLCs from DS2 (considering their size). BUT, the Ringed City... okay, it's cool. There's a lot of great stuff there; HOWEVER, no one on earth can convince me that the good ol' ""Halflight, Spear of the Church"" is in ANY way not the absolute worst thing in any Soulsborne game in existence. It SUCKS. Everytime I get to this boss, it's worse than the Bed of Chaos. It's the only boss in any of the games that actually forces me to quit out of the game and turn steam into offline mode, beat the boss in a few short moments, and then turn the game off again to switch steam back into online mode. I understand if someone had a good experience fighting a legit PvP fight for this boss, that's just great, but every time I enter the fog, I'm faced with an untouchable fat man wielding a tiny little poker to chip away at my health for two hours until all my estus is gone. The best part is that he gets to throw some shiny spears in the ground and heal... AS MANY TIMES AS HE WANTS... This fight completely ruined my experience fighting Gael. I never want to fight Gael anymore because I have to go through this guy. Just the memories of the wasted hours in that room make me want to skip Gael every time. Look, when Dark Souls 3 came out, I was one of the most excited people to play it. I actually opened the special edition box up right when it came in the mail and played it on my brother's PS4 long before he (who actually bought the game) got home from work. He wasn't too happy... I've tried to love this game. Heck, I've tried to like this game. But, after hours of returning to it, and constantly subconsciously critiquing it and comparing it to the previous two games and pointing out the infinite amount of things that should have been in the game, not been in the game, or just been better in general... I have concluded that Dark Souls 3, within the context of the Dark Souls series, is a terrible game.More Bad Things About Dark Souls 3:- PvP: it's either a gank fest lasting for 30+ minutes, a hacker that breaks your game and gets reported, a duel arena you really did not feel like doing, or you get lucky and kill a noob in a few minutes. DS3 also apparently hates invaders, so it gave them the absolute shortest straw imaginable.- PvE: R1, R1, R1, R1, R1, R1... oh, you want to be a sorcerer. Who cares!? Go play Dark Souls 2 you creep.- Armor sets: they no longer give special effects, one of the coolest things DS2 added. There's also only like four new cool looking sets. Everything else that is cool is cool because it's from DS1.- Dual wielding: it's a lie.- Hexes: Where are the hexes? I just wanted some hexes... :'(- Bosses: at least I remember the Covetous Demon because he was funny. I always seem to forget about the giant tree with gonads on his hands.- NPCs: ....I love the NPCs in Dark Souls. They are beautiful people, well, most of them. But, they are all memorable. You follow them through the game and can often determine their fate. There was a lot of this in DS2 as well. In 3? we get... Greirat... and Hawkwood... and some knight with a deep voice trying to keep some girl from losing her innocence... they're all short and disconnected. Greirat is not too disconnected, but the main problem is that everyone just teleports back to the game's hub for some wierd unexplained reason. it seems lazy. Anri's questline is fine. Anri and Horace, they are fine. But it's safe to say every quest line in the game should have been like Anri's. They were in the first game, and this is the third. Logically, it should be better. - Firelink: it sucks. It's just a hub you have to teleport back to because it's on a floaty mountain that is connected to nothing. It's like the dream place from Bloodborne. If I wanted a Bloodborne dream-hub place, I would play Bloodborne. Dark Souls is supposed to be connected by paths, like a Dark Souls game. You can literally beat DS2 without resting at a single bonfire... it's kinda sick. You hardly have to at all in Dark Souls. But DS3? Oh, you are FORCED to rest at the bonfire to get to the first area in the game. This is bad game design...These, and numerous other reasons are why I firmly believe Dark Souls 3 is awful. Thank you. Please go play the first game if you haven't. It's amazing. I wish the remaster actually finished Lost Izalith and left everything else exactly the same, aside from a few technical issues; then the world would legit have a PERFECT GAME."
Negative,"As of right now i must sadly say no. The game seems to run at a decent framerate, I do experience some skipping but not enough to really complain at all! The environments i have seen thusfar are very beautiful and make the game seem oh so very expansive. Sadly where I mark this review negative is the unpreparedness of both From software and Bandai Namco as to how they handled this release. The game has been on the eastern market almost a week now yet the game suffers from many simple bugs that should have by now already been dealt with for a worldwide release. Bandai's excuse is not to play the game early yet I am currently playing it on the expected date and time. Currently for me I cannot proceed at all thanks to a bug in which I cannot be killed yet my enemies cannot either; we simply phase through one another due a bug involving hitboxes staying where that enemy spawns. Uncircumventable I must wait until a patch has been done or refund the game. This was your baby From Software, and you aborted the HELL out of it. Hopefully when they fix this i can return and give it a much more proper review, but for now I am jsut disappointed."
Negative,Don't interact with other player you'll get a caution or ban
Negative,for some reason this game is broken unless you use controller. i cant get past the title card
Negative,There is nothing past NG+.The game is completely unfinished past the main game.The game is riddled with skiddies who will ban you.
Negative,why did i buy this
Negative,"Been playing this game for 5 hours solo, got a penalty for online (Never played online). Can't request a refund cause of the hours -.- So i do not recommend this game to anyone. Pile of shit."
Negative,Literally the worst controls of any game ever. I have played flash games with better controls
Negative,"Online gameplay with friends is more dead than me fighting dancerFix the remote code exploit or decrease the price of the game.If you're looking to play with friends, don't get it until they fix this issue, which I hope is soon. It's been 100 days FromSoft.Just found out that FromSoft has confirmed the servers are coming back. I still do not recommend you buy this game until it returns, and make sure the RCE is patched."
Negative,"This game is fun, though its difficult. The reason I can't recommend the game though is because of the completly unbalanced pvp. Starting off with just starting the game you will lose is pvp every time. EVERY TIME. Not a game that can be played with friends due to the balance issues. Its a shame the very community of dark souls ruins the experience for the players who are just starting out."
Negative,"They literally couldn't come up with anything new, so they decided ""hey all those guys who played dark souls, but never got the chance to play demon's souls, let's just make it like that""Essentially From went back on all their ideas and changes of Demon's Souls to Dark Souls. Mana? It's back. The main hub? It's the Nexus, tell me I'm wrong. The Fire Keeper? It is literally the Maiden in Black don't fucking tell me I'm wrong. Every game has shared the same themes, but this one just blatantly copies. Why can't you upgrade armor anymore? Were people actually happy about this change? That was one of the biggest issues with Demon's Souls, armor would fall off later on because it couldn't keep up with the damage values.I'd say hands down the worst part of this game is the enemy design. In the other games choreography was one of it's strongest points. Enemy telegraphed their moves, it was clear what was going to happen, it was down to the player to handle it. In this, literally every single enemy just negates this idea entirely because they just unleash a barrage of attacks without any warning whatsoever. It could be the fattest of all Smoughs, and he suddenly whips out two giant swords and spins about 30 times before stopping, all within a second. Nothing ever feels interesting or engaging because half the time I just know my opponent is going to spam some stupid crap that I'm just gonna have to dodge for a while. One of the worst feelings with this, was when I discovered the game favors offense to the absolute silliest degree. When I die time and time again to a single enemy, trying to devise all methods of strategies... When it turns out just normal attacking him over and over not only proved more efficient and effective, but safer. Combat becomes trivialized at the weirdest intervals. Nothing feels tactical anymore, just braindead. Obviously not all fights are like this, but a vast majority are solved just by attacking more and caring less.Speaking of they more a less removed any kind of tanking in this game. With armor not working well, and too many attacks to block with reasonable stamina, it's entirely Dodge Souls now. It's boring. I never felt like I was dodging because I wanted to play that way, it felt it was a requirement no matter what. It's uninteresting.Leveling felt awkward to say the least. Scaling of stats didn't seem nearly as important as putting all of it into health and stamina did. I'm not sure why they built it like this but once I got the necessary stats to equip my weapons of choice (whip and a dagger) I never once put another point into strength, dexterity, nor intelligence or faith. It just all went into my red and green bars.Covenants are... well they're fine. Nothing wrong with them. They don't feel as interactive as previous games but, at least my sunbros are still there. The mad men was an interesting idea, if a bit weak.Oh and if you thought the questlines in other games were hard to understand? These ones are just impossible. I only found out after I beat the game and looked it up that I failed like, over half of them without ever knowing it.I'm not sure why everyone raves about how awesome DaS 3 is. It feels entirely weaker to it's predecessors and felt like it was just trying to encapsulate Demon's Souls in some capacity instead. Was it all the Bloodbourne hype? Cause I never played that.Just go play the first game."
Negative,Poor camera tracking and response time takes the bite out of what is an impressive environmental telling of sword and sorcery combat.
Negative,"11.2 hours and i am depressed, anxious, lonely, scared to leave my house, afraid to open the game. Wish me luck"
Negative,Multiplayer servers are still garbage. So much hassle to get co-op to work.
Negative,Can anyone tell me why my game might keep minimizing whilst using my control? Makes the game even harder when it will randomly just minimize.
Negative,waah ludex gundyr too hard
Negative,This game is more optimized than Arkham Knight10/10 would optimize again
Negative,"runs terribly badmy pc can run any new game on max settings with good fps while ds3 runs with around 10fps no matter wether its on max or low settings. absolutely terrible and unplayablemy review will remain negative until this is changed and the game is playable, i've spent 3 hours of playtime to try and make it work properly but to no avail"
Negative,"I would of loved to play this game, I've played, completed, and enjoyed all other souls game since demon souls but i'm paying £40 on a broken game. I've had so many issues with it, crashing on joining other worlds, crashing on death, i'd probably crash if i breathed into my mic even if it wasn't plugged in."
Negative,"With zero poise in the game and no devs attempting to fix it claiming it is working as intended, it is just bloodborne 2 but on pc and xbox as well so there can be more people buying it. Loads of enemys stunlock the anti-cheat was horrid at first and made it so people that were not cheating were getting banned frequently and had to wait for the devs to finally fix it before they could play it again, some didnt play because of the fear of getting banned(i being one of the banned ones). it feels like i waisted the $80 for the preorder and i still regret not asking for a refund when i could especially when loads of the weapons do the same damage and twin weapons are extreamly annoying in pvp because they advertise bleed buff and L1/LB spam to new players. r.i.p. powerstance bby"
Negative,"Game crashes because it wont keep my graphics settings between sessions, account got flagged, account got banned. No cheats, just bad design."
Negative,This game has crashed more than fifty million bah-jillion times now...review will change once the crashing fixes
Negative,Crashes constantly on my GTX 760 making it basically unplayable.  Unless you have a 900 series card I would stay away from this game as you simply cannot play it
Negative,The game is good but the design choice to prevent players from pausing the game in OFFLINE mode deserves a thumbs down.
Negative,Do you want to have a good time? No? Then this is the game for you.
Negative,"The game would be great if it were not for the lagging. I have a high end computer and despite that, there is a constant stuttering in the game which ruins the whole experience. Fix this and I will give it thumbs up. It's shameful that a big game like this is ruined by such a thing"
Negative,"This game has no proper support for PC and unless one is used to play on consoles and don't expect game quality to be on pare with PC games, you won't be happy with this game!There is no way to deactivate console controls so you have to deal with wonky camera movements, feezes and lagging imput. I thought after all this time, at least some moders would have fixed these problems, but i was wrong. Either the engine can't be fixed, or people who enjoy the game don't see the advantages of playing with keyboard and mouse.Only buy the game, if you are comfortable with playing the game with a gamepad!!!"
Negative,"I don't know what to say except the combat isn't engaging, and in Dark Souls I don't think there can be any factor more important than the combat, at least, in my opinion. Now don't take this as me hating hard games, I absolutely love all types of games. Fighting games, one of the hardest genres (imo), is my favorite type of game. I really enjoyed Nioh 2 as well, and I even go for many collectibles when I play platformers even if they're extremely difficult and time consuming. It's just something about the combat and the way it flows that makes it honestly feel dull for me."
Negative,"Awful console port, glad I only paid 10€ for it."
Negative,Fuk dat gane
Negative,Fun game sadly as a noob i tend to die alot which results in me being near bonfire equaling alot of crashes. wait till they fix stability not worth the money at this point
Negative,Dark Souls 1 was OK. Not a fan of console games in general even when ported well (remastered DS). This one was boring. Didn't even finish it.
Negative,"DS3 is the worst in the series.I have played well over 200 hours on DS and DS2.  With a few exceptions, nearly every aspect of the earlier entries in the series was better.Pros:  Dark Souls 3 does very little better than the previous games, but what it does do is commendable.  DS3 does away with the life gems and rings of protection found in DS2 (IMO the only major flaws of DS2), but includes a way of farming embers by assisting other players with bosses.  and thats about it....  Everything else sucks.CONS:  FROM took a page out of Bethesda's book and left every fucking bug and glitch possible in the game.  The game is optimized worse than software I've written while drunk and I'm constantly kicked back to the main menu for framerate issues.  Issues I DO NOT HAVE running MGS V, XCOM2, and other games that I own on ultra settings.  This hit detection in this game has gotten much, much, muuuuuuuuuuuuch worse than it wsa in the previous two games, resulting in me losing PVP battles and PVE fights where the attack came no where near me.  Sometimes nearly the width of my screen away.  The Finely tuned combat system of the previous two games has been ditched in favor of artificial difficulty created through cheesy gimmicks like dropping your locked on target when you roll a little to the side or past them, eliminating poise, and giving half the mobs idiotic levels of multi-hit combos.The difficulty starts off at a nice spike from the previous two games (assuming you start as deprived) but very quickly levels off and becomes pointlessly sedate, so much so that grinding your way past 3 or 4 bonfires without stopping to rest is easily achieveable, even in unfamiliar zones, don't worry, you'll still die, it will just be to stupid shit like giant fucking crossbows raining death on you from above, crowds of undead running around with trees as weapons, and the predictable ambush waiting around every fucking corner in the game..seriously, that is massively overplayed.Onto the game design, or lack thereof.  Unlike the previous two entries the zones all feel uninspired and lazy.  The enemies are all 10 feet tall, which makes no fucking sense (am I playing a midget?).  The bosses are largely forgetteable - in fact, the first boss was one of the 'hardest'.  Half the characters from DS1 are shoehorned in.  The whole experience feels mighty bland.  It sorta feels like Miyazaki just ran out of ideas after DS and BB.  Just go buy DS2 Scholar of the First Sin."
Negative,The crashing function is out of this world! I crashed right when I got in the game! It's epic!!!!
Negative,PVP is a shit show cheaters everywhere. Laag is also an problem it favors the lagger...
Negative,"make the game more difficult by just throwing shit at the player. it is really fun fighting against 7 enemies who are all really aggressive. when 1 enemy is done with his combo, and you think to counterattack, think again. hard left and behind you are already started their attack"
Negative,"Forced to say that I don't like the game because a review can't be blank, so might as well type, am I right? I'd rather play Darksouls 1 for the 99th time, or Darksouls 2 for the 87th! I've had this game in my library for a long time, and every time I go to play it, I just end up hating everything about it, from the horrible lock-on jank, to the fact that the binoculars don't work like they do in darksouls 1 and 2. And then there is the fact that you fall like a sack of lead bricks whenever you try to ""jump"". As it has been far too long since I've gotten it to get a refund (Which I honestly would've gotten before), I will beat this game and then never touch it again. I don't even care if I get the ""True ending"" or whatever. I just want to beat it, and never think about it ever again for the rest of my life. This game is hot trash to me.Edit: After having played through the entirety of this game, I decided that I would only EVER use bows in this because they felt the LEAST horrible weapon to use in this game. And yes, I killed the gimmick Giant without using Storm Ruler. Did the entire game (no dlcs), including optional bosses, were slain. The first two/three zones are garbage. Some zones later on are just poorly designed, namely archdragon peak and its ""wyvern""... The final boss, I 1st tried. The Unknown King was a better fight than the final boss sadly. I give this game a 5/10. Get it discounted and not for full price. Or play Elden Ring. Elden Ring is so much better than this in entirety."
Negative,this is my favorite game
Negative,"I don't usually write reviews bud there is too much circle jerk about this game, back controls, bad game play, clunky feelings controls, no PC options all only xbox (really?) I came to the game to try it because people said it was a hard game, it isn't hard it has bad mechanics. It's not difficult it's difficult to control because of terrible coding. Just avoid it unless you have the patience to get used to the crappy controls."
Negative,"To be honest, I suck at this game. But I suck at Mordhau, too, and still I enjoy playing Mordhau while I find playing Dark Souls abhorrent. Mostly this is because this is such an low effort port that demanding 60 euros for it, is like a big, fat slap in your face (I paid 10 euros though!). The game is locked at 60fps and there is no changing that. Game gives you plenty hints and tutorials but ALL THE BUTTONS shown to you are from the Xbox controller so if you wanna know which button to press, you have to look it up in the menu. The implementation of AA is poor at best, ridiculously blurry and/or grain (sic!) most of the times.  Controls are clunky as hell. Now, now, I get it. The beauty of this game is mastering the clunky controls and then just internalize all the right movements so your very own body is the one playing this game and not your videogame mind. However, I refuse playing a game in which your enemies can change the direction of a strike in the middle of the animation while you yourself are forced to strike in the direction you clicked. That renders your enemies highly dynamic while you are just completely static. People like it, obviously, but I find it pretty cheap design. I had much more fun with Sekiro, it felt much more fluid to me. But even here you have that other ""feature"" that makes your enemies respawn whenever you die or you rest at a resting place. More often than not you have to kill a dozen of enemies over and over and over and over and over again to get to the boss, then get slaughtered by the boss, then repeat that, then almost beat the boss but get defeated eventually since your character was just standing there, then you repeat again until you made it. You come to realize that you have just spent 2 hours on a small portion of a level. For me, that is a waste of time.Hey, and before you cry about me being mad because I am bad, you must understand how utterly ridiculous such a statement would sound if you only knew what kind of games I usually play. Summa summarum: I wouldn't mind biting my teeth into this game to git gud but the pisspoor port, the bad graphics, the clunkiness and the highly artificial difficulty discourages me from the get-go whenever I come around to re-install this game.Oh, and btw: the mouse settings! 1 of 10 feels like, well 1 of 10 but increasing the mouse sensitivity to 2 of 10 is ridiculously fast all of a sudden. Yeah, so good luck trying to find the right setting with a 144hz display."
Negative,F*ck this anti-PC game.  FromSoftware couldn't be bothered to accommodate the most basic widescreen and keyboard/mouse conventions and I regret having spent both the time trying to make it work and the money to buy it.  This game belongs on a console.
Negative,"i thought id try it just to see what the hype is all about. upon playing, i realized that i would probably spend most my time resurrecting and redoing the stages over and over while leaving no room for actual fun gameplay. shame that this wasnt just for everyone."
Negative,Does not support 3440 x 1440.Like previous DS games it looks and feels like a cheap console port displaying confusing console controls. Very disappointing and certainly not worth the money! Wait until it is discounted as it should be priced as a 6 year old port it looks and plays like.....
Negative,"Note that coop is part time ghost Co-op only.  No progression for Co-op partner.  Co-op partner is rendered as a phantom.  Co-op partner is only available for a limited duration after collecting specific resources in game to enable Co-op play.  Once expended, resources must be collected again.  It's more like an online multiplayer help system if you are in a bind, but it is not Co-op in any traditional sense of the term."
Negative,i lost my save too many time without reasons
Negative,no fuki firekeeper ;(
Negative,"First, I can't hit the enemies.  Then, the controller stops working on startup.  NOW, the freaking KEYBOARD ISN'T WORKING EITHER.  Is there ANYONE in the industry interested in testing their product before release??"
Negative,I like to torture myself so when im not getting tortured i feel glad because im not getting tortured
Negative,I FUCKING HATE THIS GAMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Negative,I WOULD LOVE to play it but (WHAT THE FUCK ARE THESE CONTROLS) i mean whats the square and triangle button i dont have em on my keyboard someone elp ???
Negative,online Server down again for 3 day now . WTF happened first down for 8 month now more
Negative,"They took ""The Dark Souls Game"" and heaped piles of faeces on it.Rolls are queued and still action after the player character takes a hit (even after a single button press). Camera is the greatest enemy when facing larger bosses, they are all larger bosses. Give us ""Bloodborne"" for PC you cowards."
Negative,"what if you took the enemy design and aggression of bloodborne, but kept the swing speed and character mobility of dark souls? good thing the ashen one doesnt have a stomach for all the rolling you're constantly expected to do."
Negative,"This game is amazing! BUT...1. I'm a mouse and keyboard guy, and this game has very poor support for keyboard and mouse controls. I had to customize my keybindings which is normal. But all messages are like press R1 to slash. I had to keep on going back to the keyboard bindings menu to know what is R1 in keyboard.2. Does not support ultrawide screens 21:9.3. 60 FPS lock.If you don't mind issues I mentioned above, then I highly recommend this game. Gameplay alone is so good. I like the feeling that every enemy is like a boss fight. You have to take each encounter seriously. No rushing in because you got big guns, that's what will get you killed. That feeling of dodging those epic boss attacks is trully the best feature of the game. You only have a split second to decide if you are going to block, parry, or roll in a certain direction, dash in or out, attack, and what kind of attack, or just wait. Combo attacks need you to press the button fast but this forces you to do the combo, which means you are open if the enemy can dodge or take the initial attack without flinching. If you press the buttons too slow, this gives and opening to your enemies and they can roll out or counter.--- This part is a steam refund story ---So my reasons for wanting a refund were because of those 3 mentioned above. And there was nothing in the game description that it doesn't fully support ultrawide screens, the keyboard and mouse support is subpar, and nothing about 60 fps lock.Rules for a refund are it has to be within 14 days of purchase and less than 2 hours of playing. My problem was I spent the first few hours creating my character. The background was black so I didn't notice that this game just fills the sides with black bars to ""support"" 21:9. There was also an option to change the resolution to 3440x1440 which is 21:9. So I assumed that this game supports it while I was making my character.I was all excited playing this game at first that I didn't notice the black bars. There was so many epic moments from the start of the game that kept me busy enough to not notice them. The moment I realized my problem was when I got the binoculars item. It's an item that you can use the view your surrounding. I saw black bars when using them, and black bars when I took them off. I went through the settings, but still black bars.I had to download and use a third party program so that I can view the game without black bars. Finished the game, again it was so awesome. But I will not recommend this game, not until they support 21:9 resolution, and they properly support keyboard and mouse controls in their dialogues."
Negative,It was all good until the recent patch which made the game froze randomly.Just what you need when the game is already chanllenging.gg.
Negative,fuck this stupid shit game it doesnt work with my ps4 controller at all
Negative,this game hard. why they dont have ease mode.
Negative,scam souls 3
Negative,fucking stupid game
Negative,It's 2021 now. They don't have cloud savings. And they ban me for moving my saves from old computer to new one.
Negative,I don't like this game because it's starting to take up my life
Negative,nah fam dis some gay shit ma ngguh
Negative,Working as Intended™
Negative,"The most challenging parts of the game aren't the bosses. They are the horrible camera movement, unresponsive controls and swinging through the enemy and not connecting. How can anyone say this is the best game ever made when it can't even get these right? It needs to be taken back to beta."
Negative,its so distasteful to publish game on pc without thinking about keyboard. like cmon i dont expect it to be as fluent as pad but at least try. even mk wasnt that bad  without pad
Negative,"I can't name my character ""Kiriya Aoi luvs SHiN"" due to text limitation.I paid 60 bucks for this."
Negative,It's too bad that they lock the online server for more than 100 days and don't set a return date
Negative,"1) Don't remember a game where i had to read through the whole online game terms and conditions without any scroll or page end option, you can't even click decline without reading each and every page one by one.2) Poor PC port with controls not working as shown on screen. Press A or B, nope don't work bro, need to go back, press ESC? nope you need to press Q, annoying to deal with the controls as such, it even extends to combat and generally everything.3)Starter area so OP that many of the beginner level enemies can 1-2 shot you.Overall i don't think a game of this quality is for me, i'm sure many would love it, but this ain't my steak."
Negative,"So i have loved the dark souls series for quite some time, i have dumped way more than 34 hours between this and the ps4 version of the game. However recently when i move to a new pc my saves were lost, i had a backup and put it into my ds3 game to play my old characters for fight clubs and than poof i get soft banned. waited the month than now ive been penalized for trying to get my old saves back. this is ridiculous i love these games but with my time and saves wasted and gone i am burnt out from this game and its numerous issues with getting support. Hope my story give you all a cautionary tale of namco-bandai and its outdated practices."
Negative,you game devs were on deadass crack and meth making this shit. No way should a fucking projectile be FOLLOWING ME after LAUNCH. The fauck is that about
Negative,It would be more fun if it didnt crash every 5 minutes
Negative,"still as bad as the other ones, clunky ui, terrible controls (it took me 15-20mins to figure out how to jump and how do i even cast a spell?) and the best are the xbox prompts on my screen when playing with m&k..."
Negative,No online servers for months on end.
Negative,"game looks good, but i cant use my PlayStation controller"
Negative,Why is this game still $60? I think From needs to be FromSoftware needs to be investigated for price gouging.
Negative,Under no circumstances should anyone buy this game ever. I want to kill myself but I can't stop.
Negative,"Score: 6/10  DARK SOULS™ III  is a game that’s well-known for its punishing difficulty, but for many players, that challenge can cross the line into sheer frustration, making the experience more aggravating than rewarding.The game’s combat, which is often praised for its precision and depth, can feel more like a test of patience than skill.  DARK SOULS™ III  is unforgiving, sometimes to a fault. The difficulty spikes are frequent and harsh, often requiring repeated grinding or perfect execution just to progress. This isn’t just about learning enemy patterns or mastering mechanics—it’s about enduring the relentless barrage of obstacles that the game throws at you, sometimes with little room for error. While some players might relish the idea of overcoming these challenges, for others, it can feel more like an exercise in frustration.The bosses, while visually impressive and creatively designed, are often a source of intense aggravation. Many of these encounters rely heavily on trial and error, punishing players with one-hit kills or relentless attack patterns that leave little room for recovery. This can lead to extended periods of retrying the same fight over and over, chipping away at your patience and enjoyment of the game. Rather than feeling like rewarding tests of your skill, these encounters can come across as unfair hurdles that you just have to get through.The difficulty is compounded by the game’s checkpoint system, which can be brutal. The distance between bonfires (the game’s checkpoints) and boss fights or tough enemy gauntlets can be extensive, meaning that failure often sends you back a significant way, forcing you to repeat challenging sections multiple times. This can turn what should be a tense, exciting journey into a frustrating grind.Technical issues also play a role in the difficulty. Frame rate drops and stuttering, especially in high-pressure situations, can lead to mistimed dodges or missed attacks, adding an additional layer of frustration. In a game where precision is key, these performance problems can make an already difficult game feel even more punishing.The multiplayer aspect, while a core part of the Dark Souls experience, doesn’t do much to alleviate the difficulty. Invasions can disrupt your progress at the worst possible moments, adding yet another layer of challenge that might feel more like an unwelcome interruption than an exciting feature. While summoning help is possible, the inconsistency of the multiplayer connectivity can make it a hit-or-miss experience, leaving you to face the game’s toughest challenges on your own.In summary,  DARK SOULS™ III  is a game that prides itself on its difficulty, but that same difficulty can be its downfall. While it’s a well-crafted game with impressive visuals and deep lore, the relentless challenge, combined with technical issues and a punishing checkpoint system, can make it more frustrating than fun. If you’re a glutton for punishment, you might find something to enjoy here, but for many,  DARK SOULS™ III  will likely be more aggravating than rewarding."
Negative,dark souls 3 sucks big wang the people suck
Negative,"I have finished a couple of ""Souls like"" before, but I had no idea how much harder the real deal is: even after 40 hours and putting a third of my points into stamina at level 55, playing that game is still extremely stressful and physically painful to me. You *never* get any time to relax. There will always be a trap, an enemy that you didn't see or just cannot be seen (like slimes falling from the ceilng that cannot be seen in advance) that will destroy half your health out of nowhere, or a group of small enemies that are simply impossible to kill because there are too many of them.The difficulty of the game resides it two main things: every single enemy hits extremely hard, and they all have infinite stamina (which is what determines how much you can dodge, parry and hit). On top of that, all the dangerous enemies (more or less 30% of the enemies, not counting bosses) are much better than you at everything: more reach, faster, stronger, more health. And again: INFINITE.F*CKING.STAMINA. When you try to hit the shield of an enemy, you will bounce off it and will be briefly opened to counter attacks. Most enemies don't have that: they can just keep hitting your shield again and again without interruption and without bouncing off it until you have no more stamina, then finish you off, or just constantly spam a very powerful, uninterruptible combo with very few openings.Not impossible, but I'm not sure I'll have the patience to keep going."
Negative,"Unbalanced game with cheese mechanics that are both counter-intuitive and broken to a certain extent. Complete lack of choice and freedom.PvP is summed into item swaping on the fly and indiscriminate use of consumables (where nerds dictate that one cannot use healing pots called Estus Flasks, everything else is fair game because they have ways of circumventing the need of healing pots, through, again, ridiculous item swaping)So you have to learn everything about the game before being able to do anything in it, while guides may give a wheelchair for some PvE content, mostly you must use everything in the game extensively to learn all of it's patterns, ranges, speeds and specials (called ""WeApOn aRtS"")There's no happy pvp (fair game where you 50/50), since the game relies on trash p2p connections you WILL lag a lot if either pvping or giving a helping hand to anyone, unless you gang friends to do stuff together. Which brings me to the ""gank gangs"" where fair fighting is out of question, if they can 100v1 you, they will pre-summon 100 friends and 100v1 you the moment you spawn with that 100 years length animation, and since the game is unbalanced as F, you can't even take proper ""revenge"" in any way... This all without mentioning cheaters (blatant amounts of those), who simply run around with 1hp unable to die, speed hack, become impossible to stagger, etc.Than there's the PvE which distances itself from the ""fair game"" DS1 was, AI cheats too, poise, never-ending-stamina, never-ending-mana (FP in this game, idk why the fancy new names to already known effing standards for any RPG-eske game). Builds are also quite unreliable, you basically max out dmg output or get stuck, defensive builds suck and mostly won't work, so it's all about rolling and offensive buffs (because you basically can only hit anything in small windows). Backstabbing was nerfed from DS1, so it isn't as a reliable tactic for the game, parrying became counter-intuitive cancer.Circumventing all these issues what are we left with? Use same weapons, if not, use same moves with different weapons for melee, roll attack twice, roll away, roll in, attack twice, roll away: rinse-repeat 99.9% of the game, than we have the 0.1% of locked mechanics = kill things this very specific way, or fail, or take 350 years to kill something through normal means. Another ""viable"" way is to use spells, which have awful aiming through binoculars (that take two centuries to play the ridiculous ""pickup binoculars look through them"" animation), or free aim for wasted mana, or lock on only when the enemy is on your face, not to mention the awesome controls for lock on, which basically spins your camera because if nothing is in range the geniuses from ""FROM"" decided to make it a camera centering bind, which you cannot unbind/change.Summing up: game  is garbage, awful controls, bad interface, even worse mechanics that basically ask people to fiddle with their disgusting UI due to lack of proper basic key-mapping, while what is key-mapped is just awfully combined with unwanted commands/actions. Even messages on the ground can create problems during a fight due to this.Than we have the mongoloid train in Steam Forums of toxic kids who think they are ""DS3 PROS"" (as if the game had any Pro scene or was any sort of E-Sport, flash news: IT ISN'T BECAUSE IT'S COMPETITIVENESS SUCK, even the ""world record"" holders for speedruns rely on glitches and exploits to do almost the entirety of their runs, including constant quit/reload, navigating with noclip glitches, etc.) Basically it's community is a sum of a human cess-pool of failure.So yeah, can't really recommend this game... Used to love DS1, but as always, franchise went to feces like the rule of thumb for gaming industry demands.Have a nice one, hope you don't waste your money on this crapPS: Came late to the party, 6 years in my review doesn't have any effect nor helps much with anything."
Negative,"Worst souls, still better than elden ring."
Negative,PvE is just fine so about 40 hours of fun in the first walktraough. NG+ doesnt make sense because you just do the same thing again. PvP doesn't exist. as far as i get lvl 130 nobody invaded me once. and invading other players takes years and when you finaly find some1 to duel with its so lagging you want to cut your veins. thats because the game doesnt have dedicated servers.
Negative,"I played this game a bit in April of 2016. I didn't understand, why is it SO bad back then. Now when average online is 6-7k, it's absolutely unplayble. (DS2 was fun with 6-7k). Zero signs cause there is no rewards for help. even sunbros can get medals BY INVADING. There is no any arena that requires tokens. It's the most mainstream DSgame. Thats why so many egoistic persons play it. If u would ever find a lonely sign it will be placed in front of fog wall (not at the start of hur-durr location or even at nearest bonfire), Thank miyazakil for useless bonfires in every boss's room.  But it's impossible to level up Darkmoon Covenant for example,              cause U CAN'T INVADE SINNERS. Srsly, 'sin' means nothing in this game. Even in storyline. OFC, killing several NPC's has consequences but it's not about sin.             U will never be summoned to defend a member of 'WoB' cause nobody uses this covenant cause there is no rewards for them.Can't deny that some boss fights r very beautifull, but that's not enough for single player game. And this game is so 'singleplayer'..."
Negative,"Online Game play is awful, no option to avoid the same player continuously spawning in to halt your progress."
Negative,this game is bs
Negative,Game crashes everytime i go near a bonfire Edit: if i don't turn the lighting settings down to low
Negative,Lost connections to DK3 servers within 3 minutes everytime you play online mode.I cannot play it with my friends.Think carefully that you may not be able to play it with your friends before you buy it.
Negative,"Don't buy this on a PC and expect to play with a mouse and keyboard.  It's not playable without a console style joystick game pad; there are too many combo button presses, and everything is described in terms of what game pad buttons to press together.  The PC keyboard usage isn't functional; for example you don't bind ""parry"" to a key, and find it ends up being something like multiple mouse buttons pressed together. I have a Razer naga with a 12-button keypad on the side and some functions end up mapped on multiple side buttons.  I have only one thumb to press them with!  It's simply not physically feasible to play without a gamepad.  And I hate console joystick controls (or I'd use one!) - so this is $60 flushed down the toilet IMO."
Negative,"GAME IS UNPLAYABLE - BROKEN, BUGGY AND GLITCHES OUT. DON'T BUY UNTIL THEY FIX IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have a system well over the minimum requirements but for some reason the game crashes all the time. Full system lock up. Longest time I've played so far was for two hours on release day. Then it crashed! And since then I can't get back into the game it keeps crashing on the main menu! Rolled my drivers back and that seemed to make it work for a little while but then the game crashed again just after the first tutorial section and since save data won't load of that character without causing a crash and I can't make a new character without it crashing! And because I've been trying to make this game work I've totted up just enough time in it to disallow me for a refund. I paid for the £50 deluxe edition and now I have a broken game, a sound track, and prebought dlc for a game i can't f***ing play!"
Negative,"I can't even get the game to run on my system. I have dual 980's in sli, core i7 5930k, 32 gb of ram. Need a patch ASAP!"
Negative,I did not like it. Control is not even translated into keyboard bindings.
Negative,"Although this game is beautiful, easy to immerse in, etc etc... bla bla bla It honestly is exactly what you'd expect without fixing any of the core problems of the previous games. So if you liked the previous games, you'll probably like this one too. But if you can't stand cheap/unfair deaths like me... even if you were a fan ... this game has so many unavoidable deaths it's crazy...."
Negative,"Too many FPS drops and bugs. It's a pretty good game though. When they fix these problems, Ill start reccomending it but as of now, it's a buggy, laggy, piece of shit."
Negative,"Very disappointed with the release, Its like buying a bugged game. It crashes every single time."
Negative,This game has the same problems with late game bullshit that elden ring has but it doesn't have the funnish early game of ER. Plus the online is broken.
Negative,I beat this shit game just to say dont buy it
Negative,"Played for almost two hours and was unable to get out of the tutorial - not because of difficulty of content, but because of the broken controls.  Sidestep?  Side roll?  Back up?  Your guess is as good as mine.  One key press will do three different things... depending on what else you are doing when you press it.  Sprint?  Roll?  Jump?  All the same key - and you can't map those movements to different keys.  The UI is a controller UI - and cannot be changed.  Even as you play the game the ""hints"" you receive are controller hints - and meaningless if you are using a keyboard and mouse.  This game looks like it could be fun if the devs cared enough to allow you to set up controls for a keyboard and mouse.  They don't care - so neither should you.I do NOT recommend this game unless you play all your games with controllers."
Negative,has a game breaking bug which reversed 15 hours its a no from me
Negative,Online is dead and devs don't care. Because they already are making bucks from elden ring. Don't buy it.
Negative,Not very fun.
Negative,It's just not good.
Negative,I do not recommend ds3 on pc if you don't own a xbox controller since this game only has a xbox controller layout on and not pc layout so everything is basically xbox buttons.
Negative,goodEdit: Dark souls 3 had the best multiplayer of the souls series and they removed it a while ago...
Negative,The refund button failed me.
Negative,"can't play online, lame game go get job"
Negative,"This game is such an overrated trash bin on a PC.M&K unfriendly UI, terrible controls, blurry camera movement...Got nothing against the gameplay itself as it is great and challenging, but this game is just a very bad port and feels nowhere near where it should be as a PC game.."
Negative,"Would have loved it if it didn't bug out and crash within the first 5 min of play time every time. Character creation glitched out and I was stuck with an off-color ugly mustache, no matter what I did. Despite wandering as undead mustachio for only 5-minutes at a time, it was fun, but I couldn't get the game to work."
Negative,"I'd heard the game was difficult which was part of the appeal, but the basic instructions were never adapted for the PC. You will have to guess what buttons correspond to what action, and that's not even discussing the mouse sensitivity and shoddy camera work. I've *never* had a game make me feel nauseous before and at first was deeply confused as to why I felt dizzy after five minutes. The camera will swoop around in a full 360 degrees any time you try to look only a smidgen in a different direction, and any time you defeat an enemy it will try and do a Final Fantasy style victory pose even when, say, you have other enemies you still need to fight that you now can't protect yourself against because the camera has you looking at the sky. There are no settings to turn this off, and turning down the mouse sensitivity (a feature my mouse had) did absolutely nothing.There's no skill here. Just sheer dumb luck if you can get past the camera without throwing up and tiral and error your way through the mechanics. Requested refund."
Negative,KB&M controls are GOD AWEFUL.   Camera Speed & Mouse Sensitivity controls are set to ZERO!  To play the game I use a 3x3 CENTIMETER square section of my mousepad....  Don't even get me started on all the crash to desktop problems.  Worst $60.00 USD one can ever spend.
Negative,"If you like your free time, stay away but if you don't sell your soul"
Negative,doesnt save progress
Negative,"Super hard, ez-mode???? first boss is hardest in my opinion based off I've played 6 hours and not gotten through 20 min through the actual game itself"
Negative,geam does notint suppor lesbins bad gam
Negative,"Honestly dark souls is a wonderful game, so why do i mark it no...Tbh it's just to do with one thing and one thing alone, its mandatory take on pvp.IHatePVP...So much, and if i want to sit here and play with a friend i have no choice but to do pvp.Sure you can just swap to offline, but then when your friend wants to help you out or you want to do a boss or an area together then you -have- to be onlineAnd thats just fuckin dumb"
Negative,"The people/community that play this game are garbage assholes that think theyre better than you in everyway because they beat the game and own it on 3 different platforms and the community for sure deters any new life to the game because theyre just scumbags. you ask a question or offer help and you get barraged with ""youre weak/wrong channel retard/nobody wants to carry you you fucking noob/Get GUUdddDD at TheE gAAmmMee LUuuul"" then  proceed to have their boyfriends ban you from the community because you decide to defend yourself and they dont wanna be proved wrong or told how shitty they are as a person so they tell a moderator that theyre bestfriend butt buddies with to ban you all the while they sit and talk shit 24/8 to new players and people trying to play the game WORST WASTE OF MONEY EVER DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IT IS FULL OF GAY ASS NO LIFE BITCHES THAT EITHER CHEAT OR ARE STRAIGHT UP IMMATURE ABOUT EVERYTHING AND ANYTHING."
Negative,"Really disapointed in how lazy From Software has gotten.  On release poise was completely broken along with numerous other bugs, now my PS4 controller's gyro has the mouse going everywhere on screen and the half hour i've spent trying to fix it hasn't worked.  Funnily enough my high seas copy worked just fine with my old xbox controller and that was the very first broken release.  Really glad I just bought this and put money in your pocket....PS Don't buy the shameless cash grab that is Dark Souls Remastered on PC.  Just get DSFIx and save yourself the $.  They shold have fixed all the issues the first time and they can't even be bothered to fix all of the exploits in the ""remaster."""
Negative,"It's a really great and unforgiving game, but they clearly rushed the PC port; it displays controls that belongs to Xbox controls, forcing PC players that doesn't have a controller look up key bindings in the settings.Call me nitpicking, but this is the one lethal design flaw that's preventing me from properly recommending this game as a PC game."
Negative,This game would be great if the co-op wasn't completely ruined by invasions.
Negative,I have to run 5 fucking miles past multiple enemies to go back to a boss just to lose again
Negative,thought it would be better on pc but they apparently added stuttering like why
Negative,For the PC this is Very Hard to control. The controls are not set up for a PC . Game is too hard at the start and Just NOT Fun.
Negative,"If you haven't played a souls game yet then don't, they're designed for golfers, that is, people who enjoy being frustrated."
Negative,get gud r-tard
Negative,PC port is utter shit. Avoid. No cloud saves and takes work to get it working adequately with a controller.
Negative,"- ""Tutorial"" show key prompts for the XBOX controller even though I'm using M&K.- Game crashed every single time no matter what, when I reached the first bonfire. - Asked for refund.- If the game is properly patched I might try it again."
Negative,"A beautiful looking game.  Unfortunately I didn't do my research before buying.  Plays like crap on PC unless using a controller.  All the prompts are for console controllers. Very lazy porting on the publisher's part.  If I wanted to play on xbox, I would've bought it on xbox.  YMMV, but for me, it's getting uninstalled.  Definitely buyer's remorse here."
Negative,"I changed my mind about it. If you've already played Dark Souls 1, there is really no need to play Dark Souls 3. It's mechanically almost identical and is just a new grind in a slightly less attractive environemnt. It becomes a waste of time at that point - better do something else or play a game that feels fresh!"
Negative,"Editing review to no, because there are no cloud saves. That's abysmal at this stage of the game. Lost my gaming SSD, lost my 90+ hours of time in to my character."
Negative,"Lost my 3 year save because From Software just didn't want to have steam cloud on this game, when all my hard drives decided to break one after the other, and i forgot to back that specific save up."
Negative,>pc game >30 months after release>no pc keybinds>modding only half solves the issue >seemsgoodman
Negative,"Was Extremely Excited to play this game because I am a huge fan of the souls series, only to find out it doesnt work well. Constant lagging and stuttering has made this game impossible to play, you are taking a risk buying this game."
Negative,"Why do I have almost 50 hours in this game? Because I bought all 3 games in a bundle and played the first two under duress from friends. I hated it. Every last minute.I refused to play Dark Souls 3. I wanted nothing to do with it. But it was just sitting there in my library.Mocking me.I refuse to get this game win. So I got gud out of spite. The hate for this series drove me forward. The hate kept me warm. The hate fueled me.I watched the credits roll. Had I truly won? Or had I spent nearly 50 hours of my life playing a game that brought me absolutely no joy or pleasure?Dear reader, this game had won.On the positive side, it runs really well on Steam Deck."
Negative,"Terrible pc port. Wanted this game so badly and finally got it. Love the graphics, hate the controls. Next time you port a game, try actually making it for the pc instead of leaving the xbox controls all over to the point of ruining the experience."
Negative,"Much of the games enemies are more annoying than challenging. The game feels like cheap fanservice and still has bugs to this day. As someone who has played the other souls games, I can say I love the series but this is just a gimmick."
Negative,"+ Great art and ambience+ Complex levels with memorable areas+ Eerie lore and top tier monster design+ Castlevania/DnD-light like progression and mechanics+ Depth, details, replayability+ Soundtrack and audio- Unsatisfactory coop multiplayer, oldschool interpolation netcode- 2005 chaotic camera, awful lock mechanics- 2005 ragdolls and physics, hitbox clipping- Theoretically variant yet shallow combat based largely on timing- Absence of a mapping system- Bad default controls layout- No cloud sync / lazy port"
Negative,this game is depressing f                                        uck ity
Negative,"i used to love this game, but they pulled all the server support. so i wouldnt trust fromsoft now, and probably won't be getting elden ring either now. at least until they restore the servers and multiplayer support."
Negative,it not alright
Negative,This game freakin sucks.
Negative,Dark Souls 3 is poorly optimized with tons of random crashing and bugs. This game is also a terrible console port with the developers too lazy to implement mouse UI. It's also much easier compared to the older Dark Souls games. So If you are going to buy this game have a controller and wait until they patch everything.
Negative,"As much as I love the Dark Souls series, I honestly cannot recommend this game. The only positive I can honestly think of for this game is the graphics, they're gorgeous. Littered with issues both Online and Off.To start my biggest problem with the entire game of Dark Souls 3. Estus Flasks. This seems to fit in with part I'll mention later in the review but to start off, they returned Estus back to it's Dark Souls 1 roots. Which is not neccesarily a bad thing; but it is, it really is. Estsus flasks are a life saver regardless of what situation you're in, you can sort of walk and move while healing now, and it instantly fills most of your health bar, so if you're in a dire situation ever you can just chug that sweet Lucozade energy, low on health? Chug. Low on health AND about to be attacked by an enemy? Chug anyway, you'll be fine, just take the hit and drink again, then maybe you can think about getting out of the way. It's a hundred thousand times worse in PvP though, if you're in danger of dying just roll away and mash that heal button, chances are you'll heal and wont be punished due to how incredibly quick you heal and put away the flask, so PvP tends to boil down to nothing but an endurance contest seeing who can run out of flasks first, then and only then can you get a kill because punishing shit in this game is a mess. I personally preferred the slow heal of DS2 as it required to player to strategise when to heal and when it's not safe, making a wrong move means death. The speed of DS3 is more on par with Bloodborne however so it's understandable why they changed it for this one. It's less slow and methodical compared to 2.Rolling is also terrible, it's too easy, it gives too many i-frames, it barely uses any stamina. You can just roll and roll and roll around enemies in both PvP and PvE and be basically invincible. Completely saps any and all fun out of the game. Anyone with an inch of sense knows how to dodge in an unpredictable fashion and be impossible to punish. Poise is disabled and doesn't work. What this means; Online is people spamming the straight sword/Estoc because it's easy, and works surprsingly well. Incredibly effective if you mix up the swings so people can't parry it.  Offline you can be stunlocked by a rat or two wearing either nothing at all, or full Havels. And that's the game, basically it seems some enemies in this game have poise, but most of the time it's just no poise, I spent a good hour trying to get the parry timings down for enemies in an area later on in the game, the parry window for one certain enemy seemed incredibly out of sync with how his swing attacks performed, but regardless of this, it was completely pointless as I could kill the enemy within seconds by repeatedly tapping the swing button and stun locked him with death. Pointless. Armour is absolutely useless in this game, the defenses you gain wearing the thickest armour in the game is negligible compared to wearing rags, so if you liked to play a tank character in DS1 or 2? Too bad. It's roll or nothing in this game.I understand they were going more for fashion souls in this game? I really don't care because it ruins heavy armour for those who like it. The game also has a decent amount of hackers that seem to have the ability to get you yourself banned from online play simply by hitting you.A recent revelation I've also read about online is phantom range, a large amount of the weapons in the game have range that extends beyond their physical hitbox, this seems to allow weapons like the straight sword to have range equal to greatswords. It also doesn't end there, the basic swords or rapiers have damage that is almost equal to most of the heavy weapons in the game, that swing infinitely faster, and require infinitely less stamina so to sum it up - there's little point to using any of the weapons other than the basic swords, unless you want to make it so much harder for yourself.This game is really disappointing to me as the previous two games were fuckin' wonderful, DS1 had the superior world and the lore, DS2 had the mechanically superb game/swordplay, which it seems they have largely thrown out in Dark Souls 3 for a  much more boring, less intricate system, you also can no longer power stance weapons and instead are forced to only dual wield to specific weapons of the same type, which is incredibly upsetting as I loved mix and matching weapons to power stance in DS2. Dark Souls 3 however, has very little of it's own to offer aside from graphics, many of the areas to me are incredibly hard to remember, the swamp areas and the dungeon areas all just merge into one as they look incredibly bland. This is only saved however by the few areas that do in fact look fantastic and stand up on their own legs, areas like Irithyll of the Boreal Memory I won't soon forget. Which leads me into another point; the fellating. Dark Souls 3 has the biggest hard on for a previous game I think I've ever seen in any game series ever, this game of course being Dark Souls 1. In Dark Souls 3, From Software removed the shield breaker in favour of the kick as it was in Dark Souls 1, not only that, but the light roll animation has been changed back to the weird looking incredibly floaty roll from DS1. Now I wouldn't mind this at first, but the references keep coming strong and hard and really just fucking slap you in the face. Shortly after the tutorial area you stumble upon a building, upon entering this building you're met with a name - that name is ""Firelink Shrine"". Ok. Fine. You stumble around the area to get your bearings and then you hear a metallic clanking sound and you approach it. It's a blacksmith. The blacksmith. The exact same blacksmith from Dark Souls 1 - Andre of Astora, looking as if he hasn't actually aged a day since the events of DS1, despite it being seemingly numerous centuries after said events. And it just keeps going and going, another large one that I wasn't sure about how I felt about was an incredibly important, non optional area in DS3, you progress through an area and come to a lift, upon using said lift you are greeted with the sight of  Anor Londo. I was disappointed by this because it feels fairly obvious that the entire area would have crumbled away since we first met the place, especially since an entire city seems to have built itself under it's foundations? Fan service is all well and good, but there's a point where it's just excessive.In the end, I found the gameplay of Dark Souls 3 to be rather incredibly unfun, tedious, repetitive, and quite boring. And I'm a big fan of the series, playing both DS1 and 2 multiple times in anticipation for the release of this game.Probably worth buying if you're a fan of the series but I honestly had a hard time finishing the game once I began nearing the end.TL;DR Summary I guess; The PvE is repetitive and boring, environments look great, PvP is incredibly boring and the worst in the franchise; even made worse by the fact that invaders are constantly at a disadvantage due to gank parties and spawning with less estus than the host."
Negative,"This game is a port, which will always result in poor production value.- This game is 'accepted' as requiring a controller to use due to the poor mouse emulation. I would love to be able to play this game free aiming my spells, looking in the direction I want and not being forced to take my finger off the roll button to rotate my camera...- 'Camera reset' button being the same as the 'target', this will get you killed, constantly, it is a constant stress knowing that you camera angle may suddenly face you in the opposite direction to the enemy. This is ESPECIALLY prevalent on bosses/mobs that teleport or jump out of your range due to your character automatically dropping target lock.- Peer to peer PVP - the lag/de-sync in pvp is the worst of any game I have ever played in my 20+ years of gaming, it breaks mechanics and results in a sloppy mess. It will, without a doubt, result in you trading blows with an enemy that should have been a 1 sided affair.- Partial parries - should flat out be removed from the game.GAMEPLAY, to be PERFECTLY CLEAR.You don't attack enemies, you swing => if the enemy is in the way => takes damage.Mobs/bosses do not do this, they have direct attacks that target you with incredible range and speed - you will never have access to this level of control.This is why Dark Souls games are 'hard', you as a player have a very basic moveset that makes you weak - this game was likely developed and your character/ weapons/spells were nerfed until a 'hard' level of gameplay was achieved."
Negative,"Without doubts the worst in the series, it isn't a bad game, mind you, but it does mean that I can't recommend it.I have much love for some parts of the pve experience, but due to a couple changes to the core mechanics (poise, stamina costs, infusions) the game just falls flat compared to the others in the series. It's like Fromsoftware took the worst out of both bloodborne and ds1, and mixed it together into this game. However I'd still recommend this if this is your first from the Dark Souls series, since it is the easiest to get into of all of them. But if you've played Dark souls 1 and 2, prepare to be disappointed.The good:-The ""story"" mode feels good to play through, DLC is good albeit a bit overpriced for the content you receive (mainly looking at ariandel here)-Cool bosses-Combat is unbelievably smooth-As usual, the games in the souls series have immense replayability-Lots of armor/weapons to pick and play withThe bad:-Enemies never seem to run out of stamina-Weapon balance is terrible in PvP, there's a couple weapons which you will encounter every other fight-Phantom hits in online play-Shields are pretty much useless in PvE/PvP-All areas are made out of either a brown or grey colour, which gets tiring rather quick-Poise mechanic is executed poorly-It barely matters whether you equip heavy or light armor.-The newly introduced Weapon Arts, while cool, lead to an incredibly stale pvp-experience where you will encounter the same kind of repeated weapon art combo every time.-Weapon arts are pretty much useless in most of the PvE content compared to regular attacksHaving said all this, I'd give Dark Souls 3 (Including DLC)  a solid 6/10It's a worthwhile game to pick up if you're fresh to the souls series, but as a fan of the souls-series, I can't recommend it."
Negative,"No amount of words I put here would convince you.If you like Dark Souls, then you're already playing and this doesn't affect you.If you don't like Dark Souls, don't expect this to be any significantly different."
Negative,babyedit : baby
Negative,Game is not fit to be released at its current state. Plagued by micro stuttering as it renders new environment and or monster attack animations. Unforgivable!
Negative,"If you have never played a dark souls game, do not start. Story and lore is good, but playing the game itself is not. No help for new players, no tutorials no tips mid game, hell i cant even pause it to go take a piss. Waist of money, Just watch on youtube if ur interested in the storyline, not a normal story based game.Another thing is that this is a console port and god **** is it horrible lmao."
Negative,"I got this game to play with a friend on steam however i can not even get it to launch. I have tried every way to get it to launch but with no avail Fromsoftware should be ashamed that they haven't finished updating the game so a glitch that is fucking 4 years old now, would keep me from playing the game. DO NOT RECOMMEND."
Negative,"Was quite curious and was relatively enjoyable until the first boss which was 5 mins (!!!) in.Slam Bam. Die. Bam Slam. Die.Repeat 10x.Consider if spending money on masochistic non-fun is a good idea.Request refund.I was never a console gamer and now I understand why - this is beyond frustrating. Dying 20 times and feeling totally powerless 5 min into the game is not my idea of fun.Extremely dissapointed after reading good reviews about this game, was expecting something ... cleverer I suppose."
Negative,"While I love Dark Souls 3 as a game I can´t in good faith recommend a game that bans people that have never cheated, this has happened to both me and a good friend of mine. I don´t know if he did the same as me, which is deleting all save files and starting  a new character, but the outcome was the same for the both of us, we got softbanned.In case it matters, I did not use CE/Sweet FX or anything along those lines, the only programm I have been using while playing the game was DS4 to get my controller to work with the game.So yeah, the game is great, their anti cheat/security system is utter trash.The only ""positive"" thing about this situation is the fact that you can bypass the softban by using family share, which would force me to start over again.Thanks FromSoft."
Negative,This game has an awful pvp system. Its a fun game and i love it but its extremely dumb how people who completed the game can come and invaded early levels and bully them none stop. You shouldn't be allowed to complete the game and invade fresh characters. League of legends has a better balancing system than this game. I give this game a thumbs down because League of legends is better at balancing and that deserves the ultimate punishment
Negative,"Previously, I would have recommended Dark Souls 3. However, after more than 6 months of the online services being down still, and still having the audacity to sell this as a full priced release is uncalled for, a game released in 2016. It's a 6 year old game, I think it's time for $29.99 for a solid single player experience."
Negative,"Its hard to deny that Dark Souls 3 is a good game. I had fun with it, and it did a lot of things well. However, there are still some massive flaws that kill the experience in a lot of ways for me. And shockingly, one of my main gripes is with lack of difficulty in many cases, something I've never thought I'd ever say when talking about this series. It is an objectively good game, but in terms of the Dark Souls series as a whole it is somewhat lacking. This review will focus on PvE, since enough people have burned the PvP in this game.FromSoftware did a lot of thing right, and they do deserve praise for those. First, humanity is finally well balanced. They changed the name to ember, and the only difference there is that being hollow is now optional; you retain your human appearence while not embered. Plus, being embered gives a 30% health boost, which gives reason to using it aside from multiplayer. Most of the bosses in the game are amazing. There's a lot more consistancy compared to Dark Souls II, with the really good ones being completely original bosses. Abyss Watchers is still one of my favorites, Pontiff Sulyvahn and the dancer are well designed and hard, and the tutorial boss is one of my favorites yet. The secret final boss has great design, breaking the trend of getting under the legs to win. The final boss is not as original, but its still such a good fight I honestly don't mind.Miyazaki is a genius when it comes to level design; almost everything in the PvE portion of the game is great. However, there's a few large problems I have with it. My main problem, and a rather game breaking problem at that, is that the enemies will almost never be in your way. Unless you need the time to look around and explore for items, or are doing co-op, it is almost always disadvantageous to fight. Sure if you mess up you will get ganked and probably die, but not many enemies will be able to keep up with you while sprinting. From what I've found, its usually only the dogs or the pontiff knights you have to worry about. Almost every area in the game follows a pattern of putting a lot of elite enemies right at the start of a level, most of which will aggro in groups unless you lure one at a time with a ranged weapon, and after the first bonfire they're spread out evenly. The idea is clear; you're just supposed to lose your ember at the start, and since you often don't have enough time to light and rest at a bonfire, that's often a suicide run, and that strategy gets repetitive and boring.From when I found this strategy late game to ng+ to my second character, just running will allow you to skip most of the difficult sections throughout the entire game. I still have trouble beating the winged knight at the start of the game, but I never had to learn because the first time I could just safely kill him with a bow and he couldn't fight back, and the second I just ran past him and made some return suicide runs to get all the nearby items. The iframes on animations means you never have to clear out a room to move on, so you never have to git gud until a boss.Second, levels never loop back into a previous level. If you go one direction, you will often be going down a linear path to either the next objective or a piece of loot. It lacks Dark Souls's interconnected levels, which made all of them feel more memorable. Dark Souls III has II's overworld map, but with each location being as well designed as the first. Its better than II, but the first is a lot more interesting.Also, its missing, as Yahtzee put it, Metriodvania level progression. You only really have two directions you can go at any given point, and both of them are mandatory. There's a way to get into the final area of the game in the first level, but since its blocked by a late game boss its more for new game + players than anything. Even then you have to go the normal direction eventually, so its not a good speedrunning tactic, and you can't suicide run a high leve area to get some good loot early on. Ignoring that example, at every point in the game it goes linear, then you get to a point where there's exactly 2 path to take, before going back to being linear. For those of you who have played the game / don't care about being spoiled, linear from the start until road of sacrifices, then you have the path of Crystal Sage -> Deacons of the Deep and Abyss Watchers -> High Lord Wolnir, linear for a short time again until the distant manor bonfire, then Pontiff Sulyvahn -> Aldrich and irithyll dungeon -> profaned capital, then when you're supposed to unlock the final area, its linear to the end. You can't even do your first optional area until you're at the final level, and all but one of the optional bosses are in those areas. Simply put, I want the option to sequence break / skip certain bosses and areas, and do them in a seperate order. Even if they won't be used often, or if I'll have to go back anyways, its always nice to at least have the option. I like being able to skip to the final section of the game right at the start, but there's simply not enough of that throughout the game.While the tutorial is good, and gives the basics, the things it leaves out are vital to know. First, they kept the Dark Souls II two handing of pressing or holding to chose which hand to use, something I didn't understand coming from Dark Souls and the simple message of ""press y"" didn't make me understand there was a second version, until I tried Dark Souls II and learnt it there. Second, the iframes on rolls. This is a huge one, since many bosses require that you roll through attacks. The huge amount of iframes made me realize I was basically untouchable if I could time my roll to the boss's attack. Then, there's poise. I understand having things be cryptic from a lore perspective, but hiding a mechanic is too muchThere's naturally a fair share of bad bosses along with the great bosses. The dragon boss is an asylum demon copy (the first level copy of running away and coming back for a plunging attack, only now its a 1hko), the deacons mob boss is boring and easy, and Wolnir is a dps test, who can be impossible to kill if you don't do enough damage and the rng has him spamming fog.Co-op breaks the bosses. Bosses are at Bloodborne's speed, and having anyone to take the aggro off you means you can alternate free heals. Plus everyone gets a ton of estus to spam, so you only lose if you die in a combo or trekked the entire level beforehand.One of the changes I personally love, however, is the shortened run back to a boss. It might be a grueling trip to the boss the first time if you stop to kill all the enemies along the way, but usually after reaching it once you can unlock a shortcut that skips all the enemies. Sometimes I feel they go a little overkill with it though; my prime examples are in the last area, where the two bosses have a short gauntlet of foes before the boss, which should create a scenario forcing the player to take risks. The option should be fighting all the enemies, costing precious estus, or ember before the run to drop a quick summon, risking losing it to the enemies or getting a summon failed after entering the boss fog. However, there's a lift before both fights, right after unlocking a shortcut right before it. The final and hidden final bosses don't even have a run of any sort; there's a bonfire right before the boss. The only one without this is untended grave, since they remove the bonfire. I view this as a positive change, since with most of the bosses being well balanced, it will probably take most players a few tries to learn the pattern. I disliked this game because I beat it easily, and never had to git gud. There's no penalty for using the optimal strategies I did, and co-op is overpowered. Phantom estus needs a nerf, and enemies should block your path more often."
Negative,"Recommend this on Console, but not on PC unless you have a Steam controller, or your happy to fix the prompts through mods and play offline.PS4 Dark Souls 3 = AwesomePC Dark Souls 3 = Bad PortThe game itself is amazing with a variety of cool bosses and an experience you will never forget.Lots of pain but a huge sense of accomplishment when your patience and persistence pays off.The reason why I gave this a negative review is beacuse; - My PS4 controller wont work properly, - The port is bad and, - No Mouse & Keyboard promtps even though as this is on the PC... which sucks. Secondly Modding is banned online, some texture mods seems to be fine for some people but not for others, maybe it's the way they have them installed? But non texture mods are a definite no online which I can understand. So if you want to use either the PS4 Prompts or Keyboard & Mouse Prompts mod, there's a chance you won't be able to play online with friends and a chance it might work fine. In the Steam discussions there's some people that can play with texture mods and others can't. Even friends using the same texture mod, one is fine, the other is not. Again maybe its how they installed it or how their computer is set up, idk though.Edit: They removed online and haven't replaced it with a local coop. But the biggest issue I have is that the game now crashes every 10 minutes. PS4 controller works but had to tweak some settings and I don't have any mods to change the button prompts so no idea why it's crashing."
Negative,didnt like it
Negative,"The controlling on keyboard+mouse sucks, why you guys sell a PC edition without controlling redesign?"
Negative,they never fixed the stuttering at all. I guess it will be the same with elden ring. Not buying a game from FROMSOFTWARE ever again.
Negative,Game may be awesome... controls are the worst from any game ever. Makes it impossibly dumb. Cant get down with it.
Negative,"Keyboard and mouse controls are terrible. Dev was lazy when porting it to PC. I only use keyboard and mouse, not gunna go out and buy a controller just for this game D:<"
Negative,Easiest of the dark souls games unfortunately
Negative,The port over to PC was horrible.  Shitty keybinding options.  Can't get the button icons to change to PC unless you use a mod.  The movement is clunky and horrible.  Always sprinting unless you bind a walk button.  Jumping is a chore.  After playing Elden Ring I was hoping for some great movement and gameplay.  I was wrong.
Negative,They haven't done anything to convert this from an xbox game to a pc game. The buttons are all mixed up and camera sensitivity is so high it makes this game unplayable and I could not get a refund. Worst steam purchase I've made
Negative,"Nothing changed in DS3, since the debute of the Dark Souls franchise. It's still a grindfest with broken hitboxes, outdated graphics, horrible PC port quality (developers didn't even give an F about the control revamp - just let you guess what the X button stands for). Gameplay mechanics are cursory, more of a dance-roll simulator than a swordfighting experience. And the enemies themselves? Unresponsive meatbags that can take dozens of hits without even making a sound, specially the bosses. I'm not sure why is this called ""Hardcore"", because all you do is typically grind the boss to reveal all its attack patterns and moves, then come up with countering measure to beat it. That can not be called hardcore, but a mere exercise in patience.I've beaten up the first boss and this was an utterly boring battle of kiting and repeating the same moves over and over again until he fell dead. Then I uninstalled and refunded. Reiterating it one more time - for the practice makes perfect - the graphics and animations are incredibly outdated by multiple orders of magnitude compared to virtually any other game on the market, instantly crossing out the visual aspect of whatever this software is supposed to be.I gave the Dark Souls franchise whole 3 chances with each game, but it seems that it just wasn't the right approach.Dark Souls 3, like any other of its precursors, is a niche game for masochists or people of a very particular cast of mind, who enjoy dying a lot; because you practically can't defeat a boss without dying (to learn their move lists, of course), which is time consuming and tedious.Not recommended for purchase."
Negative,"The Souls franchise has a reputation as being hard, unforgiving, etc. Dark Souls 3 isn't challenging, it's needlessly difficult. It's not difficult because of clever encounters, great AI, or tricky resource management it's only hard because normal enemies hit hard. That's it. If you were to tone down mob damage, even a little bit, the game would be easy. That's not great design, it's lazy. Combine needlessly hard hitting enemies with very questionable hitboxes, lack of quality of life mechanics, a camera that frequently ends up inside large enemies or goes bonkers next to a wall, and you have a very frustrating game that doesn't feel rewarding when you succeed. My experience with the first boss, embodies my experience with the game as a whole. It seems pretty basic and straight forward, halfway through it sprouts an huge black gelatinous mass. After several attempts did I feel triumphant in my victory? No, I was shocked and underwhelmed, as I beat it almost completely blind as the black gooey monstrosity consumed my camera.I only had real difficulty with one boss, The Abyss Watchers. In my defense, this is my first Souls game, I was still learning much of the ins and outs at that point. Most bosses were fairly painless. That being said, the boss encounters were the highlight of the game. Bosses like the Deacons of the Deep, the Crystal Sage, The Twin Princes, and the Nameless King all stand out as very unique experiences. So it's somewhat disappointing that the game ends with a fairly generic boss fight.If you're a fan of the Soul franchise, I know what you're thinking: ""git gud"". You see this time and time again in the Souls community. Watching streams or Youtube videos make it apparent ""git gud"" means;- learn enemy positioning so you can run by them avoiding combat all together- when combat is necessary find a ledge, a doorway, any obstacle to get the enemy stuck on and exploit it- when it doubt, cheese with ranged weapons.I died more from weapons defaulting into single-handed wield than everything else in the game combined. I could not even begin to speculate how many times I charged at an enemy ready to attack with L1, only to stop dead in my tracks, buff my weapon inches from their face, and get punished. Why would the game not remember whether I single or two-handed a given weapon before I switched? If that's too tricky why is there not an ""always two hand"" option? Am I being too nit-picky? I could be... but then I think, what possible reason could there be to single hand a Bow & Arrow? DS3 is filled with many oddities like this. Dark Souls is praised because it ""doesn't hold your hand"", but it most certainly banks on you having prior knowledge from Souls games, or using Google... excessively. Would it kill the experience to offer a halfway decent description on such unfamiliar items like the Dried Finger, or a couple words on how Summoning Crystals work? I'm not asking to be whisked away mid gameplay to a floating floor in the sky so I can be directed to walk to a point and practice using a crystal. I'm asking for an extra sentence in the item description. From what I gather there's a lot of great lore. However, I just can't bring myself to be interested in the lore when there's no narrative. Apparently there are quests, but they don't feel much like quests. You explore a map, find an NPC, and talk to them until they start repeating themselves, occasionally you kill them.I found very little enjoyment in playing Dark Souls 3; The world is drab and brown, the style and design is generic, the story is non-existent, and the combat system is clunky. The hardest part of this game is finding the desire to play it."
Negative,"Does less justice to the souls series then that abomination DS2.You got covenants that are already dead or useless, poorly balanced weaponry, stagger-immune mobs, extremely unpolished code that has more holes in it than swiss cheese, and by far some of the worst netcode in the series to date. I can count on hand the amount of times someone at the top of a staircase has hit me at the bottom.Have lost my patience trying to deal with it taking 10 minutes to get a few people summoned, getting stuck unable to enter or GO THROUGH fog gates properly, crashes, getting soft banned because of said crashes during a pve encounter, losing 90% of my hp on a single bosses swing after having gone through my block.The 'plot' itself is also glitched to all hell, I had a certain trusty character not even show up in my $!@%ing game on one of my characters.Armor is useless. Poise is almost meaningless. No amount of gear is going to save you from getting permanently staggered from nonsense like rapiers and straightswords.Get your f*cking rediculous naming censorship out of my game with blood and violence you absolute insepid moron devs, seriously what the hell is the thought process behind that.Let me amend this by saying that playing this @!#$ is like revisiting an old first love at a fancy bar, it's kind of awkward because everything on her is fake as it is exagerated but it all seems okay and familiar enough, you see the fat headed son of a familiar old buddy or something.AND THEN LATER IN THE BEDROOM SHE PULLS OUT A CRYSTAL ENCHANTED 5 FOOT VIOLATOR AND PROCEEDS TO IGNORE YOUR SCREAMS FOR A SAFE WORD AND BEGINS R-1'ING YOU INTO OBLIVION. AND THEN 3 OF HER FRIENDS SUDDENLY BARGE INTO THE ROOM AND ALL START PROCEEDING TO GIVE YOU A REALLY, REALLY BAD TIME. AND THEN YOUR FRIENDS CAN'T RECIEVE YOUR CALLS FOR HELP, THE BEST PAIR OF BREASTS IN TOWN ARE GONE AND THE WHOLE CASTLE IS COVERED IN SHIT, AND THEN THE POLICE SHOW UP WITH THEIR 2 TONS OF PLATE ARMOR AND BEGIN JOINING IN ON THE BRUTALITY MOMENTS BEFORE YOUR ASS GETS BANNED FOR BEING A CHEATING SHITTER NOTHING IS WRONG HERE GIT GUD YOU WORTHLESS SAAACKKKK OOOOOOF SHIIIIIIIIIIT."
Negative,this game is fucking garbage. crashes at startup everytime. thanks for taking my money
Negative,"I've played other Dark Souls games, everyone kept insisting how good this one was, and how it was so much better than previous games.They lied.If you do not like Dark Souls or Souls style game, you will not like this one either.If you enjoy stepping on pieces of glass and then soaking your feet in salt and lemon juice, then have at it."
Negative,"I bought this game on sale to play coop with a friend, but that is just impossible with the toxic community. We got ganked constantly by invading players that have more healing flasks, more variety of spells and weapons. This game is impossible to play coop for a new player."
Negative,"If you don't have a controller for this game and want to use keyboard, don't play this. Everything is ported from xbox making it difficult to figure out at what to do as all controls shown are for xbox. Wanting to play co-op however nothing makes any sense even after watching video's on it. This game isn't designed for pc and isn't any fun with a keyboard and mouse."
Negative,"I honestly don't see why this game or the franchise in general is held in such high regard. Maybe playing on a console would be a better experience for this (and the rest of the series), but there are so many technical things to complain about I don't know where to begin.Good: -Atmosphere, graphics (sorta), sound.Neutral:-No actual story to speak of. Yeah, yeah, I know there is a lot of lore. But you're picking up puzzle pieces and eventually saying ""well what do you know, turns out this thing is fleshed out after all."" If that's your style, cool. I found myself annoyed by this approach though.Bad:-Well known issues with framerate drops for an insanely inordinate amount of issues. Even if you have a super computer, you will likely find yourself running through a 20 page check-list to ensure you don't encounter stuttering due to some strange issue that only plagues this game. -Controller mapping is terrible. And that is another well known glitch that has never been addressed.Bottom-Line: I had more fun just reading through the wiki than playing a single title in this series. I will probably give the series a chance on console just to see if the technical issues are non-existent. But shit, as much as it pains me to say, for your own sanity and the sake of your monies, stay away from the entire series on PC."
Negative,Im gonna be honest if you are casual and dont have a gaming pc DONT get this game first the frame rate is trash if you dont have a good pc and two it can be pretty boring after a little bit but i havent even been anywhere close to beating it so my opinon in just for the starting part
Negative,bad game its the worst game fortnite is better
Negative,i wont play this game anymore cuz im sick of going the same route 10 times and not figure out what to do
Negative,"While this game is incredible by itself. I did finish it multiple of time with different type of weapon or style. Finishing it level 1 with a broken sword was the most challenging.I can't recommend it at the moment, since the multiplayer is down and doesn't seem to come back. It was a nice relaxing game for me and my buddy while drinking. People would invade us and being polite chucking their potion and waiting to see which of us go first.Now we can't enjoy a couple of item in the game and we can't play with friend... Helping random people while they were invade was fun and challenging.EDIT: They did fix the multiplayer, but it did take 7 month to fix it. Which actively reduced the online community. Naturally that happen at the launch of Elden ring, which is a pure coicidence."
Negative,Ok so I off the bat want to clarify that I don't recommend this game for certain players. Obviously from ratings this is in fact a good game. Just not a game for everybody. I am one of those people. If you don't do well with being patient and enjoying learning how to beat a enemy by dying a lot. Then don't get this game. I'm just one of those people who can't get how to play this game well. I really don't enjoy dying a bunch of times to figure out how to get past a part. Just gets too frustrating and not enough of enjoyment once I got it. Also the story is very vague as far as I've gotten and they do very little to introduce you to the workings of combat and managing your equipment and upgrading.
Negative,"A game that solely revolves around timing and knowing enemy movesets. It reminds me of cramming for spelling class in elementary school, except the only difference being; what you learn is non transferable to any other game, thus being completely useless in every regard. The gameplay itself is bland and uninituitve with no real way of aiming your attacks other than trying to line it up with A and D or lock onto an enemy and be forced to lose track of your surroundings.  The camera controls are also quite bad to say the least. The game shoehorns you into a weird camera angle with unchangable FOV and mouse sensitivity. To add insult to injury, mouse inputs translate very poorly when panning and moving the camera around that gives the game an overall feel of being very janky and poorly designed.Ontop of everything aforementioned, the game also has very noticable and aging engine limitations makes it a poor excuse of a PC game, featuring a framerate cap of 60 that is directly tied to physics simulation which cannot be remedied even with mods.I also find it quite hilarious and pathetic that the entire tutorial is written in controller layout with no kb/m translation to be found anywhere, i.e. use your right bumper to perform x action etc. I don't know whether that is due to bad planning or the sheer lack of due diligence when designing the game, but that hardly matters at this point.Thank god I've only paid $10 on G2A for this game, it's a waste of time at best."
Negative,I really don't know why this game has been so popular.....
Negative,This game would be ok but the bosses are the worst in any game i have ever played
Negative,im a masochist
Negative,"2016 year - hitboxes still not invent in gamedevtarget lock doomed - the smaller the target, the closer you need to get. Some spells can simply fly through the target, mage is unplayable because of that. But in some times mege feels to OP, feels that target lock just for balance that class. Looks like dementia or laziness from the designers"
Negative,Straight up awful hit boxes worse than CSGO for sure unplayable auto targeting bullshit and input delay is straight dog water feels like the good old n64 days of this indie trash.
Negative,Now im in great pain-thank you dark souls
Negative,i have night terrors of the incest brothers ddont play this game!
Negative,sam didn't want to play with me :(
Negative,to scary didnt like h
Negative,NO ULTRAWIDE. FROM SOFTWARE GAMES ARE CONSOLE GAMES. Ridiculous.
Negative,"I believe that games should contain hard quests and puzzles to solve. But facing hard bosses is something, and being unable to use some very simple game mechanics is another. Just google how many people are searching for clues for only how to (kick) or even (jump) in Dark Souls 3. Even the hard bosses you have, beating them requires spamming rolling behind them, and hitting them in the back. It's very hard, but doesn't require any high intelligence. It's stupidly hard. It's a waste of time."
Negative,"It's a pretty fun game overall. I miss the monster/boss drops from DS1. Combat is a tad more fast paced wich is good and bad.  Weapon skills and mana are immensely useful. Now I can play a mage without feeling like I am cheating. It has its problems, sure, (such as dual weapons becoming obsolete in later playthroughs) but overall it's pretty good; a solid 7/10.The reason I am giving it a negative review is the anti-cheat program they use. I am one of the many who got soft banned, despite never using a hack or editor. All of my characters and items are legitimate, yet I am still banned. As it turns out, almost anything (including controller drivers) can get you banned. In my case, I think the cause was a me backing up a save. My HDD is dying (and there is no cloud) and I wanted to make sure it would work, so I tested it out. You get a warning telling you to stop using the characters who are in violation of the rules, but even if you delete everything like I did and start fresh it doesn't help. So if you never use almost any 3rd party programs, even things like FRAPS, and don't mind not being able to back up your data for any reason, then the game is fine.  This could be remedied by allowing us the ability to host our own servers so online play with friends and others is still possible (even after the shut down the official servers like the did with DS1).  If any of this BS changes, I will happily change my review."
Negative,ayuda lo rembolse y ahora vale 3 lucasedit: jajaj me lo empresto un amigo chupenlan
Negative,Controls for mouse and keyboard simply do not work.
Negative,This game strives to actively punish those who have played both of the previous games in the series.
Negative,the game does not work. literally every time i have tried to play it has crashed on me
Negative,"After 2 years, the game is full of twinkies. Annoying as fuck if you want just to coop with your friend and you're a noob in the game."
Negative,"Got banned w/o warning for downloading the DLC content 2 weeks after buying the game. First souls game and i didn't even finish it because i get penilized for buying the dlc now can't play with friends. Found post online about this issue from 2017, 3 YEARS later and they havn't fixed it, wow amazing too is its not just for a charactor its for my account.Still banned btw, Mike is still a Count without the U/"
Negative,"THIS REVIEW IS NOT RELEVANT IF YOU ARE PLAYING SOLO.I'm sure this would be a great game. IF I could actually join the one person whom I want to play whis game with. I know, I know, you can... But it feels incredibly tedious. Great game. Kinda tedious matchmaking... I bought this game on another website, that gets censored if I type it, as I'm poor and couldn't afford Steam's price, therefore I can not refund *wipes tear from cheek*. I feel robbed of money. In addition, the PC controls are somewhat derpy, nothing game breaking (could just use a controller). Recommended for those of you solo players. I will say that the matchmaking isn't awful, it makes sense. But I don't want to spend more time summoning my friend than fighting bosses... I don't recommend the game, only because I'm a salty potato. I hope you enjoy if you do purchase <3."
Negative,"This game has pretty serious issues. Nearing a year since release, and it will still randomly freeze and lock up your computer. This problem has been known since release and there is still no official communication to indicate any sorts of steps are being taken to fix this. Im running it on a 1070 gpu, 6600k cpu, 16 gb ddr4 3000 ram and from a nvme drive. And even after turning everything down to low, it will freeze up randomly after killing monsters, sometimes just by running around, when leaving a bonfire and when loading into an area. I have tried having it installed on a normal ssd. Increasing virtual memory to 5x the normal. Downgrading drivers, using beta drivers, disabling steam overlay.Also, i even did a complete reformat of my computer and tried having just dark souls and steam+ drivers on it. Still get the random freezes. Unfortunately, I got the game from humble store, so i cant refund it. The game is broken, and a very bad console port to pc."
Negative,If I could play the game I'm sure I would enjoy it.
Negative,I hate this game and all who enjoy it in the year 2019
Negative,"I`m sure this is a fantastic game, but every on-screen button was for an Xbox controller, including the tutorials. good luck figuring out how to actually play the game with no previous experience of DS and only M+KB."
Negative,"I wasnt into getting molested by a video game before now.EDIT: Nevermind upgraded to 21:9 and they dont have support and apparently that makes me a cheater . The game isnt difficult , not getting banned for stupid reasons is . Nvm the recommend ive had before."
Negative,"Okay so this is the 5th souls game I've played and it's fun just like every other one, the only one I didn't fully enjoy so far was Bloodborne with the excessive grinding which didn't feel justified at all but the game itself had probably the best fights in the series. I don't even wanna go into details of why all these games are good cause y'all probably already know how good the series is, I'm here to complain.The co-op sucks, not only on this game but on every game in the series, I know the game isn't designed to be co-op and I wouldn't even complain about it BUT the networking is already implemented and it's pretty good, so the co-op sucking is just a design flaw that feels like so much lost potential. Sure you can just play the whole game twice and have a somewhat decent to mid co-op experience but damn it'd be so easy to have a bit of quality of life in there, y'know? Sadly the only access to it is thru mods which for this game in particular have a warning about a potential ban, splendid, I just got into the game and if I want to actually play some co-op I have to risk getting banned, I don't even understand the game's online system enough yet to know the consequences but damn this could all been avoided by a little bit of better design.In Elden Ring the co-op mod we played was absolute fire, it made everything work so well and seamless and it just makes me feel that it's not justified for it to be this bad by default, difficulty scaling could even be customizable to increase boss hp, reduce their stagger on hit so you don't stun lock everything and so much more, with flexible rates so you can make it as hard as you want, multiplayer item loot, having to unlock things just once, I don't know man the potential is infinite with a game with such great gameplay and mechanics, normally the barrier is the networking/servers being terrible but they already work pretty well so I don't see the excuse. Why is the multiplayer so bad? No clue. I don't even want to get into how the invasions are so poorly balanced too that they don't feel fun at all, which sucks cause I absolutely love PvP but the minmaxing allowed as the main filter is just level to determine fairness in PvP makes it annoying if anything.I'll probably just play the game offline and I'll have lots of fun but you had the chance to make an incredible online co-op game for almost no effort and you decided to make the online experience terrible by design."
Negative,"I really tried to like this game, I really did and at just two hours over 600 hours played it can be said that I got my money's worth from this game. From all of that take my honest opinion, this is the worst game in the souls series. The pvp is bland and unbalanced, everyone can roll a nearly infinite amount of times and cannot be touched inbetween rolls, they can just use the bloodring if that isn't working out for them and be absolutely untouchable. Twink builds are more common for me than in the late days of the original dark souls, I encounter mulers and hackers way more often than is acceptable. With the new change to poise tpeople can just use exclusively r1s, stack poise and win. There are like 8 different weapon types and almost every one uses the same moveset as the leading weapon in its class just with worse stats, there are but a few exceptions to this, besides that there are almost no players who are playing to have fun, most all of them are there to win. The pve is the only good thing i can findd about this game, but that isn't free of garbage. It can be cool and breathtaking, really enjoyable for a while, but then you get slapped  with move-queing at one point then unresponsive controlls at another. Certain bosses are a joke and others (particularly in the new $15 dlc) have too much health to be soloed. On top of all of this despite my computer being well over the recommended specs on release, the game still runs terribly. My game will turn from a perfect frame movie to a powerpoint slideshow mid-fight, in both pvp and pve. I honestly do not recommend this game. If you have played every souls game feel free, it's a fun experience for the first or second playthrough but after that it is just terrible if you are trying to have fun with it.Update: 100 hours later nothing has changed. In 1v1 duels the game turns into a slideshow, dropping more frames than is acceptable, the game has had it's final patch ffs. Pvp is still a mess, good luck if you try anything other than arena, pontiff area is so swamped with hackers that it killed my second wind with the game. My llast session, roughly 4 hours, 8 hackers. Ridiculous. This remains to be the easiest, and buggiest in general controls and gameplay, in the series. A shining turd on the top of the heap. Uninstalled for good, final hours on the game: 674, with probably a third of that being pleasant."
Negative,"Edit as of 4/17/2022Bring the servers back or this will stay Negative forever.Don't get me wrong, Dark Souls 1 through 3 are incredible games, but until they bring back online functionality, even as anti-piracy as I am, I recommend you just pirate the game. I encourage everyone else to change their reviews."
Negative,online play is broken for long time !!! no conection at all shame!!
Negative,fuck you dark souls
Negative,The co-op tag on this game is misleading.  This game requires in-game items in order to sync up with your friends... and it also changes the experience so that random folks can join.  I like playing hard games with friends... this game did not provide that co-op experience from the start.  Be mindful of the 2 hour refund policy if you try the game.  My friend played an hour extra longer than me and was not refunded by Steam.
Negative,"Very badly optimized for PC, even though I was using a controller, I had to use a mouse to look through inventory , and to change settings as  the controller DID NOT RESPOND IN MENUS !  My controller was not being recognised in game at times also, so getting killed became a pain. I Decided to go keyboard & mouse  and only got prompts for controller. Why the heck is using one control control system NOT enough?Ended up getting a refund."
Negative,"So many reasons to be dissapointed with this. It's a shame, too, because there were some fantastic moments which I will never forget, such as battling the Abyss Watchers.It's funny, I thought that the largest bosses would be the most fun, but they were always the most clunky, shitty hitbox bearing pieces of shit.At the end of the day, the experience is also just roll2win: the game."
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 unfortunately fell prey to being dumbed down for a wider audience. The game is much easier than its predecessors, and enemy variety is lackluster, with most bosses being a humanoid with a ""swing 3 times"" moveset. The game lacks in difficulty Sure, it looks nice, but it lost the essence of what Demon Souls and Dark Souls originally brought in. They attempted to bring back all the rose tinted feelings of previous games shamelessly as well, as the main hub is basically the Nexus, and there's another Anor Londo visit because.They fixed some of the glaring multiplayer issues from the previous games, which is appreciated, though modders can still cause other players to be banned from online play entirely. That's not a good system. The PvP is also still jank due to stamina not being an issue, and animations being as non-committal as possible, because they wanted to rake in as many people as possible.It's a shame because the few improvements that actually benefit the series are overshadowed by the design choices. Season passes are also a disgusting practice."
Negative,"This game doesn't need another like.  It is what it is.  I hate getting invaded all the time and I hate how the design team created a game where playing with your friends is a bad thing.  It's not like it's fair either.  Invaders find the best weapons and gear and when they're about to loose they run into a group of mobs that's sure to give them the advantage (I know there's a seed that makes mobs attack an invader but it's a hassle to get and invaders can still have superior weapons/armor).  The invader gets the best reward too, whereas killing an invader hardly yields any benefit.  The game is amazing, don't get me wrong but with the balance of the game encouraging invasion, it's too frustrating.  The game is hard enough without having a 30 minute standstill while the invader keeps running away.  It takes a lot of fun out of an otherwise great game."
Negative,"The game might be very good, but I've never seen such a poor port to the PC. The tutorial gives you the playstation buttons, then you have to look up what key they actually mean in the keybinding menu, etc. Even then, it's very counterintuitive in many ways. Don't get this for PC."
Negative,"So by now everybody probably knows that Dark Souls 3 is not a bad game. However, I feel like it made many bad game design decisions. For instance, why in the world do I need to walk back 2 minutes to every boss when I get killed. This game revolves around dying and trying again, so why would you encumber the player with something useless and time consuming like that. You're supposed to run past the enemies anyway, so there's zero challenge there and takes away immersion as well.Furthermore, the currency/leveling system. You can ""farm"" souls from NPC's that respawn and level up as far as you want. Why? Isn't this game supposed to be challenging? I found myself deliberately NOT leveling up or collecting souls, because that would undermine the challenge and accomplishment of the game.Then, there's almost zero lore. I don't care what the wikipage says on it. It should be in the game. Not a singe boss gets ANY kind of introduction or bit of story. You're just fighting big things and have no idea why. Just a lack of the story-component of a game. Then, the combat. There seems to be a delay between the input and an action (including rolling), and since many enemy attacks are faster than that delay, there's literally no way to avoid getting hit without knowing exactly at what point the animation will do an attack (which some people see as a challenge, but is just memorisation). The camera can get really annoying too. When locked-on you often can't even see the upper body of the enemy (because they're so big and the FOV is so narrow), so you can barely make out the animations. A lot of bosses just boil down to ""poke them in the ass"" as well. Also attacks go through walls. Furthermore, what's the point of stamina really? Is ""resource management"" really a challenging and exciting mechanic?There's no ambient music and some of the boss music is just obnoxious. Though the main theme and some others (Abyss Watchers) is quite nice.There are many fps drops as well.All that said, I think all the environments are really beautiful and I love the gothic fantasy vibe. Armor, weapons, spells and enemies look cool. I'm glad games like DS3 exist, but I just disagree with some things in it."
Negative,"This game is amazing, and a must for fans of Souls/Elden Ring. However, they took the servers down as far as we can tell forever, and removed all mention of online play in the store. This is pretty shady. CyberPunk shady."
Negative,too faucking heard
Negative,Worst playerbase in the series with worst gameplay to top it all of
Negative,The controls are utter shit for PC. all key guides are in controller terms.
Negative,Monster Hunter but worse.
Negative,"When it works it's great. Though I've speant as much time just trying to get the game to launch as I have playing. From what I've seen I like it as far as gameplay, however do to the fact it won't launch half the time I cannot reccommend."
Negative,I can play Witcher 3 on med-high settings at 35 fps on my current card. I have everything on low in this game and I still get as low as 15 fps in lots of areas. Thankfully I've only crashed once. I know lots of other people crash all the time. At the time of writing this review. FromSoft hasn't done anything to fix this games terrible optimization. I run into enemys all the time that seem to still be able to hit me in mid roll. It's much worse in pvp. I've still managed to beat this game and all of the bosses. I honestly am done playing until this game is fixed. The fact that I was able to still beat it is amazing. I'll be watching for updates. Hopefully they come sooner rather than later.
Negative,"Whoever finds it fun to invade other players who casually play this game for a few hours a week tops are TRULY the armpit of the earth. I don't want to ""GiT gUd"", I want to enjoy playing the game. The game is just about unplayable by yourself and then when you get your friends to come and help you out, you're invaded by some guy sitting by himself in his parents basement while he taunts you and ruins your game. He taunts you in the game when in reality he's too scared to even talk to his 6/10 cousin without sweating or stuttering.  As south park would put it, I'll refer to these players who invade as ""he who has no life."" IF this game had a feature where you could play with your friends without having to worry about ""he who has no life"" invading your game, maybe I would recommend this game to others. Since there doesn't see to be a "" sword of a thousand truths"" in the game or should i say ""art"", this game is the most frustrating game to play if you enjoy frustrating yourself and screaming obscenities at your screen while your cats run and cower in a corner, then this is the game for you!"
Negative,"Game looks good. Runs good. This game feels to me like WoW end game bosses with no help. End game bosses you pay 60 bucks for to fight over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over  over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over  over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over  over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over  over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over  over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over  over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over  over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over  over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over  over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over... OK FUCK IT... go look up how to beat on you tube,.... SHIT I am the wrong class... !! restart game...."
Negative,play it on ps4 instead.
Negative,if you played elden ring before youll not like this game everyone who says its better than er is blinded by nostalgia
Negative,"very bad game, developers cant even make the controls hud for pc"
Negative,"Every time I launch this shit, it requires me to read the online EULA, even though I read already. It doesn't allow accept nor decline nor skip nor quickly move to the end nor even scroll with a bar. Totally unplayable."
Negative,"Good game, bad programming.Lots of bugs, game corrupted my save, physics engine locks framerate at 60hz."
Negative,"no no e no, FROM SOFTWARE...Dio santo: allora nella fisica classica (in seguito spiegherò perchè ho specificato classica) quando un oggetto di peso elevato viene colpito da un oggetto avente un peso e la forza applicata minore alla massa dell'oggetto iniziale quest'ultimo verrà aiutato dall'EQUILIBRIO che permetterà all'oggetto di spostarsi ma non di cadere. Ecco, CHE CAZZO TI COSTA FAR FARE QUESTA COSA ANCHE AI PERSONAGGI DI DS3?! allora nel primo DS funzionava, nel secondo anche, NEL 3 NO. MA DIO SANTO! Se te hai preso come riferimento e come spunto per la fisica la fisica quantistica e serve la lore per capirlo allora chiedo venia ma ricordo ai programmatori una semplice cosa: NON SIAMO FOTTUTI ATOMI!"
Negative,"If you like PvP, don't buy this game.There is no dedicated PvP server to play on. Instead, one of the players will ""host"" the game, which means the entire match will be pure LAG every time. In fact, if you want to be a god at pvp in this game, all you have to do is go into your modem/router settings, go into QoS (quality of service) and set the upload bandwidth to the lowest possible value. Presto! You can now kill all enemy invaders easily and they cannot fight back since you will not be sending them data about your position and actions fast enough for them to be able to play with you. Make sure you point down and throw shit at every free kill because winning matches by cheating makes you good."
Negative,"crashes every 10 minutes, not worth the title"
Negative,Framerate Unsuitable for Online Play. Game just came out 1 hour ago so no point in searching for solution. Tsk tsk tsk
Negative,"Never stopped playing a Triple A game as fast as this. Uninteresting combat. Avoid unless you like Assassin's Creed style, repetitive combat. The only saving grace is boss mechanics. But it's still AC style combat. Roll roll roll until you can hit. Take a potion. Repeat"
Negative,it needs a fucking controller
Negative,This game is so bad I literally could not get past the first boss. At this point I am confident it is impossible to beat the first boss. DON'T BUY THIS GAME UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE!
Negative,Fuck you and your endless twink horde. Can't play this game for the first time ever. Not recommended to anyone who doesn't want to constantly being ambushed and get nowhere in the game.
Negative,"AMAZING GAME, FIX THE DAMN BUGS FROMSOFT"
Negative,Crashes before bonfire. Refunded.
Negative,"Invading / being invaded really needs to be opt-in.  If players want to focus on beating the game rather than defending against invaders, then they have to run around hollow or play offline.  It is really going to mess with people's enjoyment of an otherwise excellent game.  Especially when you can be invaded by multiple enemies and your Way of the Blue covenant doesn't work as advertised."
Negative,Hackers...lots of hackers...AvoidGot one 45 hour character turned permanent hollow unable to equip armor. This guy started the trend but others are now picking it up.
Negative,"Game has really no instruction, no real intro, and I seem to have been stuck in the intro. It dropped me into some dark not rich feeling world, very minimal, as a knight? of some kind with a shield and a sword, you fight these weird one-hit kill waithlike-looking dark creatures, no challenge there, no sign of it being a tutorial at all however, just feels dead, (why do they look like dementors from harry p? where is the game content?) Then the game actions are not easy/intuitive, and all the controls on the PC version are hovered as controller ""PRESS A"" for example which it obviously doesn't work using ""A"" on the keyboard. There is no way in the settings to change this, (that was me going through every setting) so can't really play a game or get into it with no obvious direction, voice, path, or anything really to speak of game wise going on. Major let down.. Maybe if I was playing with a controller (I don't have one connected...) however this does not feel like a finished game."
Negative,"It does look like a good game, but one fatal flaw for me, the mutliplayer of this game is horrible at best. Cant play coop with a friend without being forced to do pvp. I dont care about any reason whats ever, I dont like pvp, I dont care about pvp and I dont want to do pvp. I dont want to play coop with my friend only the cheese the game, I want to play it for fun. So yeah asked refund cause of this, if you enjoy, more power to you, but lost 2 sells."
Negative,"JUst played it cause it's dark souls. Got banned for god knows what. Fuck you fromsoft or whoever behind this BS. LIterally deleted all my toon uninstalled game, logged back on and banned. This system sucks. Really hope community boycotts this cunt in the future."
Negative,"First of, just let me say I played and loved the two previous dark souls games.Regretably, this launch has been quite a disaster. Many users are reporting various crashes and poor performance. I can hardly reach the title screen, let alone play the game. Even the older souls games didn't have this many game-breaking issues (though they weren't perfect either). I hate to be ""that guy"", but the ever more common practice of rushing out clrearly unfit and untested games relying on patching as a crutch it unnacceptable.I'll not be modifying this review, even if they patch this many issues, to show I don't support poor releases.Obviously this review can't cover gameplay, though it is good from what I hear..."
Negative,Fuck you Fromsoft
Negative,Easily the worst game I have ever played.  The combat system is very non-responsive and the in-game tutorial teaches you nothing.  Do not buy.
Negative,absolute horse shit
Negative,Full of bugs
Negative,dark souls 3 crashes much
Negative,"TO THE ATTENTION OF GAME DEVELOPERS: 1) To co-op, that consumable ""Ember"" thing to summon friends and finally play together (until ONE of you die which cancels the co-op mode) is totally stupid. I bought the game to play with friends and now we look dumb as we have to play solo to earn the right to play together. 2) The tutorial controls on PC are indicated with the XBOX buttons naming, which is very annoying and sounds like neglect. Outside of that Dark Souls has outstanding Art Direction and the Gameplay is smooth."

Negative,"Bounced hard off of this one. No Tutorial, no mechanics or lore explained, no narrative. Realised I was facing 100+ hrs of repeatedly dying and consulting wikis on how to proceed.I need a reason or a cause to fight for, something to motivate me to play. There doesn't appear to be one, other than people on reddit saying 'you will enjoy the suffering'. I wonder how many new players like me are put off immediately by getting repeatedly wrecked in the starting area without knowing why."
Negative,"Its hard allright.Besides that, it dosen't really work well for PC, no key binding support and graphics seems very pointy."
Negative,not fun hard to roll
Negative,Great game 0/10
Negative,i hate dark souls
Negative,at furst bunfier the shit craches over and over... realy fuking realy ffs dont get thsi game its not working. will w8 for 5 days if not fix wil refund.
Negative,"i get what the hype is about but its really just a poorly put together game. maybe it's better on console with less glitches. The sad excuse for a story is one thing but its the bad combat mechanics that bother me, so i'll just list them off.-sometimes while fighting the camera does a dramatic change like you are about to see something cool but then it just zooms in on your face. you cant stop it until its done, so hopefully you already killed who you were fighting.-the camera is unable to move every time after hitting an enemy, unless you put a movement command in. So you cant just turn the camera sometimes which is huge in this game.-enemies frequently get stuck in the terrain and are unable to be hit but can hit you all day.-not all hit boxes are correct for attack animations-all in game commands are for the controller, so you spend a lot of time just trying to figure out what button does what on a keyboard. - literally nothing gets broken down or explained in this game. it gives so many combat numbers but not the important ones. If you want to see the dmg from your FP using special attacks, you have to google it. want to know wtf unfaltering prayer does, you better google it. you want to know how much poise your specific unfaltering prayer gives, google it. want to see a spell's ratio to your spell buff? google it... get the idea? its just laziness. Its super inconvenient to google everything when the game should just tell you the numbers to begin with. I'm a numbers guy, so this really bothers me more than anything else in item based game.- if it wasnt $60 i would understand all the problems with the game.  but the basically made a pretty decent combat game, gave it a camera from the PS2 days, put some of their numbers together for you to see, explained nothing, and called it a hard game.- tired of the camera staring at my guys face, the wall, or straight down because i used the lock on."
Negative,so much troble just to lunch it
Negative,"These games have been around since 2009, and I am STILL getting invaded by people who are so laggy I can not hit them. Yet they can hit me through every single roll, block and piece of terrain.Really fun."
Negative,This games control scheme is absurdly outdated.
Negative,dark souls 1 did it first and did it better
Negative,pvp is just as shit as ever
Negative,probably one of the shittest games ive ever played
Negative,"lack of technical support, no windowed borderless mode, no ultrawide, hackers issue, graphic tearing"
Negative,"I just finished the game and wanted to say that yes, this IS the best Dark Souls game, and I've played all of them.That said, I'm keeping this review with a thumbs-down until the following is done by the publisher, Namco Bandai:- Stop banning non-cheaters and allow cheaters to keep playing.- Allow for Cloud saves so that players don't have to back-up their game on their own, which might save them from corrupted data (courtesy of said cheaters).- Write patch notes in clear ways that explain what EXACTLY is being changed instead of making the player base do experiments on their own in order to figure out the new ""balance"" patch.- Take care of its players' problems by responding within a reasonable time period (i.e. less than two weeks).- Admit that ""poise"", an important game mechanic, is NOT working, and shouldn't be displayed in the game because, well, it's misleading."
Negative,"Almost everyone is experiencing crashes, framerate issues (5 -10 fps) and poor performance.Even people with 980's and overkill hardware have issues. There's a huge problem with this games optimization.People crash at bonfires (your savepoint) which is ridiculous, some have even lost their save game entirely.The gameplay is good and atmosphere is there, but the game isn't stable, it's unplayable.The steam community hub is flooded with over 1000 cries for help because the game doesn't work.Another 1000 posts on Reddit by people looking for performance fixes, multiple threads on /v/, neogaf, gamefaq etc. Every PC game at launch has issues but it's fair to say this hasn't been a smooth PC launch considering the sheer amount of problems. People with high end systems struggle to run the game/suffer from crashes, so the problem is the game itself. I'm one of the lucky few who can play the game, but even then I had to spend hours doing work arounds and tweaking settings until the game worked.Don't buy this game until they update and fix the problems, there's far too many to overlook even for the most loyal of souls fans. (Don't trust some of the positive steam reviews, one of the top rated ones was by a guy who only played the ps4 version. Don't be fooled by blind fanboys or video game journalists who barely even played the game)"
Negative,stupid fucking questlines
Negative,PVP is straight trash. if you enjoy pvp don't buy this unbalanced piece of shit. if you like to 3or 4v1 all fucking day long then go ahead and try this out since this is the only form of pvp you will get. fuckin literal 2/10PVE is fantastic however.
Negative,"The ban policy is madness. While people are using family sharing for doing all kind of stupid cheat engine s_h+i_t and they suffer nothing, people like me that do not cheat getting banned because some salty azz_hole ran some scripts on my character."
Negative,"May be a great game but If you press attack while attacking you will start attack after the first animation is finnished, even if you want to dogde at this time. It feels clunky and takes my fun of the game"
Negative,f*ck this game is so hard to play!!
Negative,"You dont have a xBox controller? Too bad! Have fun dealing with all those controller buttons you have to press, even if you dont have one."
Negative,10/10 most difficult souls game to datecant even get past the cinematic.starting up the game is even harder than playing it
Negative,Miyazaki never cook again
Negative,Bad Elden Ring copy don't get this.
Negative,"I play this game for the pvp, if you want to do pve, and you don't have a squad to help with bosses, make sure you play this crap offline! I have had several incidents where I am fighting a boss, it says I lost connection to server, and it boots me to title screen."
Negative,"game is ment for people with no life. I played the game story twice now.its a cool story but the game play/ leve design lets it down.you must do hours of research to do anything in the game. amor dosent matter so enemy will allways take chunks of life away..... even rats a low leve enemy..........WTF? enemy will stun lock you but you cant them.also some times your hits wont register even when you clearly hit them, had this happen when I was farming.A lot of weapons are copy pasted reskins of one another even down to weapon art.Playing pvp is a mix bag due to laging.overall get the game on sale for around 10-20$ play story and drop it since thats all thats good."
Negative,"This game touts itself as a very difficult game that can be mastered.  However, this is more of a test of patience with bad design and technical issues.The good portions can be seen through the PC techical issues.  The enemies are hard and, when the framerates cooperate, it can be quite fun to learn their attack and finally take down a hard armored enemie.  The loot is about standard and, from what I can tell, there is a decent system in place that allows experimentation.Then comes the issues.  The camera design is very much for a controller.  Even with a controller, it is terrible.  This is further exacerbated by the technical issues.  The frame rate would randomly decrease in the middle of a fight, inevitably just as an enemy was winding up an attack.  Then you would randomly loose lock, causing the camera to swing wildly and making it that much more difficult to even dodge/block.In the end, this just makes the game an excercise in patience as you see if you can challenge a particularly hard enemy blocking your path when the game isn't acting up.  I would have loved a hard but rewarding game, but this is just cheap.I can definitely see a good game under these issues and maybe it is for the console players.  However, for PC, this seems to be another Resident Evil 4 PC port."
Negative,"This game was literally designed to make you hate people in real life. The reason its called ""Dark Souls"" is because it actually manages to make you track down people in real life so you wanna kill them. Laggers, hackers, some fucker called Tarzan, you should only see this game as a singleplayer game. In the small time I've played this game's singleplayer, its actually really fucking good, like the atmosphere is amazing. Still I wantted to play because Co-op. But I think this multiplayer is actually a response to millions of people asking for co-op. The designers of this game purposely made it so if you wanna play co op with your friends, you'll be analed by asshole with 1012 hours despite being new to the game. If you're unlucky you'll see a dipshit in a top hat who whips you and shoots fire, and voice spams Japanese pornstar sounds; so dirty you'll feel ashamed that you've ever jacked off to AV Models.Rage/10"
Negative,"Modders were* keeping this game alive since FromSh1tware decided to give up on all their past work (which is quite good in general, not considering DS2 ofc) in order to complete development for the most broken and hype failed game we now witness spreading all over, thinking they could somehow manage to craft a decent open world game that lives up to the name of all Souls saga. Not only they aren't capable of polishing their own product game after game repeating the same formula, they also invite a man who never finished his own stories in 10+ years to help designing a whole ""new"" world based on his all fucked up small minded (leak of) imagination AND they recycle like 90% of DS3 making it a ""new"" lame excuse for moneygrabbing. Genius, and I also congratulate those who were jebaited by their new ""gem"".If you never played any Souls game before, I'm sorry to say but don't bother paying for it anyhow nowadays - IT'S NOT WORTH IT. Ask if a friend can share their library instead so you can enjoy (?) roots soulslike experience while confirming every negative review going on from multiplayer issues that are never fixed to all deepest shit that never got any dev attention.Have no friends? Well, sounds bad. Wait for a critical sale then with discounts so high they can't pay for a single cup of coffee on their end.DS3 is an okay game for today's standards tho, great when running modded since it adds a huge replayability potential, even greater when you throw some challenges and overhauls in the mix. You'll be hardly bored or disappointed for a long time (unlike Elden Ring) but always keep in mind your journey may be surrounded by unbalanced and bugged shit alike.-----* I say ""were"" because many active devs suspended their activities to check out how broken and shitty Elden Ring was gonna be so idk when they will return, IF they return. All their brilliant work still up for everyone at Nexus, of course."
Negative,sad excuse for a new game played both dark souls and honestly this just seems like a remake with a few new things added in and a new story i mean dont get me wrong i love the story but game play is still the same as always
Negative,3d game requires you to face specific direction of 3d object to interact with it
Negative,"Fun? Can be, 200+ hrs speak for themselves.not recommending then why? For at what it is meant to be, it fails miserably:*mobs+bosses hit you through obstacles (dragonslayer armor the fountain/well in the boss stage / whatever corner you kite a mob around, that you cannot hit through - where DS1 and DS2 shine bright (being fair and if you die you die to your own mistake/s) DS3 .... well no way to put that in nice words.*it brandishes a whole new level of NOT-CO-OP ( Cannot pass fog gate to help others / boss not visible and thus non-attackable / being stuck within the fog wall not able to progress / being summoned into pvp as support (BotDM/BS) spawning between rage-giant and monster crab instantly pwning you before your land-animation is even completed / oh so very many more things, that are NOT fair and for the most parts of it quite the opposite of what I deem to be fun)*haxx (purple invaders following you into boss zones) and no way to report people or even get in touch with a CSR-team and YES for christs sake, if someone busts my head and I know his name, the location/timestamp and it's absolutely possible to backtrace that guy, YUP mates I go call the police and expect them doing something about that dude*tech issues several people have (I for example have mini freezes every 10 minutes (exactly) that only occur on DS3. freeze for approx 2 to 4 seconds, then a short frame of accessibility, then another freeze for about half the duration of the former (so 1 to 2 seconds) after that 10 minutes flawless gaming  no matter whether min or max settings)"
Negative,"I really, really wanted to love this game. I've played every Souls game and DLC starting with Demon's Souls and enjoyed every minute of it. And I even started off loving Dark Souls 3; the environment is rich, the world is fascinating, and the combat is everything that previous games have taught me to expect. But then the bugs started showing up. Enemy attacks clip through walls. Enemies get stuck in the ground and still pursue and attack you. The targeting has a nasty tendency to choose the furthest of two options. And the design does little to help these issues. Enemies not only attack through walls, but also target through them. The game's difficulty is higher than in previous games, which I'd normally love, but that only makes things worse when compounded by the technical problems. I love this series, but I honestly have no motivation to finish this game."
Negative,"I would like to tell you more about the gameplay and world of DS3, but i can't. It crashes so often that i can't be asked to bother anymore. Crashes occured randomly, most likely when bonfires where involved. Graphic settings, especially lightning, on low help a great deal but there's still the chance that the game will randomly crash if visiting a bonfire. The issue mentioned above will eventually get fixed but was already known by the time review builds where out. I So, what did they do in the four weeks it has already been released in japan and the two months in which preview builds where out? Was the whole thing just to create coverage instead of creating a meaningful day one patch? I don't have any idea. But for me and many others, the game is barely playable."
Negative,"A soul is precisely what this game lacks...(and probably what some of it's diehard fans lack too)For real overrated doesn't even describe it,Even this being it's 3rd part it still has no moving mouths and endless vague monologues... Like a good friend of mine once said on this matter: ""it's a cheap way to makeup for the lack of story"".You really have to be either a drug addict or stuck with you head in the clouds in order to beable to appreciate that sort of thing because boy let me tell you, this one aint for the down-to-earth amongst us but let's move on to the combat:First you pick a difficulty/class the two are tied together where's Knight is easy and Deprived is hard and all the others are somewhere in between, then after that all you have to do is roll-dodge, attack, repeat oh and sometimes drink a potion when you made a mistake.Don't get me wrong the proper execution of this certainly is hard (yet not as hardcore as people claim).In fact the hardest ever-present bossfight is it's awkward camera angle, that's when this game's difficulty truly shines.Then there's the 'multiplayer' it's sad that it was so half-arsed for it is the only thing that made this game somewhat fun well at times... I guess it's random encounter pvp is there just to add another level of difficulty being matched against random tryhards out there whenether you where just about to save or turn in a quest or just prepping for the usual bossfight. People tend to call it a 'unique' pvp system but it's nowhere near as unique as it's especially unique co-op system: You require items to summon up to two or three friends where's 2 out of the 3 just get instant disconnected most of the time (doesn't refund the item btw) but in the rare occasions it does succeed (after the necessary retry or 6), you've got yourself a party in all colours of the rainbow out there. Now ofcourse there's a way to appear 'normal coloured' in a friend's game but that requires another item, same with the communication emotes by the way which is the epitome of uniqueness: You have to throw rocks at one another in order to say; ""hello, thank you, very good, I'm sorry"" I only got them very late after I finished the game already but that might've been just me. Wish I could've just had a chatbar honestly but yeah sure it's funny I'll give it that...Speaking of humour, the only likeable npc aside the onion knight who has produced the most interesting dialogue so far is probably the blacksmith that says slightly less incoherent stuff with an actual moving mouth! And with him having the only moving mouth in the game I had long suspected of being the secret final boss or somebody important, well more important then that lady that keeps telling you to 'touch the darkness inside her' atleast but ah well...Now I could go on for abit there (there's quite alot of points to still comment on) but as I've received this game as a gift from a friend I find it rude to stomp it any further. That's right I never would've gotten or played this game if it wasn't gifted to me, heck I'd be ashamed to have this shitty game in my library otherwise. Especially after witnessing how abysmal it's first game already was back on one of them consoles at the time.But for real I'll stop there, you see I'm not usually one for writing long ass reviews on a piece of scat but what can I say... the quarantine has hit me hard enough to waste some words on this shit-stain within my library. In short:Couldn't get enough out of it's previous parts already? Then go ahead by all means buy it, you probably won't be disappointed for this is exactly that very same game (roll-dodge to win + no moving mouths or coherent story included).New to Dark Souls and thinking of giving this 'RPG' a spin? I would really suggest to pass on this one... In all the time I was playing this lineair shizzle I kept thinking: ""Hey I could give Dragons Dogma another try, heck even Dragon Age... or some other RPG"" along the way I was even thinking of Namco's field expertise and conjuring up thoughts of giving their actual good games a try like Tekken. And after snarky comments like: ""You're just old!"" , ""you just don't like hard games"" I suddenly realized I started to miss games like (2D) Castlevania and Metroid or other games that are genuinely hard without the help of an awkward 3rd person camera and 'ring outs' in way too small fighting arenas (or oversized bosses, take a pick). You see I think this is one of those games that tried to be a little of each genre but came out pretty mediocre in each of these. So again don't go expecting a solid RPG, a fighter or a proper metroidvania because it aint.+it works with a mouse + keyboard (I've played the entire game with it due to the lack of a controller at the time and can safely say it is doable -ish)-it doesn't show which keys do what (yeah you have to figure out those yourself by trial and error but that's just extra gameplay right?)I was asked to give my personal opinion on the matter, take it for what it is."
Negative,"Dark Souls 1 had the best PVEDark Souls 2 had the best PVPDark Souls 3 has the best graphics.Do not play it if you plan to mainly PVP, you will not have fun. But i'll keep playing it anyways because I am a huge masochist with no self respect."
Negative,Everything fucking tracks. For no reason. Worst in the series.
Negative,"Camera and target controls are FUCKING BULLSHIT, specially for bosses.  Game is nice, but camera system is BULLSHIT"
Negative,One word..... CRAP!!!
Negative,"I played most souls games on console an liked them so I wanted to give the PC version a try. But this PC port sucks hard. Cant even properly get though the character creation as only controller keys are shown and you can't click to confirm some changes. The mouse sensitivity settings are a joke, even on lowest settings its way to fast. Bought an hour ago an will uninstall it before even playing. What a waste of money."
Negative,"I hardly ever write reviews. I felt compelled to write one for this in the hopes of preventing someone from making a mistake in buying this game for PC. It's a console port, and it's the worst I've ever seen. There is literally NO support for keyboard/mouse. The tutorial doesn't explain keybinds, just controller buttons. You have to literally guess which keybinds correspond to which buttons. Some functions just don't have a keybind equivalent that I could find. If you manage to do figure out the controls, the character movement is still terrible with mouse/keyboard. It's clear they put zero effort into porting this over, yet are still charging $60 for it (I got it on sale). Do NOT buy this game on PC unless you are ok playing with a controller and are ok with supporting zero-effort-cash-grab PC ports. Literally unplayable with mouse/keyboard."
Negative,"So I have been trying to play this game but even with trying every single fps fix I could find online its impossible to get my framerate about 14. This just makes the game unplayable and quite honestly, it's the worst way to end a series on. I can't even give anyone who reads this an indepth view into the game when it comes to how well the game mechanics were etc because it was literally impossible to play at all.I have already contacted support twice (just sent the second email, they ignored me the first time). I don't recommend this game to anyone, it's clearly broken as a lot of people have this issue. If you haven't finished the game at least enough to make it playable, even so longer after it's release... just do everyone a favour and stop making games... This is a disgrace to the amazing series that is Dark Souls."
Negative,"Feels like playing QWOP wile fighting bosses. It only tells you how to use a controller, but there isn't anything telling you how to play on PC. You have to fight the camera the whole time and its hard to see whats going on. Don't buy unless its on sale, and even then i'd suggest against it. Its not worth $15 let alone $60.  Great game idea, Great graphics, Bad mechanics. Reminds me of League of Legends"
Negative,"I think that the best thing I can say about this game is that, the more I played it, the more I liked Dark Souls 1.DS2 was a disappointment, DS3 even more so.I keep reading about how good the combat mechanics is and I am absolutely baffled by this, the combat is pathetic, it is nothing more than spam rolling. People say that 'it's more polished', and I can only think that it's a polished turd."
Negative,"This game has a horrible UI. The UI is incredibly confusing, and if you want to play with a keyboard and mouse, well good luck, everything is labeled for a controller which is just lazy. There's also no way to customize your keybindings, and the entire process is made that much more frustrating by glitches in the UI that make things jump around in unexpected ways."
Negative,"There is a known bug with rolling-buffered-inputs that has not been fixed, Problems with connecting to friends online to play multiplayer. These two glaring issues ruin any enjoyjment of the game. Rip off"
Negative,I thought they were kidding.
Negative,"I Platinumed this game on PS4. Overall, this game is quite simply a clunkfest where your character has the ability to do insane damage. But, in order to do that damage, you need to farm like crap. Overall, 4/10. I loved the Nameless King fight as well as the Champion Gundyr section of the game. Irithyl Dungeon (and to anyone who has been through that hell, I commend you on your dedication) was the most disappointing area of the whole game. In my opinion, Demon Souls is still the best souls game. Personally, I would rather pick up Sekiro or Bloodborne. Bloodborne is a faster, more aggressive take on Dark Souls. Sekiro is an amazing stray from the repetitive combat of Dark Souls or Bloodborne. I hope to get around to playing this game on PC, I just haven't had time."
Negative,"Yeah, i got ""penalised"" for having invalid data when i played the game despite not having done ANYTHING even remotely close to a glitch or hack, AT ALL, EVER!.fix your online systems, fromEdit: with the most recent patches i was un-penalised, and the game was balaanced very well, so i can honestly say, i love this game, and would recomend it, as the ban waves affecting innocent poeple have been stoppedanother edit:i spoke too soon. i was apparently softbanned once more for, again, NO REASON. im dont with this game. gonna go back to BB cause that game at least works, and dosn't ban you for no reasonone final edit: it's april 17 2018. i've been un-softbanned and re-softbanned twice more.if dark souls remastered has this same anticheat system i'm refunding it"
Negative,"Still the buggy, wonky hit box, monotone game you've played four times before. If you're into that, cool, if you're not, not cool.That whole crash bug with the fire pits is the most idiotic thing in the world too. It's like if Super Mario Brothers crashed when you jumped on a Goomba. How do you not find that bug in quality testing? It's harder to avoid the bug than to stumble on it.If you haven't played the series before, get an earlier version. It's cheaper, and not much has changed. If you have played the series before and hate it, you'll hate this game.If you have played the series before and love it, you'll love this game.Pretty simple."
Negative,"Cannot even launch, bad port for PC. Too bad. Until they fix this don't buy this ****"
Negative,camera is fucking abysmal
Negative,"This game has some of the strengths that made the original Dark Souls amazing, but ruins a lot of those strengths with its other flaws.This game lacks the slower paced, more strategic game play of either of its predecessors, trading that off for faster paced combat. Weather that is preferred or not by any player is entirely based upon them.For me, though, I don't have the reaction time required to do what this game asks of me. No matter how much I play or practice, I can't change the fact that I wasn't born with a reaction speed high enough to respond to the enemies in this game. I honestly think this game is amazing for people who have that talent - but If you don't, there's zero accommodation for you.Enemy attacks are barely telegraphed at all, and come out extremely quickly. With the removal of the poise mechanic, many alternative play styles have been removed as well. That means that where in the older games you could Taylor your build to your own strengths and weaknesses, you simply can't do that here.""Slow"" weapons attacks come out in less than a second. ""Fast"" weapon attacks are nearly instant. Quite frankly, this game isn't really anything like Dark Souls at all.The world is entirely linear - you can kiss the open, sprawling and beautifully crafted Lordran goodbye.Struggling through an area, hoping to god there's a checkpoint around the next corner? That's gone. Now there's a checkpoint around every bend. Sometimes twice, side by side.You can't go down your own path - there's a specific, set in stone route through this game that you can't deviate from whatsoever. there are some side areas, but as far as doing things in whatever order you want, that's gone.Just want to point out here - at the start of Dark Souls 1, imediatly from firelink shrine, there are more than 10 areas immediately accessible for you to explore. (The great hollow, undead burg, darkroot garden, the cavern of drakes, blighttown, demon ruins, New londo ruins, Ash lake and more.)This game gives you 1. And when you beat that 1 area, you get 1 more. And so on and so forth, until the game is over.Enemies scream at you. A lot. The enemy design is no longer story driven, lore rich immersive, but instead biological horror, and ear splitting screaming.Graphically, everything is brown and gray. There's hardly any color on anything. I don't know where this comes from - the game looks like mud. The OG game has bright, vibrant colors are areas, all the time. It was beautiful. that's gone.This game refrences the OG game constantly, like it knows its a masterpeice, but proceded to carry over nothing good from it. I don't understand why the devs of these games never even tried to make anything like the origional game ever again.DS2 was full of BS traps and instant kills, terrible hitboxes, ect. This game isn't even anything like either of those games.The sucess of this franchise saddens me, in a way, since I think DS1 is a true masterpiece of a game. I wish that another developer could make something similar without it being a ""souls clone"", and that completely diferent games like this, which have NOTHING to do with dark souls beyond the title alone, would not be considered a ""souls like"" game. Or even a souls game for that matter.All that defines this genre anymore is difficulty. And that's a huge loss."
Negative,"Very underwhelming game. With the amount of hype this game received, I thought I would finally buy it and get stuck in. I like the whole dark lore of it and the intro into the game is really neat. It really got me hyped up. But when the game started, I was met with clunky controls and movement, and subpar fighting mechanics. There isn't much of a story line to go along with it either so I felt like I was just playing another hack and slash game. The AI have no intelligence and there is not much in the way of strategising attacks. One thing I do appreciate is the level of difficult this game offers. You will die! All in all, it's just a basic hack and slash game that looks good, but just doesn't hold my attention."
Negative,"I simply cannot suggest this game if you plan to use it for the PVP aspect.No care was put into it, it hardly functions and you'll end up with a laggy mess 90% of the time."
Negative,i rellay dont like tbhis game its really hard and im reallhy really bad0.
Negative,"This game runs at 60 fps in 2021, its more clunky than a game from 1998, i would rather play farm ville on a android tablet"
Negative,"i think i would rather stuff my ears with tin foil and microwave my own head than try to stay awake for another minute playing this over appreciated bad pc port of the hottest of boring critically acclaimed garbage, dark souls nerds, you owe me some wedgies for making me feel like i needed to try this again"
Negative,"Dark Souls is punishing1. Start the game with zero info and end the game with almost none. Average players will require wiki to learn anything.2. Every enemy pretty much kills you when you first encounter it, then you're sent back to restart the whole area. Die again? Punished again. All enemies respawn as well, so you better hope you can beat that enemy which killed you or repeat again.3. Bosses are formulaic and require precise memorization to beat. You simply cannot go into the boss fights and win from skill, you MUST memorize. Some great players can, but the developer should empower the player to be able to win on the first try or at least learn then win shortly thereafter. Souls bosses like Nameless King and Pontiff have so many movesets that dying 10+ times is not just common but expected. Every boss attempt that fails requires you to slog through the entire area. You can't even enter the boss fight with full health because enemies can even kill you on the way there!5. The above punishment encourages running past enemies because all you want is to fight the boss again. Your punishment is to speedrun. What you want doesn't matter. Bad design!6. Enemies often lie in wait in key moments. For example, you see an enemy walking but his back is turned. You carefully sneak up but then 3 enemies fall on your head and stun gank you. So many times I died to those dogs in Irithyll that were at the top of the staircase where you could not see. Memory saves your life the second try, not skill.7. Enemy difficulty is artificial- they have ultra health and deal awful amounts of damage. If bosses were truly hard, then they would still be tough even if you and the boss did similar damage with similar health. No, Souls games stack odds against you. Dancer, for example- you can perfectly dodge every attack except the tail end of one spinning combo... you die. This is artificial. It's their bigger numbers vs your lesser numbers=difficult. Apparently, in the Souls fanbase this difficulty is acceptable and rewarding.8. Soulsborne series as a whole and the community encourage exploits. For example, in Bloodborne within the first 20 minutes you're forced to fight two werewolves  blocking your path- Fextralife wiki states to lure them to a house where they get stuck in a door so you can just whale on them. Another example from wiki, Dark Souls 3 prior to the Road of Sacrifices an ice knight which few could beat, you will read to lure it to an elevator shaft where it will stupidly fall to its death. BAD. DESIGN. When this is considered good advice the game is seriously messed up. None of this was even patched.I could go on for another block paragraph but you get it. 128 hours of Dark Souls 3 and 110 hours of Bloodborne, I've learned I love it all for what it does right and overcome its glaring faults. This, plus memorization was required to fully enjoy the series. This should not be so.As for the game itself, it is clunky, full of bugs, camera issues get you killed hourly, crashing is common every 15-60 minutes, massive input lag, server lag (so awful when invaded by players as they skitter all over the place), poor hit detection which is both a cause of death to you but also something you can exploit, walls cause a stun on you if you are too close with a slashing weapon allowing enemies to combo you, stamina system creates undue hardship as you have to manage stamina as if it were just another health bar, shields do almost nothing forcing player to dodge which is not realistic combat for a game which fans praise as realistic.The list of bugs goes on. Most can be overcome, many will persist. So much in battle is considered, including bugs which increases difficulty even more. You will learn to remember not to swing near walls so in a hard fight you have to plan your dodges for better positioning to overcome this dreadful issue. That's my most hated issue.The deadliest enemy in the entire Soulsborne series of games is. the. freakin. CAMERA. It's maddening because every time you fight a boss you are always in a crowded area and the camera is physical so it goes crazy, even reversing direction or flat-out refusing to pan at all because of nearby clutter. A great example, in Bloodborne Gascoigne is in a graveyard and every single tombstone hits the camera causing the above. Cleric beast, you are on a small bridge with a hulking beast whose arms are so long it can swipe the entire width of the bridge and who is so tall locking on will cause you to lose sight of yourself. Yhorm the Giant will absolutely send the camera into a mental hospital. The delevopers are laughing at you.There are innumerable instances where hulking enemies are in tiny halls that you eventually realize this is intentional from the developers. It is not a 8ft tall knight with a sword either, it is an 8ft tall knight in a tiny hallway with a 20ft glaive, but does his weapon hit the walls....... nope but yours does. How ab when an enemy getstuck in a wall, eas kill huh? Nope you cannot hit him but he will hit you.I am done! Rant over. I will likely play this game the rest of my life. Don't ask why. I'd rather not say anything good about it. Off to play more Souls and cut myself because that is how I get meh gost these days.P.S. The Souls series fanbase has regular ""Souls-bashing"" thread watchers. Just like every other forum and post that a newbie complains on, there will be 500 Souls fans on patrol to make him into a liar and a troll. Don't be fooled. These people patrol forums more than they play the game. Actual statistic shows only 10% of people who play Souls games ever finish, so they represent an extreme minority. Prepare for the trolling if you play this game then bash it."
Negative,"What do you do when your game is so badly polished graphics wise, it consumes way more out of a GPU than it should? Why it's simple! Increase the GPU minimum requirements from a GTX 465 to a GTX 750. And just my luck. I got so excited about DS3 coming out I didn't notice the changes they made for the minimum requirements just as the game got released. 85€ and 40 frustrating hours later, I came to learn how refunds work! You can all guess how that worked out for me. Since I ""played"" over 2 hours and all.I lowered all my settings to minimum, kept fiddling with the resolution, downgrade graphics drivers... The game isn't playable for it keeps sending me to offline mode because of some fps drops every now and then.The game itself is fantastic. Better than DS2 from the little I was able to play:- Combat is much more fluid- Online PVP is more polished than DS2- All the beauty regular DS players can relate toFromSoftware simply couldn't care less about people with a 3 year old laptop that's all. And why should they?My specs:ASUS N46VBGeforce GT 740M i7-3630QM @ 2.4 GHz16 GB RAMSources: http://www.pcgamer.com/dark-souls-3-system-requirements-revealed/               https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/4bxbwk/fromsoftware_has_revised_the_pc_requirements_for/And a note to Valve. Because of these situations where companies revise the game minimum requirements, why don't you add a Steam feature where before buying a game, Steam checks your computer specs so it warns the user the game might not run properly?"
Negative,"I love everything dark souls. I think DS3 is a truly amazing game. But thats the problem, its unplayable. I have tried all the fixes and all the work arounds. Around 5-6 hours through the game just doesnt want to boot up. I love you dark souls, but this was a problem day 1, and its still a problem now."
Negative,A lot of issues in this game that aren't fixed yet. Spent all of my money on this shit game and now I am broke. Dark Souls 2 was way better than this piece of shit.
Negative,Good Game but worst Dark Souls. Level design is linear corridor after corridor.
Negative,match making with friends sucks
Negative,"Dark Casul III Prepare to ban editionGame (offlline) ---> 5,5/10Game (online) ---> ?/?I don't know!!! I'm banned :DBandai looks as Riot..."
Negative,"I am having nothing but problems with this port. I thought after several weeks/months these issues would have been resolved, but even at low settings I am frequently dropping to 12-15 fps. To make matters worse, the game won't allow you to play in online mode with a low framerate. Your game session also terminates if your framerate falls too far. The entire UI is obviously designed for console users, and there isn't even a quit to desktop function. You have to exit from the main menu.Other than that, the game is itself is pretty fun. The difficulty is what you would expect, and the sword play is faster than Dark Souls II. I just can't recommend the game due to its bugginess. I shouldn't be getting drops like this on a 390x."
Negative,I hate this game so much I bought it a 2nd time once on the ps4 and now on pcThis game is the hardest I have ever played. The fights are unbalanced asf and the only tip is to git gud. Don't let my play time fool you I have played this game enough to know what I am talking about. Dark Souls 3 is fun only when you defeat that enemy who has killed you 6 times before. This game will give you headaches and make you break your controller. Do I recommend this game? No and yes. Do you hate yourself and have nothing else to do then play dark souls 3.Are you bored and have eternity to waste play dark souls 3.
Negative,"well for starters i cant even get the game to run whatsoever and every attempt at trying to fix the problem (which i should not have to do in the first place) does absolutly nothing to even get the game to open. i have tried running it on my main 1terabyte harddrive multiple times and no dice and even moved it over to my 128GB SSD and still nothing. this is only the tip of the ice burg however as many users are stating the game runs like garbage and even on some pretty good pc's the game will run at around 10 or 15 fps and not only that but crashes after the first boss and at pretty much every bonfire. im afaid i cant reccomend this game at all as it is so broken that it wont even start up or go to the main menu for christ sake. i have done everything in my power such as: running in high priorety, changing resolution and some graphics options in the INI file, reinstalling multiple times and once to another hard drive. i have been looking forward to this game and to see that it wont even start up makes me think that the dev team had absolutly no idea what they were doing when they were making this game."
Negative,"tl;dr: Great bosses, fun PvP, and (in my opinion) bad general PvE due to inconsistent enemies. Very short game compared to DS1 and DS2.I loved both DS1 and DS2 SotfS and have spent countless hours playing them.  Just like the aforementioned games, DS3 offers a lot of weapon and armor variety. It introduces weapon stances which you can activate by holding L2 and pressing either R1 or R2 while two-handing your weapon. The infusion mechanic from DS2 has been revamped and makes it so that any weapon can fit into every single build (e.g. sharpening gives the weapon a lot of DEX scaling).  The power stance mechanic introduced in DS2 has sadly been removed and was replaced by weapons that come in pair right out of the box. Two-handing them causes you to switch your off-hand weapon to a second copy of your hain-hand weapon.  Armor upgrades have also been removed, which is great in my opinion.  Switching covenants no longer has any negative consequences as opposed to DS1 & DS2.  The graphics are absolutely stunning and the level design felt good. There are a lot of things to discover; exploring is rewarded.  DS3 features the best boss fights out of the entire series in my opinion. So far, every fight felt challenging and fair. I don't like how you are required to summon certain NPCs to your boss fights in order to unlock certain things or to progress some quest lines. I'd rather fight them alone.  However, poise has received a large overhaul as well; ""passive"" poise is no longer a thing, meaning a hit with a butter knife will stagger a player wearing Havel's armor, unless they are in the middle of swinging with a large weapon (""hyper armor""). Getting hit during an attack wind-up will still stagger your and will cancel the attack.  Not all weapon types and weapon actions benefit from hyper armor though: In a nutshell, straight swords only benefit from hyper armor during their R2 stance, greatswords during two-handed attacks and stances and ultra greatswords gain its benefits during every action. There are some weapon specific exceptions of course.  But some PvE enemies you will encounter still seem to have ""passive"" poise on top of seemingly infinite stamina, turning PvE using smaller weapons into an annoyingly frustrating experience that feels more unfair than hard.  I can't comment on PvP weapon variety though. The builds I have seen during invasions seemed pretty varied."
Negative,"Another sloppy PC port. No direct optimization what so ever, only indirect due to fixes assocated with the base game affecting console players. Simply targets a specific demographic as if PC is ""a console"" itself.If you do not meet the minimum requirements (or equivalent) do not expect to play this game even on the lowest of settings. Minimum requirements also neglect to state recommended RAM type/speed. Any random assortment of RAM will not be ""just fine"" as it can lead to anything from memory leaks to requiring inflating your virtual memory to trick the game.It offers a wide variety of arbitrary resolutions and graphic settings. Arbitrary as the minimum requirements are equivalent to the highest quality the console versions expect to have. The lowest possible settings serve almost no purpose except for inclusion purposes, as any meaningful graphical options are locked away. You are effectively given a limited selection of choices between ""on"" or ""off"" and ""good"" or ""not as good"".**Tip for PC performance: This game loves to hoard your resources (CPU/RAM/VRAM/etc) even if it isn't using them effectively. Disable or close any program that isn't required to run Steam or Dark Souls 3. (Something simple as Windows Defender can cripple performance!)****Tip for not getting banned: Clean install of Windows, clean install Graphics Drivers (no extra programs like 3D Vision or Geforce Experience), clean install of Steam (don't bother installing other games, they might install extra stuff) with clean install of Dark Souls 3. If your KB+M or controller isn't accepted by default don't bother using it.**"
Negative,"This game destroys the grandeur of Dark Souls 1's world, characters and lore."
Negative,"Wow, what a really bad port to PC, it's as if they went, meh.....who cares we've made our money lets fleece people some more with a half done port.......I would not recommend."
Negative,funn little pas time </3
Negative,too easy :(
Negative,Потраченного времени жаль.
Negative,"though this game is exremely good ,exinting and as hard as it has too be i will give this game a thumbs down since i got banned for no fucking reason and even though i deleted all my character in an effort to get this ban off me (i got banned for picking up hacked item) nothing happend its been 4 fucking months and i am still banned. If you are looking for a solid experience buy this game its fun but getting banned becuase their protection aigenst hackers is so bad that it cant recognise who hacked and who didnt makes me extremely angry"
Negative,"It is a nice game but if you format you HDD you lose your character and progress because it does not use steam-cloud for whatever reason.I had a level 215 character , finished the game 3 times and i was in my 4th play.Playing this game was a mean of relaxation for me after getting out of work every day.I was forced to change a few PC parts and had to reinstall windows.I am disappointed in steam and i'm also disappointed in the developer for not having a contingency plan in place for this."
Negative,"Several issues:    Bad networking (seemingly no improvement over previous souls games, most likely even worse)    Related to the issue above: Many players do not have animations and float in space. Bosses get glitched out due to them (easy kill) and if you have to fight someone like that you may as well jump to your death and not waste time.    Boring bosses: Almost always same old same old    Monsters, bosses and people will hit you during a dodgeroll 50% of the times    Free bans for everyone, even those that don't cheat    Pvp highly unbalanced    Anti-invading game. Why they didn't just remove invading, since apparently they hate that feature, I have no idea. Enjoy constant 1vs3!    Optional: If you really want to ruin your own experience go summon help for every bossfight. And don't just summon one ally to help you, summon three! It is such a blast playing Dark Souls 3 Go gank bosses 3vs1 simulator!Aside from those issues the game is fun to play through once. NG+ might as well not exist since it adds NOTHING new."
Negative,"EDIT: Okay so this is my second review for Dark Souls 3. So I wanted to write this because of the updates since my original review (You can see it at the bottom).Now on to some important changes I think made this game tolerable. So they fixed the frame rate issues and some other errors.BUT GOD FUCKING DAMMIT DARK SOULSSo i played through the full game around 4 times and did a bunch of pvp. So leaving aside THE FUCKING FANFARE THAT IS THE EARLY GAME its a pretty quality single player game. So i played through and was ultimately pretty satisfied. I loved the extra areas and npc's i found my second time around. Soo..   Pros:- End game is fun- Lots of error fixes- Visible improvements since releaseCons:- Lots of reskinned enemies (feels like the ds2 DLC's)- Terrible story telling that is somehow worse that DS2and finally the fucking PVP. HERE COMES ANOTHER RANT BITCHES. The pvp is what you get when you take a perfectly innocent puppy and shove a firecracker up its ass while 4 men stand around kicking it. THIS FUCKIGN DESCRIBES THE 10v1 GANK THAT IS THIS FUCKING PVP.So lets break it down a little moreGANKS: With no limit to what the fucking cunts of hosts can do the game turns into a chinese sweatshop. They will send infinite waves of phantoms at you to fight. But wait they also fight you simaltaneously. Its like that scene from indiana jones where they guy gets swarmed by and they crawl up inside of him.SUNNY D ADDICTS: Being usually an invader I end up fighting about 2 phantoms and a host. So I play it smart and chip away at the hosts health using the environment to my advantage. And he drinks some estus. I do it again. And he drinks some estus. I do it again. And he drinks some estus. I do it again. And he drinks some estus. I do it again. And he drinks some estus. I do it again. And he drinks some estus. I do it again. And he drinks some estus. I do it again. And he drinks some estus. I do it again. And he drinks some estus. I do it again. And he drinks some estus. I do it again. WHO THE FUCK CREATED THIS CRUEL SYSTEM. Between the hosts and phantoms a good 20 something flasks are fucking chugged only for me to be lag killed.THE LAG: Do I really need to explain this bullshitUpdated Rating: 2/10 disable onlineand as promised heres my original reviewOriginal review:WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK DARK SOULSSo i have been a dark souls fan for years and I would say that ds1 and ds2 are two of my favourite games of all time. I was waiting for so long in a state of sheer excitement for the game and THIS IS THE PIECE OF SHIT I GET. FIRST OF ALL THIS GAME DROPS FRAMES SO FUCKING HARD ITS RIDICULOUS. NOW BEFORE YOU PIN THIS PROBLEM ON MY COMPUTER I WOULD LIKE TO SAY I COULD RUN WITCHER 3 ON MY COMPUTER FINE. Now this isn't a big issue considering the sheer size of the game but that isnt even close to everything wrong with this game.1. This game didnt make me give a single fuck about the story line. I remember watching the intro to ds1 and ds2 and I felt absolutely captivated. I wanted to rekindle that flame if it meant me lighting my literal fucking body on fire. The second i got into this game I was excited. So i made a character, jumped in and immedeatly was fucking lost. One of the biggest parts of the souls games was the STORY AND IT FEELS LIKE THEY TOOK A POTENTIALY GOOD STORY AND SAID FUCK IT LETS THROW IT IN THE DLC2. THE FUCKING COMBAT. I loved the pace of dark souls 1. You would encounter these powerful enemies and you would find yourself trying to find every weakness and ways to beat the enemy. I loved the fights where it was you and a boss like sif staring each other down both trying to get a few good hits in before dodging away. THIS GAME FEELS LIKE IM STICKING A FUCKING FORK IN A TOASTER. Here's is the AI in ds1 ""Well if i move back I can get him into this trap and one of us will block his exit"". Here's the AI in ds3 ""Slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash"".

Negative,"Dark Souls 3, where do I even begin?I have played three different classes. All with different methods of fighting. I have died more times than I can count and have lost more souls than I want to think about. I have died practically every way imaginable and still keep tripping up on some of simplest errors. This is by far the most punishing installment of the franchise.I have clocked around eighty hours into this game and, after finally forcing my way across the rooftops of The Great Archives, do not think I will be finishing. I, personally, simply do not have the patience or fortitude left to see it through to the end.However, If seeing you're character repeatedly slaughtered, eaten and thrown around with all the grace of a ragdoll is your idea of fun, then I have some good news, you won't be dissapointed."
Negative,"Well, nice gamedesign etc. but broken hitboxes in pvp, heavy lag issues and broken camera controls."
Negative,This game is a piece of shit.
Negative,"GAME SUCKS, VERY HARD AND ANNOYING. SPAWN POINTS ARE SHIT, YOU TO HAVE TO WALK 1 MILLION MILES TO THE NEAREST BOSS AND THEN YOU GET KILLED BY SOME MOB WALKING IN FRONT OF YOU. that being said, I finished the game and it was rather fun. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE EXPERIENCE"
Negative,Poise is broken. Armor is useless. And don't tell me about hyperarmor. I know how it works.
Negative,"Very good game, very shit playerbase, amplified by the fact hackers can just get your account banned/restricted on the pc version, play offline or on console if you want to have a good experience"
Negative,THIS GAME IS COMPLETELY UMPLAYABLE WITHOUT AN xbox CONTROLLER AND FANTASTIC REFLEXES. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY.
Negative,"Dark III is complete garbage and I do not even plan on finishing the game any time soon. And here is why:1. POISE - Every Enemie in the game has poise. Some have more, some have less and some you can even stagger if you roll against them. This is totally fine and is indeed a good mechanic, there is just minor oversight to it that ruins the whole gameplay. You have none. No matter what the game tells you and tries to make you believe poise would be a thing for player characters, it is not. You get staggerd by every minor hit and get comboed to death.2. COMBOS - Enemies have attack patterns and when you learn them you eventually ""git gud"" at this game. There is again just one minor problem. Seemingly endless combos. I have counted and came across quiet a few enemies who did quiet fair damage and were able to perform a combo of 6! This is ridiculous. You do not even have to be caught in one of those it is just the fact that enemies seem to have endless stamina when it comes to attacks, just as they would not use any of their stamina to perform them. Still you can cause a guardbreak to them through attacking their shields (if they have any).3. SHIELDS - They are not good for blocking anything, because of above mentioned endless combos. If you are not good at parrying or plan on becoming so, or do not plan on using a greatshild, do not bother to throw them all away.4. PARRYING - I seriously do not know what is wrong with this mechanic in DARK III, but it feels very broken. I often get partial parries and take all the penalties of that (partial health and higher stamina loss), but still parry the enemie and can perform a counterattack. And this ca. 50% of my parries. the rest are actual parries or I miss them. Maybe I am just off, but then again, why get a partial and the parry at the same time?5. ARMOR - Armor is worthless. It makes nearly no difference in regards of defense nor in poise (due to its abscence). the only serious difference is if you wear armor, or not. It just does not matter which kind, how heavy, how much poise or how much defense it says it gives to you. Thus, making the stats of any armor almost useless, it all breaks down to fashion souls. take what you like and do not give a fuck about defenses.6. ENEMIES - Well, there are enemies, that are quiet difficult to defeat, but only if you are not dealing high enough poise damage to them, or get staggerd because you have no poise. There are no ""special"" enemies, just annoying ones that are hard to defeat because of their artificial difficulty. For example, there is a enemie type that drains your health in an enormous tempo, just by looking at you. And they not only take the health out of your healthbar, they take the whole goddamn thing. So there is no chance for you to heal and keep going. You HAVE TO wait for your healthbar to return, until you can continue fighting or you WILL die if you are not fast enough. This mechanic is sick and shows us where Dark Souls has come to - complete garbage -.7. BOSS ENEMIES - Nothing much to say about them. They are not necessarily uninspired, but very plain. No real intense fights with them, nor any big challenges. If one is hard to defeat, call a summon and get done. You will not miss any spectacular bossfight.8. COVENANTS - You can change your covenant at any given time, due to the fact that there are now items that symbolize the bond to your covenant. There are no real good rewards and as far as known, only two covenant tiers for every covenant. One tier for turning in ten and a second for turning in 30 covenant items at the shrine, or leader. The only real interesting covenant is the one (not saying any names here, because of spoilers) where you can decide to be a good or a bad phantom. Absolutely dumb is also the mechanic, that you now get the item related to your actual covenant, if you invade as a red phantom and kill the host. This is just a poor excuse for not giving you any, specialy valuable and strictly strained reward for ranking up in the individual covenants.9. NPCs - They have at least questlines. Some are quiet interesting to pursue and some are not. But I did not experience any major twists.10. Weapons - Mostly copy pasted from previous Dark games. Just a few exceptions and not really worth mentioning here.11. Magic - Never used and never plan to do so. Until now it seems to be pretty useless.12. PVP - Quick weapons outplay almost everything, because you can be staggered by everything and ganking is still what people love the most. In the end I do not recommend this game to anyone. Atleast not for that much money. If you want to take part in the Dark series, stick with DS I, still by fare the best of the series, sadly. I do not speak english as my native language so do not hate on that."
Negative,"Elden Ring is out and doing well, fix the online."
Negative,Character controlling is too rough.
Negative,"Sekiro > Dark Souls, fight me."
Negative,worst souls game
Negative,I dont like this bitchass dragon so called midir the shit eater
Negative,i hate the abyss watcher antichrist
Negative,Well I know that I am going against the grain here but this game appears to be a bad choice if you are a keyboard and mouse player. All in game prompts are referencing controller buttons and not the keybinds which is to say the least extremely frustrating. Lacking any in game options to select a keyboard and mouse I can only wonder why it was ever ported to the PC when other third person games can work perfectly well without a controller.I'm sure it is a good game but as someone who does not get on well with a controller I have to down vote this game for the shoddy lack of development on the support of non control pad players.
Negative,"After watching this game on twitch, youtube and also reading the reviews on steam, my brother and I were sold. This game looked amazing. We were so excited to spend hours in this game playing.After we downloaded and installed it, we ran into a pretty game breaking issue. (at least for us.) The control definitions in game are set to ONLY XBOX. We use a mouse and keyboard so we had no idea what to press to even navigate through the main menu. We also own PS4 controllers so we tried those. After plugging those in, the control definitions still were set to xbox only and would not change. The mouse kept moving around where ever I pointed my controller. We spent about 45 minutes just in the main menu trying to navigate around and learn the controls.We are very sad we wont be able to play this game because of this. Maybe if they add an update to support keyboard and mouse we might come back."
Negative,"Its good, but the Ringed city dlc is a bit too much (it is hardcore, but if its too hardcore then not so enjoyable anymore), Ashes of ariandel is ok yet, but hoped to see more there lol:- i do not like the idea to parry automatically when i break someones shield (it can not be a back stab as i am face to face, not behind- it is a huge downside of this game cause it is not logical)- most of the enemys  can hit trough the wall- not possible (huge downside)- It is actually annoying when someone invades at the same time when i have some business with some strong enemy (i wish my own worlds mobs can hit that invader too, not only me- then its even then)If you can change that Ringed city dlc then i can give a better thumbs up!"
Negative,this game fucking sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Negative,"these are some of the most immersive and amazing games ever created by a mans hands... its a shame the ""difficulty"" is absolutely broken and unnecessarily hard. you're completely at the mercy of whatever the fuck the game feels like trowing at you. sometimes its just total luck that you make it through. sometimes you have to repeat a boss over and over just to learn some bs move sets. its a life ruining experience. these games would be perfect 10/10 masterpieces, but alas, these fuckign geniuses couldn't scale down the garbage impossibilities of dark souls."
Negative,"I wish I would'nt have bought this game period.Steam's refund ""Under 2 hour playtime"" policy does'nt suit for this kind of game to properly assess whether you like it not, especially given that you might be hyped based on the assumption of its predecessor's quality. As is my case. Liked DS1, and love DS2, because of its tactical/""cleaner""/slower combat gameplay for one. Now, why I dont' like this game:1) Why de fek bring Bloodborne into the Souls universe in any shape or form!!!1.1) Bloodborne visual style elements detract from the Souls world... this is medieval and fantasy combined not Victorian times! And those elongated humanoid forms are the worst!1.2) Bloodborne mashy-flashy combat mechanics  made its way into the Dark Souls world and it's not welcome here to say the least! The combat flow is less controllable now - just feels mashy and frustratingly so! Kilometric dodge distances, insane AUTO-TRACKING! Weapon hit boxes totally out whack... 360 degrees spinnable polearms in tight corridors are a norm lol! Weapon tactical depth seems non-existant because of that. All weapons have high angle coverage, what it comes down to most of the time is to simply mash attack until stamina depletes. Weapon ""sweet spots"" they don't seem to be present anymore :( Also weapon poise damage is unknown or not listed. You can take the mace and stun no one except the lizard semi-boss in the tutorial area lol! 2) PC controls are a mess yet again (though it can be mediated via AutoHotkey as with DS2), however because of the new faster combat overall they have more negative impact than previously... kick, jump attacks especiall come to mind.3) Enemies (especially bosses and semi-bosses) have less tactical depth to them than I would like... they attack without remorse or any sense of stamina existence... Bosses and semi-bosses especially are very hard to ""read"" what they gonna do next, therefore the learning curve comes down only to Trial&Error. They seem to attack non-stop until you DIE! Sense of tension comes only from frustration in your mind, because most of the time you have no sense of control of what's going on in the figth and learn enemies pattern of behaviour. There are simple enemies that are satisfying to fight against, but others - not so... Overall fights feel chaotic more than anything, which punishes you, but fails to prompt any notion as to what was your mistake other than getting on the hype train and letting yourself get addicted to this game.FromSoftware feels tired of the Dark Souls and its genre (yet reluctant for bring innovation) and that's what I took from this purchase."
Negative,"This game becomes a joke really with all the hackers. I'm in the Ringed City dlc trying to go down to the dragon boss, at first everything seems fine, summon sign is still on n all of a sudden I see the Ladder that u need to go down to the boss is not there anymore, my summon sign isnt on anymore, didnt hear a sound of an invader n then all of a sudden ""invader has invaded you"" shows up I try running, the guy is invisable n im just getting hit while I jump down to the lower floor level.  My game then freezes n idk how to find the person's steam account to report or maybe there is no way. If you haven't already played this game I would say don't buy it, u will waste ur time n just get mad at all the hackers. Save ur money until the company fixes their shit!!!"
Negative,Can't recommend until they fix the game's crashes.
Negative,I hate this game
Negative,1/10 drop chance for clerics chime not high enough
Negative,not good game
Negative,What a joke
Negative,"been playing this game for a while but i cant get past the freaking guy where you pull the sword out of him and before anyone says ""git gud"" just know that ive been practicing but i still cant do it this game is bs"
Negative,makes me feel sad
Negative,"I really like souls games but this one doesn't click with me. I gave DS3 an honest few tries but im bored to tears when I play this entry. If it at least made me angry, I would bother with completing it but I literally feel nothing towards the game besides boredom."
Negative,"Me and my friends bought this game because it was advertised as a CO-OP game, we had heard of it and thought it would be so much fun to play together. Now Im not here to complain about the game itself, even though it is very difficult, I still have fun playing it, its not about the difficulty. My problem is that its also advertised as being a co-op game. But the co-op is literally unplayable. First of all, theres no way to invite people into your lobby or anything, its extremely complicated and the only way to find out how to play with friends is by watching a video, there no server selection menu or join button at all, its extremely to complicated. First of all, you need to go to the shop and buy a ""Silver Soap Stone"" and then go to a certain location and put it on the ground, and your friend in their own server has to summon you. (This  is allready too complicated, why isnt their just an ""invite to world"" option??) Once you get into your friends game, you will realize that you cannot pickup anything in the world or get any items from the enemies, only the host gets any items, this makes progress hard for you but the host is experiencing the whole game. Another HUGE thing, which should NOT be in the game is that, when you die in your friends lobby (which if you didnt know, happens A LOT in Dark Souls) it kicks you from the game and you have to redo the steps such as placing the soap stone on the ground and summoning your friend again. I literally dont understand why any of this has to be in the game, its way too tedious, and unnecessary. Fun game, but should NOT be marked as a CO-OP game until these are fixed, I wouldnt recommended buying this game if you are looking to play this with friends, its too annoying..."
Negative,"I do not recommend this game to anyone, especially if you have enjoyed Witcher 3 already. It's a lot like Witcher 3 except worse in all imaginable ways. Playing on a PC -> does not compute, get used to being given useless instructionsControls are less than perfect -> that's funny, can't really change themThe movement and the fighting are really clunky.The enemy designs are unimaginative.There is very little meaningful story to drawn me in, which isn't usually a deal breaker for me. I really enjoyed Holllow Knight which was similar is this regard, but because of the reasons stated above I can't hang.Unless you're hungry for a tediously dark and lonely game of clunky fantasy violence do not purchase.Oh yea and they even make it laborious to quit the game..."
Negative,"Thought this would be better than DS1. Nope. Same shitty camera work, and sometimes even worse than in DS1 (Nameless King's 1st phase, I'm looking at you!). Shitty hitboxes and collisions, enemies can hit you through stone pillars but your sword gets bounced off the same pillar (yeah, right), key presses still sometimes not registered. Backstab won't work half the time.Batteries in controller deplete in the middle of a fight, and you get rekt. GG WP. Why not bring up the menu? Because fuck you, that's why.Oh, and a promising DLC, The Ringed City, was somehow made as annoying as it could possibly get, for unknown reason. Like, for example, stupid motherfucking huge respawning summoners.This game (and DS1 as well) has cool vibes, great level design, possibility of creating dozens of builds, nice atmosphere, etc. Why ruin this all by ridiculously fucking moronic design choices?"
Negative,"A great installment in the souls series. Grab the season pass on a sale if you want a great singleplayer experience.Why don't recommend? There is no multiplayer. You get banned for NO reason.I have played for 200 hours online with one character, built him up to about level 400 just because (farming locust priests really gets you going), ng6+ was just about to get done. BUT the last 14 hours i played solo and offline so no chance of getting banned by a hacker (as people state), no hacks applied by me and all of all nothing irregular. I logged on today as i thought i could give it a go and boom. Banned for ""invalid save data"". As there is no indicator on WHAT got you banned you can't do anything but delete all your save files (F you, 200 hours down the drain) and wait... i don't know how long to get unbanned. So for a SP game this is great. Get help for bosses from npcs, but if you want to play with friends; nope. This will be short fun."
Negative,"I really like this game BUT THE PC-PORT IS JUST BROKEN!It keeps crashing, and crashing and crashing. Please fix it!"
Negative,dark souls 3 fucking sucks but some of the best times of my life were spent doing pvp with the lads at the usual spot.
Negative,It's an okay game.
Negative,Another lazy port of a decent game.
Negative,"If you planned to play this on PC only, don't bother. No controls work, it still shows prompts for console on screen (!) and you are not even able to exit the game properly. Without a controller, the game interface/controls are just absolute travesty! For 60usd game, this is completely ridiculous. Extremely disappointed, my gameplay ended even before I had a chance to play."
Negative,Dude fuck this game.
Negative,ruined my life
Negative,So many bugs so sad
Negative,"I have no patience for this game. I'd tell you to google the definition of insanity, but instead of the Far Cry 3 quote I was thinking of, it basically says I'd have to be mentally ill to enjoy repeatedly dying in this game. Close enough."
Negative,"It's not a bad game, however it. Like Darksous 2 has the same flaw. If your using the keyboard and mouse it still gives all the hints and tutoral information for the controller version making it way more tedious to figure things out than it needs to be. Can't really recommend a game if they can't get something as simple as that fixed after 3 games."
Negative,"2/5 Bad showI picked up DS3 because I'm a souls fan. I liked ds1 I liked ds2 missed BB but looked cool. This is shit.FromSoft has an issue with determining what should be bosses and what should be enemies.This is a far cry from both DS and DS2.Enemy placement in the predecessors was brilliant. Hard but fair.Enemy placement here is not. Ive run into more absolute ""Fuck you for playing"" moments then the two predessesors combined. Hollow soldier stabbing you from off screen that you had no warning for. yup.DS1 and 2 were very clean and clear with what was going on.DS3 is not. Everything is really muddy, enemies blend in with the environment too much and the rediculously floppy rags on many enemies contributes to how confusing the visuals are. Also the floppy way enemies flinch is hilariously over the top.Bosses are easier than enemies. This is ridiculous. Boss 2 is a fucking fat crawling ice warrior and you meet his brother later as a basic enemy and hes HARDER than the boss. The fuck is wrong with you From?Also FAT CRAWLING KNIGHT THING. The boss doesnt make sense. Its really dumb,DS2 had sound and visual design above and beyond DS3. They regressed the sound design back to DS1 mixed with BB. Not nessisarily bad just kind of odd seeing close to a decade of sound design back to back.DS2 and to a lesser extent 1, had clearly defined legs of areas. Ds3 is a maze that isnt fun to navigate.TL;DR DS2, DS1, BB, Demon Souls >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>DS3Don't buy. Just don't unless you love torturing yourself."
Negative,"Every time I replay the Souls games I hope that I will discover something about Dark Souls III I didn't previously, something that makes me realize it is a great game up there with Demon's Souls, Dark Souls I, Bloodborne, not mediocre like Dark Souls II. Every time I am disappointed. It's pretty crazy that this came out after Bloodborne, it is worse in pretty much every way - areas, bosses, weapons, mechanics, design. Nothing feels connected like in Dark Souls I or Bloodborne. Half of the bosses suck. The beginning areas are the worst in the whole series - honestly, does anyone actually enjoy replaying Undead Settlement, Road of Sacrifices, Farron Keep, Cathedral of the Deep, Catacombs, or Smouldering Lake? These areas are so fucking boring - boring designs, layout, all look the same, ass cancer mobs. The later areas aren't much better either. The game lacks identity, recycling areas and NPCs from DS1, except they are worse (seriously, Anor Londo is just dreadful in this game). Many of the weapons and spells (especially the spells) are just the same ol shit from previous Souls games. They could have at least brought the rallying mechanic from BB into DS3, it would have been perfect. But no, for every innovative new step BB took forward, DS3 took back. Dark Souls 3 is a pretty good game. Dark Souls 3 is not a good Souls game, it belongs in bottom tier with Dark Souls 2."
Negative,"Man, this game is so hard i cant even get into the title screen. i try to start it and my screen goes white and i get an error message about as helpful as saying ""you fucked"" and i'm given no option BUT to close the program. I looked into it and apparently this problem has been here since the first week of release, and Fromsoft hasn't bothered to fix it. If you have an Nvidia graphics card you can just switch which card the game runs on but if not you're kind of SOL. I'd love to give a real review, but when i dont even know what the loading screen before the title screen looks like...And before anyone makes any assumptions, it's not that i'm bad at the game, or i hate difficult games, hell, DS1 is my favorite game but i cant even fucking start this one..."
Negative,"Terrible port, they didn't even try to have it make sense for a PC player. Garbage. Refund, delete ASAP."
Negative,"I wish I could say I liked this game, that it was my favorite one in the whole series, that it improved on its predecessors in every way. Even if I tried to say that, I couldn't.Much of this game relies on heavy callbacks to the first game, some of them good, most of them unnecessary. Many problems with the first game have returned in this one, such as the glitch-infested, unbalanced pvp and a broken blue phantom system. In fact, this game is almost entirely based on the previous ones, preventing it from bringing anything new and interesting to the table. I say ""ones"" there with some hesitation, as almost none of the positive aspects of 2 have been carried over, such as the better game balance, increased weapon variety without gimmicks, SM, magic that does something, ADP, actual stamina management, actual level design (to a degree), better magic system, bonfire intensity, useful infusions... fun PvP...I can say with conviction that this game ruined the replayability of the entire series for me. I don't feel the same desire to play through 2 again and make another build that I did before 3 was released. The community has grown far too large and full of honorfags, edgelords, casuals, children, and mainstream ""gamers.""Play through this game and DLCs once. If you want to play this game for the PvP, don't buy it. If you (unfortunately) already own this game and are looking to PvP, don't do it.If you want to watch this game for whatever reason, here's a good streamer: https://twitch.tv/otzdarva"
Negative,you get banned for enjoying a mod
Negative,"From what I have played on the PS4, it is a great game. However, from what I have played on PC, this game is a 0/10. The loading screen boss was the hardest thing I have ever had to deal with which is quickly followed up by the character creation crash boss. Not only have I spent the better part of 2hrs dealing with problems to try to get the game to start but I have still yet to so much as move my character. It is impossible to solve the endless crashes to even get the game to be a game! I have tried every tutorial/fix/reformat possible. All the drivers are up to date, all the programs have been optomized, the apps priorities have been set to the highest possible settings, and I'm running it in the most optimal possible visual settings. My computer far exceeds the requirements the game has set yet it opens unresponsive, fixes itself after roughly 10sec, and then after the long cutscene which can be skipped crashes the second there is hope of playing a game before you can edit a single option. It sometimes crashes so bad the only way to get my PC out of it's ""soft-locked"" state is to hard power down the PC."
Negative,"Most overrated game series in modern history.Walk into room, get unfairly flanked and fucked by 4 enemies. Respawn and now with the knowledge you couldn't possibly have had before, walk into room knowing you're gonna get ambushed.Here's every boss fight:Variety of attack animations but here's how all of them function.Three-five short attacks with the final one being a flourish.One huge attack where the attack animation is super delayed to make you dodge early.AoE attack that deals instant death and affects an unreasonably large area.Most of the locations in-game are drab and uninteresting. It's just greens, beige and brown until you reach the Boreal Valley, then it gets a lot more visually interesting.Super rich lore and amazing world-building buried in mundane item descriptions and stilted and often incredibly easy to miss interactions with characters (for example, the 'good' ending can only be achieved when you do a bunch of incredibly mundane and extremely time-scenario sensitive tasks for one character that you'll likely never know exists until your third playthrough)Sense of achievement undermined by feeling less like you overcame a great many odds, and more just that you scoped an area for so long you figured out all the ways it was underhandedly designed to screw you over and you learnt a boss' 5 attacks.This game isn't even difficult. I beat Vordt, Curse-Rotted, Abyss Watcher, Sullivan, final boss in one life each. Every other boss was no more than 3 attempts. Each boss fight is just back up, let them do their attacks, learn the dead obvious openings and exploit them slowly until they die."
Negative,"All fanservice from previous titles has been removedthe 2nd DLC manage to bring you two .. yes only 2 fanservice costumes ..so unlike previous series, this game is just all pain no gain ..."
Negative,"If you release game on PC you must port controls from joystick to keyboard,"
Negative,"I made it about 10 minunets into the gameplay where you encounter the first boss. Two hours later, I was still batling him. Between the camera and the gameplay mechanics this game is garbage. Tried it with both a keyboard and a steam controller, both made it extremly hard to controll the camera.Further more, they have the entire game set up for a controller in mind, there are  control hints (like rb to attack, etc.) but they are only for controllers and there is no way to switch it for a keyboard."
Negative,FUCKING STUPID SHIT GAME EVER!!!
Negative,"far far too hard by far, it is hard. cool graphics buts its hard"
Negative,"Can't conect with my friend, that's make me really sad! bad game!"
Negative,im gatekeeping dis shi
Negative,Refunded quickly; Horrible Mouse/KB controls. Gamepad or bust for this one.

Negative,me boi solaire b ded
Negative,"Quick review but this game sucks, and online was removed. Peace out!"
Negative,This is my second most played game on steam. I'm utterly disgusted at myself for how long I've played it and how much longer I will in the future. Don't play this. Go outside. Find someone you love and spend time with them. Don't be like me.I have no one.I'm all alone.
Negative,"Souls games arent hard, they are deathroom puzzle games, room after room after room. and you must solve these puzzeles perfectly every corridor to proceed. if you like experinceing games at 0.025 meters a min then you will love this game. if you are like me and can still wlak at 2mph then this might be a slog. No real semblance to the first game, this one should be called ""Sorry we made DS2 this is DS3 with 2% less BS but 500% more ambushes cause we dont know how to mkae a level, or design a encounter, or actually make momentum combat work. Sad to see so many people loving this cash grab. play DS1 it is superior and more fair. I counted on one had how many deaths were ""Bad deaths"" in DS1 for me. DS2 filled both hands up in less than an hour. DS3 filled them both up at the first boss arena. I dont get the draw of seeing the same zone, the same enemies and the same text ""You died"" (Like no shit shurlok) now load me in faster and stop wasting my time or have the balls to instant replay that ""Hit"" and let me contest it if you want your game to be ""harsh but fair"" BTW harsh but fair is dumb, how about nondestructive and fair. also why is the fandom so gatekeepy with difficulty. go beat battle taods no hit. then you will win your poiontless eleitist gamer badge that syas ""Any other people caught enjoying what I enjoy in an improper way must be told they are a pleb for enjoying thier own lives"" So yeah, im kinda done with toxic relationships inside and outside of games. ill play contra on NES"
Negative,fix the damm covenan invasion already
Negative,"Crashing at the bonfire after the first ""boss"", can't believe FROM SOFTWARE is still making these mistakes..."
Negative,Has a decent PVE and good bosses but lacks in every other category especially PVP where it is by far the worst in the series
Negative,"I really liked Hollow Knight and wanted to try a souls game next. The combat is good I guess but the game doesn't really make me wanna explore the world(invisible walls and such, also the vibe in general)so I just don't see a reason to continue playing.If you like challenging but fair combat and don't care at all about exploration, this game is for you"
Negative,"This game has so many problems pvp wise. Every single time I've died to a gank squad I've gotten a point down. There's a word for people like that: Scum. I hate the everybody has fast rolling mechanic. I hate how poise is just magically gone. I hate how dragon form is useless. I hate how my options are extremely limited and all of dark souls 1 spells are just copy pasted. I have to play like a piece of garbage to score a victory on the host and all of the players have no problem chasing you with dark infused straight swords. Just don't pick up this game for the PvP and if you do get invaded don't be a salty cunt and point down when you kill them. That's shitty sport. They came to fight you for a challenge, and you lose practically nothing. Stop being scum. I'm leaving you a review because I'm sick of it. Nearly 400 hours and I'm no better than when I started this game. If that's  not an indicator something is wrong then I don't know what is."
Negative,"i know the game is good, ive played the previous ones and ive played this one on consoles before, but ever since getting it on my pc it hasnt worked properly at all, theres no lag or long loading times, theres no texture errors or multiplayer issues, but the hit boxes never move, as in nothing can be hit or deal damage unless you find where they spawn. its ridiculous and frustrating and takes everything away from the game as well as making fighting certain bosses impossible because of cutscenes. i did nothing to the game, i did nothing to the code, i didnt try to alter anything, i just bought thee game, ran it, and it was like this, and even reinstalling it and deleting all my game data does nothing to fix anything.if someone knows what to do, please help, i just want to play the game."
Negative,"Great waste of money, Broken Machanics, horrable game play, toxic community, a game progression machanic to make sure you dont progress and over all as mentioned at the start a great waste of money and time.If you like being agressive when playing games, like to coop with friends, no be attacked every 5 seconds and enjoy a great game turn around and look eltswhere because you wont find it in this game and its community of gang banging backstabbing individuals."
Negative,"I really reeeeaaally wanted to like this game. Instead it turned out to be the most overrated game I ever tried, i think. I went into this thinking the game would be hard because of the ""difficulty"". It turns out that it is hard mostly because of awful mechanics and lack of check points that send you way back. Having to grind you way through the same mobs again and again for no good reason to get a go at the same boss is not challenging...it is just a pointless grind. If i wanted a pointless grind i'd start up D3 one of the many other grind games."
Negative,"Pc controls are garbage, shouldnt have ever ported it to PC without them properly doing so.  Get a controller if you want to stand a chance at getting anywhere.  otherwise dont waste your money"
Negative,"Made for neck bearded fat basement dwelling leeching from society try hards,"
Negative,They were too lazy to change the damn control icons.
Negative,Nah not for me
Negative,Pros:-Good Combat.-Good Graphics.-Well intergrated Co-opCons:-Shit console-ported game.-Laggy pvp like 99% of the times.-Terrible Camera.
Negative,"I do not recommend this game, Dark Souls is way too hard. You gonna die, this is terrifying. Fact. Again and again. So don't play it, you gonna be invaded and will die. Play GTA instead. Dark Souls is not for light weights."
Negative,"horrible game, reset my PC and lost all my progress since the game does not have Cloud save in 2021 (I'm aware that the game was released in 2016, does not change anything)"
Negative,the definition of overrated
Negative,"""no no no the 10 minute runbacks are fun you're just trash!! go back to call of duty!!! :D""-fromshit fans"
Negative,Overly difficult game! :p
Negative,"This game was not built for pc keyboard, if you are using a controller fine, , all the hints and tutorials in game, are in the controller mode, if you only use keyboard and mouse do not get this game next to impossible to play. lazy developers."
Negative,Boring in my opinion. Controls are weird too. Just could not get into the game at all. I truly fail to see the hype about this game. But that's my opinion. We all have our own :)
Negative,IF I DROP ONE FRAME MY GAME CRASHES PLS FIX
Negative,fool me like that again and I will be really passive aggresive to you >:(
Negative,"I don't understand how a game so flawless could get any hate.All enemy attacks are easily avoidable and ther hitboxes correspond exactly to the visual representation. Heavily armored Knights and 600 year old men will never suddenly change the direction of their attack , as if they had a lock-on feature. Every attack cleary telegraphs the enemys action. Having problems with getting hit to death while on the floor? Well just don't get hit in the first place, you noob.The game randomly forgetting that you killed the first sub-boss and not giving you the souls is hardly an issue, because youl will grind those anyway on your infinitly repeating way tho the first boss.I'll 'git good', as soon as From gits good at gamedesing.After forcing myself to play this game for almost 4 hours I conclude; this isn't a hard game, this is incompetence."
Negative,"My review is solely based on the PC-version of this game.  Normally, folks might not have to make that distinction, but on PC this is an awful game.  Truly bad.  Every tutorial aspect uses controller-based commands, which then I have to find in the keybindings to determine what it translates to for keyboard and mouse.  The keybindings are also not very fluid or intuitive (tap space bar dodge backward, hold space bar to run, while running tap space to jump).  I died ~6 times to the first boss because I couldn't do any of the combat mechanics effectively.I don't mind the game being difficult.  In fact I like difficulty.  But the port is so awful that it's just not playable.  If you buy this game, play it on console and/or buy a controller if you want it to be halfway decent.  It might even be fun.  Don't buy it if you plan on playing with mouse and keyboard."
Negative,How to make Dark Souls Game Hard: Just overcrowd an enemy area that all
Negative,I am very confused.I bought the deluxe edition during the summer sale for the dlc. when i downloaded the game it said i had the normal version and has no dlc at all.I even have the receipt for it that proves my point.Please fix this and i will change my mind.
Negative,"You call Dark Souls 2 the worst because of copium.Dark Souls 3 explicitly sucks for the following reasons:1. All grabs have massive hitboxes and lengths that don't correspond to their animation2. the selection of rings for physical options are a complete joke, the overwhelming majority of good options for rings is purely favoring spellcasters.3. The placement of bonfires is absolutely terrible. In high Wall, an area that really only needs maybe 2 bonfires, has 4, 2 of which are basically adjacent to one another, meanwhile the massively long path to the Smouldering Lake Ballista has no bonfires along it and one of the shortest videos teaching how to turn the ballista off is roughly 3 full minutes ignoring fights.4. Dancer is an unreasonably disproportionate difficulty spike and is quite literally the 2nd worst boss Miyazaki ever allowed in any of his games. The boss has 1 predictable pattern and the rest of their moves all come almost out of nowhere and are chained at purely random. For their mobility, the boss is the first to do this in the game's progression (and for a while it's also the only one) where it's the most effective. ""It's just difficult"" only applies when the difficulty itself can be predicted in the moment. Most of Dancer's moves do not Have tells, and the few that have any are so absurdly fast that it's unreasonable. Dragonslayer Armor is easily 10x easier, considering he is just Gundyr with extra steps.5. Dagger's dash being required in certain areas isn't smart or inventive game design, it's lazy, slapdash and provably terrible.6. This game has the worst farming of any souls game by a country mile and I really don't understand why to any comprehensible degree.7. The volume of offline summonable help for such difficult areas is dreadful, bordering on literally non existent at almost all times.8. 80% of every enemy in this game are all humanoids with sweep or stab attacks, the occasional rat is literally a breath of fresh air. The real number is more likely to be higher than it is to be lower.9. The bridge to High Lord Wolnir has no reason to regenerate. ""Story"" is not a reason, it's an excuse.10. Infusing a weapon reduces its base damage by a bit no matter what infusion you use (ignoring Raw which eliminates scaling and it's just... lmao imagine Raw infusing anything) and that's just ludicrously dim.Genuinely all of these points don't exist in Dark Souls 1, let alone 2, of which is better than 1 in some points.The fact anyone called this the best souls game is a joke and proof that humanity's standards are just supremely low across the board. 2 is better than 3, and you can't empirically prove otherwise (prove me wrong lmao). Have a nice day."
Negative,I cannot believe how bad of a game this is the world itself feels dull and uninteresting explorating is not rewarded the enemy types are repetetive and arent challenging but rather an annoyance as they dont need skill to beat but an area in which you can actually fight in and hope that there arent 20 of them attacking you at once given how this game is pretty much just based around castles and narrow pathways you can see how this can become a problem very fast.bosses have little to no moves i believe i am somewhat far into the game and i dont believe i've met more than 2 bosses that didnt have someone interfere midfight which brings us back to the enemys being an annoyance and no challenge. the bosses themselves are way too easy and i dont see myself struggling as is one of dark souls fundamentals that the game will be a challenge and not a cakewalk but i dont see the game being difficult its rather the design and the general foundation on which the gameplay is built upon that makes me wanna tear my eyes out. no jumping? no crouching? running for a max of 10seconds? when im naked id be able to the all of these things but in dark souls 3 you cant. i have probably died 50 times or so half of which was due to gravity since falling down 3m already takes a big chunk of your hp and it does make sense to some degree that you would take damage in real life but it doesnt translate well in a game where you are trying to have fun or have fun beating a supposedly difficult game. these things do not make the game hard or difficult but just annoy and hinder the player from experimenting with the game itself it restricts the player from having said fun. in contrast to other souls games that ive played like sekiro or elden ring dark souls 3 is a complete letdown and i can see why people like the game and maybe i dont due to having played more recent titles of fromsoft but as it stands now i dont view the game as a good challenge and a great addition to fromsofts work
Negative,"Deppression inducing landscapes, near black and white color schemes. Felt my soul being sucked dry in real life with every in game death. Seems like a great game, excluding the fact theres no Ultra wide support and the tips that popup are for a controller, so if you are playing on a KB/Mouse like myself, there is no tips other than going into settings>keybinds  20 times.  Seems like a great game for someone using Consoles.   Just not for me.Bad Console to PC port!"
Negative,"If you have an AMD fx-8150, don't even bother buying it. Won't run, even if you havea gtx970."
Negative,This game is so hard that when you start it up it just crashes
Negative,"hAHhaHAhahgIT Gud!! XD XD XDStupid Hitboxes and Combat System, Horrendous Lock on System.Only good as an anger-Mangement-simulatorGiT gUD XD XD XD"
Negative,Game is shit if you wanna try PvP. Ya'll might as well go back to Dark Souls 2 and deal with all the Hexcasters or katana fags instead of this. Cause once yah beat this the first time it's down hill from there. Hell... even the hackers in Dark Souls 2 could actually be fun to mess with. This though...? Jesus Fromsoft... had good ideas with really shitty execution.
Negative,"the game is not hard because of the design, its hard because the developer didn't even bother to map the tutorial to the keyboard, regardelss if you are playing with a keyboard you still get playstation layniness prompts, leaving you to smash every key until you find out how to play, its a 'difficult' game. the game is still fun, I like the story. but things like requiring you to constantly toggole on and off of targets to either run or fight is reminicesnt of 1990's games like zelda's ocrina of time. while I understand nostalgia, having a poor UI is no excuse to tout that the game is 'hard' its really not hard, the game itself is easy its the clunky UI and poor and lazy mechanics and lack of a compute tutorial that makes the game hard."
Negative,"Crashes at the first bonfire. Over and over again. i7-4770k, GTX 780 Ti. Unplayable. Shadow Play stops working when the game crashes. Is the game crashing my graphics card? Oh set lighting to low you say? I paid $500 for a graphics card to run this game on low? Might as well tell me to buy a console, it might be 30 FPS peasantry but at least I won't get stuck on a save point. Artificial difficulty to the max. 0/10 my mistake for supporting the legit version. Won't make the same mistake next time.EDIT: WELL WHAT DO YOU KNOW. Free version on KAT didn't crash at the first bonfire. Lasted til the FireLink Shrine before crashing. Still unplayable but at least it's superior to the legitimate version.Talk about embarrassing. #FAIL."
Negative,"Phenomenal game in many ways, but poorly optimized and riddled with bugs. Spent about as much time troubleshooting stuff as actually playing, which gets really old after a while. If you're lucky enough to avoid the technical issues, the game is marvelous. You know what you get from the Souls series. An action-packed RPG that is tough as nails and unforgiving but fair (ish). Steep learning curve, great boss fights and harsh spikes in difficulty. It challenges you at every step.Unfortunately I can't recommend the PC version though. Far too many technical issues at this stage. And unfortunately, From Software/Namco Bandai have apparently given up completely on making it better. Probably a safer bet to get it on a console instead."
Negative,"I understand that many purchasers are experiences little to no issues regarding the optimization and functionality of Dark Souls 3.  However, the issues need to be resolved because most of the problems are inexcusable.  I've been a fan of the Soulsborne series since Dark Souls, and I do not want the PC problems to hinder the expansion of sales and fanbase.  The Souls' series encapsulates a challenging game that refuses to hold your hand in solving problems.  However, the PC problems are the only challenge that need FromSoft and Bandai Namco's help to correct.In its current state, I cannot recommend this game.  I would personally recommend any newcomer or supporter to purchase the game on Xbox One or PS4, even though the frame rate is capped at 30fps.  The console versions have more stability and lack the unpredictability of the current PC version.  To end on a positive note in this Unrecommended review, the two hours that I have played on the Xbox One have been enjoyable.  The map design, boss fight(s), and unfolding narrative are proving to be promising for the upcoming hours.  In this rendition, the non-hostile NPC's are more direct with their statements and lack the cryptic articulation that previous characters retained such as Knight Solaire of Astora.  To be fair to these characters, though as stated previously, I've only progressed two hours into the game.  The opening cutscene is fantastic; the introduction to the world is great; the vistas are gorgeous; and the first boss is a memorable entry.  I'm highly anticipating the next 100+ hours that I will invest into this game."
Negative,"I beat this game 6 times, speed ran it once, have over 100 hours of dedicated PvP and have tried every build I could think of, all of this comes to the conclusion of no this is not a good game.Dark souls III has really solid controls when they aren’t being taken from you by one of the enemy grabs or the turned off poise system, or a server stutter that can’t be avoided no matter how good your PC is.The games bosses start out ok, and are enjoyable when not raging at the stagger lock, instant death moves or plain glitchy bs that just happens to you at every turn. Though a lot of them share the gimmick of ""break the thing to do huge burst damage."" and the ones that don’t have a spammy move set that is frustrating before you learn it and boring and time consuming after.PvP is unplayable garbage, most fights end at the first hit. By that i mean that if you get hit once you are stagger locked until dead. There is no remedy for this as poise is deactivated and any opponant worth there salt wont just spam R1 to avoid getting parried.As the third installment in the dark souls series and the cap stone of the franchise i expected much better. There are so many problems that are hold overs from previous game that i don't even care to list them. I recommend staying away from this one and going back to Dark Souls 1, that game may look dated but at least the core of the combat works."
Negative,This game is the worst the ui literally cheats ive beaten the first and this one. The ui goes totally hard core once you dropped souls.you cant roll throw enemies so you can be trapped easily. The enviroment iterfers with weapon attack mechanics. Jumping is horrible. You cant perform any other action with the npc has words on you screen. One second the mobs cant reach you at all the you drop souls get in the exact position you were in before in every way and now they can not only reack you but hit much much harder.The game is desighed to cheat you be aware of that.
Negative,love the game but plz fromsoft just enable poise already.
Negative,Trash game pvp. Imagine fighting laggards & crinj survivalists all day
Negative,10 / 10fps
Negative,"Unequivocally the worst souls game, including all imitations from Nioh to the $1 knock off games littering steam. Buy if you like games with 3 colours and a permanent unwanted yellow filter over the entire game."
Negative,"Pros:Best game in Souls series so farCons:I've spent more time loading this game than playing it, because it's constantly crashing."
Negative,"My friend permabanned for nothing (after his saves was busted) so we can't play together. Random freezes, low-fps red phantoms somehow parrying while in stunlock, high-level characters ganking me constantly. The last problem is nothing, it's about me getting gud after 5 hours of gameplay, okay, why not. And I was summoned to help someone with the boss, but the boss was invisible. I couldn't damage him and seemingly was phasing through. Nice. I hope I won't get banned."
Negative,"An incredibly designed example of what can be achieved through careful attention to both world and mechanical detail. Animation in a game like this is exquisite because it has to be - however, some enemies may seem rote because of their attack patterns. This, however, is the form needing give way to function, as the entire game is predicated on measured tests of player skill, absorption and ultimately, patience.Every hit in this game should be treated like the last, because it very well could be. A player wanting to experience this would do well to spend some time in the earlier game, just learning the core character movement and locomotion, in addition to observables, such as weapon attack speeds, et alAn absolute masterpiece, one which falls well within the 'oft imitated/never duplicated' school.At the end of the day though, fuck this fucking game. Goddamn it."
Negative,"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....This is just a boring retread of Dark Souls 1 with token references to Dark Souls 2 but nothing that made that game interesting.  It's the same level over and over again (ANOTHER Gothic church....  Ugh) with the key difference between areas being the variety of the crappy and cheap enemies.  Armor doesn't matter, enemies will always hit you like a truck, generally one shooting you... and these arean't even mini-bosses, much less bosses.  The bosses are dull and uniteresting, with little point to fighting them other than the fact that they are there and hositle to the player.The ""story"" doesn't connect with the player at all, it's just a shallow framework to hang the repetitive comabt on, which quickly collapses when you notice how utterly pointless it all is.  There's no point to doing anything in this game since there is no emotional connection for the player.  There's no sense of accomplishment or enjoyment, even when beating a boss, since you've FAILED over and over and over and over again before you eventually win.  The ""wear them down"" style of gameplay is trite, overplayed, and dull as dishwater.  The player's actions and decisions don't even really influence the game or story at all, just determining which ending cutscene you watch play after you reach the end of the storyline (that you are utterly railroaded through).And ""git gud""?  It's a meaningless phrase, since there is no point to suffering through this tripe.  Why would anyone want to be ""gud"" at this garbage?This is the final Souls game and good riddance.  This ""genre"" needs to just go away and be forgotten for good."
Negative,"would'v been 8/10 (not a dark souls fan, but this was very good) BUT:not playing online until this pathetic cheater thing has been sorted out, where innocents are getting banned when a cheater invades their world. google ""Reddit Dark Souls 3 Malcom"", you will see a post by someone which i quickly glanced over, stating there is a player going around invading players games to get them banned to a ""cheater"" server which is mostly innocent players. Malcom has even started streaming this on youtube when i viewed it. there are players stating that FROMSOFTWARE is not bothering to help, fix or resolve any of this, thus keeping the player banned on online play. they are there'fore punishing their legit players because their anti-cheat has a major flaw in the system. Also, iv not been banned yet, but thats due to me putting a password on my game and also making it offline only, effectivly deleting my ""co-op"" experience with random people, and i dont know anyone who plays Dark Souls 3 since its not my friend circle's regular game. if i do get banned ""AFTER this negative review"", well, i have plenty of alts, i do not think i would have cheated on a game on my main game account with near 300 games, would you? Nor would i pay £39.99 just to cheat on it. you'v matched grounds to WarZ (Infestation: Survivor Stories) and even the player-based ""anti-cheat"" of CS:GO. (dont ace with duelies kids)So, its now 3/10.not leaving a positive review until these problems have been fixed."
Negative,"""Working as intended"""
Negative,"Microstutters the game. Seriously though, why would you put this on the market knowing that it has such glaring flaws? Patch it already."
Negative,"F*** this game, zero joy like I experienced with Sekiro."
Negative,Couldn't have sex with relatives. Moving on.
Negative,"This was my first venture into the Souls series.  I can't say I was a fan.  The game play is serviceable exploring and figuring out how best approach situations and enemies and figure out what works and what doesn't.  Combat mostly appears to consist of learning an opponents attack set, knowing where the opening are and getting the timing down to exploit them.  Maybe it was just me, but I found myself not especially satisfied in maneuvering for a back stab compared to battling in a more head-to-head fashion.  I constantly felt that while fights were tough, they also felt very hollow to me.  To the point, just didn't feel like banging my head against the game to overcome them.  I was a little surprised on how complex the character sheet was to the point of being arcane without researching outside of the game.  I liked the setting and aesthetics, but that wasn't enough of a draw to continue honing my skills to progress.  The Souls series obviously has an audience, but I am not it."
Negative,"Man what a piece of shit where to even begin. First off they hit you with an online user agreement that takes 5+ minutes to scroll through and then on top of that the actual game itselfProsNoneConsno steam cloud save syncClunky and terrible player movement Horrible control layout not to mention they didnt even attempt to make controls for the PC version of the game so the tutorial is telling you controls for the fucking xbox when you are using a keyboard and mouse.no storyOverall an actual piece of shit. This game feels like it was made by the worst indie dev team in the world who thought they had ""unique"" combat but never had the budget for good optimization, voice acting, story and well everything that actually makes a game good. All there is to this game is the combat and even that is trash."
Negative,cant connect to server . Kappa
Negative,Worst in the series.  Mobs are stronger than bosses.  Should not be this way.
Negative,Not as good as DS1
Negative,"The game tries to increase the difficulty by handicapping the player instead of making the enemy strong.I can never kick an enemy without great focus.I can never roll while running.I can never lock an enemy before he stands up.The locking on an enemy can easily broken by distance and direction. It can be a pain in the a** when fighting someone agile and high in damage - one lock break = my life.The next attack/roll is queued, if I press it at the very beginning part of the animation of the first attack, and it cannot be cancelled by any mean. Once I tried to dodge and accurately got hit by the boss due to the delay. Then after the hurt animation, my character started to roll just like my input 3 seconds ago! Yeah, even getting hit won't break the order queue."
Negative,"While this game's more consistent than Dark Souls and probably ""better"" than Dark Souls 2 in fundamental respects like combat and level design, I don't experience games on a rubric. Dark Souls 3 lacks a sublime something that haunts me when I walk away from the game...Well, except for PvP. This game's more active than the other two (on Steam, anyway). The game's community keeps surprising me with their themed builds and cheeky play. Co-op and invasions really sing in this one, and the game is obviously designed to accommodate it, from the 270-degree sweeping attacks of bosses to the area-specific covenants. If you don't mind the turn based-tier netcode and PvP is your thing, this will be your favorite."
Negative,"Decent overall artistic design, low resolution textures (some lower than in Dark Souls PtDE), worst (laggy and inconsistent) pvp connections in Souls series, shoddy server work, bad gameplay decisions, just a mix of elements from previous games (for obvious financial reasons), irrelevant useless covenants, broken pvp, unmemorable story, lore, characters and locations, futile graphics settings (no options for disabling volumetric fog = biggest fps killer for most players/customers), the game frustratingly ignores simple mathematics, the game has no identity whatsoever, this is not in the same league as Dark Souls Prepare to Die Edition! Overall, DS3 is a sh*tty game.Not recommended for Dark Souls fans!This is for new comers only who enjoy some eye candy! Maybe for some Bloodborne fans, too.Just let it die.PS: I regret buying this mess of a game!"
Negative,"I loved Dark Souls. I thought 2 was bad, but I enjoyed it. 3 is THOROUGHLY UN FUN. Biggest disappointment of any game series since Mass Effect. Why is this the one that gets raved about.The story sucks. It's basically a rehash of 1. Complete with the NPCs. Like, if I wanted to see Andre, I'd play 1.The gameplay sucks. Not only does the game think Mix-You-Ups are a fun and interesting difficulty mechanic, but the removal of poise, nerfing of shields, and increased gameplay pace means it plays like a bastard half-arsed copy of Bloodbourne and lacks any real Dark Sould feel.The online sucks. Not only does the netcode STILL not work properly, but twink builds for PVP are everywhere and it's also borderline impossible to find Embers / Regain your ""Embered up"" status.Dying sucks. Oh I know 2 was bad for the loss of health on death, but 3 DOES IT TOO. Not being embered up cuts your health to a mere 60%. Dying shouldn't be an issue in a souls game. What the fuck guys.The difficulty curve sucks. By which I mean it doesn't exist. Fast and complex enemies are standard from THE FIRST AREA and yes, health and damage increase as the game progresses but your soul count and level nicely and naturally match that, so the game never feels ANY harder or easier. It's monotonous and dull.The bosses suck. I don't think I fondly remember any of them? I mean Dark Souls had some crap bosses (Bed of chaos being the worst in the series), and 2 was bland at best (Semon of Dong honestly being the only vaguely interesting one), but 3 is just DULL.The soundtrack sucks. The peaceful, mournful feel of one WORKED. The soundtrack in 2 was patchy, but mostly WORKED. In 3 it feels at odds with the world, when it exists in any noticeable capacity at all.The level design sucks. Gone is the interconnected and varied map that 1 was so praised for and even 2 managed fairly well. All area transitions in this game are by warping, and each area itself is largely just a corridor with a shortcut or 2. It's bland and uninspired.I... I honestly think Dark Souls 3 is a bad game. I honestly think it's the worst game to have left FromSoft. And by like a LOT."
Negative,Welcome to spam R1 to win the game.
Negative,"sell it for fifteen dollars, this game came out in 2018 and it doesnt have sixty dollar graphics"
Negative,"i would reccomend but the fact that you have to be open to invasion to play co-op and due to the fact that the population of this game is made op of brain dead monkeys that just run from you and use the mobs to kill because of there lack of skill. Which yeah whatever, even the bad players gotta play somehow i guess. but at what point is it worth waste 20 minutes of mine and ur time for nothing, and the cheaters. one of best games ever but the community is dog shit"
Negative,"Graphic is really amazing. But playing on keyboard is thanks to very bad key binding completely terrible. Only switching between weapons is cleverly done, rest is really against all normal keyboard users. This is having bigger impact on the play, than i ever expected, so i cannot recommend this game for PC users. Sorry i had high hopes for this game :(UPDATE I+ after playing further i really like the environment, undead settlement is beautifully done.- while rolling is so important, i do not understand the fact, that you can roll in full knight armor.... but you cannot jump without running or climb small obstacles. no sense in it..."
Negative,"Things I like:+Looks pretty+Cool name+It's #3, so that's one more than Valve could ever manageThings I didn't like:-Keyboard controlls as screwy and the game assumes you really fucking want to play with your controller-Camera and controlls with a controller are still bollocks-Still about as fun as anal sex while having murderous mutant hemorroids.If you didn't like the first and didn't like the second, you won't like this one either, no matter how much the try-hard cunts bang on about the third one being too easy. They have a fanbase, so I guess there's something to it that I don't get, but if you realized that time is finite and that you are mortal: Fuck it! Go play something that's actually fun before having considerably shortened your life by stressing you out."
Negative,"I knew it was a hard game, when I got it from a Humble Monthly bundle. I wanted to try it anyway. I probably just suck hard, because I've never really played a console style action game. But damn is this game unforgiving. And for me this game is actually borderline unfair. I know ""git gud"" and all that. But screw that! It began with the very first ""tutorial"" boss, The reach of that thing... I couldn't evade, I couldn't block properly, as a tank I might add, it just drained too much stamina. Staying out of reach was hard because of the arena. And you can't really punish it too much after an attack because it recovers before you get 2 quick hits in. Maybe I'm too impatient. Anyway after 10 tries I said “screw it"", and just button mashed it up close after it transformed. And that worked somehow! Is that the fabled fighting system of this series?And it just got worse when the game properly started. This game is not linear... Or actually it is, but it presents you with like 3 paths, where 2 lead into a dead end. There were no indications for the right path. Of course as a noob they were filled with difficult enemies anyway, though they get easier with patience. The first check point is an eternity away and actually fricking hidden, or at least way out of the main path. On my own I wouldn't have found it. Right after that is basically a smaller version of the first boss. Only this time with a lot less space to manouver, and you can even call to your death if not careful. Oh, and you have to be used to console controls, which I'm not. I probably had to fight the controls just as much as the monsters. I played with the XBox pad. The right camera stick is super sensitive and even putting sensitivity to 0 in the options didn't help me. It got pretty disorienting at times. Adding to that, that you have to click the right stick to target an enemy (which has a short range to boot), and you have stuff of nightmares. And whoever thought that having to click the left stick, then pressing the Dodge button for a short hop was a good control scheme, should play a no hit run of this game!I really want to like this game, but it is way more frustrating than it has any reason to be. A good hard game should make the played feel like he screwed up. This makes me scream at the controls and the cheap enemies.Git gud? Screw that!"
Negative,abyss watchers are dogshit
Negative,"NOT VERY PC FRIENDLY.POORLY OPTIMIZED.GAME CONTROLLER ISSUES.Bought, played 2 hours. Thank goodness for Steam Refunds."
Negative,poorly done for pc all the controls and guides are showed as if it was played on a ps3
Negative,Games is not politics
Negative,"Can't play the game. Constant crashes, freezes on every server save, fps drops, memory leaks.The longest time I was able to play without crash is about 20 mins. Usually it crashes in  a first few minutes.Huge input lags - biggest in the series. So big that they make input queues from which you can't cancel of. Even downloaded DkS2 to check it out.Awfull lock on system with kb+m. Bad camera with kb+m.Unplayable for me.3 bad ports from From in a row.Refunded."
Negative,"Old designed-for-console RPG FPS game, does not support wide displays and mouse/keyboard is clearly an addon to console controller (e.g. you cant use exotic buttons like '=' to bind to an action). Its also designed to be more about hitting buttons at exactly the right time than how you approach a situation (think games like CoD where you get ""press x"" come up on the screen and if you press it fast enough you win, else you die - this game doesnt tell you what to press but its the same thing going on under the hood). Camera controls are pretty weak, probably related to the monitor support. In all honesty I would avoid this game unless you played the previous ones or live and die for below-average-console-ports."
Negative,"There's nothing new going on compared to it's predecessors, with a bland world map with mostly similar locations (and no over-arching connections), and the enemy designs, weapons, spells, ... are mostly just copy-pastes as well. Basically the formula is just tired at this point. (I did play Bloodborne too, and I think that game is way better because it's trying new stuff).I also found the game to be overly difficult. My feeling is that the designers were compensating for the fact that everyone is looking up optimal character builds and walkthroughs and stuff by making each encounter extra difficult. This is annoying because I don't really do that. I do see when I get invaded other characters with gnarly looking spells and crazy weapons and stuff, so I sometimes look up where they get them... and basically I'm skeptical anybody is really figuring out all these obscure sequences of events on their own. Anyway, the game became a lot more reasonable after I grinded out a few levels, but I never had to do that in previous games in the series, and it's a a waste of time to have to do that to keep up with these stupid design trends.Basically in a vacuum it's an alright game but it just feels a bit phoned in. I give it a middling, ""kinda worth your time during a pandemic"" out of 10"
Negative,"No cloud saves. You cannot play on PC and SteamDeck at the same time.Achievements do not work if you accidentally play offline. You have to start a new game and NEVER go offline.Hidetaka Miyazaki fucks you IRL, not just in games."
Negative,"This game should have been a sequel to DS2 rather than being Bloodborne 1.5 lite. Dark Souls 3 and Bloodborne only served to prove that Hidetaka Miyazaki and the A Team have no clue how PVP should function, or what makes it fun. There is a reason these two games were dead as fūck only a few months with content creators trickling out content at best, meanwhile DS2 was strong all the way up until the release of DS3.By choosing to use the Bloodborne over Dark Souls 2 for the Dark Souls 3 system they: 1. Stripped out everything that made the online covenants worth a fūck. The rewards are all garbage too.2. Added the arena in as an afterthought within a cut-down short DLC (Andariel) with NO REWARDS, not even a fūcking glowing AURA. Whereas Dark Souls 2 had two arenas for Brotherhood of Blood and Blue Sentinels on launch day.3. Poise in pvp, the A Team and Miyazaki chose not to add Poise to DS2, this is due to Bloodborne 100%, and then claimed it was ""working as intented"" when the fans backlashed against it. They added it in a patch (only during hyperarmor swings, and it only improves hyperarmor.) only after like a year after the game's release, and only after vitriol and memes made such a mockery of them they were forced to change it.This is an example to show that these developers don't know what the fūck they are doing, or what the fans want.4. Like the Bloodborne system they absolutely destroyed invasions in DS3. You can invade almost anywhere unlike Bloodborne, but everything else that made this game bad stayed. (With the exception of passwords, which was a good quality of life change from the Nameless Ring.) You have an auto-summon covenant that summons two different covenants (Blue Sentinels and Darkmoon Blades.) Having two covenants do the exact same thing, only to congest both of them and make it take HOURS to get summoned (unless you are extremely low SL) was a brain-dead decision. They recently ""fixed"" it so that now every time you are invaded with way of blue equipped, you instantly get 2 blue phantoms, and infinite ones after that. This made invasions basically impossible unless you are a god with hundreds or almost thousands of hours in the game (like me) and are willing to try so hard to kill that host that you will be sweating on your gamepad trying to thread the needle between an endless torrent of R1 spammers. 2 Blues, up to 3 whites and oh yeah I forgot to mention your health is gimped by 30% while the host is buffed 30%. Thanks Myazaki, that's what makes invasions fun. Complete morons. This goes to show you that the greatness of Dark Souls 1 was purely by chance and not from real skill or insight from the ""god"" Miyazaki.5. Weapons in the left hand were a staple of Dark Souls 2, and many of them were designed specifically to be used like this, whereas there’s only about 2 in DS3 to my knowledge (Rapier and Handmaid’s Dagger) which gave you and extremely high amount of variety and versatility to any build. 6.The variation of viable builds in DS2 game also far exceeds Dark Souls 3 or Bloodborne for that matter. Even magic is far more useful in this game especially in pvp.at launch. DS3 had a few useful dark pyromancies. Only in the very last patch have that even tried to improve scaling on magic and faith infusions (And made Solaire's sword OP as fūck in the process) since the release of the game, On release everything was Quality Quality Quality, and it wasn't worth a fūck to even consider anything else, its still mostly not, and this only shows to prove that this was not really high on the priorities during the development process. If they actually gave a shĩt about build diversity and more importantly the diversity of viable builds then we would have a more robust interesting game, with lots of different playstyles to try out. Instead we have homogeneous sameness of meta boring weapons and some meme lul weapons that people only use to basically bad-manner other players.Dark Souls 2 is the true Dark Souls experience, especially for everything online. The only reason that Dark Souls 3 is such a garbage game is because of the massive backlash of fanboys over Dark Souls 2 on it's release. It did have it’s problems, to be sure but because of this the publishers pressured From Software away from those design decisions and instead chose Bloodborne mechanics over Dark Souls 2. This made them steer clear of ANY designs from Dark Souls 2, including those that were carried over from Dark Souls 1, and is why we got a thoroughly disappointing third sequel.A lot of those problems in Dark Souls 2 have also been hashed out with the SotFS release of the game, which most of these vitriolic fanboys never even finished one new game cycle, let alone the improved SotFS experience, and the online component is even better.In Dark Souls 3 and Bloodborne, PVP is an afterthought, in Dark Souls 2 PVP is the main point and focus, and it’s obvious where the development priorities were in these games."
Negative,"I love this game, but I hate the developers. I got banned for ""Invalid game data"". I wiped the game, reinstalled, and started fresh, and still got the ban, after the notification. Now I can't play with my friends because the developer team is in Japan, according to the customer service representative I spoke to, and apparently has no system to dispute the ban. For the record: No, I was not hacking, or using cheats, nor did I modify the save files. I only recieved the notification ""If you continue to play with Invalid game data, you will be banned"". UPDATE: Still no word on the review of the ban, nor do I expect to get anything from them..Update: Submitted a second ticket, and managed to get an actual response, and a lift of the ban. Still displeased with overall service, and that there really never explained why I was banned, despite my guessing. Still going to be an overall no, simply for how draconian they can be with their players, and their lack of transparency."
Negative,mastapeeceedit: can't recommend this game anymore until they patch the RCE exploit and bring the servers back up
Negative,"Horrible PC port.  Trying to navigate menus and configure settings is unintelligible, since joystick buttons are the only instructions, and Escape, backspace, and enter do nothing.  Seriously, WTF."
Negative,game was 2 ez i just quit halfway
Negative,i crashes constanly -.-
Negative,"Underdeveloped piece of trash that i dont even want to refund. All i want is my time back. But i can't have that, can I?"
Negative,GGWP GOT CRASHED AT STARTUP
Negative,"consol port peace of crap, if you can strugle through the insaly bad controllers, the visuals will make your head spin, no v/g-sync and the screan tears like crazy. 60fps cap, ffs what is is this, batman all over again."
Negative,"Говно игра.Я играл во все игры серии соулс,но такого говна еще не видел.Я ОЧЕНЬ РАД ЧТО ЭТО ПОСЛЕДНЯЯ ЧАСТЬ!!!!!!!"
Negative,"The game is designed to not be fun. Every area has enemy spam, enemies all have absurdly inflated stats, too much mobility, too much health, too much damage, enemies all have super armour on half their attacks while poise is non existant to you, so anything hitstuns you, most of the weapons are actually worthless.Miyazaki had said he didn't want to make Dark Souls 3 and I can feel it, he didn't want to do it, so he doesn't want me to like it either,And that's before getting into the frustration with the Dark Souls community bitching about how bad DS2 was while praising DS3 for doing the exact same fucking things.This game gives me conniptions."
Negative,"I'm honestly sick of trying to wrestle with the controls for this, I don't know if its some bug or just poor coding but for some reason every time I start this up there seems to be yet another problem with trying to use a controller, the same controller that I have no problems using in literally every other game.So the entirety of my DS3 experience has been my pissing about to get a controller to work for a game that in theory shouldn't even have a problem recognising it in the first place.Years later this game still has the same glaring problems with controllers, worse is that the discussions of said problems inevitably get derailed with pathetic fanboys bogging down the posts without bothering to contribute, the amount of topics that just have people saying ""I've never had that problem so you must be lying"" or ""DS3 is perfect and has no support issues just get good"" it is depressing to know that the fan base has devolved to this point."
Negative,"Now, I need to warn you, this is a very long review because I've been playing souls games since 2013 and I feel like this game falls short from every other SoulsBorne game, specially since I played it for a long time now.I wanted to like this game, trully, I did, but it handles everything from past games in the wrong way, it takes more steps back than it tries to go forward, for example:                                                                                    » Dark Souls 2 had bland but difficult bosses, so let's make every boss unique, and while some are nice and challenging, a lot of them are a bunch of complete pushovers, how bad are these pushovers? They are worse than Dark Souls 2's pushovers, (some of them are just straight up generic video game bosses, you know the type, strike the shiny area to deal extreme ammounts of damage, use a special weapon to deal tons of damage to a boss, just very generic, boring gimmicks to bosses that could have been interesting), which is an amazing feat, since a boss was literally just a bunch of the weakest enemies from the game, paired with a few stronger ones, no wait it's much worse, THEY DO IT AGAIN IN THIS GAME!!!  I know that being creative sometimes is hard, but Jesus christ, that was just straight up pathetic.                                                                                                                                                               » Dark Souls 2 had bad level design, so let's make every level loop on itself! And while it's fine to make a nice little level that loops, Dark Souls 3 does not understand what made level design great in  Dark Souls, and it was world building, there's an enourmous difference between a level that goes from point A to point B and a level that goes from point A to either point B, C, D or E, while interconnecting all of them to point A, that's what's great about the Dark Souls level design, wandering off ina direction, branching off to wherever you felt was the best way, finding out more about the world and actually appreciating it, to feel yourself get lost and find yourself again was the best feeling of exploring Dark Souls, Dark Souls 3 has nothing of the sort, instead it goes for a very linear type of design, so much that the only branch you could choose, completely blocks you because you haven't progressed in the main path yet. It also impacts on how difficult the early game is, making the early bits challenging, but the middle to the end bits being way too easy, I remember the first run I made, I went with a simple cleric  because Deus Vult! , but I stopped using healing miracles, I felt like it was cheating since I would clear areas while using 1 MP heal and would just wreck the boss.                                                                                  » Soul memory was an issue because of the twinks against the new players, so let's just ruin invading all together, invasions are not likely to happen if you play alone, which sucks, because the strongest points Dark Souls had was the multiplayer, you never knew when xXNarutoManXx would invade you and screw your day up, it was thrilling and it kept the single player game very fresh, Dark Souls 3 is now extremely afraid of these encounters, since you are way more likely to invade coopers, and I don't mean that as a 50/50 chance, I would say 9/10 times you try invading, you'll stumble upon coopers, not only that but the game takes 50% of your main healing items away, takes away (about, give or take) 25% of your character's HP while invading, and you still have MP to think about, the way it works is basically this, you have 15 Healing items, you can use these 15 healing items to either heal HP or MP, but you can only alot them while in your hub, that means, if you have 10 HP heals and 5 MP heals, you get 5 HP heals and 2 MP heals while invading, but wait, there's MORE, the player you invade has the power to summon 3 other people to coop with, the chance to get 2 other helpers against the invader and to turn the enemies of the level against the invader, and while that makes the host more likely to be invaded, but there is always the chance of the other invader getting in your way, rather than helping you out.                                                                                » This is where most people complain about, so much that the playerbase has been dropping to an extreme peaking at 7k players on steam on workdays, with reason too, Dark Souls 3 is missing 3 VITAL aspects from the other Souls games:» Poise» Dual wield/Powerstance» NG + content, replayability right now = 0  Shove the + rings up your ass, give us actual content!   Actually no, let's keep going:» Armor balance, basically, your armor does not matter at all in PVP, all that matters is if you wear armor OR not» Split damage is shit again» Originality, this game is everything but original, too many reused assets from Dark Souls 1 and 2 , characters, areas, weapons and armor, it is completely fine for a game to make a callback, or to go back to it's roots an example of that would be the crystal sages, a very nice way to say ''this is dark souls, the world has moved on'', but Anor londo is a huge pile of garbage.» Bonfire aestethics» Rosaria's realocations and slabs, so these are your only reasons to go to NG+, why exactly are these things finite? Because the devs are lazy.» Hackers, hackers are bad in every game, but there's something slightly more terrifying about hackers in Dark Souls 3, a while back there was a hack that when hitting you would glitch your character's model, making you take the form of a dragon while keeping your armor on and giving you a large ammount of souls, this would put you in a dangerous position because Dark Souls 3's programming would believe you were hacking to get extra souls, dooming your save file, the only way to fix this issue would be backing up your files and overwritting them after you've been hit by the hacker, even Fromsoftware has endorced the practice to counter these issues, as seen in the steam discussion threads of Dark Souls 3.And I could go on for days ...About balancing issues, about counterpicking, about min maxing, about glitching and bugs, but I think this is enough.No, I do not reccomend Dark Souls 3, and I encourage you to play the original Dark Souls, Demon's, Dark Souls 2 or Bloodborne over this one."
Negative,"Play offline, this is only good as a single player game. Pvp is a joke in this game as someone who has played all from games this is by far the worst for the online interactions."
Negative,Too long delay before online is usable again.
Negative,Controls are obviously for console players.  Keyboard+mouse combo was an after thought.  I played for 30 minutes and got frustrated.  Probably won't play it again.  Waste of money.
Negative,Its a poorly balanced mess of a game whose PvP meta is super armor and weapons that grant perserverance(Aka super armor).Its nearly impossible to punish exstus usage even when the enemy is barely out of melee range(Aka all the time).Magic is nearly useless in the game outside of gimmick builds or builds that use magic soley for damage on melee weapons(Which why bother sense you can't cast weapon buffs on a magic infused weapon)It lacks its own story really using mainly old characters and ideas from the other games without adding much itself to the formula(The fire keeper is a less interesting emerald herald for example as they both share the same mechanical and story usages).The balance is bad enough that the devs themselves have denoucned it in interviews of skeiro shadow's die twice(The dev worked on both games) when asked about why there was no weapons or multiplayer. To paraphrase: Its because we wanted to get back to basics after the balancing failure of their previous game(DS3).This game's main appeal is if your play DS1 your going to be getting nothing but fanservice for the entire game reguardless of if it makes any sense for said characters or items or even covenants being there. For example:The sun light warrior covenant is literally laying on a random table in the undead settlement with no explanation of why its there or who the sun light warriors even are. Another example is Greighton from DS2 invades once then falls off the face of the earth never to be seen nor heard from again with 0 text or dialog even acknowledging his existence in the game.TLDR: This is a poorly balanced mess and is only here for DS1 fans as it doesn't really have an identity of its own other then having the worst balance in the series to the point the devs(Or at least a dev) called it out themselves.
Negative,Got invaded and a hacker put 40 modded items in my inventory that I cannot remove. Not a very good game.
Negative,I'd rather play DSII than this
Negative,"f.u.c.k you stupid company, you guys kiss my d.i.c.k"
Negative,I'm ok with it being difficult but the combat mechanics are to sloppy for me.
Negative,This game sucks Its just one big depressing troll ment to drag you down and make fun of gammers.
Negative,"Looks gorgeous but ranged magic was a bit of a joke tbh, so it's a mostly melee based slash 'em up for playing sat on the sofa with a controller.If you find 'slash slash roll repeat' a bit boring then this is not the game for you. Or me for that matter which is a shame as like i said, it looks amazing."
Negative,"Sadly, I'm gonna have to go against recommending it.I was looking for a challenging game and decided to give Dark Souls 3 a try. Now, while the game is actually challenging, it wasn't what I was looking for, and that's the main reason for a negative review. If you're here looking for mechanically challenging game (something like Mordhau combat perhaps or even Hades, or dodging stuff like in Enter the Gungeon) this isn't going to be it.First of all, you can't cancel your actions, which leads to you being locked in whatever you pressed with no means to stop it. Accidentally attacked twice instead of once? Too bad. Used an item by accident? Too bad again, enjoy your death. While I understand it's fully intended, it makes combat not feel smooth and fluid for me, which is something I was expecting.On top of that, the game is mostly trial and error, or a memory game of sorts. If you're doing your first playthrough without any knowledge beforehand, the game will be hard. But it's not ""hard"" in a way I'd like it to be - it's more the lack of knowledge, which once you gain, the game becomes a breeze. Will that enemy's attack sequence hit twice of thrice? Should you roll away during his windup or should you wait mid-animation? Can you parry this? That's basically what makes the game ""hard"". Once you've corpse ran a zone a couple of times, you'll learn all the attack patterns of enemies and how to deal with what, making it very possible to run big portions of zones (if not, even whole levels) without taking any damage at all. Your typical run goes something like this:>find an enemy/enemies>see if you can kill them fast (or before they can hit you) / die a couple of times to learn their moveset>repeat on next enemyEDIT: Forgot to include this, but another major part of its difficulty is just finding the way to go. Considering there's enemies everywhere, this extends the above mentioned for quite a while per zone. Personally, I wasn't a huge fan of it as it also adds to the feeling that you haven't made any progress that I mention bellow. Often times your whole session will end up with just ""okay, so I spent all that time just to find out it's the wrong way"" and you're back to square one. With that in mind, your in-game currency used for purchasing equipment and upgrades (called ""souls"") drops on death at the place you die. So, say you got to an enemy #10, you're gonna have to pass the previous 9 without dying to reach your souls. To use them, you must be near a bonfire so you can travel to the upgrade NPCs. This will often leave you with no ugprades for a while. To me, this didn't feel good at all because it would often leave me feeling like I've made no progress at all and discourage me from playing.With that said, the environments and the general aesthetic of the game is truly beautiful. If what I described seems like a challenge you're looking for then, by all means, go for it! But if you're after a game with smooth combat and more challenging on the mechanical side, I'd recommend you keep looking elsewhere."
Negative,"With 400 hours in ds1 and 220 hours in ds2 I consider myself a souls veteran, and heres what this vet has to say: meh.The combat takes getting used to but can flow quite nicely when the right mindset sinks in, the world looks amazing as ever and the areas are for the most part very well designed, and the game has almost as many swords as borderlands has guns so props to the dev team that took the time to animate everything.However this game has some flaws that keep it not only from being a great souls game but just a good game in general. 1) The lock on. Holy fuck the lock on system is complete shit in this game. I lost track of how many times I have stopped focusing on an enemy just because I shifted the camera a smidgen to see if that armored dipstick I hear beside me has moved within hitting distance. My target never fully leaves my screen but the lockon dosen't care. It also has the shortest range of any of the souls games. In ds1 I could lock on and then move almost 2 rooms away and still focus on my target. In ds3 I often lost target lock backing away from a dude swinging a halberd just 15 feet away.2) Ultra greatswords  and slow weapons in general are almost useless in pve. My favorite class of weapon made obsolete by one thing: the enemies move and attack way to damn fast in this game. Combine enemy speed with the fact that armor cant be upgraded and poise dosent work and you have a recipie for a game where it is always going to be preferable to just spam r1 with a longsword than wait behind a shield for the right moment between enemy attack patterns.3) The pvp. Just watch this to understand why. 4) The npc quests. This is more of a minor point as for the most part they dont matter but one of them unlocks a completly different ending. In ds1 and 2 Solaire and lucatiel had slightly convoluted quests with lucatiel being the weirdest (girl how the hell did you get in that cave?) but ds3 takes it to a whole new level. I can guarentee that if you did a blind playthrogh with no wiki checks you would fail all of them. 5) The dlc. I cant... I just cant.All in all this game kinda left me even more sad at the fact that it is the last in the series as it dosen't feel likea an evolution of the last 2 games in anything other that graphics. Graphics are nice but its not why people buy souls games."
Negative,"Positives:Exploring the world is fun and there is alot of interessing stuff to find.Running back if you have lost your souls is a really cool mechanic.Gives a reason to go back to the place you have died and pay attention there stuff is and not to run in to traps.Also the markers on the ground make this a really cool expirence.Negatives:The boss gameplay suck.They look cool but play like shit.Imo game would have probably been better without them or have them used for some story stuff thats not fighting them.They are either way to easy, gimmicks, area denial/spam attacks or punish mistakes by basiclly oneshotting you.Sometimes you even get combinations of those.Game devolves to run to boss, either beat it basiclly first try or google weakness/gimmick after 10 tries.On the part of retrying bosses:I can stand retrying.I've played more than enough OSU for that to not be a problem.What i cant stand is, that the game fucking demands of you that you waste atleast 30 seconds to run back to enter the boss area.There is nothing interessing happening.You run past a few enemies and thats it (Sometimes you even have to dodge one, because thats the peak of gameplay).You learn or see nothing new.Its a complete waste of everyones time.Anyways enough about that.Does the game give those infos on its own how to beat them easier?Idk, i havent found any of it yet.Is searching for that info part of the game?Also idk and if it is, than i cant be bothered to do this part of the game.The game doesnt value my time when it is about bosses so im not willing to spend anymore of mine on it.I value my time higher than being forced to search for specific information in the most stupid way possible.Td;DrInteressting world, but shit bosses.Watch Lets play/Walkthrough or some lore videos.Thats probably about as entertaining and wastes less of your time.Maybe i change my mind when i finish the game but i dont think that will happen."
Negative,"Even though it's on Steam, you can't play unless you have a controller. You'll get trapped in the settings or level select because it's waiting for you to hit the ""A"" or ""B"" or ""Start"" buttons, which you CAN'T DO ON A KEYBOARD, and  there's no way I could find to change that.A great game that's a complete waste of money on Steam due to ZERO optimization for this platform."
Negative,"I'm enjoying this game but seriously, how lazy can you be?The port is horrible, here are the problems I've had:-Low and inconsistent framerates, even though the game looks like a xbox 360 era game-No support for 16:10 monitors(even though it lets me pick the res there are black bars)-There isn't even a goddamn quit to desktop button. You have to alt f4.-Blurry textures for things like grassAs i said, good game but i'm not going to leave a positive review and encourage such lazy portsIf you are going to charge 60 bucks for a game, don't be a jerk and make it run properly.EVEN EA OPTIMIZES THEIR GAMES"
Negative,For shutting down the servers
Negative,"The game is designed to be played with a controller. It sucks if you plan on using a mouse and a keyboard. Also, I have a slightly better graphics card  than the recommended card, and I get about 20 fps on low settings."
Negative,i didnt do nothing but im in troll server wtf
Negative,"Clunky as fuck with an artificial difficulty.This game is not hard because the enemies are tough, it's hard because your character has a stick up his ass and can do 3 moves, that's the entire combat system if you can even call it a combat system.Exploring is useless 9 times out of 10 because you probably won't use what you just found. You just have to stick to 1 armor and 1 weapon that you like and continuously upgrade those."
Negative,"Beautiful game but If you like Pve, this game isnt for you, random high level players invade your world and attacks you and kills you. Some bosses are way overpowered and way too much bugs like bosses hits you even when they miss also bosses can hit you even when you stay behind a wall or a pillar and more.Graphics --> BeautifulGame play in single-player --> a little boringGame play in multi-player --> ok, could get higher if you could turn pvp offAudio -->Very goodAudience --> AdultsPC Requirements --> High Difficulty -> Super Hard to play solo / Hard to play with companyStory -> BoringGame Time -> LongPrice -->Not worth full price or discountBugs --> average amount of bugsI cant recommend this game as it is."
Negative,"I wish I could give both a thumbs up and a thumbs down.single player?probably the best souls game so far.Want to play online? just don't. PVP is the worst of the series, where 11 year olds can just run up to you and spam L2 or circle and when things get bad just hide among the 100000 mobs all maps are filled with.now let's break down why this game online is bullshit:Quickroll is ridiculously overpowered. We were fighting 3 on one against 1 invader, ganged up on him and guess what? didn't hit him once because he kept spamming circle. Are you fucking kidding me? How many invulnerability frames do you even goddamn get? I guess having the right timing is too casual, let's make this game SUPER HARD by rewarding rollspam while naked. Dark Souls 3 is designed to be invaded, have this piece of shit run up to you, get his ass kicked and then hide away among the enemies further down the level to ambush you, and this feels worse than the other souls games since the map is FILLED with cheap ass trash mobs. This is one scenario, the other one is he runs up, you fight a bit, and he spam parries you, because why keeping parrying a high risk - high reward move where you actually have to be good to pull it off, no, spamming L2 is so much more harder. I never even liked the PVP side of the souls games in the first place, i played mostly for the lore and the single player, but I admired the skill it took and actually had a bit of fun in a few duels. Here in DS3 it's just this joyless charade of bullshit. Oh yeah, and let's not forget the fact that if they invade you, YOU CAN'T FUCKING TELL SINCE THE NOTIFICATION IS INSTANT AND SMALL AS HELL. Nothing like dying in a spot, trying to get your souls back and take on the boss just to be invaded and backstabbed by some prick who I didn't even know was there. Such a great experience. Again, play it offline if you want to enjoy it. I played all the souls games, demon's souls included, none of them felt this much like a cheap, awful calibrated casual-tailored pile of garbage as this one."
Negative,"Oh, what's that? You like some of the good features that Dark Souls 2 brought around, especially the improved PVP experience? Well fuck you, lol. Clearly Dark Souls 1 was better in every single way 'cause muh nostalgia.- Miyazaki"
Negative,"Between the invisible walls, forced PVP and the ten point stat system, the only real appeal to this game is its masochistic difficulty. Go buy the Witcher 3 for a similar combat system and a far better experience.Also some items and an entire area is only unlockable through using emotes in specfic areas - though they don't tell you that.Furthermore, you generally have no idea where you're going or what you're really doing. Questlines are random and you aren't told how to follow them.Any game where you need a wiki to tell you what you're doing is shit."
Negative,"All of the help icons showing you moves and tactics are being described in controller keys, not keyboard keys. Also, from the start, the game is tedious without any real sense of accomplishment, just one level after the next, I will be refunding this."
Negative,"I do not like to play with controllers, and I refuse to do it. A game should be optimized for mouse and keyboard if it is going to appear on Steam. To give you an idea of how this game is optimized for mouse and keyboard, you can't even switch the on screen tips to show the key bindings for the keyboard or mouse instead of the controller. No matter what you change, it will always appear as the controller shortcuts."
Negative,the worst keyboard control ever
Negative,-Gets the game to play with friends-Gets invaded literally every two minutes because developpers thought it was a good idea to let experienced players attack beginners in the start area-Quits
Negative,"I love this game and this series, but this is not a good port. Unstable and prone to crashes on PC even over a year after release, porting from console was clearly an afterthought."
Negative,"Lazy por. No keyboard inputs on tutorials or on anything. Shows controller inputs instead. Finding how to do things even in keybindings is hard as hell as not all is shown there(like kick).Also crashes happen often in this game. Before even reaching first bonfire. One fix is to play as knight or set lightning quality to low. That doesn't stop all crashes though.    Avoid for now, maybe patches will flesh these out by time. But we shall see, Dark souls patches pushes in slowly so the wait might be a mighty one."
Negative,"I really don't reccomend this game in it's current state, or potentially in any state at the current rate it's going.+ Some of the enemies are unique and challenging.+ Some Bossess are original and interesting fights.+ Gear and throwbacks to previous games enjoyable to see.- Repetitive grab / fire-based mechanics on enemies.- Current patch gives freezes that last multiple seconds, even on a GTX 970 4GB VRAM, 16GB RAM and a i5 2500k.- PvP is currently in a horrible state due to the broken nature of the connection, making it near impossible to have anything that seems fair, along with horribly unbalanced weapons, areas in which invaders are guranteed. Sorry if you wanted to run the game embered and just PvM!Honestly this game would feel so much nicer if there wasn't so many obvious flaws with mechanics of the game which are thrusted upon you. I dread the moment I see I'm invaded by ""Git gud kid"" whilst trying to run an area in NG+ whatever. The hitboxes feel so unaligned and the length of weapons seems to feel as a downside rather than an upside of holding a larger weapon. Combined with the awful connectivity, even with cross region play disabled, you just might aswell let them kill you as it's almost guranteed everyone is min/maxing to an absolute peak.Did I forget to mention they broke poise aswell? when asked what they plan to do, they stated, ""Poise is working as intended"" when it literally has no benefit. thank's for this riveting information!Did I forget to mention possible invaders are also hacking? Any items they drop modify your game data in such a way it's possible to get you permanently banned from the game. So they can invade you and you get banned, SIGN ME UP!I wouldn't bother purchasing this game until changes are made that actually make it more reasonable for those who are interested in getting into PvP or plan to just PvM whilst getting invaded can hold a chance against someone with a similar skill level on a even playing field."
Negative,"I just wanted to see if writing a review shows the time played for games using family share. Which it does apparently, don't know where else this would be shown.But since I'm already here you can definitely skip this one. In retrospect this just shows that no one at FromSoft was interested in the franchise and world of ""Dark Souls"" anymore, so they half heartily packed the game full of fan service that makes Dark Souls 2 seem creative. Expect a lot ""Remember x?? You loved that when you played DS1, right?!"". If you don't care about that and also don't care that souls is no longer about outsmarting your opponent and variety in approaches but rather a standard action game with tacked on stats then go for it. Bossfights are basically shonen anime now with EVERY (E V E R Y) boss having 2 phases: The first one being a joke and the second one clearly designed to overwhelm and cheaply kill you by spamming attacks as soon as the bosses hit half HP. I don't know about you but I liked my souls bosses more as a ""puzzle"" and less as a ""Cut me down to half HP each time, then learn when to press dodge once I show you my real moveset"". And if you're into shonen anime bosses I'd recommend actual action games (DMC, God Hand, Ninja Gaiden Black etc).I played through it. It was fun. But it also made me lose interest in the whole Soulsbornesekiring franchise because as far as I'm concerned, they let the fans take over design and/or forgot what made Demon's Souls and Dark Souls masterpieces in the first place."
Negative,"-For the record, I am writing this review having completed every vanilla boss except for the Nameless King and the Soul of Cinder. I also have the Ashes of Ariandal DLC that I have not touched. At this point I am walking away and not sure I am coming back.-As a complete game, Dark Souls 3 has little to offer. It is a boss marathon dressed up in beggars clothes. For all of its hype it has critical flaws which severely diminish its positive aspects.For one, the camera is often detrimental to the player, and surprisingly this is an issue in many of the boss fights. You get stuck on terrain you can't see, or the camera positions in such a way that you can't see the telegraphs of the boss. Often you are fighting the camera and other lousy mechanics more than the boss.Other mechanics that hurt players include the fact that nearly all enemies can hit through walls and terrain with melee attacks, but the player can almost never hit them back in the same way. I have been able to abuse wall clipping in a single instance. For a game that seemingly enourages ""cheesing,"" it punishes its players in such a way that for some boss fights it actually takes options away from the player.That is another issue. There is little room for creativity from the player when engaging boss fights, and nearly nothing the player can learn or discover to aid them in boss fights. WIthout reading a wiki, knowing what types of damage a boss may be weak to is a matter of testing and number crunching. Much like the rest of the game, it is this repetitive ""trial and error"" that detracts from the experience of each fight. The game simply trains you to accomplish each task in a certain way, and you will fail until you learn the way it was meant to be done. Again, little room for cleverness or creativity by the player.In terms of narrative and what you could call ""side quests,"" it is typically unclear to the player how to advance any singular side-plot of peripheral characters. As the game encourages player to explore by rewarding them with findable equipment and items, it also punishes players for exploring by triggering failures to certain quests unknown to the player. By advancing too far without accomplishing unlisted tasks, the player can actually cause Dark Spirit NPCs to basically disappear from the playthrough, or even cause peripheral NPCs to die with no apparent cause. The cause and effect of player actions is, again, something the player can only understand through trial and error. It is completely head-scratching.I think that is enough about negatives. I could go on but I do want to touch on positive parts of this game, some I even think are brilliant. For instance, the messages that players can leave for eachother are hilarious, helpful, and informative. It is a simple way for players to feel part of a community trying their hardest to beat a game. Without giving too much away, players often drop hints at what is to come. I think this is such a unique and awesome mechanic that goes a long way towards building community, letting players create content (if limited), and helping newer players with the game.I also deeply appreciate the variety of weapons and armor that are available, even if some of the armor stats (poise) aren't well explained and some of the weapons really aren't viable. Since each weapon has its own moveset and secondary abilities, there is a lot of customization available to players in how they approach PVP fights and even PVE encounters. Developers should be apploaded for this especially. The PVP system in this game, and combat in general, are really fantastic, well executed especially with the weapon variety.  Lastly, the art direction of the game is incredible. Visually, it's astounding. From the minor environmental details to the distant scenery, it's all impressive.To be honest, I still am not sure what the plot is. I'm not sure what the connection is between all the bosses, or why all these dudes are trying to kill me. I understand the ""linking of the fire"" for the most part, and I can tell there has been a war of some sort. I didn't find the game overly difficult. I think a lot of the difficulty is just frustrating mechanics and elements being trumped up. I freely admit I was absurdly frustrated at times.  I just can't recommend this to a casual gamer. As for ""hardcore"" gamers, I don't even know what that means. Anyone can beat this game, it's just a matter of learning and working through unbelievable frustration."
Negative,"The Quick Review, Do you like Dark Souls? Well if you do this is more Dark Souls. It's almost exactly what you expect, except it has new areas and abilities. I've played all the souls games and Bloodborne and all that, and this game made me realize I'm bored of this. (Except Bloodborne, that game is dope). Anyways, I've always felt the difficulty of these games was over exaggerated. This game seems easier than the others. I put 23 hours into it, hardly dying for a Souls Game,  I got to a point where there was a cathedral, and the place was huge. I was making a mental map in my head, trying to keep track of all the numerous paths I still needed to go through, and I let out an sigh within my brain. Yes I sighed in my head with disappointment as I realized I was incredibly bored. I just didn't care. These games could really use better narratives...but you're not here for that. If you're itching for more Souls stuff, this will scratch the itch. For me, it scratched it so well that I don't think I'll need it again for a very long time. Pass.7/10"
Negative,"You'll see a lot of raving positive reviews for this game comparing it to DS 1 & 2. I don't doubt that it's the ""prettiest"" or ""the best optimized one"" of the three. It doesn't change the fact that it remains an obscure, visually unattractive game. It's very responsive and has quite the variety of patterns to learn but it's still Dark Souls to the core. If that's not entirely your thing, DS3 is not your thing."
Negative,duck sols gud gaim. no i like gud gaim buta good gain = gud hey. hey hey. wait wa. nnono
Negative,"Time to write a review. This is my personal opinion, my review. So here goes.I dislike Dark Souls 3.The previous games certainly weren't without fault, but it seems like all of these faults have compounded in Dark Souls 3 to leave it a frustrating experience.I am starting with the character customization. Which is good admittedly, you can make amazing looking characters or ones that are more hideous than Shrek. The real problem comes in with the way you can play your character. You can be a strong warrior with giant weapon, a nimble assassin like guy, a cleric that heals and throws lightning, or a mage with a wide array of spells to make use of. Or you can be a strong mage that shoots beams of blue death, tots a giant hammer and rolls around like a gummyball. You can build your character as you please.Its all a wash. Because here's where the problem starts. The game promotes only one way to play it, and that is to be a cheesy combat pragmatic that backstabs, stunlocks and does hit and run like its nobodies business. In other words, the nimble assassin. The problem with that are the designs of some enemies, which sadly exist in abundance. Starting already with the Lothric Knights in the first zone that you enter after exiting the ""tutorial"". They come in sword and spear variants and basically never stop swinging and being in your face. Are you a caster? Enjoy getting stabbed as the heavily armored maniac charges right through your pitiful little magic missile and stabs you in the face. Are you a cleric? Hah, you don't even have any offensive miracles at this point yet.Are you a warrior? Try and block his attacks and see him burn through your stamina before he proceeds to fuck your face with his metal stick again. ""Huh, its time to git gud, scrub."", yeah fucko, you're right. And you know how that looks like? Backstab the fucker or parry his attack and stab him in the gut. Except that is nothing that a sorcerer can or would do, parrying and backstabbing are warrior and assassin things. Mage, have fun dying, git gud and level your dex you scrub, embrace the holy katana masturbation aid. Okay, lets assume you made it past those knights by getting gud and learned how to fish backstabs. Maybe you have even noticed that you can stunlock them when you two hand your weapon and just keep swinging during their very rare pauses of attack.Up next, behold the wonder that are the fat women called Evangelists. They give a rats ass about your stunlocking, all that wobbling mass turns them into immovable objects that turn into self immolating unstoppable forces as they smother you to death against their fiery bossom. The dance of backstab fishing continues.And Dark Souls 3 has a lot of enemies that require you to backstab fish. BEHOLD THE GIANT ENEMY CRAB. Probably the best example of what the fuck is wrong with this game. It is gigantic, resilient as all hell AND NEVER STOPS ATTACKING. It just keeps wapping away at you with its giant claws.Magic? Its immediately in your face, giving you sweet crusty love.Tanking it with your shield? You don't seem to be aware how great a can opener those claws are.Backstabbing? Not with this crab. Dodgerolling is the only thing you can do that will get you anywhere.Dodgerolling will get you places in this game. Go level your Dex, you scrub. ""But Jag! I have this gian hammer, surely that will crack the malevolent crustacean, won't it?"" Oh my little Strawman, you're not wrong. Except that while you swing that hammer, the crab will once more give you its crusty love. The problem is, Dark Souls 3 has a lot of enemies that seem ripped straight from Bloodborne, where nonstop, high speed, high lethality combat was a norm with invincibility windows that were wider than a hooker's money maker. This works when you play Dark Souls 3 like Bloodborne, dodging everything and everywhere, letting those glorious rolls carry you past the horizon and into a better world. Another thing that shows how broken the notion of different playstyles actually is. Do you wish to play a tank? Do you like the look of huge armor and massive shields and letting your enemies break upon the wall that is you? The damage resistance system in Dark Souls 3 is broken. Its a joke. Somebody crunched the math and even when wearing the ""best"" and heaviest armor in the game, you died just as quickly as a guy who wore armor that you start the game in. Its save to say that armor literally only exists for the fashion, except that it has weight associated with it that can seriously cripple your characters ability to evade attacks.And with enemies that never stop attacking, even the biggest shield will eventually cave and you get your face pushed in again.And that was only the problem I have with the enemies themselves. Lets carry on, shall we? The aesthetics of the game are... samey? You start in a decrepit and ruined graveyard, behind you a tremendous castle... or fortress resting atop a mountain as a backdrop. Ahead you have the desolate Firelink Shrine, who certainly has seen better days.From there you make your way to the Kingdom of Lothric, a ruined city and castle, with heaps of dead people, strange trees and beheaded knights everywhere. From there on to the undead settlement... a ruined village with heaps of dead people. Then Farron Woods... a swamp with ruins of a castle and not quite as many heaps of dead people. But fret not! You may enter the ruined graveyard of the Cathedral of the Deep where heaps of dead people walk around, before you make your way into the disheveled cathedral that had seen brighter days too. Heaps of dead bodies and ruined castles or cathedrals remain a fairly common theme, the only area that really stood out in my mind was the winter wonderland of Irithyll, the Boreal Valley... which however had about the most forgettable bossfights ever. Other than four bossfights none of them struck me as particularly memorable. And three of those bossfights I only remember because I literally had to do them a dozen times, because much like the regular enemies, they often never stop attacking and keep being in your face constantly.Special mention deserves Champion Gundyr for being the only boss in the game that will FUCKING AIR JUGGLE YOU. Its like he jumped right out of Soul Calibur or Street Fighter. He will punch you, shoulder tackle, kick and throw you like its nobodies business, all the while being completely unfazed by your attacks.And that is yet another gripe I have with the game, the terrible inconsistency of its rules. Some enemies will get staggered when you attack them, which keeps them from attacking you, sometimes they will completely ignore your attacks and just wade through it like you're just giving them a gentle carress of the inner thigh. Bosses will almost always ignore your attacks and continue their own, which becomes problematic when you have an enemy like Gundyr who has freakishly long strings of attacks, where you can only evade and hope in to sneak in a quick poke. (God forbid you're using a big and slow weapon)Finally, as my last point, I have to say the biggest problem I have. The game cheats. The previous games had their monster closets, rooms that specificly exist to harbour an enemy that will walk out of it when you run past in order to ambush you. That was fine, when you knew about it or were slow enough, you could take care of that ambush by basically ambushing it in turn. Dark Souls 3 will straight up spawn enemies in your back that have not been there previously, with no hint whatsoever that they will appear other than your knowledge in hindsight. I consider that bad form in a game that boasts that ""everything can be solved with preperation, patience and care"". You can't prepare for something that literally didn't exist moments ago. Okay, done."
Negative,Great game but can't recommend because of the literal hours you will waste walking from bonfire to fog door when working on a boss.
Negative,I was randomly banned without reason in 2019 why from what did i do.
Negative,"Man, fuck this game. Loaded in and my character wont stop moving into a random wall. Im going to jump off of a bridge and I want my money back goddammit."
Negative,Overrated trash for kids. :/
Negative,It's overall a fantastic game!If they would manage it to give softbans to the correct users with appropriate reasons! I got softbanned for playing the game in English instead of German?!?  like seriously?!? invalid data use because I played the game on English? I'm sorry but that is a no-go
Negative,"A game that's almost 8 (!) years old, why the hell is this still FULL PRICE ?????I enjoyed it, still do, but after a major succesfull game like Elden Ring, DS3's price should half price of the half price. JFC FromSoft, get real. Are you going full Nintendo on your player base?I love it, but because of the price I don't recommend it. Wait for a sale."
Negative,"Yes, I'll recommend the game, but i'm giving it a down just because of the fact that In steam, It's gives you console controls, which is stupid. Why is the name of God should I have to sort through the menus just to figure how to play it on PC? I don't own any consoles, so why do I have to reconfigure and go though stupid fucking menus to be able to play this game? I understand this game is supposed to be hard, but this port over to PC idiotic, and I don't want extra difficulty just trying to figure out how to play the damn game.Maybe I'm an idiot and there is a way to change the preset controls to  change the things that say press Y to do whatever, But still, It's a bad port to PC and there's no reason why PC players should deal with sifting through menus to figure out how to make them play the game.Trust me I like a hard game and it's fun to play hard games, but the menu sorting and reconfig is bullshit and I feel like there's no reason for me to do that as someone who spent 60 dollars on a game.Seriously, When Dark souls 4 comes out and It's for PC, don't make me sort though menus to  figure out how to play, just give me PC controls"
Negative,Theres a puddle of piss underneath me.
Negative,"Everything is great except the co-op feature.If you live in Down Under and wanna summon friends from Midgard, good luck."
Negative,Can't even use borderless + controller ads without getting tagged! Downvoted because of this.
Negative,Combat is overhyped. People only like it because gameplay is hard. Its not immersive. Its crap compared to games with good combat and good animations.
Negative,please stop making games
Negative,No 21:9 native support. The native mouse control is so uncontrollable it's a joke... I have never encountered game developers incompetent enough to not add 21:9 support and decent mouse speed to a game even after a year. Do not buy this ancient piece of absolute fucking garbage.
Negative,"I really wanted to like this game and think it was good, but there's just so much that drags it down. For every super fun boss there's an awful 0 fun allowed zone that follows it. Most zones are super uninspired and feel like worse editions of their Dark Souls 1 versions. Every room you enter has a secret guy hiding that's going to gank you for half your health. Farron Keep might be the worst zone in any game I've played in my life. Both DLC areas despite having great bosses are super unfun to traverse. Almost all the bosses are truly awesome though, I will say. Fighting Gael was the most fun boss in the entire series so far for me. Makes me wish there was just a boss rush mode for this game but I get why there isn't. I'ts like they listened to everyone going ""woah dark souls is such a hard and epicly difficult game...."" and took it to the extreme. Game just feels mean and unfun most of the time."
Negative,"UPDATE: Despite playing ""an additional 228 hours"", I still stand by my criticisms of the game's lack of consistency in audio, visuals, and animations. The game lacks a lot of important polish that would make it a positive review. The things that are frustrating are still frustrating after 200 hours. There's crazy production on display, but the game is mostly just frustrating and not because of the arbitrary artificial difficulty.  I have very mixed feelings on Dark Souls 3. I’m now on my 3rd playthrough, with another on New Game +. I played through primarily as Deprived. After 60 hours I can say finally my thoughts on it and give it a negative review with a score of 5/10.Dark Souls 3 fails for me as a game for one major reason – and that is inconsistency. In a game about making quick decisions and recognising patterns, inconsistency is an incredibly fatal flaw. The game is meant to be hard, not frustrating because of inconsistency. What do I mean by inconsistency? For example: Attacks, visuals and sounds not matching up with when things happen. Sometimes you have to dodge on the visual cue, the audio cue or when you can see actual model of the attack. So you’ll go to roll as the person raises their sword to swing and the ‘swoosh’ sound plays, but then they actually do the attack a little over a second later. Attacks hitting things that can’t possibly physically, visually or logically hit (for example a forward attack hitting behind). Attacks that connect visually but don’t deal damage, or make the sound but don’t deal damage. It’s hard to explain this in a unconvoluted way. For a game about combat, you can’t tell what half the enemies are doing unless you have a reasonable knowledge of the game. You don’t know what/when/how many an attack is, but you know you should probably dodge it. Online has not great netcoding. And by not great I mean it’s about as shoddy and full of bullshit as the Australian Greens Party. You’ll hit people when they aren’t there. They’ll hit you when you aren’t there. The fact that you get the hit sound feedback even if you didn’t hit them, and vice versa. That being said, apart from being frustrating dealing with enemy players, the co-op is pretty okay. I played co-op mostly on my second playthrough and here the networking problems were even more prevalent.  Inconsistency of enemy positions (for example, my friend saw the skeleton boulder was broken when it wasn’t, got hit by it when it was literally nowhere near him at the other end of the tunnel, stuff like this happened very often), connections errors that were primarily linked to wacky server maintenance, passwords not working (seriously, who else is using meme1122 as their password? Why can they summon me?) Co-op was a whole lot of fun when it worked, and you got to do some very silly strategies that completely destroyed the structure and balance of the PvE side of the game. Getting invaded when co-oping was also pretty fun. “But Algatress, Dark Souls 2/3 sucked! You just have to get good! They aren’t real Dark Souls!”I mean, the learning of enemies really sucked the first playthrough. By the third you would think I would know what I’m doing, but the game still strikes me as obscenely grindy and inconsistent. Another thing that’s absolutely sickening is the Dark Souls community in general. If 2 out of 3 of the games in your series ‘suck’ by the communities own discretion, chances are it isn’t just the devs making mistakes. These games have flaws, from a design point of view. “Why aren’t you playing DS1?”I did. It had similar issues, and didn’t strike me especially differently, it had locked 30 fps that ruined it even with DSFix. “They ruined Dark Souls!”No, these games area good. Not as nearly as the circlejerk elitists make it out to be. They’re not amazing, but they’re pretty good some of the time. Which comes back to the same thing of consistency: I don’t know if I’m going to enjoy myself if I sit down to play Dark Souls 3, and this is the main aspect that pushes this review into the negative. Some of the bosses are truly unenjoyable. I don’t mean hard, I mean bland. Bosses I really enjoyed fighting: Abyss Watchers, Dancer, The Twin Princes, Vordt, Deacons, and (kind of) the Soul of Cinder.Almost everything else felt like it was needlessly padded with wait times (the 10 second wait time on the Giant Tree AoE slow is ridiculous especially when it’s every other attack) and attacks that were intentionally designed to make you go “Oh” as the screen greys out. I’m looking at you, Darkeater Dragon. You don’t get massive AoE that does half my hp, a health bar longer than Angela Merkel’s penis and high mobility. One shots are not fun when you can’t tell what kind of attack they are, or how they’re going to take place. Because chances are you’ll die before you figure out what hit you and how to dodge it. The one thing I can primarily say I absolutely loved about this game was the music. The soundtrack, as with the other souls games, is admirable. It’s carries the game, especially the boss fights. I can’t compliment it enough. I could write an essay on how excellent this music is (yes, from a musical theory point it isn’t that ‘amazing’, but most people don’t recognise that.)Oh yes, and let’s not forget XBOX controls. $60, + DLC (I got it with the season pass for $53 AUS to avoid the Steam scam) , so yes, $60 fucking USD for a game that doesn’t have native controls. Why is the button for lock on the same button for flipping the camera? Who thought that was a good idea? I’m going to destroy their car breaks without them knowing, I swear to go.For a $60 game, you should at least have rebindable controls on a port, or maybe, I don’t know, have fully supported controls for the platform you’re playing on?I’ve coded control schemas cross platform before. This shit isn’t hard. It really isn’t. The fact that this made it to release and multiple patches is honestly unprofessional. What else haven’t I covered? Oh yes, the Lord of Cinder’s Sunlight Spear (yes, the thing you get for beating the FINAL BOSS of the game) does minimal damage even with a build surrounding it, and generally damage, spells and scaling doesn’t make sense. The things which are cool mostly suck or have been nerfed until they suck. I hope you like Dex builds. And I hope you like needlessly painful areas (for example the artillery areas because you probably haven't done the thing which you couldn't possibly know to do), the Swamps where you take unavoidable damage and are almost perpetually slowed against masses of enemies, the quests which can be failed from the slightest thing and exist only to punish you and force you to play through this garbage game a second time to see if maybe something interesting happening.This game was hit or miss, like my review score.5/10."
Negative,"imagine leaving the closest bonfire 2 minutes from the boss you need to do and you run for 2 minutes every single god damn attempt just to make it to the boss and die because you arent high enough level. this game can go fuck itself. if you like it, I hate you"
Negative,"too easy to get bored with this game, compared to ds1 and 2"
Negative,"(4/12/2016) This game is a joke. The bosses are easy and the enemies are easy. The worst part about the game I cannot recommend is the amount of bugs on day one release. consoles did not seem to have this many bugs as the PC version. I cannot help but be geninuely disgusted by how many people defend From Software.From Software fix your god damn game before you release to the public. the amount of exploits and glitches are so bad. Its awful how a triple A company like you practically release a game in alpha and just let people play. I have had to restart my character a total of 4 times not because of like poor builds, but because the amount of glitches that permalocked my characters on a infinite loading screen. Look if anyone is reading this right now, buy the game if you want BUT DO NOT GO TO THE CATHEDRAL OF THE DEEP because that'll permalock your character. I reverified my game cache and everything but this glitch that locks my character still occurs, because the whole area is bugged. Next i would like to mention how you brought like the ♥♥♥♥♥est things from Bloodborne. Bloodborne was already a geninuely ♥♥♥♥ game (this is coming from a guy who has 100% completed DaS1, DaS2, and Bloodborne). Next you rehash yet another souls game? Really? Like I wear different types of armor sets, check poise, and now I am convinced that the poise number was just added for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles and pvp because when its not pvp I still get stun locked by any enemy just like as If I was playing Bloodborne. Then you have the watchdog of old lords from Bloodborne practically painted black and looks like some sanic deviant art OC. Punishing people trying to help others is awful. Punish the guy that summons at least. But halving estus and about a 20%-30% hp decrease from people trying to help others is just plain stupid. At least in bloodborne you basically had the same amount of healing items as the host, but this game you don't. It punishes the people trying to do covenants and people trying to be a good goy and help scrubs. I cannot defend a ♥♥♥♥ game, because I had to restart my character 4 times only to have the same glitch occur over and over. Decreasing estus and hp max in pvp and co-op was borderline ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. The worst part is how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the enemy placement was, like did B team work on this? because this is Scholars of the first sin enemy placement, artificial difficulty. Then you made shields just as useless as they were in Dark Souls 2. Remember how in Dark souls 1 where you could practically parry any humanoid enemy? yeah well you can't anymore. Some of the enemies you can parry in Dark Souls 1 (e.g. black knights) they just eat the parry and have like infinite stamina and poise to the point where they can just 2 shot you. Never in my entire life have I ever wanted something organic because this difficulty is artificial. Yeah the bosses and enemies are jokes, but you occasionally run into the 1 or 2 enemies that just stun lock you for years. From please fix your game before I just end myself because this isn't how it was supposed to end. Not this bad."
Negative,Controller prompts sans controller.
Negative,"Got boring very quickly, I honestly dont understand how this game has such a following. The combat and gameplay remind me of an old N64 game as the Ai seems to be 15 years behind the times."
Negative,"Servers were taken down for an exploit that was fixed by independent people in less than a week. Here we are almost if not more than 2 months later and the tags for the souls games don't say multiplayer anymore. There hasn't been a single public announcement since they said they were taking the servers down until after Elden Rings release.The prices for the souls games here on steam were all raised after the last major steam sale while there hasn't even been an attempt to update players on the plan for the servers.Taking all of this in I cannot recommend any of these games because they are a husk of what they were with servers up.Let me make this clear as well, I say this because they are now charging more for literally every souls game on steam right now than they have in years. What are you getting for these hiked prices? Less of a game than you would've gotten when you could've bought the whole series for the price of one game. That's just a bad deal if you ask me.This series is my favorite game series period but I don't want to praise any aspect of these games without servers because that would just give FromSoftware more of an excuse to never bring the servers back."
Negative,"The best way to describe this game, is it's like an abusive relationship. you get angry, and hurt, and annoyed but you keep coming back to the game for reasons even you don't seem to understand. it's addictive no doubt, and it has a lot of fun content to it as well. But the toxic community, rage inducing main story, poor network connection, and the fact that the game punishes you for trying out new play styles can REALLY get on your nerves. (you're basically very limited on how you can play this game, and what weapons you can use, or you'll never get anywhere)I play this peice of shit game a lot, and I'll probably continue to. But I would never recomend this to anyone else because of it's painful drawbacks. Especially if you have anger issues."
Negative,You gotta be lame or a virgin if you swear by this game on bronem
Negative,didn't want to write a review before 10 hours so after all this time I think Dark souls 3 is just a good game; nothing more.
Negative,"Don't get me wrong, I love this game and I think it lives up to the original and surpasses it in many ways.That said this is a pisspoor PC port that forces you to play with a controller to defeat anything beyond Vordt and all tutorials are for controllers even if you are using mouse and keyboard only. It baffles me that From Software still has not managed to make an acceptable PC port that plays OK with keyboard and mouse, or properly supports mods."
Negative,This game is clearly desinged for other platforms. No intro into keybindings and control. Equipment and inventory very confussing. IMO a waste of money.
Negative,"Hello, I got PENALIZED before I finish my first run of 60 hrs?"
Negative,low effort game. devs obviously don't care
Negative,"Farron Keep is too hard, I'll stick to reading Berserk"
Negative,I have every reason to recommond this game❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ love it!but this DISLIKE is for NO STEAM-CLOUDwhere the ❤❤❤❤ do the game company think theyre at? somewhere in the ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ 1996 ?cant believe im playing a game of such kind without steam-cloud in the 2016use steam-cloud if ur working on the next game. such a RUINER
Negative,"Seems like it could be a fairly decent game.  It has a pretty engrossing atmosphere and dynamic character creation.Unfortunately, it is plagued by clunky, unresponsive controls with the most cumbersome camera/targetting system I've ever seen in any game I've ever played.  Selecting the target you want is extremely awkward (quite often it feels like you have to get only a few feet away before it will target-lock), and half the time when fighting, you lose target-lock randomly (it has an extremely short ""leash""), leaving you and your camera facing away from the threat with no quick means to re-engage.  There is seemingly no feature to ""target closest enemy"" which would help mitigate this issue.Certain moves or attacks seem like they take a half-second to trigger at times, and my rig is pretty beefy (by 2019 standards).  Other times, I've had dodge-rolls double on me (when I only pressed the button once).  I've tried several different controllers, and even an older wired Logitech to make sure it's not something with the wireless dongle.  I even tried other games to make sure something wasn't up with my setup.  Nope, every other game ran as normal with desired controller input.  It was just this game.I haven't tried with mouse and keyboard, but really this type of game *should* shine with a controller, and it simply doesn't.  For a good game reference, quite similar style to this game, with a solid camera, targeting and control system, see Shadows of Mordor.  Hell, go back in time to Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.  Even that crusty classic of a game had a superior camera and targeting system to this one.The arduous slog of fighting the controls to coax your spastic toon to get in line with what you want is just too much.  Save yourself the frustration, and at least, try before you buy.  If the horribly unresponsive mess of a poor excuse for controller input doesn't turn you off to it, then maybe I've just been spoiled by far tighter gameplay in other games."
Negative,"The console to pc port is worse than assassins creed 1! They didnt even bother to put in instructions in-game for the key bindings on the keyboard... also the actions seem delayed. If you don´t have a controller do not buy this game. Playing this without a controller gave me cancer. It shouldn´t say full controller support in the description, it should say controller support only!Could have been better graphics than 7 year old ps3 graphics."
Negative,It's 2018 and my game keeps crashing all the time. Like literaly every 10mins. I tried playing around with game setings and other stuff still no luck. I expected more form a DS game especially since 1 and 2 worked well enough.Btw I have good PC specs with a gtx 980.
Negative,"Don't get me wrong. I mean the game itself is really good, gameplay and control are better than other Souls franchises. And the matching system based on Soul Level is better than other Souls games. All bosses and DLC are really good, especially Gael Boss fight is the best boss fight in the game. But the fact that I bought this only for playing Co-op with my friend and seem to be really difficult because we got invaded every 2 minutes. I understand that Pvp is the thing that makes Dark Souls good and they nerf etus flask and ashen etus flask but you can get invaded by a person higher than you up to +20 Souls Level is ridiculous and we need Ember every time we want to coop. Even if we win it takes a lot of time and effort and we got invaded again right after that and it's suck.I hope Developers should at least have another option or change invade system somehow not letting it that often for anyone who wants to play Co-op in this game.Also, the game is full of hackers, all they did is just invade your world and inject invalid items into your inventory to get you banned. You can just backup your saved file and every time it happens you need to do that all over again.P/S: I'll not recommend it as the guy who wants to play co-op with friends. But if you want to play single player or something yeah definitely recommend this."
Negative,"Dark Souls III[a] is a 2016 action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Windows. The third and final entry in the Dark Souls series, the game follows an unkindled character on a quest to prevent the end of the world. It is played in a third-person perspective, and players have access to various weapons, armour, magic, and consumables that they can use to fight their enemies. Hidetaka Miyazaki, the creator of the series, returned to direct the game after handing the development duties of Dark Souls II to others.Dark Souls III was critically and commercially successful, with critics calling it a worthy and fitting conclusion to the series. It shipped over three million copies within its first two months and over 10 million by 2020. Two downloadable content (DLC) expansions, Ashes of Ariandel and The Ringed City, were also made. Dark Souls III: The Fire Fades Edition, containing the base game and both expansions, was released in April 2017. Dark Souls III: Deluxe Edition is identical to The Fire Fades Edition with the exception of having to download the DLCs separately."
Negative,"This game is just bad, and I am probably one in a million in saying that, but I don't care at all.The thing that annoys me the most about this game is that it is SO CLOSE to being good, apart from the fact that it's main personality attribute is being hard. The design of both the environment and the enemies is so cool and the music is so so good. But it gets a bit boring when every boss fight is just an unrewarding sack of dodge roll dodge roll hit dodge roll hit. I will say that I wouldn't mind this being the case in boss fights IF it felt smooth to play, but the game is just a glitchy mess and fans of the game act as if it isn't at all. (and not in a funny lovable glitchy way like Skyrim... a way that makes the game feel nasty and janky to play).Obviously with enough time, anyone can learn this game and eventually complete it. But I like video games that are fun and don't feel like a chore to play and complete... after all, completing this game isn't going on my CV.It's really important that this game starts to receive more criticism, as right now it has far too many people sticking up for it.4/10"
Negative,BAD game very bad game
Negative,"This game is a pitiful excuse for a souls game lol EDIT: DO NOT PLAY ONLINE, THERE IS AN RCE HACK WHERE INVADERS CAN HIJACK YOUR PC, FROM SOFT IS IGNORING THIS ISSUE, DO NOT PLAY THIS OR ELDEN RING ONLINE."
Negative,Spent 7h and didn't managed to overcome the 1st boss :/Sad story guys....
Negative,Jst dont guys jst dont
Negative,"After having played the four major souls games, this is by far the worst. Lacking in content with a far more linear design and questionable re-balancing of mechanics, this is a massive step down in many elements from DS2 scholar. All that being said, DS3 does have some strengths in the franchise. It has the best multiplayer and the best current major overhaul modifications. With Cinders especially, I would recommend this title. But as a base product - I would absolutely recommend DS2 Scholar over this."
Negative,"This is a thumbs up only if you got a controller, without it, it's unplayable for me. I've been a pc player since 386 times so definitely I expect to be able to navigate through even simple things such as menus with a mouse and keyboard!Absolutely straight port from console, horrid!"
Negative,"So frustrating and difficult when played on a PC with a mouse. No chocie to change difficulty. No way to make to controls better. Just frustating to play. Also, I have a fairly high end PC (alienware), and for some reason, I can't get 60FPS even on the lowest settings..... seriously?.... I'm cosidering getting my money back."
Negative,Недоделанный. нереиграбельный кусок говна с напрочь убитым мультиплейером.Самая слабая часть серии.Unfinished. unreplayable piece of shit with completely killed multiplayer.The weakest part of the series.\o/
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 has been published on PC sometime in the spring of 2016. We are now in 2019, more than three and a half years later, and the in-game instructions are STILL for a controller. Sure, one could parrot the Blizzard spin with some ""do you guys not have controllers?"" but I don't see what good that would do. This a PC game and PC games usually work with a keyboard and a mouse. Of course, controllers could - and probably should for a game such as DS3 - be added but refusing to adapt in-game instructions to the realities of PC gaming is frankly insulting. Dark Souls III may have been ported from the console but this is no excuse. Years have gone by, FromSoftarware has made a ton of money on PC and still one has to waste precious time on the web to see what controls should be used and how since the dear producers couldn't be bothered to do their job. Why would they? The game sold great, despite being a console port with console in-game instructions and all-around clumsy controls which have to be re-assigned in order for them to actually work. If people have bought it regardless of the producers' lazyness, why would FromSoftware bother doing any kind of work? Work is for idiots, let the buyer worry about it. Unprofessional behavior. This is a clear no, especially since it is a game as punishing as this."
Negative,so crashy and laggy
Negative,I have a supped 2000£ comp. Tries to play dark souls.. Won't load.. white screen upon loading.. Feelsbadman.. Even getting into the game is diffucult..
Negative,"Игра не сложная,боссы унылые,за исключением нескольких,эпичности тоже хватает не всем. Но почему же я именно не советую покупать эту игру,так это баги и неоправданно завышенная цена,если вы собираетесь покупать на скидке,то всё ок,но полных денег игра не стоит.Лаганый нет код, лаганные монстры и боссы,вы можете проходить локацию,а у вас в потолке будет крыса застрявшая, босс может залететь в текстуру и стоять там ( Оцейрос),а собаки в ариандель длц бегать по воздуху,но всё бы ничего,только вот кучу багов в пве никак не компенсируются хорошим пвп,потому что оно тоже дерьмовое,преобладают гипер-арморщики,с которыми играть не интересно, никогда не пойдет бить вас первым,а только будет бить вас во время ваших атак,что делает пвп очень унылым и односторонним,а так же довольно мало оружия с уникальным мувсетом,но за то оружие которое с ним огромное спасибо,ведь оно действительно довольно хорошо. И тем,кто тут ради коопа,если у вас плохое железо,то лучше не покупайте,удовольствия не получите, играл с другом,когда проходили  храм глубин и шли к лифту,у него не прогрузились текстуры,я ему говорю тут лифт иди ко мне,а сам стою на плите лифта,он идет,а потом сразу проваливается и умирает,хотя я в том самом месте стоял без любых проблем."
Negative,"This is an absolutely horrible game and entirely a waste of money at any price!  All effort was put into creating the atmosphere, which is quite dark and is the nearest thing this title has to any sort of redeeming value.  Beyond that, it is devoid of any story, any purpose, any direction, etc.  The gameplay is tedious and unrealistic.  Be ready to spam-roll around the same areas repeatedly until through mostly dumb luck you move on to roll around the next area.  Don't expect to feel heroic, unless you think circus clown stupidity can be heroic.If you told me this was an alpha/beta foundation upon which a good game would be built over the coming several years, I would look forward to playing it.  Since it is a finished product with no real playability whatsoever, I got duped and wasted my money.  Why do others like it?  Some people solve cognitive dissonance by denying reality and doubling down on their mistakes.  I'm a realist, however, so I just admit I wasted a good chunk of money on this dreck and had to learn the hard way that Dark Souls is an Emperor with no clothes!"
Negative,The worst netcode FromSoftware has ever shat out.
Negative,TUTORIAL IS TOOOOOOOOOOOO HARD I CANT DO IT
Negative,"Berserk rip-off, which itself is just a cheap Evil Dead 2/Army of Darkness rip-off; which, by extension, makes this just a shallow imitation of Sam Raimi's cult classic horror/action films. TWICE the plagiarism. And on top of it all, the game fucking SUCKS. If I had the power to forever remove one studio from the gaming industry, without a doubt it would be the frauds at FromSoftware. ONE! A ONE out of ten, and that's being generous."
Negative,"Apparently this is supposed to be a good game. For me, I didn't get to experience it at all. 1. The camera angle was TERRIBLE, I couldn't see the boss at all and whenever i rotated to see him, i could barely see anything else. Makes the game very annoying to play. 2. Everyone says the game being hard is the fun part. If it was just hard, I would have no problem. But there are so many glitches with my character and the FPS caps at 60. This doesn't have to do with the difficulty, this is the overall gameplay that is not very enjoyable."
Negative,"Played for 3.5 hours but in reality only actually played a proper hour. Was shadow banned from the game after an hour of play, spent 2 hours trying to link up with a friend without knowing this. I have literally only beaten the first real boss and went a little further,  No idea why I was banned, Support don't know why I was banned, Nobody knows why I was banned.  Thus I cannot play this bloody game."
Negative,"PS4 controllers do not work with this game.Do not buy.""Full control support"". What a joke."
Negative,"Can't believe I was gaslit into thinking this game was even remotely good for so long, fuck this game, Dark Souls 2 is the GOAT, that is all."
Negative,It really lacks in playtime compared to the pricing.
Negative,no keyboard options for menu
Negative,Not very squid game
Negative,where is poise
Negative,"Not much of a PC port.  I'll try to get my money back. if they don't care enough to actually doing a decent job porting to PC, no PC player should pay  for this garbage."
Negative,"I got the platinum of the game, but 2 of the achievements bugged out so It doesn't show it. It's been a long time since I played something as badly and lazy programmed as this game, together with the elitism in the community, my experience with it has been as bad as when I used to play League of legends."
Negative,"Game is kinda good and bad in the same way. The not intended coop could ve been good if it wasnt one sided and only the host gets story progression and loot, so you have to do the same stuff 2 or 3 times over depends on how many people you're playing with. The PvP over invasions is a great thing but due to ultra bad servers 50% of the time the other person is lagging or gets zero damage while punshing you into the face -  -  - . this happens very often. also the controlls are very clumsy. so if you want to game with fake coop and good intended but laggy pvp go for it. (isnt worth more than 20 bucks tho)"
Negative,"This is simply to warn people about the constant crashing. I personally have tried countless times to start the game but it crashes at character creation. Literally can not start the game. Be warned.Edit: After some time, I am now actually in and playing the game. Still inexcusable that there were so many crashes before I could even get to play.Edit2: It's been a few days and I've tried getting back onto the game but with no luck. Crashes as far as the eyes can see."
Negative,can't connect to the servers. don't buy this crap as there is literally no point if online features are disabled. go play ds 1 or ds 2 or elden ring. fix this shit omfg.
Negative,"I am sorry. I have used up all my Dark Souls. I beat the first one, and the idea of playing another one is like a nightmare to me."
Negative,"No key binding prompts for keyboard/mouse.Since I'm 100% new to the series, a lack of proper tutorial (due to the aforementioned issue) is enough to put me off. If the devs are so lazy they cannot introduce such a simple thing in a PC port, I've no reason to believe the game is worth my time, or money."
Negative,"Look elsewhere for a quality pvp experience. Because every invasion you attempt will be 4 children against 1 you, with their analog sticks duck taped forward mashing r1 with their straight swords so hard their liable to break a bumper. also healing isnt punishableroll spam isnt punishablenothing is punishable"
Negative,i'v played this game for 35 hours its lots of fun don't get me like that BUT the Co-Op the invades where all the fun in the game and from the 10 that the game was is now a 6 or 7 you cant even play with friends and that was the reason i bought it to play with friends but i cant even play Co-Op cause a lot of people wanted to hurt others game play with cheat or even get their saves and everything . I think Fromsoft can fix it if they want but Elden Ring makes them spend more time developing it rather helping all those people that played for hours and hours i am not one of those peoples but i will become one and i think Fromsoft can really fix this think i hope Fromsoft sees these reviews everyone posting and dont snob us.
Negative,"I decided to buy dark souls 3 during the winter sale because it looked good, after lots of research and watching reviews of it. I loaded up the game and found that you need a controller to play and even interact with the interface, and I got stuck in the character creation screen multiple times because I had no way to navigate out of it with only my mouse and keyboard. I further inquired, and everybody says it's a pain to play with a keyboard and mouse. Need to fix or at least give more awareness to it being basically exclusively for those with a controller."
Negative,"This is the fifth game in FromSoftware's own lineup of ""soulslikes"" and the third iteration in the Souls saga itself, and yet there have been little to no noticeable improvements to the series' core mechanics. Enemies still get unfair advantage with wall clipping, animation cancelling, and non-animated tracking. The combat seems to be even more streamlined, forcing the player into constant endless rolling in every boss fight. PvP is still buggy and input is still inconsistent. Level design is way too linear and offers little visual variety, making exploration duller. There are some bright spots here and there, but they're not enough to disregard the series' blatant flanderization."
Negative,"I want my money back. I think this game is pure **** (sorry for the language). - You do not get to know where you are supposed to go- Game randomly crashes- Certain enemies are simply 2 powerful to defeat- The game are in lack of often save points- Combat system is just horrible I have not played long enough to discover more negative things about this game, but I think theese things I have told about are more than enough for me knowing I will never buy a Dark Souls-game in the future."
Negative,"Bad framerate studder dual Gtx970 sli 32 GB ram etc.  Got a refund thanks steam, made it to gamestop in time to get Xbone.  Graphics are better on PC but framerate and crashes are non existent on Xbone.  Wait for some patches or get console version for now."
Negative,"So this game is still 60$ there are bugs and glitches aplenty with quest lines let alone, actually realizing what the quest wants you to do and doing it. Want to summon your friend hope you didn't finsh the area your in because if so that shit ain't happening. And if you hold out hope that at least in new game plus you can actually do your side quest, no again they can and will (from personal experience with Greirat) they will not be in the cell and when you reload they well just be ashes. 2/10 at least its not Dark Souls 2"
Negative,"It's a good action-RPG and I would recommend it as such. But it is a bad Souls-game.fromsoftware should go back to the original Souls formula.Dark Souls 2 was the last real Souls game that punished players for trying to blindly speedrun through new areas and highly rewarded players for thinking about how to approach encounters.Dark Souls 3 is a Souls game in name only, as it has barely anything in common with the design philosophy of Demon Souls. It's a fast paced action game with flashy boss fights, but there's so little depth to regular enemy encounters. The exploration, immersion and creative ways of handling the encounters are lacking.They should make another one that focuses more on the RPG aspect, instead of neglecting it in favor of hyperfocusing on flashy boss fights. Give me more slow and careful exploration that rewards smart and creative players, instead of exploration that encourages just running through new areas."
Negative,"The game looks great and feels amazing. It's like fast Dark Souls. The first boss had my heart in my throat, and it's genuinely exciting.Why the negative review then?I attempted to play this game for around an hour after I unpacked the preload. The game crashed three times because Windows ran out of memory - I have 8GB RAM and a 970. Grow up Windows. The game has crashed when I look at bonfires several times, as well as when I travel to the first proper area and when I tried to invade there. It's crashed opening doors, and just fighting random enemies in the beginning area. It's even crashed my entire GPU about four times. Trying it again now, I cannot even start playing - it crashes on the initial loading screen after pressing Continue in the main menu. Other people are having severe FPS issues.This is happening to a not-insignificant portion of people. This port, at least on release, is utterly and completely horrendous, and is plagued by the worst issues I have ever seen. Even the original Dark Souls at least ran for the most part. When these issues are fixed I would well and truly recommend the game to anyone even the slightest bit interested. Right now, however, it's an abhorrently broken mess in absolute shambles. By far the worst PC port I have ever seen."
Negative,Be prepared for broken hit boxes and a plethora of Cheat Engine users.
Negative,I got banned for getting an ember from a friend.
Negative,"1. Parrying/blocking system broken2. Easy to be overwhelmed with enemies, poor spawn pointsA true mark of poor game design when hallways with minions are actually more difficult than the bosses."
Negative,This game has a ridiculous price. It also didn't get a discount in 15 months!
Negative,my friend got banned for using a PS4 controller
Negative,"This game is only hard because the camera and controls are pretty bad. Linear progression through a great looking, empty world leads to repetitive gameplay right off the bat. Obviously this is a widely appreciated game, but hey it just isn't for me.."
Negative,"Great single player game!  The coop and multiplayer functions are poorly designed.  I bet they would sell a million more copies if you could actually play with your friends. The hacked invading players, mixed with a limit number of Embers allows for a lot of manipulation. Like i said really great single player game. Terrible multiplayer, terrible coop play.People want to play games together, moding has led to a resurgence of games. Let us create private servers, let the people have the game, it isnt' even new anymore.Make Dark Souls 3 Online fun again!"
Negative,"do yourself a favor and do not buy this on PC. 1) not ultrawide compatible although the resolution for 3440x1440 was in the settings menu, it had black bars on the side.2) capped at 60 fps3) I use a 1080ti and it ran and looked terrible 4) Assumes you are on an XBOX and not on a PC, as all tips and toasts tell you to push an xbox remote button. I used an xbox one controller, and it barely worked if thats what you want to call it. i asked for a refund after about 2 minutes"
Negative,"Games so hard , cant event start the game to play .     10/10 Best  port ever !"
Negative,Honestly just wish they made Dark Souls 2+2 instead.
Negative,"Broken game, Xbox buttons.  When you attack it aims stupidly.  4 point movement rather than 360.  All aboard the hype train"
Negative,"In Dark Souls, it often wasn't the difficulty of a boss that was frustrating; it was the tedium of a 2 minute walk in order to try again. Punishing a player in that way doesn't test their skill but rather their patience and...AIN'T NOBODY GOT TIME FO' DAT."
Negative,"1. Game is absolutely no rewarding am still with claymore +6 no better weapon.2. Some weapons can be infused or reinforced only, claymore both.3. Game is rewarding me with rubish every time.4. Soul transposition at end game makes no sense5. At 3/4 of game bosses alone become imposible unless you have realy high level.6. No point of factions, multiplayer items limited, but at least learned from DS 2 mistakes.7. After 1/2 the sense of repeating really frustrates you.8. Game is poorer than DS 2 in many aspects.------------------------------------------------*Game is not rewarding, many things are not wise created(lack of imagination and future sense), game is VERY POOR, but central mistakes of DS 2 are corrected at least..."
Negative,"The servers have been down for months. I paid for a game that offered online gameplay. On the steam page, there is information about multiplayer and co-op modes. Console players have active multiplayer. Fraud and discrimination against pc gamers. I will not buy any more games from this release. Embarrassment"
Negative,"im sure its an amazing game.But seriously .. i boot up the game and the tutorials have controller buttons instead of PC. i went to the forums and appearantly the only way to change it , is with mods. Thats the worst thing i have ever seen.I refunded it. i will get myself something that i can actually play"
Negative,"if you like a grinding game when you do the same thing over and over again, this is the game for you.I, on the other hand, I play computer games for fun, not to do chores. That's why I didn't enjoy this game. It is really beautiful and climactic. But there is no story, the controls are clunky, and the whole game is just so much grinding that feels like work not fun. Actually, what I do for living is more fun than this game at this point, because I actually see things accomplished. I don't feel like I am accomplishing anything in this game. Feels like a waste of time."
Negative,why this 2016 game still expenciv
Negative,I've been experiencing some frate rate issues from the past few weeks. And a update has been released recently. Hoping that it makes a huge change in things. Until frame rate issues are dealt with. Do not get this game.
Negative,"In all honesty, Dark Souls 3 is a very good and enjoyable game in it's own right but there are several things about it that just don't sit right with me as a long time fan of the series.The number of things flat-out copied from DS1 with little to no context other than being blatant fan service started off humourous and eventually just got exasperating after a while, the very clear influences taken from Bloodbourne with the heavy emphasis on abusing I-frames for defence and heavily disadvantaging shields/heavy armour in the process, almost every boss having multiple phases like it's an over the top Shonen anime (long gone are the days of things like seeing Sif get wounded and struggle as the battle against him went on, we need cool glowing shit to make the fight harder and provide me with a sense of validation) and the clear shaping of the gameplay to stifle elements of the meta that aided less skilled players in previous entries (the hilariously lowered ammo cap for bows basically kneecapping bow builds, shields being rendered more of a hazard than a benefit by the number of enemies with rapid combos designed to break your block and leave you vulnerable, large numbers of enemies having random lunging attacks to punish you for trying to break off to heal or get a handle on the situation).Still a fine game and certainly enjoyable on it's own merits but I would honestly recommend Dark Souls: Remastered over this."
Negative,"The game itself is really fun, but there have been issues with getting it to load since release. At this point, the game crashes every time I try to open it, and I'm tired of finding solutions to fix it."
Negative,"The game itself is great, but the PC port is crashy as hell. Get it on a console instead."
Negative,Why are controller notations onscreen?Why do many game creators not respect the device they execute on?Bad + bad + bad
Negative,"DONT BUY THIS FOR COOP, You need to farm to be able to buy items to play coop, only to be 1hit 5mins in buy some high level mages spell from a player who has invaded your game and you gotta farm all ova again.All they need to do is add a option to turn off player invasions and make coop easy and free to join."
Negative,Something about this game feels like someone played Dark Souls 1 then tried to remake it by memory but took out everything that made it feel unique or special in the first place. In theory I should like this game but I really don't. I've never felt drawn to play this again after playing through it twice.
Negative,"Before you shout ""git gud"" as loud as you can, calm that autism and read what I have to say.I see it, I see the love that went into this game, I see lots of the great things in it that make it a popular game.I just do not find this game fun, it is torture, not a game.Basically if you learn the patterns and movement of the enemies, its easier to progress.However it is not the RPG I enjoy, I liked the Witcher 2 which is similar and I watched my friends play Demons Souls, I like fantasy style games hence I bought this game because I thought I would enjoy it but I have learned this game is not for people like me whom have little patience and a short fuse. It is rage inducing even if you get lucky and win, you just repeat the process the game is not fun that way to me. One life - dead - GAME OVER - EAT A D!CK. Yeah no thanks.If you have the patience and time to learn the patterns and respawn again, again and again, if you enjoy BDSM or other Masochistic torture, then by all means, ignore this review.If however you are like me and do not want to keep trying to kill the same boss over and over again just to die from falling off a cliff and having to do it again, avoid this game, it is just one big troll.I regret wasting 15£ on this when I could have bought a game that didn't make me want to put my fist through my monitor.My blood pressure is high enough as it is.To reiterate: It is not a BAD game, it is just not FUN."
Negative,this game is for minecraft players anditreallly good dame i maen jgame
Negative,DS1 remaster not wurf
Negative,It's a pretty good game but it isn't Dark Souls 2
Negative,I signed my divorce papers playing this game.... never regret it...
Negative,"The strongest boss in this game is called ""Buy steam controller or suffer endless keyboard disconnects""."
Negative,one of the worst games made
Negative,"don't waist your time on this garbage just get elden ring by then these devs finally knew how to make a game. the combat is clunky, every enemy can hit you from insane ranges with a sword smaller than yours but you miss even when locked on, spear type weapons poke at the ground when you're locked on, and then the game randomly kicks you to the main menu for no reason. I've played better made free to play games older than this one."
Negative,"I had a lot of fun playing this game, but it is far too poorly made to deserve a positive review. The boss battles feel repetetive and stale. The environment feels lifeless and cold (and not because this was the chosen aesthetic). The combat (which is obviously the main part of the game) feels uninspired and limited. The story is... wait a second, there isn't a story. The game has no story. None. All you do is kill things. The game tries to pretend there is a story, but there isn't. It has as much plot as spider solitaire. The only information you will ever learn about the plot is when you google things about the game that don't make any sense because the game never tells you anything. I could go on and on about all the terrible things about the game, but the bottom line is that the game will always have an appeal to a little niche group, myself included."
Negative,"im truely heart broken over this game... after playing and loving dark souls 2 i was very excited to jump into DS3 but its total crap.. its a SUPER CPU hog.. i have never had a lag problem with any game, not fall out 4 on highest graphic settings, not skyrim, or dark souls 2.. but dark souls 3, on the lowest settings and resolution is still laggy as shit. this game was a waste of money and is an even begger waste of time to try and play. 0 stars... the producers of this game dont care at all about their PC players.. if you want to play this game, get it for consol"
Negative,"I finally finished this game, and at the end of it all....I just can't recommend it if you're a casual gamer like me.  The learning curve for a casual player is pretty steep.  the controls aren't intuitive and the in-game tutorial messages are useless, seeing as they're still showing controls for gamepads rather than PC, and there are no clear directions as to what you're supposed to do or where you're to go.  You just figure it out as you go.  This can be good or bad depending on who you are.  I quit the game in disgust after dying for the millionth time against the 3rd or 4th boss, and still didn't feel like I had a good grasp of the game.  Since gaming is a smaller part of my life, I didn't have the same reaction other reviewers had under these circumstances.  I felt no obsession with winning or anger that drove me to boot the game up again.  I just felt frustrated, annoyed, and regret over the purchase, as I had spent so much time on it with no progression.  By this point I was just over the refund time cap, so I couldn't return it, which was just salt in the wound.After a few months I tried again and was successful, but I didn't feel ""exhilerated"" or anywhere near as euphoric as others seem to feel.  I just felt relief that I could finally continue, that an annoying barrier was finally behind me.  From that point, the game grew on me, and by the final boss, I had become pretty good at it.  But I didn't feel fulfilled at the end.This may be because the story isn't really there.  It's buried in item descriptions and vague dialoges with npcs.  You can find out what's going on around you, but the easiest way to do this is to look online for explanations that have been cobbled together overtime.  That's just not something that says ""good story"" to me.  It's vague and ambiguous, which is fine, but as a result, I felt far less connected to the world.  Not once did I care about any character in the game.  To me, it was always just a hack-and-slash.So, that's why, after the final boss was dead, I decided to write this.  If you're a casual gamer, I would advise you to stay away from this one.  Unless you have the extra time to find out all the additional information and play strategies on the internet to learn about every single bit of how this game works, I don't think you'll enjoy yourself very much.That's not to say there aren't good things.  Sometimes the combat can truly be fun.  The graphics are great.  You get some amazing views.  The character builds are very involved and rewarding.  If you aren't turned off by the brutally unforgiving nature of the game, then you may find something to like under the surface.  Otherwise, I would ultimately advise you to save your money.  There are games that are far more enjoyable overall, with better story as well."
Negative,"I played this game a lot and it's still better than most of the other games currently on the market. However, the whole experience really feels hollow when you realize how linear the experience is. What ruined the fun for me specifically is that this game is way too much like Bloodborne. The combat is heavily reliant on dodging and dexterity weapons can stagger most enemies to the point where they can't fight back. It feels less like an RPG and more of an action game. At first, I really liked this game but on repeat playthroughs, the honeymoon ends and I am left wondering why this game got so much universal praise. I feel that part of it is the fact that Dark Souls 2 was so disappointing. If Dark Souls 2 either didn't exist or was a much better game that doesn't continue off of Dark Souls 1's ending, I think people would feel much more differently. I've named a lot of problems with it but my biggest one is that my preferred style of play (blocking with a shield and attack when there's an opening) is no longer viable since enemies can burn down your stamina with really aggressive attacks and many shields don't have 100% physical damage resistance. With this playstyle being obsolete and dodging being much more efficient, there is really only one efficient way to play now, which is mash the dodge button and attack every once in a while. As a result, the whole experience feels like the game wants to be more like Monster Hunter but is stuck being a souls game. I would use the much bigger shields but those types of shields aren't as fun to play with. The whole reason I fell in love with the Souls series is because you can play the game any way you want and it was considered valid and not the other way around. So, in conclusion, I would highly recommend that you either pick up a PS3 for Demon's Souls, get Dark Souls Remastered, or play Sekiro since those are much better options in my opinion."
Negative,Not as fun as dark souls 1
Negative,"This game has more in common with Bloodborne than Dark Souls. I felt like I wasn't playing a sequel to Dark Souls, more like Demon Souls 2 in the way that it adds a mana bar again and the entire movement and feel is different from 1 & 2. I don't really consider this an enjoyable experience for the following reasons.•  Very few reasons to start fighting, I feel as if I spent majority of the game running instead of fighting because unlike Dark Souls 1 & 2, Enemies felt more rewarding to stop and fight due to their drop table but most enemies really give you no incentive to kill them and more incentive to run from them due to the insane damage they deal.•  Most of the enemies in this game are recycled more than any other game. I thought Elden Ring was filled to the brim with recycled enemies but this game takes the absolute cake. You fight the exact same enemies in the first area as you do in the end game area castle. This game has the most re-skinned dog enemies in almost every area of the game.• Linear to a fault, The other souls games had more branching or interconnecting areas. This game just has level to level game design which isn't bad but when you take into account the prior games had much more to offer in-terms of replay value due to how much you could do in the beginning as opposed to play out the level the exact same way everyone else does. • Abysmal loot and every other chest is a mimic. I've never seen so many mimics in a souls game till this one. The amount of times I look at the chest and the chain is straight instead of curved, I swear my eyes were rolling so much they were gonna get stuck that way. The loot is absolute garbage, I felt like I was picking up household appliances than actual items worth anything.• No fun locations, Everything feels like a slog. The first three areas are a castle, a swamp and a forest. It's like if you took all the worst areas from Dark Souls 1 & 2 and made a game about them.If I gave Dark Souls 2 a 5/10, This one is a solid 4/10 game."
Negative,"infuriating game with incredible graphic design.there is no instruction or sense of progression, checkpoints are far apart, and bosses are prohibitively difficult.I get that ""oh the challenge is the point"" but come on, i don't have 500 hours to dump into a game as a full-grown adult. I already suck at my job and at life, i dont need another angle of failure."
Negative,"Upon starting this game, its awesome. It looks cool asf, everything feels cool, and you just feel like a badass. Its noticibly hard, but its not that bad! It starts to get a bit hard, whatever, its dark souls duh. You beat the first boss easily, and start playing more. It gets harder and harder, but your a gamer its DARK SOULS III ITS A HARD GAME AND YOU KNOW THIS. You stay motivated, and then end up having to fight the abyss watchers. And then you feel pain. You finally understand what everyone talks about. This boss sucks so much. It took me personally over 10 hours to beat, none of which was fun. You finally beat it, and it does admittidly feel good. You beat a couple more bosses afterward, but it only gets harder, and its not getting fun anymore. The game ends up being something that makes you mad, and when you dont have fun playing a video game, maybe you shouldnt play the game. This game sucks ass"
Negative,"no widescreen. Bravo, such a hyped game loads showing nothing about keyboard but still it can be used and no widescreen. Bravo.Edit after 15 hours:Still bad game.  They dont care about pc gamers yet they sell this thing expensive. Its a hard-mode game. Not a game with high skill-cap or something like that, this game is literally god of war in hardest mode. I prefer that, i play cod in hardest, i prefer to be pushed to use tactics other than going ""doom like"" and this game is a moderate game with moderate story and gameplay. But the price and the hype pushes this to bad. Look, these games have to be fun such as doom, GoW or even like Codmw3, they have the hit feeling, they have you connect to the character. When you make it hard, you feel it, i love it. But DS3 is only being about an ad about difficulty. No feeling. You see this well when you hear the same knife slash whether you kill with your sword or a flameball. Nice kill effect morons. Souless game, as name suggests. Classic 0.2x damage out, 5x damage in hardness level. When other games make this they be lazy. This game is literally depends on that and its called AAA game."
Negative,I'm trying to get back into this game but I'm struggling. Hard. Whilst the game is great and very challenging its become to riddled with griefers. I can't even get through the first world without being invaded every single time. How are you supposed to encourage new players if it's the community making it un-enjoyable?
Negative,"I didn't enjoy the game. No quest journals, no directions or reasons for me to do what I'm doing, etc etc. unnecessarily hard without any lower difficulty. Supposed to be an RPG, but I see neither no roleplaying nor story. Basically whenever I played I couldn't last 20 minutes without getting bored. Just not the game for me I suppose."
Negative,they made the servers in the first place
Negative,Game is good up until you face your first multi enemy boss and then the game is no longer fun.
Negative,this game fucking sucks lmao
Negative,it's so hard :<
Negative,too dark -1/10Update for Steam Game Awards:still too dark -2/10
Negative,"Steam releases a horrible computer port. I know you guys want money, but if you want to make a console game for pc then change it (especially for that absurd price tag). The menus are a mess if you even want to bother trying to rebind the keys.Tried using the steam controller but without a second joystick (which will forever bother me), there isn't much enjoyment found in this title."
Negative,"I played almost every souls gameThis one made me want to kill myself the mostNot because it's hardBecause it felt the least like a dark souls gameEditors note: Also the easiest of the souls games, and i beat it before they added poise"
Negative,"I dont know what to do anymore. This game is so good and i would really like to play it. But this game is shit as it is now. Not to mention the absolutely cancerous PC-Port where i have to translate what the game could possibly mean by: ""Press X, A, Y, RB, RT"" on the PC... but no, it is also crashing every 5 minutes. Sometimes I cant even reach the first boss.Things that i read on websites for help to prevent the crashes:-set lightning options to ""low"" (didnt work)-play wihtout a shield (didnt work)-set reflections quality to ""low"" (didnt work)-play as the ""knight"" (didnt work)I can barely kill 3-4 of those reapers after the first bonfire until a ""Dark Souls 3 doesnt work anymore"" pops right into my face. Devs nowadays release such unpolished, buggy crap games that its not funny anymore. I wish i could, but I do highly NOT recommend this game currently. Wait for patches OR buy it on a console.(Edit 1 day later: Did i just say wait for patches? Guess i didnt realize that the game came out in april when i wrote that and we have reached the end of friggin august soon, so dont expect too much -_- If the patch v1.07, which is supposed to come out on the 25th of august, fixes the crashes so that i can at least play the game a little bit, i eventually let my thumb change its direction. otherwise this game is dead to me)"
Negative,"I bought an online game, as I played both DS1 and DS2 with their online components.But DS3 servers are dead for months and the developers don't give a damn about their ""older"" gamesThis game does not deserve a positive review"
Negative,"The curse of the ""Third Game""...TLDR: My playtime:Dark Souls 1: 250 hrsDark Souls 2: 230 hrsDark Souls 3: 67 hrs"
Negative,"The PC controls are joke, its basically unpleyable without a controller, its unoptimised, i have low fps on good pc, and its a joke with good graphic. I do not recommend to destroy your day with this piece of sh*t game"
Negative,YOUR FUCKING KIDDING I HAV TO BUY TH GAME AGAIN IF I ACCIDNTLY HIDE IT FROM MY LIBRARYWHAT TH FUCK
Negative,this game makes me want to kill myself
Negative,"dogshit game, i hope i never have to play this game agina stinky poop oope ghame. maybed insteaf dof kiklling emiemes you shjojd lkill yourskegfl"
Negative,why is the sensitivity high as fuck? i changed it 0 and it is still fast. if you are low sens player you will never able to play this game. also it only shows tips for controller. it doesnt care if you are using keyboard.
Negative,"Total horseshit. The beginning is not meant for early players at all. You only have 3 estus flasks, and everything two or three shots you.""Oh just get good"", I hear all your Soulsborne fanboys screaming. How am I supposed to learn to get good when I can't even see my character because the enemies move around so jankily and the lock-on just turns off most the time?""Try a different build"" Ok but that's still shitty design, any game where playing one specific playstyle helps you win more than any other effectively removes all agency from the player, as they have to have a perfect knowledge of the games combat to do any amount of anything with the build they actually want, or they have to use a build and a weapon that they dislike jsut to beat a boss.""This game doesn't hold your hand and tell you where you're supposed to go!"" Yes, and that is a problem. I understand the want to have a game that doesn't hold your hand. It's one thing entirely, however, to have your game go from 'here is how you fight, dodge, and run :D' to 'okay now explore this tower wall with a giant dragon with fire breath and every enemy can stunlock you and kill you in two hits and good luck figuring out what the FUCK you're supposed to do to progress because we won't tell you SHIT.' THAT is not the definition of 'not holding the players hand', that is the definition of shitty game design and world design.TL;DR: This game sucks. Wholly and truly. Anyone who likes this game is either some kind of gaming God, or (more likely) they came from older Soulsbourne games and are already throat deep on Fromsoft's dick."
Negative,"honestly one of the worst experiences in gaming dont waste your time or effort. over rated over hype garbage. Broken games are not hard, broken games are bad and bad gameplay is also bad. there is no reward here only the feeling of false accomplishment."
Negative,"If Fromsoft wanted to make Bloodborne 2 then they just should have done so. It's a great game. This unfortunately is not. Don't give me so many build options then gimp most of them. And don't pretend a game is polished when enemies can still swing through walls, shields are wildly inconsistent, and certain boss fights are tedious for ten minutes up until the moment you get 1-shotted by some gimmicky attack you could never see coming."
Negative,"While I absolutely love the rest of the series, Dark Souls 3 feels like ""A Best Ofs"" Album. And much like those albums, it brings very little new to the table, and merely rests on the laurels of earlier works. The amount of reused areas, enemies, and even bosses from earlier games is truly astonishing. If I hadnt played through it myself, I dont think I would believe people.Its derivative to say the least. And while some people may not mind this, I do. My love for the other games was in due part to how fresh and new they felt to a stagnant genre. This game just feels like a lazy sequel, and the developers have lost sight of what people loved about the originals. It feels like they just keep trying to recapture that magic without realizing that the magic was because it was something different. Instead, in this game we get to fight the same bosses, and the same areas.If you play these games solely for their gameplay mechanics, it really depends on taste and playstyle. I am severly disapointed with how badly they botched pose. That being said, weapon arts generally work well, but the breadth of playstyles feels much more limited than previous installments, especially Dark Souls 2.If you're a die hard fan of the series like me, you'll play it anyway. But if you're new to the series, or not super into it, I really would recommend exhausting any other game in the series first."
Negative,"Fun game, too many crashes."
Negative,All the negative reviews are just from people who keep dying
Negative,"game sucks, yet another waste of money, fuck you steam"
Negative,game is hard
Negative,This game is not ready for PC's players I bought it and the key binds are only for showed for console even when I play on a PC so I need to buy a controller to play this game that really the biggest issue why would it say that its for PC players as well makes not sense to mat least.
Negative,">> Worst community on Steam or maybe in the whole game community.>> Disapointing if you played DS1.>> Missing features that obviously were suppose to be in the game.>> Mechanics don't match the rest of the game design.>> Buggy and glitched.>> Same camera issues introduced on DS2.>> Bad port and User Interface.>> Bad covenant design.>> Small, but bad fan-service.>> Don't have enough characters to explain everything, so will keep it short.I really should not have bought this game and should be expecting what I got after playing DS2 and experienced how it was worse than DS1. I did played DS2 and thought it was awesome, but after playing DS1 and discovered it is nothing as good as it I changed my opinion.The gamer community should not be evangelist with any game and expect better games than the previous entries. If you are really interessed on the franchise, just get DS1 and, if you have a PS4, Bloodborne.Update: Just played DLC. It suck too."
Negative,"Wow, I am amazed ... this game is not for PC, but for consoles .... all the controls are explained using controller buttons, which I have NO idea about, considering I have always played on a keyboard.No, I am not going to buy a controller.I had to Alt+tab out to even close the game, having no idea how to get the main menu up again.Epic fail."
Negative,"Was talked into buying this terribly difficult game, not worth even playing for free. That is unless u like dying every 3 minutes, constantly having to start over, and never getting anywhere... even in co-op! The game allows completely random people to invade your game and easily kill you and your friends. F*&%ing joke of a game... DO NOT BUY!!!"
Negative,"No ultrawide support, as a 21:9 monitor user i find it annoying to edit the game's inner workings just to play on my native aspect ratio (this means risking a ban, since i don't care about online it's not a problem for me though). Also, there's almost no consideration for mouse and keyboard users, all the icons are controller icons. The developers should be ashamed for not putting keyboard icons and 21:9 aspect ratio support in a game that came out in 2016."
Negative,Near impossible to play with keyboard cause the devs are too lazy to update the UI. Plus the game crashes constantly.
Negative,"****I have mixed feelings about the game but I'm recomending against it just because of how the game would be for the underdeveloped Dark Souls players*****The game is ok up untill you enter the DLC and notice that everyone who's ""good at pvp"" uses a dark lothric knight sword every invasion. The meta game ends up being less variety than the base game origionally was and more of who has the simple move set down to a math. 500+ hours of game play for me was just trying out new builds and challenges and when progress is haulted because a straight sword outclasses most weapons and spells/pyromancies/miracles(all of which are severely crippled compared to earlier games) my experience went from exciting pvp interactions straight to avoid the cheese factory. If you're interested in Dark Souls and you're on the outside looking in, don't let this one be your first experience."
Negative,"The level design out-does most games while you wont find a story unless you look through hours of lore videos on youtube. The combat is the highlight of the game and while it's got some RPG elements unique to the series. I feel like this game will entice you to play for a long time but in the end you will not have fun with it because you expected something. If you buy it, look at how to properly walk through the game without missing everything considering you could be missing multiple bosses by just walking by.Tl;dr I personally like the game, but I could not recommend it to anyone I know because of how unfriendly and misguiding most of it is. Update:FromSoftware has acknowledged an issue with the game where any other player you connect to can run software on your computer without your permission. So they can wipe your hard drive, Elden Ring should be boycott until they fix this"
Negative,who would pay 60 dollars for this game oh my god i hate dark souls so much no i do not recommend it do not ever play it if you own this game delete it right now it sucks i hate it
Negative,Too many hackers for a boring multiplayer game. Decent storyline
Negative,"6/10 its average, get Dark souls prepare to die edition (First game) or get Dark souls 2 scholar of the first sin, Much better base game, also much better DLC."
Negative,its hard and long lool
Negative,Shit game with broken controls tells you to jump but will only let you roll backwards shit port
Negative,"If you enjoy this type of games, skip this one. Sekiro and earlier installations of this series are much better.If you have a life and/or don't want to spend 100+ hours on a game, skip games from FromSoftware; they are simply not for you."
Negative,"Since  just play solo or  complete the story whit ur friend. PvP sucks   u have like 2 or 3 atack delai every single invade/pvp 1x1 . no i dont have a bad conection, and yes  game  frames  and hit box sucks"
Negative,Overrated as hell. Terrible control schemes and combat. Seriously don't understand how people enjoy these games so much.
Negative,Copied Elden Ring
Negative,This game is Ass
Negative,unplayable with Moouse and keyboard.  fuck outta here.  lazy devs.
Negative,"The game is too easy, you start over geared, parries are over powered, enemies do not track their hits, spell casting builds suck, rolling costs stamina but you can roll if you have .001 stamina and you are immune to all damage regardless of roll direction. PvP has never worked, thank God they disabled it"
Negative,"Not as good as Dark Souls 1 and 2. It lacks a feel of its own. The levels are very linear and this makes the game feel less like an explorable world and more like a collection of different areas, even more so than DS2.Some of the bosses are the best in the series but they become more boring towards the end of the game. The player character feels the same speed as in the previous DS games (although you can roll a lot more), but the enemies all operate at Bloodborne speed. Overall not a bad game, actually a good one, but the least good in the series,"
Negative,"Another negative review for the game.Reasons : Fps drops, crashes when i reach the first bonfire and there is no hit detection for me in the tutorial, i cant damage the enemies and they damage me, only killed about 2-3 enemies when i swung my sword against the ground 5 feet away from them. Il rewrite this review once fromsoft fix their shitty game"
Negative,"I don't like it, not because it's hard. I don't like it because it's just not fun.It's plays & feels like The Witcher 3 but without the story or graphics. It's not a terrible game, just not a good one. Do yourself a favor & get The Witcher 3 & play it on Death March difficulty instead. You'll have the same difficulty & experience but with a hugely engrossing story. DS3 is just running around killing stuff.Super boring without any motivation behind the character.And for people saying, ""YoU dIdNt PlAy ThE wHoLe GaMe"" or ""YoU dIdNt PlAy 1 & 2"". I shouldn't have to play another game to understand the story of a a $60 ""premium AAA"" title"". Period. Even if it means adding a 1-2 minute intro cut scene that explains everything. Just running around aimlessly killing stuff ""until you figure out the story"" isn't fun to me.Also the forced PvP means this game deserves a negative review for that reason alone."
Negative,"i died, game bad"
Negative,"With such a terrible port to pc, don't waste your time or money. It is so frustrating to be unable to navigate the game. The only reason it was made available to pc was greed by the devs and publisher. SICK."
Negative,"No part of this game is fun.  Slow clunky combat, horrible lack of learning curve, and no support for ultrawide in 2020? Find something better to play."
Negative,not player friendly
Negative,Uses unfairness as a difficulty supplement
Negative,"if you are going to ruin a good game by cramming FORCED pvp down my throat, than make sure the fucking shit actually WORKS you fucking cunts."
Negative,"The opening cinematic is laughably overwrought and cryptic. It didn't do anything for my immersion. There seems to be no tutorial and on-screen key suggestions are apparently for a controller, not a keyboard and mouse. My first impression it that it seems like a zero-effort port to the PC that requires a console controller. Also, I could never log into the online server. Seems like a buggy, alpha-quality game."
Negative,"PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE BUYING!!!I LOVE this game. I am a gamer who wants a challenge, and this provided a challenge like no other i have ever come across in a game. It offers pretty awesome graphics, gameplay (that at the moments where it seems repetitive, you meet a new enemy that tests your skill and patience) and an awesome array of weapons and classes that make you play like you want to. All in all, an amazing game that is well worth the money, and i got it on sale for $45.00, which made it even better.BUT, I am not here to talk about the amazing greatness this game offers. There are plenty of reviews that give great discriptions of this piece of work. I am here to WARN YOU, DO NOT TO BUY THIS GAME!!! Why? Because there is a bug that ruins the whole game!There are checkpoints called Bonefires throughout the game that you get to and save your progress. THIS BUG CRASHES THE GAME AS YOU APPROACH THEM! So not only is this game hard, but when you FINALLY get through that super hard boss on the 69th (lol) time, THE BONEFIRE CRASHES YOUR GAME. Now, somehow, I was able to get through 23 hours of gameplay before the Boss Bug started doing its dirty work as the most dangerous boss in the whole Dark Soul Series to date. As you can tell, a lot of people dont have trouble on these reviews. As I have done my research and I have dug for a solution, none have proved to work, and I have seem many forums full of disappointed players whose game has been screwed over, MOST of which have not even been able to make it past the first bonefire. I was lucky. Well, kinda, now i want the game to be fixed so badly now that I have had my 23 hour taste of it. AND, the funny part, the devs of this game apparently knew of this crashing problem before release, but did not want to delay the release due to this bug. Just a little (alot) disappointing. But, of course, if they fix this, I will be over joyed and will change this review as soon as I pull myself away from this game (if I can).SO, if you are seriously interested in this game, you may want to do some research into your graphics card to see if it will run the game without crashing. This is a huge warning, BE CAREFUL BUYING THIS GAME!!!P.S. If I could get my money back for this game or get it fixed, I would want it fixed. But, if the game is not going to get fixed, then im wasting my time and I want my money back, if that is even possible."
Negative,"I'm afraid that after a week of playing this game constantly.... I have to say it's the worst in the entire series. Not only does it add in pointless item limits for the sake of appealing to the Bloodborne fanbase, and have wildly imbalanced PVE mechanics, but its PVP also suffers from a lack of balance as well. To all fans of the Dark Souls series, I have to say ""Just go play Dark Souls"". This game features Bloodborne style enemies fighting a slower-than-molasses Dark Souls character, meaning that while enemies zip about like they're on nitrous oxide and combo you into oblivion with megadamage attacks, you struggle to roll in and out of the instant-death-radius....Also the boss designs are generally pretty lame and get recycled once or twice."
Negative,"This should not be put on steam as a PC game.  game stucks in settings, all the buttons are still Xbox icons, labels, then I realize this is just a PC remastered version of the Xbox dark soul3 , which is not really compatible to my PC.I'm willing to change my review if anyone helps me resolve this issue"
Negative,"It is near unplayable with keyboard/mouse as all the messages use the console controls, meaning you are forced to use a controller if you want to play this game.This game does not play by its own rules and in a game as unforgiving as this that is a deal breaker, as a example a enemy with a huge weapon swings at you in a narrow tunnel it is clip past the walls and potentially hit you while if the player does the same it will impact the wall leaving you vulnerable and the attack will missThe lack of communication with the player is also a major downside, many times i found myself saying ""how was i suppose to know that!?"" like the existence of two whole areas, 3 bosses and a method to a ending"
Negative,"The worst game that has ever existed, I cannot stress more how much of a fraud this game is. First, the ""story"" hahaha is dramatic as hell every thing is all doom and gloom and puhhhhssy ass whinging all the time. Boo hoo this and boo hoo that and this gay ass boss and oh youre gonna be invaded by a puhhhhssy boi and oh were gonna talk shet like the Japanese lil dix that we are and oh we cant make shet for nothing and were just a bunch of lil dix loser Japanese puhhhhhssy bois. This game should get removed from every shelf, they should be forced to give back any penny they ever made on this f disgrace to humanity, and they should be thrown in jail for 10 years to think about how bum their f lives are and how small their lil dix are."
Negative,terrible PC port
Negative,Really good game but gets stuck at a black screen whenever I quit the game and hardlocks my computer lmao
Negative,"Waste of time, and not in a good way. The kind of game you force yourself to play because its built well. Not because its fun. Made it to Lothric and Lorian. Over it.Edit: Trying to give it a second go around it's still clunky and painful. The delay in actions is awful. The forced shared buttons makes me gag. I hate this game because I just want to explore and see the world but everything is just about wasting the players time. Point is that everyone like to overlook some serious bullshit just because they enjoy other aspects more. That's how every game works. What will I give up for something I can't find elsewhere? Beautiful deep world building that you have to BEAT YOUR HEAD INTO A ROCK TO ENJOY. Dope ass enemies  and weapons but the absolute god damn worst button layout I have played with in 30 years on this planet.  Fuck this game. I'll edit again when I throw in the towel for the final time.Edit 2: Finally beat this god damn game. Honestly, the difficulty of the game is nothing special, I spent at least 30 of my 47 play hours just running around lost. Every fanboy is overlooking some seriously awful and clunky mechanics that they have gotten way used too over more than 6 months of previously said HEAD INTO ROCK beating play.130 hours and NOTHING feels smooth. I don't need an easy mode but I need some GOD DAMN consistency when it comes to game mechanics. Terrible. Putting up this ""veil of mystery"" around your world to make it more difficult is the absolute most boring way to make a game ""hard"". I never felt like i had to ""git gud"" or learn anything substantial - just kill that next guy and go up those stairs/ladder/lift.Bosses were a frustrating combo of getting some ridiculous bull-shit hits with no visible hit box, instant death, general AI stupidity and followed by another run back to the boss arena that's as long as brunch with your in-laws for every small mistake. When you beat a boss you just want to light the bonfire and never come back to this area, screw what you missed.I really DO NOT recommend this game for everyone. What killed it for me personally? The constant run backs, complete lack of a map/compass or really ANYTHING to help you find your way in AN ENTIRE GOD DAMN WORLD, bullshit control scheme, and the unavailability of the world (especially from an explorers view) just made me fight to not uninstall the game constantly.I will say that it felt great to be a high level and go back to early areas and DELETE the mobs that got some bullshit kills on you early game. But if hitting a rat with a 90% boosted Soul Stream DIDN'T feel good then the game wouldn't be so popular still. I REALLY enjoy watching people play this game and my favorite streamer does Soulsbourne No-Hit content (shoutout to my boy dinossindgeil who just got THE GOD RUN). But if you are like me and get frustrated when your lost for 2/3 of your playthrough and spend the other 1/3 running back to boss fights then save yourself some cash."
Negative,"The highs in DS3 are very high, but the game is held back by a swarm of flat out objectively bad game design choices."
Negative,What have they done to my baby???!!!!???!
Negative,@uncharter He forced me to buy it
Negative,"This just seems like a very sloppy port.  The UI, the settings, everything feels like it just came off the console with a bare minimum of work put in.  The shape of the game is still there and it is playable but I think one would be better served to play this on a console instead."
Negative,its dark souls. so dont play it. you scrub.
Negative,Why big dude smash fast
Negative,Waited for half a hour looking at a black screen before it crashed. Don't buy it right now unless you want to be disappointed. I'll change my review if there is ever a fix.
Negative,"DS2 - the best oneER - alright but has flawsDS1 - dated, better as a proof of conseptDS3 - actualy dogshitgameplay: gone is the metroidvania like exploration and the need to explore to progress, the game is just leniar, there is one path you may go down, every playthrough is the same, its just a question of how you murder the enemies, powerstances are gone meaning theres no reason to dual wield weapons.audio: the game has horrable audio balancing, if you keep the audio so you can hear the enemies and the envoirment well, then every dragon and random goop enemy will blow your eardrums out, so you either play with the game audio in a way where these enemies deafen you or you lower the game's volium down untill you basicaly dont have audio onvisuals - EVERYTHING IS JUST GRAY, also its hard to see importent things in the envoirment because of that coz it all melts in to gray sluge in the brain, god help you if you try to find a resqued npc in firelink, they will melt in to the envoirment and you will not find themother notes - pretend ds2 didnt happen, not only are things from ds1 back, the lore established by 2 is completely ignored, the 'the time line is convoluted' is a terrable excuse to reuse old charicters and imagery, the lore of ds2 establishes that the cicle of fire and ash has been happening for so long that entire civilesations can rise and fall and get forgotten so thourghly that no one knows they existed, yet despite that, in ds3 which takes place so far in the future, inexplicably has black knights and anorlondo back. the lore is a mess held together by excuses. also the imput buffering/detection is worse then before, you will kick and roll despite not wanting to, why even bring the kick back, that feature fucking sucked.i really tried to understand why people like this game but this game is just awful.also the steam game cover for this game is just laughaly bad, generic souls knight in THE PISS DIMENTION, like, did they not have anything better to use?, the cover art for ds2 is somehow a better cover for 3 because its gray af, it is reflective of what the game is like, a bad cover for a bad game"
Negative,I originally beat this game without frame rate drops when Dark Souls 3 first came out.  Now huge frame rate drops to the point in crashes. whatever you (development team) did great job.  You turned a great game into a shit game.
Negative,"Should be renamed to ""Crash To Desktop Simulator 2016"""
Negative,Most DogShit game I have ever played. I forgot how bad the ganking AI are which have the speed of Gwyn and the damage of a smelter demon on NG+8. All the bosses have goddamn light speed. Game is fucking filled with artificial difficulty because the developers forgot how to make a hard game without it.
Negative,"Some of the worst auto targeting known to man kind. People believe this to be positive as it increases the 'difficulty', which wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't so blatant. As well as this, expect to be hit whilst behind trees, walls, and other objects in this pathetic excuse of a 'difficult' game. THE most glaring issue with this game and the Souls series in general is the action buffer (made much worse with this entry to the series). You could press 'Rb' three times rapidly and will in turn be forced to watch your character slog away until the buffer is empty. The fact that the buffer is so large in this game shows the level the devs are willing to go to in an effort to inflate the already masked 'difficulty'.With the release of every game people have complained about this issue and yet no attempt to solve this has been made on behalf of the devs. Stupid and obnoxious features != difficultyMediocre game with abhorrent and repulsive features that will ruin any fun to be had."
Negative,"Poop pc ports.This game is surely not on an emulator or such however even you use Keyboard and mouse instead xb controller, every keymaps in mid-game (not in keybinding option) show game pad button not KB and mouse.Seriously show some effort at PC porting FROM when you decided to release something for PCs."
Negative,I couldn't wait to play Dark Souls III based on all of the recommendations I'd heard. But I was very disappointed in the game. The combat is not hard - it's clunky. The RPG elements are too strange and deep for me - I was expecting more of a Japanese-style 3d action adventure. The game feels bland and dull. It couldn't keep my attention.
Negative,"Update: Quality game if you play with the Cinders mod. Vanilla is still boring as hell!!!It's not a bad game it's just DISAPPOINTING!!!Having played and 100% all Souls games and Bloodborne (minus SotFS) prior to this I guess I hyped it a bit too much. The main issue is the lack the difficulty compared to the previous games. A SL1 run or using a bad weapon was the only way to add some difficulty for me! The 1st DLC was pretty lacklusted as well. 2nd one was decent and had 2 good bosses!I found the bosses to be a bit unmemorable. Only the final boss in the 2nd DLC really engaged me!Then again it's a great place for newcomers to try the Dark Souls series without the normal ""Souls"" difficulty!!!"
Negative,"I am not gud at games and I haven't made it past the tutorial level in this one.This game looks great and I want to like it because the franchise is so popular. I actually bought this title on sale during the hype for the release of Elden Ring because I wanted to finally see what was up. I knew being difficult was the Dark Souls thing so I was ready for that, I thought.Dark Souls 3 I can't recommend unless you're a sucker for punishment because a big part of the difficulty of DS3 are it's poorly designed button layout, which you can't customize, and the camera. Both of these work against you as you try to play the game making it frustratingly difficult in a completely unsatisfying way.So, if you're a casual who's been living under a rock and only now wondering if they should get into this, unless you like the idea of the UI being another boss to defeat, steer clear.But what do I know?"
Negative,5 years game never oıptimize with playing mouse and keyboard. Game good Control systems sucks
Negative,Game is actually really mid
Negative,too hard even if you're a good player
Negative,ds2 was better
Negative,"Just like the other fromsoftware games, it’s just not fun."
Negative,its a good game but you cant finish it without the wiki because the game doesnt give you the slightest fucking hint on what you could possibly do so without the wiki its just running around doing nothing for HOURS until you finally find the tiny passage way that leads you to the next area where you can walk around again..
Negative,"The most difficult and super hard game for only for gamers returns with dark souls 3, the latest and hottest action rpg by japanese game developer from soft ware. The game takes place shortly after the events of dark souls 2 when all of the stupid fans of that bad game fart at the same time which leads to the end of the world.Dark souls 3 is like the game you have already played, from the rolling and hitting action that blows my pants away, to the locations and characters and armour and music and.What sets dark souls  3 apart from the previous games is its price. This one is more expensive than the other two, and the additional money you pay goes towards miyazaki's heart medicine. rumour has it he has only a month to live unless one more person buys his game.Dark souls 3 also features a character called the fire keeper. The fire keeper is a woman who has no eyes, and she gives me levels. She also gives me terrible thoughts. I cant go to the shrine and see her without imagining my character giving her head trauma with the nearest rock. She wouldnt even see it coming. Stood motionless in the shrine, alone. Suddenly i give her the peoples elbow out of nowhere, and kick her in the ribs.Unfortunately, the  game does not contain industry standard features like a weekly content update, or a cool battle pass with epic loot. I played for 60 hours before stopping right at the graveyard level with the evil knight. I didnt even get one tier on the battle pass by then so i stopped playing.overall , dark souls 3 is like the other games, but not like 2 because that sucks. Despite the high number of beers and babes, the game is held back by its oriental game design and only appeals to morons and babies who cant even play a hard game like i can.1/5 Pros:- nothingCons:- everything"
Negative,Absolutely dog shit of a game..Gotta be downbad idiotic to play crap like soul gamessekiro its 1000% a better gamedont bother with this crap
Negative,the only fucking game in existence without cloud saves XDD fromsoftware please unistall your company k thx bai
Negative,game sucks lol
Negative,dank but easiest of the souls games
Negative,"I was told to buy this... played for 30 minutes,  absolute waste of time. Everything is dated"
Negative,"This PC port is just straight garbage. Controls are janky, the camera is unreliable, and the graphics look like crap. They didn't even bother changing the console button icons! So don't even expect button prompts to be something you can understand.Don't buy this game on PC. Don't support this lazy, zero-effort disaster of a port."
Negative,Ok game is very very good but i would only recomend it on console where u are safe from hackers ive had my game reset on me twice now throwing me into new game++ hours wasted cuz of some sad manchild who's idea of fun is ruining everyones day. From/Bandai sort you shite out please please please.
Negative,"Refunded this game not because it is too hard, but because it is extremely frustrating to go through a tutorial that only shows you how to play with a controller. I can't learn the game properly if I have to check every few minutes or seconds what key I am supposed to press. Just a heads up for people like me who wish to play with kb&m and do not own a controller."
Negative,"PvP just isn't fun with the lag in movement to hit. Sorry, I love Dark Souls, I like a good fight, but this isn't it."
Negative,"Runs horrible, I have to play in 720 p for it to even work in online play.."
Negative,"Dark Souls III destroyed my passion for the series.(Very shot not much about the lore and so god damn easy)(but i have to say the ""2cd""ending is pretty good.I was expecting more of that)"
Negative,"More Frustrating than fun for me. Ty, no Ty."
Negative,"I never thought that the game's toughest, most frustrating enemy would be the save points that cause your game to crash."
Negative,"The keybinding on the controller is just so different from any games that I played.There is supposed to be an auto lock mode for controller, which is ticked on by default, but doesn't seems to work.I've better aiming with keyboard and mouse, but can't find the equivalent for heavy blow.Also can't find the page to change the keybinding, the esc menu needs to be redesigned."
Negative,DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!!!!!! TOO SCARY AND MEAN. I COULD NOT GET PASSED THE FIRST LEVEL BECUS IT WAS TOO HARD!!!!!! THERE IS NO FIRST PERSON AND NOT GUNS EITHER LIKE WTF ARE WE IN 1812????????????? Anyway don't play this game. Too hard and super stupid. Rubbish and waste of time
Negative,"It's bloodborne enemies vs demon's souls character.Not for me, too much fan service and enemy attack spam. I managed to platinum on PS4 but it's honestly my least favourite of the series. Soundtrack is excellent though."
Negative,"you need a controler its alot harder with a keyboard and mouse.but then again ports allways have issus with this game its controlls there just conplete crap ti where its not really playabul,i say get the witcher 3 if you haven its a much better game!"
Negative,"After 11 hours of game time and probably 30 hours on youtube, watching ""how to"" and other fellers with experience I realized this game is just not a PC user like me. Horrendous camera spanning for no reason at random moments, disastrous shake during simple walk. I literally had to stop after each hour or so to take a brake because I felt motion sick. Controls are made for console so even if you get hints as a pc player they are useless because they describe console buttons. When I finally understood how to parry and how to back stab I noticed the ""camera focus"" feature is randomly deselecting the target and that leads to the character not facing the boss and yea ... the block will be sideways and the character gets killed ... Other then bugs and glitches the boss fights are very interesting and well done. Jump scares are everywhere and very annoying semi elites are everywhere. The design of the landscape is asking you to try the gravity (it will kill you) and mostly for me it's more of an annoying experience then a challenging one... even getting to a boss involves dealing with serious mobs that will make me use the limited potions and be left with close to nothing for the boss encounter. I'm glad other people find this game attractive, but surely not for me."
Negative,"First up let me say that in summary I feel pretty neutral about the game, but since Steam doesn't do ""neutral"" and I don't want to join the fanboy choir, I settled on a negative review.I'm a latecomer to the series, wanted to know what it's all about and got ""Dark Souls 3"" plus season pass on a Steam sale (PC platform). It's my first Souls game and it'll also be my last. I'm saying this after finishing the game and its DLCs, and beating all Bosses solo except for Friede and Demon Prince, where I used one NPC summon, and Midir which I eventually gave up on. I'm merely writing this to emphasize that I do know what I'm talking about.Let's address the positives first. The art design of this game is nothing short of phenomenal; I seriously doubt a lot of people would even get involved in this game if it didn't have such a strong artistic vision and presentation. A world of ruins standing on impossibly steep mountains, castles in various stages of decay, inhabited by monstrosities large and small, all cast in a sickly light; I'm a sucker for this kind of thing, and I've never seen it done better than here. Another positive thing is the engine stability: in all of the roughly 150 hours I played this game it didn't crash on me once, which is quite impressive (and extremely important for a hard game like this).When we get to the gameplay, though, that's where the problems abound. You can actually reduce almost the entire game to the concept ""fear of the unknown"". Is there a bonfire or certain death around the next corner? Is this monster I've never seen before as formidable as it looks or will it go down in two or three swings? How many attacks of this monster do I have to dodge until I can retaliate? How does this boss behave during the various phases of the fight? Unknown, all of it. The only way to find out is to proceed -- and get cut down for it, through no real fault on your part, again and again and again: ""you died"". Which in itself wouldn't be particularily problematic if the game actually gave you a fair chance to learn, but unfortunately the game's idea of a ""fair chance"" is to make you go through all the motions leading up to your demise again and again and again, just so you can try another strategy, fail at that too, go through the motions again, fail again, and so on and so on. That's not a fair chance, that's like someone learning a musical instrument getting punished for every mistake by having his hands dunked in ice water for a minute or two before being allowed another try. And no matter what the ""git gud"" kindergarden claims: this doesn't separate good players from bad ones either, it merely separates those who sink a lot of time into the game from those who don't.One of the most important realizations about the game connected to this issue is: running past/away from things is not the exception, it's your normal modus operandi. Anyone actually fighting their way to the Twin Princes rather than just running/rolling through the stairs of death would go mad long before he got Lorian into phase 2. Once you realize that, boss fights in particular are less daunting, but at the same time it also hammers home the fact that this game is just wasting your time, and lots of it, for no good reason whatsoever, just because it likes being a dick. I can't have the bonfire very near the boss room and just concentrate on that, no, I have to climb boring stairs and elevators and dodge through lots of boring and unthreatening mobs just so I can fight the boss for 10 seconds to try out a new strategy, fail and go through all that boring and unnecessary crap again. The game is probably the most pointless waste of time I've ever come across. How about this, From: add some sort of an arena modus where you can practice fighting every enemy and boss (stage) you encountered so far during your regular campaign. Beating an enemy in that arena earns you nothing, it merely gives you a fair chance to actually practice against the enemy efficiently rather than making learning as awkward as humanly possible. Well?""But when you finally beat that boss, it'll all be worth it, you'll have a rush like nothing before"" they said, but of course that's nonsense too. One of the main reasons for that is that in order to be able to take the game's constant and unfair punishment, you'll have to detach yourself emotionally from the whole thing. If you start taking this personally, if your reaction to another premature demise is anything more violent than a regular-voice ""ah come on!"", you'll just end up making more mistakes and eventually break things. That detachment will invariably carry over to your victory, though. Of course there'll be a short high, but I couldn't say it's more pronounced nor any more long-lived than any other game's boss-high. And for the late-game bosses there really wasn't a high anymore, there was just relief. The kind of relief you have when that sadistic bastard with the sledge hammer finally stops mashing your fingers with it.And after spending all that time in the game and finally beating it, I still don't understand a lot about it. How the hell do you fight shield & spear enemies? These things are the bane of my existence, at least Lothric Knight class and upwards. They turn faster than you can walk behind them, they can hit you or your shield regardless what you do and their reach is beyond ridiculous. Why is collision detection such an outrageous mess in a game which claims precision? Snipers shooting homing bolts through mobs of enemies without hitting anything but you, enemies stabbing through walls and trees hitting nothing but same old you, it's ridiculous. Why do I need 30 hits with a 450AR dark-infused straight sword to get weak-to-dark Soul of Cinder to phase two (6500HP)? Yes, I counted. And most of all, why do bosses in internet videos behave nothing like the ones I fought? In videos you usually see some guy in a loincloth and a ridiculously oversized and slow ultra-weapon square off against the boss, who'll do nicely regular attacks and then stand still while loincloth dude huffs and puffs and heaves the Ultra in his face. No weird, seemingly random delayed attacks followed by openings just barely long enough for a swing with a straight sword, none of the hard stuff, really. Do bosses drop a bucket of Valium as soon as they realize their opponent is into Shonen Anime cosplay?Controls could also use some serious overhaul, at least keyboard and mouse. For starters, the game seems to buffer mouse buttons, which is extremely irritating. I don't know if that's the same with Controller buttons, but your avatar still doing attacks several seconds after you last pressed a button is ridiculous. Even more ridiculous is having to lock onto something just so you can walk backwards with your shield raised. And I'll never be friends with 3rd person games' separation of avatar and camera direction, at least in the heat of combat I want these to be the same (you can always make the avatar transparent). And speaking of the camera, fix the bloody thing for crying out loud! The fight against Midir still gives me flashbacks of skyscrapers falling on top of me with most of my field of vision taken up by my avatar's back...)So is it all horrible? No, of course not, I wouldn't have spent around 150 hours with it if everything was pure misery. There were certainly fun aspects of it, but there were many times were I really didn't want to turn on the PC because I knew I'd just get pummeled again for 2 hours straight and that's not what I want to do after getting home from work. In the end I finished the game more because I'm a stubborn bastard who doesn't like getting beaten by a game than because I enjoyed it. Objectively speaking, that's a pretty dumb reason to play a game, though, which is why I really wouldn't recommend the game to anyone. For masochists and bragging rights mostly."
Negative,tree buy why have to kill
Negative,"Trash game, all you see in pvp is ultra greatswords, anything else gets obliterated. PVE is full of aimbot npc's, don't recommend this. Poise is none existant."
Negative,Everyone has estus to heal back to full health 10 times over? Check.Host can send infinite summons at an invader while healing constantly? Check.Magic is trash? Check.Horrible Netcode? Check.Don't buy.
Negative,"Dont get this game if ur a solo player, u will have no clue fr"
Negative,"if you want to kill yourself, this is the game for you, 10/10 best video game to be murdered by"
Negative,"Resolution and settings for this game are awful.I've hundreds of hours on this game for playstation, its great.The PC version, due to issues with resolution and not being able to change from the standard resolution set, the game is awful. Buggy."
Negative,"The worst souls game out of the current 3 by far, rarely have i been subjected to this much dogwater. The weapons all suck barely anything does the damage you need to compete with the enemies who all do a billion damage more then you. Everything you do is slow AF especially the estus drinking, often times the game will not even recognize you pressed a button, health and armor basically do nothing as everything in the game either 2 or 3 shots you, iframes practically dont exists and you will get hit all the time even if rolling perfectly, hitboxes are among the worse in the entire series too, oh and the bosses THE MOTHER IN JCBOY BOSSES... 99% of the bosses are beyond terrible, everything either instant kills you or takes away over half your health in one hit and they are all so very agressive and fast with just god awful hitboxes that healing becomes practically impossible. F this game i wish i could get my money back."
Negative,Fuck this game
Negative,its hard :(
Negative,"i can be summoned 1,000 times over and help defeat so many bosses, but when i need a summon sign, its like the games f$%#@#$@ empty and soulless. just like how i feel after playing for so long rip"
Negative,This game is amazing...ly overrated.
Negative,"You play Dark Souls 1, you've played this one. Repetition of ""Big bad boss monster"" certainly got old in 1, and in 3 they just made things obnoxious by having everything transform into amorphous blobs. Such a let down."
Negative,Miazaki is sad that you didn't buy bloodbourne Miazaki wants you to play bloodbourne Miazaki will never ever get to make devil may cry this is not a dark souls game
Negative,pvp with 2 seconds delay?sign me up
Negative,"Could have been a great game. But the retarded devs decided to let invasions be a thing. Oh and there is NO WAY to remove it, if you wanna play co-op. You'll of course only get invaded by players, much higher lvl than you, so you have zero chance. And the servers are fucking trash, so when you finally get a hit in, it can take up to 2 seconds for it to register. WHAT A FUCKING GAME"
Negative,"Really wanted to enjoy this game - was on my list for so long. Turns out to be a terrible port from console, with no option to show mouse and keyboard key bindings. Plus, the opening of the game tells you nothing of the world, and no tutorial whatsoever, just a hulking boss battle (aka Roll Simulator 2016). The game gives you absolutely no reason to care about the game, or persevere through the difficulty. Just not fun at all, and a complete let down for such a highly acclaimed game. First ever negative review and refund on Steam.tl;dr: didn't git gud."
Negative,"I'm new to the game, I'm not great at the game so I decide to play with a friend. I summon him, we get invaded, I barely manage to survive the invasion. I go back, heal up, resummon him. Not even 2 minutes in and we get invaded by a guy with end game gear and spells, kills me with 1 hit."
Negative,Game still crashing many times and there is no solution for this. This situation is so bothering me so much.
Negative,"It's okay, feels a bit too much like bloodborne at times (keep on rolling baby), has poor optimisation on PC and DLC1 was underwhelming. Get at a discount."
Negative,Fucking shit game
Negative,Even worse than 2.
Negative,"This game is epic tho i dont play DS 1 & 2, but.. just to many cheater last time invicible people that keep hit you out of no where, or max stats people in early level mean they spaming poise and high attack to kill you not to mention some people that keep runing dashing to hit you as they dont need stamina"
Negative,"Wow you have to be kidding... this is my first negative review on Steam to my knowledge.  I'm pretty upset I wasted $60 on this game.  Horrible interface obviously meant for XBOX.  Tutorials referring to xbox controls.  Klunky movement, clipping graphics, horrible targetting, etc.  I'm sure the game is great on console, but for PC, I really wish I could get my money back."
Negative,"I haven't actually played this game since 2018 because it sucks so much, but after hearing about the hackers that are running rampant across the last vestiges of PvP play I feel that it is my responsibility as an elite, cyber gamer to provide my own unwanted opinion about this hollowed game.It sucks."
Negative,"I've tried playing this game a few times with my friends. While we understand, and even appreciate, the invasion and PvP aspects of Dark Souls, the fact that there is no limitation on WHO can invade completely murders the game for us. On our most recent attempt, we went to the High Wall of Lothric, I summoned my friend, and within 5 minutes, we had been invaded and one-shot. He used an Ember, summoned me, and we walked down the stairs, only to come face to face with another invader. He shredded us with no effort, because, as with the first invader, he had endgame equipment and was camping the FIRST BONFIRE.If you want to play Dark Souls with friends, and engage in PvP that reflects your current progress and soul count, you want Dark Souls 2. I know I'll get hate for it, but I have no love for the Dark Souls 3 community. Hate all you want; I'll be on 2, having fun with my pals."
Negative,"I did not get to play the game so this review will only cover the fact that: The game (or more precisely steam-link+controller) did not work as described. I received my refund and will purchase once the controller and/or other issues that should have been sorted out in the beta are fixed. I'm sure they had a beta? if not then perhaps they should.  Steam is probably more to blame than the developers of Dark Souls III, but the fact remains that ""Full controller support"" is listed in the steam store page, therefore it is, and should be, expected to work."
Negative,"If you are a competitive gamer, don't bother, Hackers own this game.You can be teleported, by an invader, over a pit to be killed over and over."
Negative,dark souls 3 the final boss is your character from the original dark souls
Negative,Hacker infested shithole
Negative,Filled with filthy castlules. Strength Faith best build big daddy <memes>.
Negative,my 29 hours wasted cause my save is fucking gone fuck this gameits fun tho
Negative,"trully amazing game altho highly populated by cheaters. from begining of the game got contantly invaded with people having over 20 flasks, speedhacks, kalashnikov avelyn firing 10 bolts per second around 30 in a row, and even got all party wiped with not having an invader but a white phantom summod by white soapstone sign. unlike dark souls 1 and 2, this one doesnt have actual players to cooperate or fight against"
Negative,"I bought this game expecting it to be hard. And rewarding.The fact that I can't figure out controls because they are written in console lingo makes it disrespectful.Update 2022:So, I have a ps4 controller i've been using with other games on Steam. Let's try DS3 again!Nope. It doesn't recognize the controller. It uses xbox mappings. And a different unrelated issue, always offline, can't connect to online servers.Pro."
Negative,"Graphics are beautiful, combats mechanics are great and the game looks really promising.However, few things that quite bother me :- everything on the game is explained for consoles games. You're using a PC ? ok, go fuck yourself and try to match the console explanation with the keyboard & mouse actions. Plus it's not optimized for PC, as you have no shortcut to access inventory etc. (or maybe there is, but as there is no tutorial... see next point)- no tutorial at all. You're dropped in the middle of nowhere, and you have to figure out how the spells are handled, what equipment does what, etc. Players of DS1&2 probably know all that, but newcomers dont, and thus would appreciate some guidelines (without going on internet to understand the game mechanics)- Over exagerated difficulty... it's good to see a game where mobs are a bit challenging to fight. But 15 times without success to pass the first boss isnt fun at all.The game is beautiful and I guess the campaign is great, but for the moment it hasnt been enjoyable."
Negative,"Very good game ; lazy, messy port never patched. And from Software ban you from online play if you use a very well known renderer injector which does not allow you to cheat at all and just fix the issues From Software should have fixed years ago !BTW PvP is unplayable : the netcode is as messy as in other Dark Souls game, which mean unplayable : prepare to be backstab from players in front of you and be hit by players meters away if you're in a masochist mood and give it a try....."
Negative,TERRIBLE PC PORT. CAN'T EVEN GET CONTROLS LISTED IN PC - ONLY CONSOLE LIST.REFUNDED.
Negative,its not working
Negative,FIX ME GETTING INVADED BY HIGH LEVELS WHEN I FIRST START THEN I WILL COME BACK BUT THIS GAME IS DUMB AS SHIT!!!!! HEADING BACK TO DS2
Negative,GAME IS FUCKING DOG WATER!!!
Negative,"Honestly, I regret purchasing this game. I suck and the game sucks. Everything about the experience is terrible."
Negative,"What if Dark Souls 1 was a bad game? This game is the answer. Just the same things DS1 has, but worse."
Negative,"Definite dark souls that john Michael envisioned. Still full of classic dark souls tropes of poison swamps, terrible camera and lock on, enemies with crazy attacks and more. A wide variety of amazing bosses such as soul of cinder and Gael to terribly overrated and lame bosses such as Midir and lothric princes."
Negative,"Dark Souls is one of my favorite games of all time. It's an incredible game with an interesting story, amazing world design, and fun gameplay to boot. The weapons and build setups were perfect, the level design (besides the latter half of the game) is some of the best I've ever experienced in a game, and  I can recall almost all of the bosses from the original Dark Souls, and with the exception of a few, I can tell you that I really enjoyed all of them. Dark Souls 3 hits none of that.Dark Souls 3 is.... ok. It's just ok, and for me, that's not enough to justify purchasing it and its two DLCs. Weapons are spread way too far and thin and they don't reward players for seeking unconventional methods in order to create unique low level builds. Instead, you have to extremely gimp yourself just to have access to the most important rings for low level characters. This makes low level PvP annoying and unfun. Why invade when you can only use 5 weapons? As for PvE, all weapons are viable, but so many weapons are just clearly way better than the others... why would you use anything else? If I can just spam my right trigger with the sellsword twinblades, I'll just do that. It's too stupidly easy. In the opposite of stupidly easy, this game was designed to be stupidly difficult and challenging. Dark Souls was challenging, yes. It's one of my favorite games *because* it is so challenging. However, Dark Souls 3 takes the concept of challenge and flips it into ""oh, by challenge, you meant fighting the same boss 2-3 times over and over, right?"" So many bosses in Dark Souls 3 have two phases. You will beat a boss, then you will have to fight it all over again with its health completely restored. And no, a different moveset or a different enemy does not justify this. It is tedious and boring. There is a boss in the DLC that has  three  phases. This isn't fun or challenging. It's a waste of my time and I don't want to sit and fight bosses over and over when I could just easily move onto the next area.However, there will be nothing interesting in those areas. Dark Souls 3 completely relies on callbacks and ""remember this?!?!??!"" to make an interesting world. It doesn't work. There are some truly beautiful locations in this game but they just slap a title from the old game or copy and paste something from Dark Souls 1 there instead. Why?? Come up with something original! It is incredibly lazy to rely on your old games to completely pad the new one. Stop being lazy.If you're going to play a souls game, play Dark Souls, or Demon's Souls or Bloodborne, or as much as I hate it, play Dark Souls 2 even. Dark Souls 3 is a boring and uninteresting take on the souls series and you would be better off investing time into the better games in the series."
Negative,"ITS A STUPID GAME FOR STUPID PEOPLE. THE GAME HAS A GODDAMED BOSS IT THE FUCKING TUTORIAL THAT 3 SHOTS YOU AND DOESNT EVEN GIVE YOU THE CHANCE TO DODGE ITS FOLLOWING ATTACKS, SO TECHNICALLY IT ONE SHOTS YOU. THE GAME WOULD BE FUCKING GREAT IF THE FUCKING PLAYER WAS MORE BALANCED AND THE STUPID FACT THAT YOU CANT EVEN LEVEL IN THE TUTORIAL SO I HAD 4680 SOULS WHEN I FOUGHT SIR DOUCHBAG. LOST EVERY-FUCKING THING ITS STUPID AND ITS PATHETIC CAUSE THE MOMENT YOU GET HIT ONCE YOU MINASWELL LETGO OF THE FUCKING CONTROLLER CAUSE YOUR DONE. ITS NOT ABOUT GETTING GOOD AT THE GAME CAUSE THE GAME DOESNT EVEN LET YOU GET GOOD AT IT IT JUST MAKES YOU RAGE TILL YOUVE USED UP THE 2 HOUR PLAY TIME ON FUCKING STEAM SO YOU CAN RETURN IT. SOO ALL IN ALL I GIVE IT A -666/100. PRETTY FAIR SCORE FOR THIS PEICE OF SHIT."
Negative,"Edit: Installed the Cinders mod and I've never had so much fun in a souls game before, says a lot of the vanilla version of this title."
Negative,"So... Here I am, playing Dark Souls III with buddies, following the rules and doing all I should. Got some troubles with my PC, crashed a couple of times during online play. Whelp, now I am penalized for cheating that I didn't do, probably because the game did not take well to crashing and had some corrupted bits of code from that. The automatic detection system is overly sensitive and Bandai Namco's report system for false positives is not helpful as I was just told what character I allegedly cheated with. On top of that, you can be banned for being in the same game as somebody who is cheating, either by summon or invasion, because of the bad detection system. I do not recommend this game to people who want a fun online experience, as chances are you might be unjustfully punished for stuff you didn't do.I do also not recommend this game to people that liked the previous two installments or Demon Souls or Bloodborne, as the game is badly paced, doesn't deliver enough of a story of its own, does reuse assets from the previous Dark Souls installments as well as Bloodborne and only has one or two enjoyable bossfights over its entirety. So overall, a 2/10 for me, I was picking it up to play with friends because Dark Souls I and II became stale at some point and now I can't even do that."
Negative,"Despite its popularity, this game is only reserved for those who clearly hate themselves. Shallow gameplay loop with the only tools at your disposal being attacking and dodging. There is no complexity. Everything is surface level, with the only skill one requires is to have godlike reflexes. The only depth the game has is the choice between magic and melee.The punishment you get for dying, is the combined time spent waiting for the loading screen to finish and traveling across the entire continent to take on the boss again. The reward for slowly chipping down the boss' health to 0 and finally defeating them is utter dread."
Negative,hot and spicy
Negative,"game doesn't let me play online cause i played offline and came back online just to not be able to do co-op,edit sofware ur ati cheat is dogshit, support doent respond and they can kiss my ass"
Negative,"fromsoftware killed the servers so all of the focus can be on Elden Ring, worst of all they gave a bullshit excuse instead of an honest answer for why the shut down DS3, never buying anything else from this developer."
Negative,"I would play the next Dark Souls, IF THEY COULD FIGURE OUT CLOUD SAVE!..."
Negative,Not Playable!! Only Crashes!. I played 8 Minutes 23 x Crashes ! if i now login after 6seconds ... again ..crash ! soo bad! i did everything what people said to do... but nothing helps..iam playing knightworst graphic options(i have high end pc)without schildhelmet on head.nothing helps.no update..
Negative,this is shit
Negative,Until they fix the random crash issue I would not recommend this game to anyone.
Negative,"i wouldn't recommend even if my mom was gonna die if I didn't recommend this game, for sure refunding"
Negative,"This game has had 0 effort put into the PC version. If you feel console gaming has set the game industry backwards with its limited playstyle, then this right here is a shining example of exactly how far it's fallen."
Negative,Recycled Bloodborne assets.
Negative,"After playing for these many hours i lost joy to even play this, pve/zones are so liner and all are bland in design, all bosses except 1 are not even worth mentioning, gael is the only best boss in game, cinder is a wannabe gwyn. pvp is usually a one sided coin or gankers or invasion party in anor londo. save your money and play elden ring then this game."
Negative,"The game it self has some quality, the atmosphere is good. But the way you are controlling your avatar - horrific. This game has a reputation for being hard indeed. It wouldn't be half as bad if they had tried to put in proper controls. Sure you can rebind but I guess that bit works. But the camera controls... With keyboard and mouse you fight it trying to keep focus on the enemy. With a controller you hope the autolock helps you but lining it up before hand is the best, once you are in combat you are not able to aim. If the enemy ends up in a blindspot, rotating the camera and you to face your opponent to attack usually cracks it and leaves you swinging at anything else. The fact that you can look up your own arse is kind of telling how free it is as well as how rudimentary the implementation is. The autolook is pressing down on the camera panning controller for me with a Steam controller and if I'm not close enough it resets to where my avatar is facing. Brilliant...This game is probably as hard as people say but the controls are way worse. Now I know why console players NEEEDS aimbots to even face the right direction, much less hit anything.Update: Even worse than I remembered it. Horrific camera, moronic controls which are even less than the console/controller version and then... oh man the inbuilt lag and absolutely horrible 'You pressed the button a second ago before you were hit and now we will do it and get you killed.'Garbage game. You want a good game of this kind, Code Vein, Scourge 2... anything but Dark Souls. Dark Souls game design is abyssmal as it's graphical design is great."
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 is quite a huge disappointment for me so far. It continuously rips off the first game while falling into the same traps like the second. The combat is better, the stupid soul memory system got removed, but in both encounter and mob design it is DS2 all over again. The first game was quite simple in a way. It did not have the most up to date technology, nor level design detail but it worked because of the great balance. DS3 includes a lot more of those oversized enemies whose hitboxes are rather unrefined. This game is definitely more action focused but it feels a supbar experience compared to the best entry. While the game can be punishing as expected, when played in a way it is far easier then DS1, and might only be a little bit more difficult than the second. Obviously it is extremely difficult to create a hard but balanced game. Just look at most open-world AAA games where death is meaningless and the core gameplay is not solid enough for a higher skill demand. There are also bugs that are still present in the game, and other potential exploitations, like when on reload mobs teleport back to their original places dead or otherwise. Of course the performance is the other culprit, having texture streaming and stuttering issues even from an SSD.In the end From Software starts to look like a one hit wonder to me. While Demon's Souls was the 'Dark Souls beta', the first entry in the series is an excellent experience even today, which hopefully becomes better with the new remaster. After DS1 everything went downhill and most of the new ideas included in the last two games are rather mixed. They are good games but not on the level that was expected in my opinion. I cannot talk about Bloodborne or the King's Field games as I have not played them yet, they might be another exception. Through all of their games the atmosphere is strong but the gameplay is often suffers."
Negative,DO NOT PLAY FOR PC!The controls all popped up in XBox controller settings - lot of fucking help that is for my keyboard.Searched up every control for Keyboard some didn't work and others required multiple actions to do 1 taskGot tired of the bullshit integration to PC Controls so I plugged in a controllerToo bad its not an X-Box Controller and I couldnt switch any of the key bindings.That being said 90% of the key binders for the controller didn't even do anything.like holy fuck learn how to properly integrate into PCPiece of shit game go buy it for Xbox or PS
Negative,"10/10 would have it crash my GPU over and over again because I'm running on hardware this game apparently can't handle, AKA a 144hz monitor. 120hz monitors were commonplace by 2010. This game released in 2016. You figure it out. The 54 hours I have came from a older rig that was on a 60hz monitor.People cut Fromsoft far too much slack for things that any other company would be ripped apart for doing. From absolute terrible PC ports that never get fixed, to day zero cheats, hacks and exploits that go completely unaddressed despite public outcry for years. The online scene for this game at this point has devolved into a wasteland of bots and hackers who can completely brick and ruin entire saves at any time they want, with a half functioning 3rd party anti-cheat mod being your only saving grace from them."
Negative,"My first negative review on Steam.My progression was suddenly reset and my character was thrown all the way to the beginning. This made me lose all the progress I was able to muster so far in this already difficult game.Most of the reviews are memes and I'm getting tired of seeing DSIII praised as this masterpiece when it's so undeniably flawed.While not a soul-likes fanatic, I have these experiences under my belt:- Finished Bloodborne and got Platinum Trophy on the PS4;- Played a decent amount of Dark Souls II;- Played Nioh 1 and 2;DS III is a great dark fantasy game, without a doubt.The music is good, the artwork and graphics of the game are nothing short of amazing.The weapons and armours are fascinating and the gameplay is gritty and tough.The world is connected with all of their regions and that's something I haven't seen in too many games. That being said, that's where my praise ends.Compared to Bloodborne, DS III is much slower, the bosses are alright (the ones I've been facing so far) but don't stand out, at least in the beginning.As usual, the hit boxes of enemies and bosses can miss by a mile and you'll still end up getting hit which is pretty pathetic but people, for some reason, praise this nonetheless. A masochistic reaction to a difficult game doesn't make it any better at its core.Bosses that look like they're weighing 3 tons will 360 no scope you in a flash if you don't spam roll 24/7 trying to learn of their movements and patterns.While Dark Souls II was more slow and predictable, it offered more realistic boss fights.Bloodborne wants you to be calculated while also being aggressive since attacking in that game does heal you for a certain amount.The enemy design for some DSIII mobs are also questionable...especially since there are Bloodborne bosses or should I say...scrapped content from Bloodborne thrown in here - that is just lazy.For instance there's this really beautiful scenery you'll reach at some point - the view of an amazing city. There's a bridge you have to go on in order to reach the city and this beast spawns behind you, out of thin air which looks exactly like the Cleric Beast in Bloodborne. The only difference is that it's so bad in every sense of the word. I was able to beat this mob on my 5th try but there's barely any place to dodge. Its attacks come out of nowhere and you can only predict a few and sometimes you just have to be lucky for the AI to maybe repeat some of its attacks in order for you to land those lucky shots that end the fight.Lazy, uninspired and it's just hard for the sake of being hard.The online mode...oh the online mode at least on PC.My playthrough was reset while I was progressing through the game and my character was thrown right at the beginning. Later, I've found out that I was ""hacked"". In all my 20 years of gaming, this has never happened to me. Then a bunch of people, have informed me that I should've installed mods that protect you against ""cheaters and hackers"" while also having to store and protect your save file... - Mods should ENRICH the game on multiple playthroughs. - If I have to LEAVE the game and find fixes for something this bad, then it does NOT deserve the praise.  - This cult fanbase is one of the worst communities I've seen and I don't wish to revisit it soon.While I may continue playing DS III and attempt to struggle all the way back to where I was, this review and opinion comes from the heart especially with a poor online mode where anyone can hack their way into your game/system.I was really hyped going into DSIII hearing and seeing how amazing it looked and feels. But in reality, it's just a massively disappointing mess of a game. Its memes and community artwork have lifted and held it up where it is today.Maybe a few years ago it was truly the game everyone praised it to be but now it's a plague that will harm you, especially if you're a new player.6.5/10 game."

Negative,so bad such poor port settings dont even fucking save
Negative,unplayable with friends. getting invaded isntantly by experienced players
Negative,"Damn near unplayable, one of the worst ports in existence.... literal cancer trying to play this crap.  Pure and utter pile of hot steamy garbage."
Negative,"No Digital ""The Fire Fades"" Edition, fuck Bandai Namco."
Negative,"Trash controls for PC. UI is clunky, game is clunky.  Game feels like a console port not done well."
Negative,My ass has been obliterated too many times to count.
Negative,"It's okay, I guess. Not as good as the first one and a bit better than the second one. It's really rather empty and hasn't got many bosses in it in comparison to the other games. Enemies can hit you through walls and R1 spam is the most anti-fun PVP thing so far. Would not recommend unless it's on sale."
Negative,"game is rng trash, pvp is also the most garbage unpolished thing i've ever touched in my life.""invasion aborted due to timeout""""could not invade, failed to joined session"""
Negative,What the actual fuck is the pontiff walk back. (Would not recommend).
Negative,Every other boss in the game is pretty easy compared to the first one. I really want to replay the game but first boss is so stupid that I can't be bothered to even try.
Negative,Season Pass/DLCs are never on sale cause they want you to buy the game twice (GotY Ed).Do not support shitty business practices.
Negative,Fucking sucks ass
Negative,This game is not suitable for people who are trying to get into Action RPG's - The controls are overly difficult. The first boss massively overpowered. I feel like i have wasted my money. No tutorials. No help for new players. Really disappointed. I was really looking forward to the rest of the game. They haven't even taken the courtesy of changing the control tutorial to suit Windows - all commands are still on x-box controller.
Negative,"Bought the game for co-op.Start playing co-op in the first map and get invaded nonstop by bored dudes with supergear and millions estus flasks. Was told to Git Gud in the Discussions.Refund.If you want to play this game co-op from the start, you will be disappointed."
Negative,"It's like Demon's Souls but without all the good parts.edit- the level design is really bad. the world design is really linear. there is no poise so the combat sucks [edit- i was mistaken. YOU have no poise. 50% of the enemies have none, the other 50% are meat tanks]. there is less color and emotion than a zack snyder film. the bosses are boring and ugly and gimmicky. soul gain is insanely low and plodding. enemies do too much damage thus mandating shield usage [edit- roll buffers are atrocious and collision is worse, you just have to hope and pray that your inputs don't get eaten and game won't autocorrect you 90 degrees opposite the direction you were holding the stick towards] even though shield combat in dark souls is always garbage, you do either too much or not nearly enough damage, and there are bigger enemy swarms everywhere than in scholar of the first sin. none of the NPCs that aren't just recycled from earlier games are memorable. the lack of a hollowing mechanic combined with the rarity of embers and the false hope of the extra health only incentivizes doing suicide runs over and over again, and since you don't get any souls from enemies you don't lose anything important. the only thing that i am enjoying so far is the fanservice. if this wasn't a dark souls game i wouldn't care about it. i would literally rather play lords of the fallen or the surge. very disappointing, so i'm glad i got the goty edition for $15 on sale. of course i'm going to keep playing in the hopes that ""oh trust me after high wall and undead settlement it gets good"" but if it becomes ""oh trust me after high wall and undead settlement and road of sacrifices it gets good"" i will not at all be shocked.and as for my original review? it still stands. it 100% is just all of the bad parts of demon's souls.edit- road of sacrifices sucked. cathedral of the deep sucked. farron keep? fuck this game. i don't care about anything else, i am finally uninstalling. this brings me no joy. i don't even like dark souls 1 and i'd rather play it than this because at least it was fresh and new and original and had heart and soul put into it. not this.update! farron keep was worse than i expected. catacombs of carthus was too short but i am actually glad for that because it sucked. smouldering lake was mediocre for about five minutes and then it was just boring. demon ruins was all the worst parts of carthus and chalice dungeons and lost izalith BUT EVEN WORSE. irithyll is just a million enemy swarms with square decameter spell coverage and 6-hit 360 degree combos and some of them are invisible. the painted world? more like the painFUL TO PLAY world. there is not a single speck of enjoyment to be found here, yet i keep pressing on because what if it's about to get good? what if it's about to be better? what if it's about to be a masterpiece? all that awaits is just more poorly designed bosses, even worse designed levels, and more absurd leaps in enemy stats while my own stats are stagnant. i am literally just suicide run sprinting through the levels grabbing shinies because it's so fucking BORING. if this wasn't dripping with dark souls fanservice and the squirts of dopamine from large titanite shards because todd howard's operant conditioning brainwashing has taken hold of the RPG industry, i'd have been out a long time ago. BUT SURE, DARK SOULS 2 IS THE BAD ONE. SCHOLAR IS THE ONE EVERYONE HATES. 2 IS THE ONE EVERYONE SAYS IS GARBAGE FOR EXACTLY THE SAME THINGS THAT ARE RAMPANT IN 3. even though every single bad thing about 2 was carried over but only about 10% of the good things were. this experience has only served to sour my outlook on this fandom and the dev team. if any good has come from playing this, it's that before i played 3 i hated ds1 and thought that it wasn't a very good game as far as jrpgs OR action games go. now i realize, wow, it could have been so much worse in every single conceivable way. i genuinely am not enjoying anything about this, and if i had bought this at full price and not a 75% discount i would have been as depressed as i would be furious. luckily i feel almost no emotion towards this besides apathy, and nostalgia for what should have been another awesome souls game. instead i get basically the 3D equivalent of early 80s sidescrolling platformers but the developers actively hate you. it's kaizo castlevania 2."
Negative,"Not recommend to buy the game yet. The game have many issue so far. I can't damage the enemies and I can walk through them without getting hurt.. This is kinda upset me, because I've been excitied about the game. Hopefully they will fix soon. I'm sure this is a great game, it just need time to fix the issue.. so don't buy the game yet"
Negative,"Absolute joke console port, onscreen instructions to press XBox controller buttons to perform actions and tasks, no keyboard instructions. Game may be great but its so poorly optimised that I can't be bothered to find out."
Negative,It's Dark Souls.
Negative,"Play the previous games, or just get a PS4 with Bloodborne. Uninspired levels, tries to be Dark 1 too hard, and pvp manages to be worse than the backstab fishing in Dark 1"
Negative,shit game dont play and dont buy
Negative,I 100% on my xbox tried it pc found out why I broke a desk and my phone over this game
Negative,"As a dark souls 1 and 2 fan, i cannot recommend ds3. Its a nice game but not the dark souls we wanted. The reason is that ds3 is a copy paste of dark souls 1 , many areas are the same.Few ( and the same ) enemies, same playing style, nothing new.  Also you can beat ds3 quite fast, not as ds 1 and 2. They made no effort to make ds3, only stealing from the other souls, no originality. It seems they made it fast to take our money. Also pvp is alot parry spamming, no many moves or skill in battles, only parry , critical hits and weapons that can hit from distance, withought many joices to avoid the attacks.( no effective backstep, no good rolling maneuvers or other moves, only walking away from the attacks). This is the truth about ds3. I ll continue playing ds3 ( i bought it 60 euro ) but im dissapointed with this souls game."
Negative,games ass bruh highkey
Negative,"This game may be fun and addictive but I refuse to play a game with broken ui, annotations and broken screen resolutionsPros: very interesting gameplayCons: Broken Ui, annotations, promts broken screen resolutionsLooks like a very bad port from console peasants"
Negative,"*The second last paragraph is by far the most important*While I certainley had some enjoyment while playing the game and will remember the experiance, had I known what the game was and was not I would never have bought it. It can and will be a great experiance for many - but you have to know what dark souls is and is not. I aim to tell you what it is, and what it is not. I own the season pass and while I have completed the main campaign I will not be playing the DLCs.Dark Souls III is an excellent fighting game that is like an RPG in the traditional sense in that you are able to decide how you want to play in using an excellent and effective leveling and equipment system. You can choose to play as a hard-hitting noble knight or as a spell weaving mage, or as someone in-between. You can dictate the manner of your play and the nature of boss fights and enemy encounters. Replays are made possible by this system as you will have a drasticaly differant game play experiance depending on the class you choose. Don't be worried about the permenance of your choices at the start, while admittdedly they can and will affect the levelling choices you make later in the game you are giving plently of differant paths to choose if you end up picking a primarily melee character but late on decide you really would like to use that awesome spell you picked up.The boss fights are challenging ,and while I mantain the belief that dark soul III's reputation as being insanely difficult is an exaggeration and downright right harmful to the game (It puts off more casual players who arn't interested in the fictional idea of slaving away at a level for weeks and weeks), they do give you a run for your money. They will often require more than several attempts, (a reasonable player should aim to beat a boss between 5 - 20 tries) and ,as mentioned before, there are several differant ways to approach them depending on your chosen playstyle. The boss fights are very entertaning works of art where Dark Souls truly shines.The developers have clearly put a lot of time, effort and love into the game and this is at it's most evident in the world at large. The settings never get boring and repetitive as each level has a cleary defined texture and feel that make every setting a memorable one. While the levels can be beautiful at times, do not go into the game expecting a pictuersque scene to take your breath away at every corner. The levels are generally dark, depressing, eerie and at times dull - but this is not done out of laziness (Although the developers do have a nasty habit of reusing assets), but from proper regard to the lore and situation of the world. You will however never truly get distracted by the scenery around you.Dark Soul's level design is a bit of a mixed bag in all honesty. At it's best it's intuitive, simple and straightforward and an example for the rest of the dungeon crawler genre. At it's worst the level's become maze like with not clear indictation for where you need to end up, with backtracking and confusion being the status quo - and with no map system or an objective finder this can be an immersion breaker.  The bonfire locations (where you can teleport to a safezone or to other areas as well as heal and fill up your estus flasks) particulary irke me. While at times they are placed at ideal legs of the journey, so as not to trivilize the experiance - nor turn into endurance sprinting, they are often placed either too short or too far away. One particulary hateful memory is when you have two bonfires twenty feet apart from each other in a straight corridor with no enemies in between. This is made all the more horrible when for the vast majority of the game bonfires are often placed some distance from the boss rooms requiring you to take inevetiable damage by sprinting past enemies you have already fought or search for sectet passages to open up, which is not always an option nor an intuitive one.What I've said so far seems to be a game seller or at the very least no grounds for a negative review. And you would be right had I not misbranded the game as a storytelling and emotive experiance. I walked into this game expecting a soap opera to make me cry and rejoce and at times I did - but for the wrong reasons. I was happy I got past a tough boss by myself and I was frustrated and sad whenever I failed. But I was never sad because I character I had come to love had died, I was never happy for someone elses experaince. I felt constantly hollow and purposeless, and by the end simply bored. There was never any real reason to go forward on the path. This game is simply an Action RPG Dungeon Crawler. And if this genre appeals to you - Great - get it, it is truly a masterpiece of the genre. If you arn't particulary interested by the genre or have no experiance with it, watch some gameplay videos, but chances are you'll love it. But for the minority who are looking for a story and characters to laugh and weep, this simply isn't the game for you.I should however note that while the game lacks for all intents and purposes a story, it does have masterful lore writing and world building that makes for a very interesting read on the wiki that gives a much better understanding of the world around you and why you do things. And if you have far too much time on your hands you can always piece together mind-numbing dialogue and item descriptions and craft your own theories."
Negative,A platforming simulator with no story
Negative,just dont like it
Negative,Bndai namco fucking sucks lower thr price you bitches
Negative,WORST GAME EVER
Negative,Why There Is No Breaking Bad Game
Negative,Coop with password doesn't work.
Negative,"the game lacks innovation and fails to bring many new elements to the series. While it does refine and improve upon the gameplay mechanics of its predecessors, it just doesnt feel fresh for the people who have already played the previous installments.Another area where the game may fall short is in its storytelling. While the game has a rich lore and backstory, it is often left up to the player to piece together through item descriptions and environmental clues. Some players may prefer a more straightforward or cinematic approach to storytelling.-Bad Game, Try: Sekiro"
Negative,"i dont know how to play this game. I finished all game Nioh1 and Nioh2 with all DLCs. but the Fight system in nioh was mutch better, and everithing was better, smother ..... i cant deffeat in Dark Souls basic knight of Gotrhic because he hit me everytime..... Hitboxes are terrible , i try rolling but not help...."
Negative,"These souls games are just horrible, they have unfair controls, you control this super slow walk in the mud character with the stamina of a 90 year old and the enemies have endless stamina and move like lightning, unfair crappy game."
Negative,still banned i think but i had to re agree too the eula when i opened it so idk
Negative,"i dont recommend this game because other players can invade and kill you while you play, it's totally unfair and annoying, they should at least add a voice chat so you talk to the invaders"
Negative,People who play this game think they’re hot shit and think they’re the best at video games were as it’s just a circle and square over and over again this game is for hamsters that can’t use their brains
Negative,this is a amazing game and very well made. but im bad and it frusturates therefore it gets a no.
Negative,Its so dull it feels like its thrown together from leftover bits and i honestly dont know what people see in this one
Negative,coop is hot trash game coulda used me as creative director and breathed new life into its coop scene but alas i aint japanese hopefully elden ring better coop but doubt it lul but got horses and big jump so pog bye
Negative,"I love hard, challenging and punishing YOU mistakes games, I did 100% (Plat) in SURGR 1&2, LordsOfFallen, Nioh, MortalShell, i Have like 90 % of completion of CodeVain, DemonSouls, Ashen plaing now 5 other games like this ect,and after finishing all DS games i never call them ""Souls like"" becouse DarkSouls Games are Easy, Anoing and Not Rewarding and Punish You for somply playing them .EASY - 80% of enemy and Bosses can be cheese with magics, Bow spells etc. There is no Level/Power Cap, before Boss. When you kill the boss you can be at lvl 30 but i can farm like stupid and kill him almost in one hit because im on lvl 60. I love SURGE approach each Boss is a literal gate keeper because you can lvl higher only after you kill him.  Whats the difference, when i see that someone beat SURGE i know His good when i see that someone beat DS first think crossing my mind is ""Ye He cheese everything"", In SURGE you have scoreboard showing how many times you die , your time etc.ANOING -""When you die you loos your souls"" so what ?? After first level in first DS you learn about ""suicide runs"", you spend everything and start new lvl naked and run collecting everything and uncovering checkpoints not worrying about the deaths because (a) when you pick a Item its yours, (b) when you collect a item you don't have to go there second time. NOT REWARDING - When you play a game with enemy's lvl increase further you go, you expect that you will be rewarded with more and better loot, not in DS games!. Yes last levels enemy give 2000 souls but time you have to spend in fights is stupid compering to killing all 7 ""Spiders"" under kitchen in 15sec and getting 7000+!!. Its easy that i will farm them instead enemy that can kill me in one hit , the duel takes 30-60sec (depending your luck with backstabe)and reward is disappointing 2000 and we go back to second point of ""suicide runs"". I dont want to farm on ""NEW"" levels i simply rush thru them.The idea to play all Darksouls before pre-ordering Elder Ring was great, now i Know that ER is not for me i'll wait for some better games like SURGE 3 or MortalShell 2.P.S. The idea that after failed boos fight you loose your items you use at the fight but you do not re spawn before the fight but at last checkpoint was stupid in DemonSouls but in DS is a  +100 to punish you for playing. Same as in 2009, when I copy save to pen-drive before boss, I use the same trick now. in 80% of cases is faster than farming souls to buy items you lost and making way up to the boss again."
Negative,"The game sucks.if you REALLY want to have fun and feel like a boss play Sekiro.the gameplay really sucks in dark souls 3. the movemant is slow and you are stuck at your movement. let's say that you roll and accidently press roll during the animation again in a boss battle the game will buffer it as another roll after finishing the first one and you can't cancel it at all which confirm your death.when you roll the enemies still kill you because that the invincibilty frames dont exist.THE GAME FORCES YOU TO DO 2 HITS AND RUN LIKE A COWERED.The parry in this game is really unrewarding so it's not even worth to parry enemies because of the low damage that you deal.the hardest thing in this game is to not fail in missions that you didn't even start, example the siris mission i was at the swamp took an item before i got to intarect with her because that i don't just go back to the shrine after every fucking boss which automaticly made the npc to never apear to me.UNDERSTANDING WHERE YOU ARE SUPOSED TO GO NEXT IS A TORTURE:so much back and forth to do, you need to look at random guides just to tell you that you have to get a specific item for activating some events and then you try to understand where you can get that item and you move to another video and it says ""hey, you need to talk with that npc at the shrine"" and then i got to that shrine and the npc was not there and then i tried to look for over half an hour to understand where the fuck the npc and then a site said that you can fail at her mission without even starting the mission which make the npc to never appear. there is no npc that tells you where you are supposed to go next or go to a specific area to just figure where you should go, guides are the best way to move in this game and it's really easy to miss bosses in this game and you have to beat 5 of them and 3 of them you can skip without even noticing because you have to go to specific areas that you wouldnt even think about from the first place. YOU HAVE TO DO A STUPID EMOTE AT A SPECIFIC AREA JUST TO GO TO A NEW PLACE AND IT'S A MUST THING TO DOso if you are looking for a game that you actually need some skill to play just PLAY ""SEKIRO SHADOW DIE TWICE"", the gameplay there is perfect, the combat feels actually fluid there and the parry is actually rewarding and makes you feel like a bad ass.in short i beat dark souls and i have to say fuck this game and it does not worth your money or your time, it's REALLY OVERATED."
Negative,"I don't know who the fuck thought it was a good idea to make it so a random asshole with a build specifically designed to ruin your life can join early on in the game and destroy your game, but it is quite honestly some of the worst damn game design I've ever seen."
Negative,"I wrote a long, long review here before, but steam refused to let me post it, and I had the game up and got invaded, which caused my game to jump up and use 100% in all parts of my PC, crashing it. Dark souls 3 as it currently stands is a insecure game that should genuinely not be sold. I even have blue sentinel installed, and i had all processes for the game jump to 100% and crash my PC. Please reconsider purchasing this game, or just playing offline"
Negative,"its too easy, i do not recommend"
Negative,"Lost connection while creating character, then did it 4 more times in 15 minutes. This is the only game I have that is constantly losing connection. Would not recommend."
Negative,"very good platform rpg game, very bad dark souls game (yes, even worse than ds2)it really feels like dark souls had sex with his allready retarded cousin dark souls2 and ds3 is the product of their love"
Negative,"borderline unplayable if you use keyboard, just wasn't made for it"
Negative,I really really want to enjoy this game but I am having key and mouse tracking issues which make it almost unplayable
Negative,100 hours in a game I barely enjoy.
Negative,"This game is not bad. Not at all. Looks fine and everything. What I don't like is that the game is outstandingly difficult for a person like me who has never played any Dark Souls game or even a 3rd person combat game. After dying over and over again to some slightly beefier common enemy, I just lost my intrest in the game."
Negative,"Really wanted to like this game. It does some things better than DS2, like give you a little bit more in the story department. Visuals are definitely better. It doesn't feel as linear. You feel like you have a lot more options on where to go when exploring. The environmental design is some of best I've seen compared to the previous games. But wow, there are a ton of things that are worse in this compared to its predecessor where 10 hours is more than enough of this game for me. The camera bugs are back in full force. Constantly, the camera will un-target the target you're wanting to go after. When fighting multiple enemies at the same time, the camera will randomly switch to another target without the instruction from you, the player. Delayed, or queued, reactions are more prevalent in this compared to the previous game. When you get knocked down to the ground by an enemy, often your character will just dodge or attack when getting back up when you're not wanting either of those actions, or just one in particular. The constant wiffs of your sword or arrow missing the target when the animation is going through the enemy model is frustrating. Many times I've been left wondering if this was intentional or not since it doesn't make sense. Enemies you're attacking will sometimes randomly start holding an invisible shield they never were holding before. The animation of the enemy will show them holding it up at guard, but the shield isn't actually there. When attacking, your attack will bounce off of their invisible shield. Invisible walls will block you in the middle of a room or walkway but enemies can walk and attack through them with no issue. In addition, enemies can land their melee swings through clipped walls, ceilings, and rooftops at a much higher rate than I've seen in the previous games.In combination of the aforementioned, playing as a strength melee build is flat out miserable. I made it to level 40ish in the time I played following a strength melee guide with focus on Strength, Dexterity, Endurance, splashing a bit into HP, using a Greatsword, and lighter armor < 50% weight capacity. The joe-schmo skeletons were easy to take down and had a fairly low stagger point. Many of the more ""tougher"" enemies typically didn't have a stagger point and generally were relentless in how hard they stagger or how fast they attacked with Greatswords leaving you unable to dodge all of their constant attacks. They also have incredible ranging so if you think you're safe at a distance, you're wrong. Strangely, the boss fights I experienced, up to the cathedral, were incredibly simple. The real bosses in this game are the glitches."
Negative,"There are two aspects to every game, learning to play the game and mastering the game. Most people want a game to be easy to learn and hard to master. This game is both hard to learn and hard to master if you are playing on a PC. There is no tutorial to teach you the mechanics of the game or the user interface, instead you get scratch marks on the ground that give you hints. The problem w/this is that the hints are for playing on an X-Box, not a PC. When you stand on the hint (the game calls them ""messages"") the prompt you get to open the ""message"" is geared for an X-box so on a PC you have have no clue how to read the ""message"". The only way to learn anything about the game mechanics (which button does what, how to attack or block, how to move, etc.) is to look at the key bindings. This brings up the another problem, two different actions which are important (rolling/dodging an attack and jumping) are both keyed to the ""space bar"". No matter what I tried I could never ""jump"", just roll/dodge. Changing either action to a different key doesn't help as the new key for the action won't work. The user interface (UI) is also hard to understand or manipulate. In the lower left the UI displays your ""ready"" tools/items. Of course the game doesn't tell you how to trigger them if playing on a PC or how to add a new item/tool. Again, I had to look at the key bindings to find out how to trigger them. After 13 hours of playing the game I still have no idea how to add to the ""ready"" items, the game doesn't tell you. Another glaring problem w/the game is an apparent lack of an in game map. If thereis an in game map, you are not told how to access it (there is no key for this in the ""key bindings""). Anyway, this is long enough. In conclusion, a game being hard to master is fine. Being hard to learn is not, I don't want to spend hours stressing over how to play the game, I want to stress over how to MASTER the game!"
Negative,"wow legit too ez, i cant believe they say this game is like Dark Souls. its nothing like Dark Souls. DaRk sOul is an actual hard game. this game nEeeds to be buFFed before we can call it Draks ouls worthy... honestly dont seE what the hyper about this game is. like... the name is completely ripped off from DArk soulds.you should buy just drak suols instead...hey these edibles aint sHi-.."
Negative,i did ur mom
Negative,"this game is too hard, so for maniacs only"
Negative,"41hrs in: Pay to win trash, play DS1 insteadEdit: 160hrs in and the game starts to crash on startup with no fix other than rolling back my graphics card version."
Negative,camera is suck and lag when fight invader
Negative,"Overall a fun game to play co-op with friends, but the game is several years old and has a hacking problem.  I've played roughly 30 hours and I honestly don't care to play the PVP. Previously, when I played DS games, I bought them on sale and played disconnected from the internet. Trying co-op with friends, overall, it's fun, but 1 in 3 people who invade are lagging so bad, it's pointless to fight them. Three people hit them, hear the sound of hitting, and the person's life bar doesn't go down, they just roll out and go run to enemies waiting to bait. You just literally sit there for 10-15 minutes waiting til either you get bored or they do. It interrupts the flow of the game and kills the enjoyment of it. I either just let people kill me, jump into world enemy, jump off something high, or just alt-F4 and do something else. I've played the game for 30 hours, why the fuck can some one 2000 hours enter my game and waste my fucking time."
Negative,The game doesn't work. I've downloaded it and it does not recognize my keyboard.  I've tried all the online solutions available and none work. I can't even move. Total waste of money.
Negative,this game rottens my computer
Negative,i did a playthru a couple of months ago that went completly fine but then i reopend the game and all of the sudden there are no frames and its completly unplayable
Negative,"Just things doing there combo routine, there is no AI in battles."
Negative,"I can't say how this game ran originally but trying to play it now in 2019 the controls wouldn't even work properly on my computer, not with mouse and keyboard, not with a controller.  It's just really bad."
Negative,All excited. Loaded game. Shock&Anger - game plays with console controller. Refund requested. Saw no mention in any game description or review of this little (for me) game killer.
Negative,"Seriously Done with this game, shotty mechanics and bullshit enemies and magic that hits you through walls, actually most attacks from enemies can hit you through walls, really dumb pvp mechanics and even shittier pve mechanics, have loved ds1-2 3 ruins the game and it isn't actually fun, spent the last 10 hours just trying to kill auldrich and the dumb bullshit they made him to find out the game slacks off after, really bad game don't recommend to anyone sane enough to care for themselves enough not to put your self through the head ache."
Negative,"I have an hour and a half played. It took me about an hour and 15 minutes to beat the first crystal basilisk guy. Not because the game is hard, but because of horrible fps drops. I have spent HOURS upon HOURS trying to find a solution to these fps drops, to no avail. The game is hard, and I don't mind that. I don't mind getting beat by a hard game, but when I get beat because I keep dropping down to 10 fps every 4 seconds, it's impossible to play. I'm just glad I didn't pay full price for this game because holy shit it's literally unplayable."
Negative,"nope nopethis game is trash for pc the devs clearly didn't bother at all (they didn't even change the xbox controls for pop ups)not enough graphic settings, screen tearing for me and many people and fps lock at 60wanted to try this out because of the infamous challenge but it's not fun to begin with and makes no fucking sense"
Negative,terrible pc port they dont even bother changing the icons from the xbox to pc icons very hard to begin playing and understanding controls navigating the menu is torture
Negative,"this game masks difficulty with bad controls. lock on a core game mechanic is outright broken, co op is worthless. I get they want to make a hard game but this is synthetic difficulty not skill.(if you like I wanna be the guy this games design is for you!) If you want to play the game as a caster type class the poor game design becomes much more apparent. this game is intended to be played one particular way and then maybe replayed with the different classes in mind. A lot of this games design is just lazy. what you get is bad controls..something not satisfying to win but frustrating to play.2/10 - nice graphics."
Negative,"I could talk for hours about this game, so I'll spare you and only highlight my biggest disappointment.I truely believe that the directors have no idea why Dark Souls 1 was so incredible. The carefully and creatively interconnected world of Lordran has been reduced to Firelink Shrine with loooong hallway sticking off the side of it. This turns the curiousity-driven freeform exploration of DS into a linear gauntlet of things that need to be stabbed. Essentially, I liken the relationship between DS1 and DS3 to that of Zelda 1 and 'Link to the Past'. Instead of crafting an exciting new world for us to discover, they arranged a series of uninspired DS1 and Demons' Souls references into a linear quest.I do enjoy playing it, but I would not recommend it when there are so many more interesting and rewarding 'From Software' worlds to explore. Go play Shadow Tower!"
Negative,So difficult I died thrice in the opening menu remapping my keys.
Negative,too hard.I would rather have been killed during the attacks on pearl harbor than play this fucking game. 10/10
Negative,I have a moster sytem and this game craashes all the time! Can't even get through charatcter creation. Needs some HELP!
Negative,"If you like it, you gonna love it.If not, you gonna hate it so much.Dont get me wrong, I love the whole desperate world thing.I just dont enjoy getting killed all the time. I tried, I really did..."
Negative,"Terrible port to PC, dont bother unless you have a controller, all icons default to controller regardless if you have one or not"
Negative,"crystal mage is an rng bossfight not fit for this game, better suited for the casino"
Negative,"This game is a piece of shit for ppl that use a keyboard and mouse. Half the time alt tab does not work and the keys are very awkward. I didnt get past the main menu, thats how bad of a console port this is. DIsgusting. Thankfully I can return games!!"
Negative,best gameplay worst camera angles
Negative,please dont play this if you are not a nerdy whale
Negative,Overrated as fuck
Negative,I hate this game
Negative,dark but soulless
Negative,cannot understand why they wouldnt have the steam cloud synced lost all my data on my account that i was gonna go 100% on and its all lost spent over 125 hours on that single account maxed out several convenats and its all lost now will not be playing for quite awhile
Negative,"I can't recommend the game fully because of the story mechanics. (80 / 100)The story mechanics are actually about talking to the right NPC at the right time without a connection to the things that are happening. So generally just talk to everyone before you do something. Otherwise you will miss things that get locked for the playthrough. This mechanic is just awful and leaves tremendous room for improvement. If you solely see the game as a combat game without story, it is very decent. The combat has some mechanics that are not perfect, but it is still very enjoyable. However, the general game mechanics are sometimes poor, for instance, you beat a boss, get a cutscene and get a direct port to another boss just because you stood, not as expected from the game, one meter too far to the right. A final polish is sometimes missing. I would give the game 80  / 100 but cannot fully recommend it due to its weaknesses. Interestingly, the triggers for varied endings sometimes boil down to talking to a npc one more time at a specific time which feels like a stupid click action without connection to the actual world. This barrier between the told story and the game mechanics let the whole story appear odd, unnatural and being something different than that what you are actually playing and experiencing. This is in my eyes weak game design. However, I will go for Sekiro and Elden Ring next. Keep on improving From Software. Hopefully, there will be a game with a motivating and encouraging story that makes you want to get more into it while experiencing great combat and level design."
Negative,"So after a few years I decided to give this game a try because people said it was the hardest game ever.....yeah no....This game is not hard because of the speed,Its not hard because of the timing,Its not hard as in needing to master hundreds of combos on infinite weaponsits hard,,,, just for being hard sake....Picture having to do a math test with 1000 questions. Imagine all the questions are sums and subtractions between 1-10 (ea 3+4=7) You'd say its easy right?Now picture out of those 1000 questions if you make even 1 mistake you fail the test....That's the kind of hard this game is.... You basically have two attacks (strong and weak)  that's it...and some spells ofcourse...Then you are going to have to spend hours of memorizing every single enemys exact timing (which is tedious slow and repeatetive) because the smallest mistake results in death, and death = start ALL over.This game isn't hard in a skill sense... its hard in a mind-numbing sense... I have NO idea why people love this game....If you want a game that's TRULY difficult, (without the insidious frustration and grinding) pull out an xbox and play Ninja Gaiden Black on MN setting."
Negative,"The positives, the graphical jump is good the game is massively improved in that aspect from 1 and 2. The audio is also very good, I think it beats 1 and 2 in that respect as well then control wise it reacts better than 2 but... Honestly at this point I'm somewhat struggling to find other positives to say!Here comes the negatives and there is a lot to say about this game which is wrong for the direction of the souls series.Fast gameplay, it seems like every single game is going towards this fast rapid Call Of Duty casual gamestyle and DaS3 follows this perfectly, perfectly in the absolute awful sense.  Bridging further into what is wrong with this is the fact that it doesn't actually add to any good gameplay element! You see all these big wild swinging animations and flinching animations, but is that such a good thing... I don't think so. Having the right pacing in a game is important and DaS3 throws the Souls series into this casualised era where the games turn into dumbed down easier to play games for people who don't want to learn timing.Next issue, builds there are minimal builds this game forces you to play the one way. For all the issues with 2 at least 2 (B-Team) got that right and gave us the options to play the way we wanted. The problem is with 3 the game sticks to this boring style that doesn't let you succeed with any other style, this is completely alien to 1 and 2 which to me is unacceptable. Rolling spam..... Ugh, I just can't fathom why they would think this was acceptable, it's terrible causal gameplay not good at all. Literally, NO punishment for spamming roll lol its terrible.I likely could rag on, but trust me this game that people say is good they only say it because they didn't experience the original games that weren't geared towards the Fortnite community."
Negative,review so i can say its bad
Negative,"i can't play any more, it;s not  my style"
Negative,"Game unplayable with keyboard currently, acts as if controller were connected to my PC (there is none). Impossible to navigate main menu with keyboard/mouse."
Negative,"looking for co op game ? this isnt it. souls game are much more fun when played co op, but they dont know what co op is."
Negative,"This game has had more hackers and chinese laggers than regular people from day one and it has only gotten worse over time. If you want to play the campaign, which is really good, torrent it or buy at the very least buy off of g2a for a fraction of the price. As good as the From Software developers are at making a single player experience, they don't deserve full price for a game where your character can be ruined or deleted by hackers."
Negative,"Maybe some Keyboard and mouse users guide would be awesome FromSoftware,Inc.Game is sick addicted af to play but there must be a controller to play.so.. i dont reccomend this game to keyboard mouse users."
Negative,"After 98 hrsStill a big fat thumbs down. This is inferior to Dark Souls 2 in almost every single way. The graphics is worse than Scholar of the First Kin. Sure that is remastered but does it have to be this bad? The texture popping is annoying as f-ck.What happened to bonfire ascetic? What happened to power stance? What happened to life gems? And I have to manage Ashen flask? Dont I do enough micro-management already??I have wasted 3 months of my life playing DS1, DS2 and DS3, and it is a f-cking tragedy. I have never been more frustrated, never been more angry. Never going to buy another fromsoftware games, no sekiro, no elden rings, F-ck you fromsoftware for making me hate games. I want to get back to loving games. Going back to Remnant from the ashes, Doom and Hellblade....After 8 hours.Just when I thought DS3 would a culmination of all the best lessons FromSoftware has learnt over the years, I find it worse than DS2. The graphics is utter sh-t. I can't see sh-t. This is a degrade, it looks like a game make mid 2000s. What is going on??Barring some minor improvement this game doesnt bring anything new to the table.I cant even get myself to push thru playing this."
Negative,"Don't rush to play this game Instead play Nioh 2 because it offers much more...The cooperative aspect is much better and rewarding in Nioh 2 also you get to choose the weapons you want at the start of the game and not break your head how to reach late game without using the weapons that you want... DS3 made me learn bosses attacks and maps, looking for all kind of different secrets to find gear that would or wouldn't slightly help me at the end of the game, lore that i never wanted to learn about the game because if i failed to follow some things i'd lose an important npc in my base and that game never forgives, whatever mistake you will do there's no going back...I felt most of the game that i'm expecting for something to happen that my character that i will feel a bit stronger or better but it never actually happend. With every loot i carried i felt collecting more and more junk that i will never need or use...To sum this game in 1 sentence i would say :It was Fun, Tedious and at the end a Nuisance...You need to be ready to get fed with alot of annoying stuff.So that's my general thought of the game after ""enjoying"", grinding and getting bashed by other players with minimal availability to help others (There is a stupid level cap that prevent you from appearing on other players games which are lower level and in the same area)The fun fact is that always those who come to visit you in PVP are higher levels with shiney weapons and they always appear on the worst time ever...I can say this game failed to hit my score and make my WoWs, even the cut-scenes eventually were bad for me - i wanted an ending and all i got was some more nonesense Q_Q"
Negative,"Faster combat and smother animations are all this game has over the other two. The balanceing is pure trash. Magic sucks. Anything that has to do with faith sucks. Pyromancy is ok. Straight swords, curved swords, and rapiers are pretty much god tier. Save your money and time and play the other two games."
Negative,"Overall a solid game with all that Dark soulsyness. BUT for me I prefer 1 and 2.This game in terms of general combat is great, nice selection of weapons and styles of combat, decently hard mobs and great selection of builds.Boss fights are the big let down, i honestly do not understand why people rate 3 over 1 or 2, there are maybe 2 or 3 good bosses, 4 at a stretch, it's a array of stand under, in front or behind them with a few fights that were actually designed well.And the PvP. Now before you read my thoughts on this, i am an old school DS player, no estus and avoid mobs is my etiquette, i have no issue with being bested this rant is just a heads up for those expecting quality pvp.EVERY invade the player would heal after each engage, use mobs to advantage (bearing in mind i had no summons of my own, they were not outnumbered) if i wanted Gurellia tactics i would of joined the army, don't want to be experiencing Afghanistan from the comfort of my own home.The Lagg can be forgiven, every DS has always had it, just ping differences no biggie.Why people rate this over DS2 pvp, or DS1 pve i will never know, the only points it scores is for Siegward,  RIP Onion Bro *i'm not saying this is a bad game, just not up to par with it's predecessors IMO"
Negative,"Runs like garbage on amd 390x 4gb, 8gb ram, intel core i5 3570k"
Negative,Nice slideshow. Kinda like dayz. PC master race.
Negative,worst fucking game ever
Negative,Lifts are so annoying
Negative,The actual worst Dark Souls of the series DS2 is better in every way except bosses. Most of your playtime is pretty much wasted on the not fun parts of the game and then again it also has some terrible bosses too.I have hundreds of hours on PS4
Negative,"I was Fighting iudex Gundyr and i was doing good but then he swung his weapon and I dodge rolled off a cliff and died? Hello? Level design? Bull shit experience overall. Not only that, It gets worse. Some times you Will get invaded by PvP enthusiasts when you Just want to rp as Rock Lee and do a kung fu fist Play through. I was in fact Not as fast as lightning like I was promised going dexterity. You have a Lot to answer for, FromSoftware, a lot indeed to Answer for..."
Negative,"the lag in pvp is pathetic, feels like a ps2 online."
Negative,bugs bugs bugs.
Negative,Ah darksouls 3 is a difficult one to address compared to 1 and 2 its below all of them by quite a bit let me explain.PVP: In 1 their were many different builds magic works fists works bows work you get the idea at any level it was viable. Now In 2 oh man their are soooo many builds for PVP magic? heck ya its honestly kinda op :) and to a extent miracles to. Fists? yup cuz (poise) is actually a thing in 2. Holy spear/shield knight miracle user oh ya. Dagger? well in pvp it well take a bit more effort but sure. Duelwielding/powerstanceing (what I think its called) of course you can. And now 3... One word ROLL SPAM now yes rolling has always ben in dks games 1 u had to time it right get it near perfect in 2 you had to put skill points in adaptability to have good rolls and increase your frames. But in 3 you can basically spam B or whatever is your rolling button and your in the clear. And what this leads to is hosts spam rolling away and drinking estus (did I mention everyone drinks estus at the same fast rate?) You can't really even punish them for doing so you try to finish them off with throwing knifes unless they are on a silver of health your gonna fail. try to snipe them with a bow nope he healed already when your charcter is still pulling the bowstring. Its just this over and over and for invasions its annoying cuz u have half of your orignal estus host has full usually. Even hackers can't get around it not staged at all but I met 1 didn't have time to leave I was a invader he had fast attacking hack on swung faster than normal I just roll spamed around him he didn't even hit me until I ran out of stamina and died:( oh and it looks like reporting is useless so all you can do is block the hacker and move on.Now weapon viabilty.. well there is no longer poise in 3 (at all) except for some weapon skills you could be wearing the very best poise gear yet your guy still flinches from dagger wielding hollows. And for some reason straightswords hit as hard as ultragreatswords but use less stamina so thats a thing now. Oh you want to be a magic user in low level pvp not gonna happen you see now in 3 you get ashen estus flasks that refill your Mp bar but for each ashen estus flask it takes one healing estus flask servely crippling you in summons since you have half your flasks anyway. So magic is basically dead especially since everyone is going melee now a days to have more healing flasks obviously. even if you level up one stat your always going to be lacking in another int? no stamina or health and with such lrg stamina costs and no rolling out of spells after a certain point your gonna get mobbed. Stamina? no health gets oneshot cuz your wearing light armor and you can't spare the points in vitality plus your spells are doing pethetic amounts of damage and you have no attunement so your having to refill your mp bar more and more with ur flasks. Magic is not even viable until around lvl70 threw 80ish your just spread to thin really. Weapon variablity In pvp in 3 is the lowest among all the dks games now iam not going to try and explain it anymore its explained better elsewhere on the internet than what Iam trying to tell you here tho I hope I gave you an ideaI recommend dks 2 over dks 3 but it looks like all the hype has left 2 and settled on 3 so overall if your a pvper your going to get burnt out rather quickly but if your just looking to play the game and maybe summon some help I recommend this there are always people willing to help you:)

Negative,"poor performance with GTX 970m even on low spec , bugs , DS1 is still better ..... wait for real patch next year..."
Negative,"I keep trying to find a reason to like this game. I really am. I keep saying ""I'm done with this game"" but then come back and find myself just saying ""this is boring"" and ""this is stupid"" the entire time I'm playing it.I've spent probably a good 1/4 of my time playing at least just wandering around trying to figure out where to go next. There's very little direction, and it's kind of like wandering around in a maze for a while and when you reach the exit there's no indication that you in fact did.The combat itself varies wildly in quality. Some enemies can be quite fun to fight. Often, though, it tends to turn into a boring slog through the same enemies you've killed a bunch of times before. The stamina system I really hate. While I can see why it's in the game, it feels more often than not as just an annoying mechanic that forces a break in the fight for no real reason, or prevents me from ever attacking without heavy punishment immediately following the attack. The normal enemies tend to range from ones easily killed in 1-2 attacks to enemies that take 30 seconds to kill, with 25 of those seconds rolling around avoiding their attacks. As for the bosses, I've only killed up to Abyss Watchers so far, so maybe and hopefully bosses get better and harder. But so far: there's Iudex Gundyr, who's the first boss and is supposed to be easy. Vordt of the Boreal Valley was actually a good boss, and easily my favorite so far. When learning this boss, I was actually having quite a lot of fun with this game. Curse Rotted Greatwood is just bad, with a model so big that if you're in melee range you can't see the attack animations, and the first phase involves playing whack-a-mole with a bunch of undead more than fighting the boss. And then the three bosses since then, Crystal Sage, Deacons of the Deep and Abyss Watchers have been dull and/or annoying but pathetic pushovers.As far as the story goes, I don't really have an opinion, mainly because there isn't a story. For the lore, I haven't looked into it that much, so if you're looking for something on that, I can't help you there.I was expecting more from a game that people will frequently call one of the best games they've ever played. Instead, what I got was a boring, generic action RPG with nothing but difficulty to its name.Oh, and if Nameless King were only his first phase, he'd probably be the single worst boss fight I've ever experienced in a video game, though his second phase salvages him from that."
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 is very similar to DS2. The main objective in the game is exactly the same. You do trash mob after trash mob, explore a bit until you eventually get to a boss. I am a little disappointed to be honest after doing that for 40hrs in both DS1 and 2 I have to say it was a bit boring doing all the trash mobs. Having said that they have done an excellent job in level design and I did get immersed into the game and played for long periods of time. The games port is ok just like DS2. If you play using a controller you will find the controls to be slick and smooth. You should avoid k+m as apparently they still can't get that right as the tutorial will still say things like press [Xbox b] to roll even if you're specifically using a k+m. The games art design is very nice and the monsters and bosses look scary and intimidating as ever. They've also done a great job on the soundtrack once again. Unfortunately, they haven't optimised the game very well. Playing on max and playing on low barely makes much difference to framerate so make sure you have a decent PC to run this game.Overall the bosses in this game were a bit hit and miss. The ones nearer the end of the game seemed to be better as they had better move sets and were more challenging. However, some of the bosses are sorry excuses for bosses. One of them especially is incredibly easy to dodge and you can literally kill in 5 hits. I felt a little disappointed again as the majority of bosses were done in just a few tries and no boss really gave me great trouble aside from maybe the ending one. I think they've made the roll more lenient as well, meaning you have a bigger timing window to dodge. Sometimes you can get away with a poorly timed roll by just spamming roll afterwards.So who should buy this game? If you're a hardcore DS fan then you've already bought it anyway. If you've played through DS2 and are looking for more of the same content then you should probably buy this. If you're new to DS and you're looking for a first game then I'd highly recommend DS1.Although an immersive experience and some enjoyable bosses, I'm going to thumbs down as it was just too much of the same as DS2."
Negative,this game is 2 fast 4 the human mind to compremend an i die in 2 hits to a night dude i cant block attack from1/10 its a game
Negative,PC port is horrible. Shows Xbox buttons instead of PC ones so you have to constantly go to options and check keybinds. The graphics options for PC are very limited. Would not recommend until these are fixed.
Negative,broke my controller
Negative,superbad co-op settings.
Negative,community mean glitch fun
Negative,"PVE vise its good but pvp wise its garbage. Poise system is retarded, everyone is using ugs gs etc as their weapon thanks to it. There is no build variety or something like that. Faith builds are a joke. If you want to have fun in pve buy it, if you want pvp this game is a fucking joke dont even bother."
Negative,"This game just doesn't feel like a souls game to me. I've tried three times now to get into this game and I can't. The combat is clunky and non responsive in a bad way with this one. Sometimes the delay between button press and what my character does on screen is over a FULL second. That is AWFUL. This one is a pass imo. If you want to play a Souls game, play Dark Souls 1&2, or Bloodborne on PS4. This game is a flat out pile and I wish I could refund. Really, really disappointed."

Negative,"New execution of poise system for a second game in a row has once again proven to be utterly pointless. Territorial invasion Covenants poorly executed: past level 50 I was never summoned as a watchdog with highest weapon upgrade of +4. Sequence Breaking in character quest lines is common and punishes the player for overlooking small details or progressing with no logical reason to back track and find strange quest points: Talked to seigward, then sent grey rat to irythll, grey rat died. Final boss is incredibly anti climactic without even a decent soundtrack like at least gwyn possessed in Dark Souls 1. Ironic since Dark Souls 3 CONSTANTLY kept using re used assets from the first two games and brought little to the table in its own manner. Poise system, for a second game in a row, is still a major flaw, rendering using Heavy armor and weaponry a logical fallacy. In conclusion, I'm glad the Dark Souls franchise is being put to rest. Just a shame its final mark was a second time disappointment."
Negative,Don't do it you will quit the game and hate your life. It asked me to revise this review so here is my revision. If you have a heart condition don't play this game. You will have a heart attack. It is a lot of fun with friends though.
Negative,"I have heard so much about the Dark Souls series and how good they were, so I finally decided to try it myself. This is horrible. All the controls, menus, and tutorial prompts are not listed in PC controls- they all show x-box buttons. But far worse than that, even once you know the controls, they are absolutely horrendous. Jumping doesn't work like it should. Locking onto an enemy, even when it is right in front of you, often simply fails to work. I have cast magic bolts at enemies standing directly in front of me just to watch it fly off to the side and down to the ground for no reason whatsoever. This game is not naturally ""hard"" like so many people claim. It is just so janky and poorly designed that you end up dying a lot."
Negative,i am just terrible at it i guess i cant even get passed the first area lol
Negative,Provides only brain cancer. I hate it.
Negative,Dark Souls 3: Attack Through Walls Edition
Negative,i played 150 hours on a character then when i hade to re-install this game my character lvl 200 where deleted and gone forever   150 hours on nothing
Negative,"I love dark souls 1 and 2. Have been play them several times already (and recently). And I expected to do the same for dark souls 3.But somehow, this game feel off to me. I don't ""click"" with this game like the previous game. It's a dark souls game with every bit of mechanic of the dark souls series. But the atmosphere, didn't quite feel the same to me."
Negative,"Was trying to enjoy the game without any major spoilers, but in going to certain areas before others it seems that I've missed out on a bunch of the game's content. I'd of prefered to have a near perfect run through on the first go, but it seems like that gone now, even though I was trying to explore everything and not miss things. Little bummed out :("
Negative,"I'm willing to bet it's a great game, but every single tooltip, hint, etc is designed for use with a controller, so good luck figuring it out with a keyboard and mouse.  It would be such a simple fix greatly expanding the accessability especially compared to the time and effort put into making the game.  As it is now though, I'm going to refund after slashing up the first skeleton.  WASD or bust in my world.  Fix it Bandai-Namco."
Negative,"this might be good if it wasn't hackjob console port trash. having a garbage control scheme and an unresolved camera bug that causes everything to spin whenever you're in combat might make the game challenging, but not fun."
Negative,"If you can't be bothered to include PC/Mouse controller tutorial, don't release your game on a platform dependant on it."
Negative,i am bad
Negative,"Controls are uter shit, Trash port from console"
Negative,Sucks with keyboard and mouse.
Negative,You can roll 13 times with meta level stamina and rolls have more invframes than in ds2 with 120 agility.Go figure.
Negative,fucking bring back the pvp servers or stop lying
Negative,"Bad pc port. Controller prompts from the get go and wonky acceleration. Don't buy it. If you must play it, play it on console."
Negative,Really fucking boring.  Only beat it to say I did.
Negative,"this game is just wth man seriously??? this game is so overrate all my friends r like holy crap thi s game so gooood. WELL NEWS FLASH BUDDY, ITS FRICKIN NOT! (maybe my copy is just bugged) but i just cant seem to get past the skeleton at the start????? R U FRICKIN SERIOUS BLIZZARD!??!!? is this the whole game??? just fight skeleton that is litcherally impossssilble to beat!!! frickin so gay the bosses are way too hard like the first skeleton boss when u first spawn into game!! in conclusion gay and frickin so dumb."
Negative,ever sense fromsoft brought the online services back the game has not worked
Negative,"-60 fps lock-Doesn't support ultrawide-Control hints and all prompts are in xbox controls, devs were to lazy to change them-Looks like assLaziest port I've ever seen."
Negative,"Well, I played it and finished it twice. Did I enjoy it? Nope. Overrated in every dimension. It is tolerable when you play the boss rush mod. Skip it and just listen to Vaati."
Negative,Non-consensual PVP in a punishing PVE game is bad game design.
Negative,i hate this game
Negative,This game fucking sucks I 100% it and now im deppressed pls send help dont buy this game it will make you sad pls help me.
Negative,I hate this game SO much.
Negative,Capped at 16:9 and 60 FPS?  Fail.
Negative,"Chunky controls, broken poise, almost every location in a base game is gray themed... Characters from previous games with no meaningful lore (at all). Broken finger animation (probably intended) ... Shields almost useless, unless you using fully upgraded great shield, and even then, block is nerfed so hard. Parry is very punished.Game force you to play aggressive, by whatever character build you using. Unstopable enemies attacks (in most cases), healing is way slow and extreamly punished. Daggers way too strong (DPS, critical hits).Sorcerer live (pyromancer, and so on) is extremely hard in this game. Base damage of spells without any buffs just terrible (same about buffs duration). Game force you to play like: ""one shot or be one shoted"" (mostly sorcerer).Game force you to play NG+, because of limited chunks - to get very last weapon upgrade.Game force you to play NG+, because of upgraded versions of rings (DLC break any sence in these rings).Game force you to play NG+, because of limited character's attribute reallocation.Game force you to play NG+, because there is no option to respawn favorite bosses, to fight them once again (unlike Dark Souls II).Armor cannot be upgraded, so your choice is buffs from spells and rings.Armor is more like cosmetic / fashion - since, poise not what it really is.Bleed (status alignment) - out of any meaningful bounds.Phantoms (also invaders) - lose their max health, healing is limited by half.Running cost almost no stamina - welcome to runners' race.DLC worth playing.Jolly-coperation, invasions, multiplayer.Birds at the top of Firelink shrine.Solaire of Astora full gear setup.Challenge.Mixed opinions, overall is not that bad, but also not that perfect as it could be for 3rd part of game series.Rating: 6.8 of 10."
Negative,Sky is piss colored
Negative,Big sword go brrrrrrrr
Negative,Covenants are the worst farm in any game ive ever played
Negative,"Unpolished console port that still uses controller button prompts, camera is jittery af and gives you motion sickness. This was a big waste of money"
Negative,Godly dlcs but base game is kinda mid
Negative,too hard for entry level
Negative,I should not need to configure my mouse buttons to this specific game just because the developers were too lazy to implement actual keybind functionality...  Same issue with Elden Ring.It's the principle of the thing.
Negative,"I loved Demon's souls, Dark Souls 1 and 2, and Bloodborne, and Dark Souls 3 is the most disappointed i have ever been in a video game."
Negative,Might be the worst game ive ever played
Negative,"Camera is a nightmare to deal with during combat. There are 6 frames of roll delay once the button has been released, making DS3 a somersault spam simulator instead of a game where reaction time in response to the enemy initiating an attack is important, because you are handicapped by 100ms. The boss game is hit and miss; when the camera is cooperating (maybe 3 boss fights in the entire game), the bosses are fun to fight. When the camera is NOT cooperating (almost every boss fight) its a nightmare to play as the camera readily enters into (or behind) solid objects and blocks all vision, and offers NO transparency, loses target lock constantly on bosses, many times seemingly randomly which frequently spins you around when that happens and places the boss behind you quite often when you had no intention of doing so.The fact that you have to constantly micromanage the camera so often during boss fights, to me, is inexcusable and indefensible, but I already know Fromsoft is given a 100% free pass on anything that could use QoL improvement by its fanatical and doting fan base, who most of which are too brain dead anyway to even notice the flaws to begin with."
Negative,this game is so ass. you kinda have to have a controller to play it since the ui is controller based and you cant change it
Negative,dude i fucking hate this game
Negative,"If you think dark souls are hard - skill issue. If you think dark souls are fun - i see you like running. Gave this game a lot of time to become interesting, seen 60% of locations, bested 8 bosses, only 1 was challenging and almost interesting. 99% of time i was running, just to reach the most underwhelming boss ever and continue running. Nice game design."
Negative,"Came from Elden Ring. Not into this at all. Controls were jerky. Like all games, the graphics have obviously not aged well. Not for me."
Negative,"After having properly finishing it, I say it's still the weakest in the series.Bloodborne did the fast boss gimmick better because most BB bosses were fast to keep up to speed with the player. They weren't fast just to be fast, whereas, many DS3 bosses are designed with the sole purpose of being fast and as such there is little substance. If you're the type of person who likes playing OSU and other reflex test games, you'll maybe like DS3, otherwise I think BB, DS1, and DS2 (even with it's flaws) are better games overall. Maybe the DLC is better than the main game (as with most From Games) but I simply did not enjoy this game enough to want to spend money on it. As for lore/story, it's all fanservice, and it sucked at that. You're going to take me to Lost Izalith/Demon Ruins and have no Capra Demons or Taurus Demons? But let's reuse the most uninteresting enemy from DS1, the fucking skeletons... I don't care what the lore says because that can be changed with a few sentences edited in a GDD. The only nice thing I can say about this game was Abyss Walkers was thematically a really cool fight, Aldrich was a really neat concept executed kind of poorly (also in a reused area, Anor Londo, even though the world has died and came back to life countless times, like, alright Michael Zaki) Dancer had a very unique and interesting move set (except the Ninjago spin is just pretentious, and trying so hard to be hard but it literally just requires you to spam roll or run away to a wall), and finding Firelink Shrine in the past was interesting, ig...Everything else I don't really have nothing nice to say about. The most fun part of the Nameless King fight was the actual dragon, the actual fight with him was overtly drawn out with a ridiculous health pool (same deal with Soul of Cinder) that made the fight feel like a slog even with his quick move set. The areas are boring with nothing real interesting except for the top of Lothric castle with the flying things and the Boreal Valley (seeing a screenshot of Iriythll is why I actually gave it another chance), but that was literally the only time in the game where there seems to be any care into the environment design, the 2 year development time really shone through in terms of environment. Archdragon Peak was a shameless copy of Sens Fortress but with none of the interesting parts, infact that was my least favorite area right behind the Catacombs.Overall, very few times where I can say I was actually having fun, so to make up for that I do CO-OP and that's always a blast in any FromSoft game."
Negative,not for me
Negative,i am not really a big fan of this game very braindead easy game a very good way to end off dark souls i dont know what to feel about this game
Negative,"Okay, so I am an older player and maybe slower reflexes, but, if I can't get by the second boss after several tries, learning the fight mechanics, using potions etc, then I shall not recommend this game to anyone!"
Negative,Game is very difficult. Takes the fun out of playing...
Negative,Aged like milk
Negative,The camera control is abyssmal. It should just let you control where you look instead of arresting control of your vantage point all the time. It makes you look in random directions all the time instead of simply facing the enemy. The fact this isn't mentioned much blows my mind.
Negative,"As someone who hasn't played Dark Souls 1 or 2 and wanted to give the Dark Souls a try, I really wanted to love it, but unfortunately I do not.From what I can tell, there isn't much of a storyline in the game. To me, it seems like a collection of random zones, mobs, and enemies. There's no clear sense of purpose, I have no idea where I'm going or why I'm going there. I also would have appreciated some background information about the areas I'm entering, the monsters and bosses I'm about to face, perhaps some strategic hints.There are no hints provided about the enemies you encounter, the character design doesn't necessarily indicate their attacks or attack patterns either. For example you mgith be fighting a skeleton swordman  expecting them to use their weapon, but instead, they perform an unexpected somersault attack for about 5 ticks of damage.  Similarly you might encounter a giant undead rabid dog beast on a bridge, and instead of attacks that inflict poison, infection, laceration, or bleed, it inexplicably shoots electricity from its mouth.It's clear that the game isn't designed for button mashing; it punishes you for mistimed actions by queuing them. Making an incorrect dodge timing results in taking a sword to the face, which is acceptable, but what I do not find acceptable is becoming staggered from the hit and then dodging (nothing) afterwards when already having tanked the blow.Frequently you will find yourself battling characters larger than your screen or multiple enemies that are outside your field of view, which is challenging in of itself. Mobs pouncing on you from outside of your field of view, ranged attacks hitting you from the back or the side. And the camera does not help. The camera that follows your character collides with the game world and since most fights happen in tight spaces and involve a lot of combat rolling, the camera frequently jerks back and forth between foreground objects and walls. To make matters worse, enemies or parts of enemies in the foreground sometimes become semi-transparent, causing them to seemingly materialize out of nowhere and fuck up your day.Speaking of combat rolling, it can lead to you getting stuck inside an enemy. When you're trapped in the middle of a enemy it doesn't matter if they telegraph an attack that should miss you, you will find yourself getting hit anyway because the animation doesn't accurately represent the attack's size.TL;DR:Right before I wrote this I spent 30-45 minutes in a cramped area fighting a giant dog. Every now and then getting stuck within the dog, having the camera zoom up into its ass, and having to read attack patterns based on the dog's cremasteric reflex because that was all I could see. Maybe you could call that a skill issue, but it might just also be that you're a bit too familiar with dog testicles, but frankly I've had enough of it."
Negative,e;den roikmh copy
Negative,worst dark souls game. but dragon boyfriends?
Negative,seriously not fun
Negative,as much as I want to enjoy it. the movement is way to chunky with double registering buttons and delay
Negative,Fucking game fucking sucks
Negative,skip this game the online does not work you are paying for 60$ worth of half a game dont do it this game is worth 20 bucks at most just get demon souls or elden ring or ... play code vein lol
Negative,"There are no proper tooltips for Mouse and Keyboard, so you will be frustrated off the bat. Then there are hidden stats (in a rogue-like game that's a bad thing) which determine how fast your character reacts to inputs. Thirdly, the game forgets what volume settings you've done, and constantly fights your sound card (Soundblaster XFi), if you have a dual monitors and you are watching a show, you have to choose between being deafened when you re-open the game, or never ever closing the game. These are all technical issues with the game, they could have been fixed if the developers cared, they didn't, so I am leaving a negative review. Other than that the game is pretty simple, dodge, block, or parry with precision (made difficult by the hidden stats), if you fail run back and gather up your souls, level up, and try again. Rinse and repeat until you get a rhythm going you meet an enemy with evolving combat style, fail, and then try to get lucky on a roll get behind the enemy and kill it. Bosses don't have huge health pools, feels like that, but 3-5 repetitions of dodge - attack - parry dance and you will have a boss down. The only frustrating thing is getting when the game purposefully throws you a curve ball to kill you like a dragon breathing fire and an obvious awning to shield from the fire, but the fire killing you anyway because wood has no collision with the fire. Run back, collect your skirt, shirt and purse, and try again. To summarize: No proper control hints for M&K, hidden stat values, level design meant to annoy you breaking the immersion and the rules set up by the game (attacks hitting barriers and objects), poor attempt at Diablo atmosphere translated to 3rd person from isometric. Poor support from the developer and it still has a $25 season pass."
Negative,"One of the worst games I have played in my life unironically. Boring gray levels that all blend into one another with not a single drop of colour and dogshit enemy design. Poise is there only in name so even hollows with daggers will stagger you even in full catarina gear and bosses that encourage hitting once and running away for 10 minutes because they recover from attacks before you come out of your dodge roll.Do not buy this game, absolute waste of money and I'm ashamed to have put so much time into it before giving up. It's genuinely appalling that this was the best Fromsoft could for the finale of their series."
Negative,"Online is down and will remain so indefinitely. The devs haven't communicated on the issue and refuse to show the slightest bit of pride in their flagship series, or at least in the pc ports of their series."
Negative,fix the servers wasited my money
Negative,"This stuff should have been named Roly Poly 3 – the 3D arcade rage game. While technically it’s an extremely sophisticated piece of software with amazing visuals, music, artwork etc. unlike other games of the genre like Witcher, Skyrim etc. the creators here do not care about making it enjoyable for a wide range of players. Everything in it is basically designed with some twisted sadistic intent to frustrate and humiliate. It can be addictive though as one gets  motivated in a desperate way by the amazing story line and artwork and wants to get further to see what comes next (just what happened to me) but the process of getting there offers little joy and a lot of annoyance and disappointment. The game is also broken or rather intentionally maldesigned  at its basic mechanics most noticeably armour is pretty much useless. This has probably to do with the creators’ vision that it must be played through a one style for all manner namely you have to keep rolling around on the ground like a circus monkey to dodge attacks and fight relying purely on reflexes which many players don’t have, timing by the millisecond and of course sheer luck. I mean I always preferred heavy knight characters in such games and that's what I went for in DS3 too but here, and I have tested, there is barely a difference between leaving your character naked or dressing it up in the heaviest of armours meaning you can look like a tank but even the weakest enemy will still be able to stab you to death with the lightest of weapons like a knife. And then there is the camera mechanics where if you get too close to a wall in a fight it all zooms in a way that you will lose sight what is going on and get slaughter.My advice, avoid this twisted nonsense and play with other games of the genre where the creators don’t design games for a narrow group of fanatic pros who have 12 hours a day to spend on playing video games and love nearly impossible challenges as a form of entertainment."
Negative,"horrible map design, and not really fun"
Negative,"too hard, not enuff health packs"
Negative,"I really, really want to like this game. In fact, it is a genius-level RPG, a masterpiece with a unique atmosphere, loads of content to find and explore, a steep difficulty worthy of a classic RPG, incredible build freedom... I could go on and on and on...But I just can't play the game and enjoy it, for a simple reason that has overshadowed every Souls-Game that I have played so far. And that is the abysmal, horrific, catastrophic camera and lock-on mechanics.If you play a melee build, I would advise to just ignore lock-on and then the painfully bad camera movements will only sometimes f**k you over completely and induce some justified rage. Then you can actually enjoy this game for what it is.If you do however, like myself, enjoy a good old spellcasting build, or you would love to be a marksman or any variation of a ranged build - save yourself. If you are not located in the top tenth percentile of withstanding gamer-rage, then just don't play the game in this fashion. 90% of my deaths in PvE with a sorcerer build stem from camera and lock-on issues, and this is not an exaggeration.- Why, in all hell, is locking on mapped to the same button as centering the camera, and why am I not allowed to change that? I can't tell you how often I wanted to lock on on an enemy, but can't, for some reason, and then my character just does a full 180, running in the opposite direction, inducing panic and then usually dying by a chasing enemy or falling down somewhere where you don't want to go. And it has been the same issue for 3 consecutive Dark Souls games that I have played. It's just mind-boggingly stupid and frustrating.- Why does the lock-on have a hard cap? Countless times I charge up a spell, then the enemy decides to move an innocent step to the back and boom - lock-on lost and my spell goes somewhere completely different.- Lock-on switching between targets is just... I can't explain it, but it feels super broken. Sometimes you switch to a completely different direction-facing enemy than you are aiming at, sometimes you can't switch lock-on even if the enemy is closer to you than the one you are targeting... it's just frustrating- Getting stuck in a corner by a bigger boss and the camera then bouncing around like a kid on crack - a true DS-classicAnd finally, I would LOVE to play as a caster without the stupid lock-on mechanics. But it's not possible, because FROM has decided for the third time in a row that giving ranged builds another option of actually aiming their stuff except the F*KING BINOCULARS would be heresy or something. Aiming in this game is just trial and error to a point that is unnerving.Sure, this game is hard. It is sometimes frustrating. It seems unfair, but it isn't, really. BUT. BUT. There is a difference between dying to a boss that you have to figure out first, and dying to STUPID CAMERA ISSUES THAT HAVE PLAGUED THIS SERIES FOR OVER 10 YEARS. I just can't bear it. Pros will say 'Git Gud' and 'Learn the Mechanics'. But i don't want to learn broken mechanics that an intern could fix in a working day if the developers just had the will to do it.tldr: Don't play this game if you want to use a ranged build or any variation of that. Aside from that, it's a great game."
Negative,This is just too hard to enjoy.
Negative,THE CONTROL CONFIG ON PC IS HARDER THEN PLAYING THIS GAME!!!!
Negative,43 min wasted on this shit game....
Negative,"Just sprint the whole time, boring"
Negative,"I've tried getting the game to work on my computer, but without a controller this is close to unplayable. With a controller it might be a fun game, but I'll never know."
Negative,"The Game is very amazing, but the problem is, my save file is corrupted for no fckng reason :'), & i don't want to play over through that hell again, i was tried everything (even in the thread from steamcommunity), & i think bandai wouldn't fix this since the problem is they didn't provide cloud save. But seriosly, this game was amazing & i was adicted to it. But now, all of that is gone... (Unfortunately i didn't have the time to start over)."
Negative,"Dark Souls III    Definitely a game that has potential, yet it was no use, had to stop playing it.    The controls (at least for PC) are to clunky (and mostly too slow).    The mechanics also are mediocre.   The graphics is definitely not 4k.   Heard so much about this game and then was so disappointed.    Truth is it is a yesteryear game.    Music was alright.   Would not recommend this game for a modern day player."
Negative,"A game that gets worse with time as you play more, you notice more flaws within the game. After the initial learning curve is met, the game becomes brain-dead. Wait. Attack. Dodge. Attack. Wait. Attack. This learning curve is totally negated when played co-op, as just about every enemy in the game is prone to being stunlocked and spam attacked to death. This is the same for any kind of PvP, especially in regards to invasions. The fact that just about every weapon in the game has a guaranteed two hit true combo, if you're hit once and a host has their companion(s) is close proximity you can kiss your ass goodbye. Some might say, ""Just parry"" or ""Dodge better!"" but this means little in regards to the games ability to grant an extra meter of length to another player's weapon when the connection is less than stellar. PvP suffers particularly bad, because of how Dark Souls rewards players who fight defensively, meaning the best tactic, more often that not, is to just wait for your opponent to whiff and then hit them during their recovery. This results in some of the most passive and cowardly gameplay I have ever witnessed in a video game. Just no willingness to engage in any sort of offense or aggression at all. All the weapons are pretty much copies of one another, with MINOR differences. ""Oh, this weapon is like this weapon except it has an thrusting heaving attack!"" Riveting. While there may be dozens of weapons to chose from in DS3, the simple truth is that there may as well be just a few dozen, as some weapons movesets are just clearly better than others. Don't be fooled by this game's marketing gimmick of ""Can you overcome this insurmountable challenge!?"" The challenge is quite surmountable. The only question is how many hours of your precious life do you want to waste getting good at Dah Hard Game, when you could be learning practical skills like how to fix a car door or carpentry."
Negative,Rambo the video game > Dark souls 3
Negative,This game sucks
Negative,GARBAGE ASS GAME WITH SCREEN TEARING
Negative,"Pros? It's Dark Souls. Cons? It's Dark Souls ***3***Bloodborne is a good game, they just shouldn't have had it inspired 3, and it really shows.It's not better than 2 and if you loved 1, you'll be quickly turned off by this one, buy on a deep sale, or just do that NG+9 run with some mods, Blood Souls 3 ain't it by a long-shot unless you're like me and just don't have anything else to do. Was alright."
Negative,"It's good but there's so much nonsense that makes me scream obscenities that I can't recommend it. Also there's only one real opportunity to sequence break, the characters are fairly bland, and the art assets are extremely repetitive."
Negative,"EDIT: I've played almost 300 hours, several different runs and I still kinda hate DS3 its not amazing but its definitely a peak in the souls series imo. Sekiro is great and arguably better but it plays by different rules so that's apples to oranges. Maybe my views will change when I try Elden RingThe very peak of the garbage pile any soulsborne game fromsoft has made is here. Imo, only good things about it is fashionsouls, some bosses can be fun but are usually gimmicks (looking at you Yhorm), and lastly the co-op can be fun if your friends dont mind suffering.Nameless King is still and always will be Fromsoft essentially firing their entire QA team to instead hire a group of monkeys for the job. Who the hell let this get released with visible camera issues, its like im playing an n64 game with how badly I gotta wrestle the thing in order to fight his first phase.I guess the most baffling question is why i have played 4 different runs, several NG+ iterations, and a total of 200+ hours of this shlock. I guess its a sort of comfortable piece of garbage?? but its also a kinda stockholme syndrome thing."
Negative,"1. PVP ""invasions"" are unavoidable in COOP.  So, if you want to COOP with a friend, then snother player such as ""noobslayer666"" can invade your game and kill you.   And, he gets in game rewards for doing so.2.  If you plan to play with mouse and keyboard on a PC then be aware that all the tutorials have ONLY controller key bind information. Using the key bind data from in-game options, I had to create a chart so when the game said controller key ""A"" , ""B"" etc. I could figure out what keyboard key corresponds to that action."
Negative,"By far the weakest Dark Souls game. It's a greatest hits album where the developers didn't just phone it in, they phoned it in on a bad connection from Antarctica.Replayed through the majority.The best word I have for it is ""tedious"". It's just tedious to play.  Hit a truly tedious, ridiculous part of the Ringed City DLC. It was tedious and absurd. The end boss isn't a fun fight, it's just tedious.Dark Souls 2 was better. Play that instead."
Negative,it's mediocre at best
Negative,"Borderline unplayable on keyboard, sure camera control is way better, but everything else just feels worse."
Negative,"If you liked the slow combat of the old dark souls don't look here. They want you to roll like a madman for any combat and to me, its just boring and dull"
Negative,boring as hell...maybe it's not my cup of tea
Negative,"Trash game too ez, i got too bored i gave my little sister and she spat on me the next when she speed ran the game in 1 hour"
Negative,This is loves point of Souls series.Form Software made PVP focus mechanics in single player game. Fast paste high DPS enemies Glas canon like. I can deal with that no problem but boss fights are the biggest BS. Why you make lazy design Humanoid boses withc are with multiple enemies at once. Every one showed that Darksous2 worst boss was Sentinel fight where 3 enemies attack at once. In Darksouls 3 most of boses are like that. Sad to see this game end like that. Lazy attempt to make game hard. Deamon; Sols Dark souls are master peace's. Sadly DS3 is only ok Game.
Negative,"If you have patience then this is the game for you! Its slow paced and hours upon hours of playtime of redoing the same thing over and over again expecting different results.  If you do get good at the game then its fine, but I would not recommend this game to anyone that is a casual gamer. This game is for people that have the aptitude for insanity.    Multiplayer is not functional and if you do manage to get it to work you have to deal with other players coming into your game and killing you for fun.  This is the worst game i have ever played and mind you the programmers that designed this game have little to no imagination.  Also use a controller it makes this game allot easier that is if you buy it. If your reading this don't buy it. Its hours of frustration and annoying do overs that are full of time wasting fun."
Negative,"I knew this game would be hard, I came into it knowing it would be hard, and when I got it I found that the difficulty is just lazy. ""Lets make this hard for the sake of being hard!"" Not to mention both the k+b and controller controls are shit.I like hard games, games such as getting over it with bennet fody and cuphead; but this is just shit. Why didn't I listen to Worth A Buy..."
Negative,This game was running smooth and was really fun starting out. About 2 days into the game I was getting constant screen tears and chinese lettering / wording spammed on my screen. I asked steam about the problem and to see if i could get a refund since I had a video of this. They didn't even address the issue and denied a refund for a broken game.
Negative,It's too hard so i no play it OwO
Negative,"Basically a re-skinned Blooborne (DS3 was more of a side-project of Fromsoftware) only they took out the fast player mechanics and kept the fast enemies making you much slower.Level-design is really,really linear and in areas there is 90% of the time nothing much to do. There are many bad bosses (Vordt, Crystal sage, Deacons, Wolnir, ponytiff, aldrich, ancient wyvren and Soul of Cinder (1st phase generic pvp and 2nd phase straight up the same as Gwyn. DLCs are only good for weapons and frankly this game could use 1-2 years extra development time. Only good thing is combat and pvp is a gank or stunlock fest.In conclusion another imperfect Souls game (DS1 was only half done, DS2 is not dark souls and DS3 is just bad)"
Negative,"as a stand alone game this is pretty okay but as a sequel to dark souls 2 I'm just annoyed with all the issues that came with this game that didn't exist back then. The progression in the realm of magic is kinda stagnant with how stretched out it is to get your first miracles that make any difference in the game with the first ones being 3 areas away from the begining of the game. I think the weapons are cool but DS2 did pvp much better. The hackers still existed in the peak of DS2 though which is besides the point. If you're getting into souls I'd suggest you start at DS2, play DS3 and then DS1. Kthx for coming to my tedtalk"
Negative,u forced me to do this fond
Negative,THE MOST FRUSTRATING GAME YOU WILL EVER PLAY
Negative,"I don't understand this game.  It's hard to follow where to go, and there's no in-game map to help you on your path to where you need to go.  The graphics are okay, but not what I expected."
Negative,"Awful controls, very little explanation, too difficult in the beginning. I suppose for new players it should have been made easier. It's just to annoying dying in the same place over and over again."
Negative,Midir is best boss. Pvp is dicks areas are dicks
Negative,"I CANT EVEN PASS THE FIRST PART,  TF IS THIS"
Negative,"I really love this game. But, damn I feel like I missed so much lore just because all hints are for controller. Developers simply too lazy to implement basic functionality into a PC port.If you prefer to play this game using mouse and keyboard then you'll definitely miss out on so many key elements that this game has to offer you.Not recommending just because developers were too lazy to give us proper tutorial with keyboard keys instead of only gamepad ones."
Negative,"Gotta say there was meant to be an honour system for invading but everyone is just dirty and if they do not play dirty they cheat, SO many cheaters in the game. Yet you can track their profile and see they claim to be godly players, gods are worth nothing if they are fakes."
Negative,It looks like it could be a great game but the control scheme was complete trash for both keyboard / mouse & controller. Having to wield two weapons with soft / hard attacks consumes all the top buttons on the controller & is extremely difficult to manage & doesn't feel smooth at all. Other buttons don't typically perform the functions you would expect & the auto lock system is terrible. Movement is unpolished & trying to use mouse / keyboard combo is worse.If you can get used to the control system it's probably worth playing but that completely ruined it for me.
Negative,"Bad game for people new to controllers. Inputs are slightly delayed, and you cannot cancel out of anything. Understanding a bosses moves is simply, but if you hit attack one extra time, you will be anally fucked and half of your health will be donated to the trash can. I'm going back to Terraria."
Negative,"The game frequently crashes for no apparent reason. I have to power cycle for it to not black screen on launch. I've employed tons of different fixes, which all work for a time but then stop working soon after. My PC has a 1070, a 6600k, 32gb of ram. There is no reason for the game to be this buggy."
Negative,"4/10+incredible visuals, story and boss design+better port than the first one-Overly complicated combat (its realtime but you have to memorise attacks patterns and plan ahead instead of reacting to attacks. No attacks or movements can be cancelled before they are complete. You just have to wait.)-Nearly unplayable on keyboard"
Negative,"Where do I begin.......After 500+ hrs of DS1 and some 200 hrs in DS2 , I'm completely dissapointed by DS3.Every single enemy can fuck you up in a second no matter your stats, level or gear.Blocking is joke cuz of the stamina damange.Strength weapons are a joke for PVE.Dex weapons are faster to somewhat stop your enemies in PVE , but the damage until late game is a joke.Enemies are lightning fast, very similar to Bloodborne, hwoever 1 issues, YOU'RE NOT!You're constantly being ganked by 3+ monsters even taking careful baby steps.FROMSOFT have put so many ambushes in this game and useless corpse items, I stopped picking up a lot of them jsut because of the obvious gank.PVP is a constant 5 man gank, all-out wrestle match, not fun at all with lagging.I'm not even late game yet, and I feel the game cheats all the time.The monsters have the following unfair advantages over you: * astronomical tracking with attacks* weird windups and attack patterns* EVERY monster has a fuck you up 1 shot combo that's easy to get hit by and you never expect the first time around*unlimited stamina*always being faster on the attack *Unlimited FP to cast spells*Second hits on attacks  and spells which seems to end ( something like a bullshit suprise)*ACTUAL POISE, which you' last had in DS1*Some monsters in latter parts of the game have an unreasnably high ealth pool*Toxic is much more common now, so stock up*item skills should have never been added, they screw up the flow of PVP immensely *The matchmaking system is a jokeAnd finally I will say - NO AMOUNT OF GITTIN GUD can fix the inbalanced mess that is DS3's PVE. PVP is actully somewhat of a saving grace purely because it's easy now, not taking forever to connect."
Negative,Pretty gas. Ruined by fandom
Negative,i hate this game
Negative,shit game shit controls shit combat system no explanations as to what the fuck your doing or where your going the list goes on if it was not a gift i would refund..
Negative,"This game doo doo, can't beat the first boss :("
Negative,Worst in the trilogy.You should buy the other two.
Negative,"I am penalized.Though i didn't cheat.At least I think I didn't. I wonder how this happened.If i'm given another chance to choose,i would NEVER buy games like this. I felt FRUSTRATED. And I just don't know why."
Negative,i bought this game on g2a because the devs refuse to change the controls in the message boxes to a PC keyboard :)  that's what happens when you're lazy
Negative,ATUALIZANDO A REVIEW DESSE JOGO MERD4Não compreNão gaste seu tempo jogandoMas porque?HACKERS EM TODO LUGARconexão merd4jogo sem anti-cheatO que houve pra tanto ódio?Eu abro o jogoFaço 3 invasões em locais diferentesE todas elas eu caio com hackers :D
Negative,"This game is a load of rubbish. With an abysmal character creator you can choose to look like one character or the same character. The ingame characters are uninteresting, the story is boring and the gameplay is non-existent."
Negative,Kind of meh.
Negative,This game is shit
Negative,It's only difficult because the PC port and controls are terrible.
Negative,"updated reviewthe game has some quality elements to it so here are the pros:- level design- cool weapons and armor sets- varied environments- different types of enemies with different attacks and gimmicks- cool looking bossescons:- the fun of exploration is hindered by some hard enemies- many bosses have so long combos making winning fights depending on patience and not skill- many unexplained stats and questlines if you can even call it that- you will miss some good NPCS in the game if you didn't use guides, the ability to interact with some of them is not clear enough, like pickle pee for example- no keyboard prompts- no pausing while playing offlinei didn't find it fun, if you like it then good for you, buy 10 copies i don't care."
Negative,Runs like a shower of shit on PC.
Negative,Hackers and connection based problems will ruin your experience. Don't bother.
Negative,Play control on this game fucking sucks.
Negative,"Controls are poor really bad, its like a console made copy for pc its sucks!play's slow not my game ."
Negative,"It's an alright game but the lack of a way to deal with griefers while playing with friends beyond git gud scrub kinda kills it. I'll be playing the whole way through because I do like the story and the atmosphere, but unless you enjoy contending with lag hackers and people who give themselves high-level items with new, lower-level characters for the sake of hunting down newbies, spend your money on something else."
Negative,"Really wish I could give this a positive review, really wish I could actually play it, however if you do not have a xbox or ps controler, do not bother playing this, the menus, tutorial, combat, all made for the controller, they didnt even bother to change the tutorial to have keyboard and mouse controls instead of xbox, and moving through menus is a joke."
Negative,"Gameplay is nice, Difficulty is high, Story is lackluster"
Negative,You lack the license for this review.
Negative,Farming Proofs of concord kept for 10 hours.10/10
Negative,clunk die clunk die clunk zzzzzzzzzzzz
Negative,"+ Awsome game totally recommend it- No steam cloud save, lost all my progress...."
Negative,Still not v1.06. Crashes every 5 steps...
Negative,"- Gets game for $79.99 with season pass- Plays for 10 hours, beats game- Does summons and wants to play through it again- Gets banned for cheating- writes angry email to namico- Gets email back(sorry but you have been banned for cheating we have checked your account though and though and you have been banned for the fallowing, Cheating/Hacking, that is all)- Throws Keyboard- Finds Trainer online, Cheats this time- Gets unbanned for mistake- Overall Banned/Cheating"
Negative,"I cannot enjoy this game, the prompts are all for an Xbox controller, some of the moves you can do ie. kick aren't in the key bindings but are in tips that you read as you go (so it doesn't actually tell you what to do on keyboard and mouse). I don't have the patience to figure this shit out.Getting a refund."
Negative,"The difficulty curve is fair for the first time in the history of this series, until you get to the snowy area and fight a nigh-impossible boss. It's a shame that the developers took so much effort on this game when they apparently don't want you to progress. It's a waste."
Negative,"I had written a large review about why I didn't recommend the game, but Steam ate the review, so I'll make it short.Game is similar to Dark Souls 1 and 2, if you liked those games then you'll like this one. Problem is the game has bugs that a large amount (including myself) are experiencing. The list I've experienced: Ambient/background audio cutting out and instantly resetting when rotating the camera/inspecting your inventory/interacting with objects, which ruins immersion. FPS drops in many areas, which makes the game even harder to play when you cannot react to enemies. Not even able to start the game, and crashing in random areas. Until these bugs are fixed, I will hold off on playing the game. I have no desire to play as long as FPS drops and crashing is common. I knew Dark Souls was hard, but I didn't know it was hard because it wanted you to play at 10 FPS!"
Negative,I have been having troble with the fps still any one know any  way to fix it.
Negative,"Terrible PC port, extremely boring game, HORRIBLE PC controls, etc. The best way to play this is to mute the game and play a podcast or music in the background. The game will get old very quickly."
Negative,Good Game if you're highly autistic and enjoy dying and repeating your progress over and over again otherwise it's a good game to get mad enough to punch a hole through your monitor.3/10
Negative,i get band for no reason
Negative,litteraly just because people who have boss armor weapons etc and kill you as soon as your go to the first multiplayer bonfire
Negative,"doesnt work. you read some stuff on the floor, kill enemies with one shot. then some how youre supposed to defeat something the kills you instantly. also melee is for homosexuals. end."
Negative,"The game is only hard if you severely handicap/cripple yourself. Combat is shallow with only a few different attacks, PVP is too easy and predictable unless you're facing a laggy opponent or a cheater. Very little skill involved in the combat overall since there's no animation cancelling, swiping, feinting or slipstreaming, and stamina regenerate too quickly. Don't buy this unless you are a casual gamer/weeb who plays RPG's for the story/lore."
Negative,"So, if you choose to play this game multiplayer - don't do it! I'm a huge gaming nerd and my friends and I were never able to join a game together (that was 1/2 the reason I purchased it).  We spent about 2 hours trying to link up so I was over the game play limit was denied for a refund.  SIngle player - go for it! Multiplayer? NO WAY!!!"
Negative,"The game story and bosses are great however I'm gonna give a negative for following reasons:-There is a bug when you invade, host or phantoms will be just floating in a T-pose without animation so you can't see if they're attacking or rolling and they take no damage. It is seriously game breaking in terms of pvp and it happens a lot. This also occurs during co-op play with phantoms and will completely remove any challenge from boss fights since phantoms just murder the boss without taking any damage.-Cross Region Matchmaking options don't even work. You'll get matched with people all over the world even though you have it turned off. Enjoy the lag.-Some weapons are retardedly unbalanced : Dark Sword, Estoc -Invasions are completely ruined, You get a HP penalty when you invade and often fight 3-4 people who just run at you and mash R1.-Walls and areas in game have broken collision, mobs can hit you through walls in most zones.-Poise mechanic is completely broken and you'll lose most of the time if you have a slower weapon without hyper armor. Heavy armor is completely useless.-You can get backstabbed in the middle of a jumping attack animation. -Recovery time after drinking estus is pretty much none so people just run around and chug estus without getting punished.-Some weapons have ridiculous phantom range.Besides these issues game is better than other dark souls games, however don't expect a great Online experience because T-pose bug is fucked up and there are no news of any fix. Fuck Fromsoft"
Negative,co-op is bullshit .its hard as fuckkkkkkkkkk
Negative,I hate myself and i hate this game
Negative,"I hate this game. I gave it a try, I really did. But I just can't.Mid attack and accidentally (or purposely) hit to dodge or drink your estus flask? Good luck because now you're going to do it the moment your attack animation ends. It got you killed? Too bad, that's just how the game is designed.I won't lie, for a game that I enjoy watching people play so much, it is not at all fun to play it myself. It's not an issue of skill, even. Enemies range from attacking lightning fast to attacking ridiculously slow, so an attack that would be dodged typically may not be dodged, because the enemy actually telegraphed the attack massively and made a fool out of you.If you enjoy hating your life, definitely get this game. It's unlike anything else I've ever played, and all the difficulty feels like it is solely because of AWFUL game design. I don't care if I hit the button 20 times, it shouldn't execute the instant I'm out of doing a different thing just because you think queuing up my inputs was a bright idea. Ask anyone else, and they'll likely complain about the horrendous in-game camera or maybe even the fact there's not any explanation for MOUSE AND KEYBOARD on a Steam game. Better get your controller ready to use because otherwise you're going to be randomly pushing buttons trying to figure out what to do.I'm writing this review after my second time attempting this game, because I waited long enough for the memory of how awful this game is to lapse. Hopefully next time I'll see this review and not reinstall it."
Negative,dark souls 1 men det e drit
Negative,"This game could easily be a 9/10.But first there is all the console game retarded-ness you have to content with. It's like we made zero progress since Metal Gear Solid 1. That alone would still not be that bad and as long as you play alone in offline mode, you can get used to it.Wwhat really drives this into ""screw you"" territory for me is the Multiplayer Invade Mechanic. It's just broken as all hell. Basically people make a sport out of abusing laggy netcode and retarded game mechanics like ""Hide behind Enemies that only aggro on the other guy"" or ""wait for an unsuspecting player to run into an NPC ambush and then backstab them"". Not sure why people do this. It's probably the same reason some people get off on cheating or writing Viruses. Whatever. If you want to play with a friend you have to content with constantly being interrupted by 15 year old console kiddies and forced into ""pvp"", which for those of us who actually play good PC pvp games is just a joke."
Negative,"Broken on release, do not touch for another month or two. PvP is broken, developers fail to communicate with anyone (even to Japanese players), patches have random effects and the community is still faster at solving these problems than people who are paid to. Stick with Scholar of the First Sin. It has superior:FramerateOnline play regarding covenantsDiversity of viable WeaponrySpells and Miracles are useful in PvP/PvEIncludes best iteration of Poise thus far (look up 'working as intended' for DS3 if you need further info)Less gankersBetter netcodeBetter connection (How DS3 does not eludes me, but there it is)Again, do not touch, not until these issues are resolved. They don't deserve your money.Update:Nothing has changed after about 8 months. Patches have been rolled out to address glitches and bugs, weapon diversity has been lightly touched in patches, but the emphasis is still not on online play. Only good for PvE, PvP has been done better elsewhere."
Negative,This game is a waste of time.
Negative,"I am writing this review for people who are new to the game and use a keyboard (as opposed to a game controller).  Don't buy this game.  It's way too hard.  In the first 5 minutes you meet a boss that is very hard to kill.  I tried over and over for 30 minutes, and could not kill him.  So, I could never proceed with the game.  It's really all about dodging and jumping and has very little to do with RPG.  I'm sure people who are good at that stuff love the game, but if you aren't very skilled at Play Station 4 type mechanics (or don't want that to be the focus of your gaming experience) then don't buy this game."
Negative,"Doesn't work, don't know if its because of Zen 2 is so new and a bit buggy or the game is just horribly done on PC crashes after about 5-10 mins of gameplay"
Negative,this game is amazing but i suck at it so it sucks.
Negative,Poise doesn't work apparently it's a feature.Don't bother the won't fix there game.
Negative,"This game recommand gtx 970 and my 1070 just run as 39 FPS, Good job for a action game."
Negative,Japanese PC Game Development was a mistake.Single White Female Simulator 2k14 had a better PC release and that game was made by the shitty B-Team headed by Japan Lies
Negative,game is too hard
Negative,"The game looks good and I so wish I could play it but unfortunately the controls and the camera are completely  broken, even with an Xbox controller, (forget playing with mouse and keyboard). It's a direct port from console but with very little effort from the makers of the game.  A missed opportunity for the publisher (mustn't need the money!)."
Negative,"A disappointment.The third game in the series, so it's expected you to have played the previous titles.It doesn't care much for the second, but still has a few references to the game. And then they just fill it with a crap ton of camoes. Characters from previous games are fine, but they need a reason to be here in the first place. They kind of just show up to appease the fans. * It's the shortest and most linear of the titles. I beat it about 30 hours. The first game I beat in about 60hrs, the 2nd about 50-70. * They give you so much crap early on it's disgusting. And it's not just weapons either, I'm talking about core items in the series. You want that red orb? It's really easy to get. In the first game you had to beat bosses out of order to get that. If you wanted to invade people endlessly you had to EARN it, here's basically given freely.* Covenants don't matter. What I mean is, covenant LOYALTY doesn't matter. You can swap covenants with 0 penalties and in 0 time, it's as easy as changing a pair of rings, literally. One moment you're a sun bro, the next you're a ganking shit head, and the very next minute you're ganking other gankers because you're suddenly a blue sentinel. That is silly and shouldn't be a thing. * The lore might as well not exist. It takes a back seat to all the fan pandering. You liked Andor Londo? Here you go, you can go back! Why? No real reason other than a boss fight. * The emotional rollercoaster is slow with only 1 or 2 uphills. You know those moments where you just got done fighting a really hard boss, and then are greated with an AMAZING chest (of loot of course) or perhaps a gorgeous view? That almost never happens, and the one time it does you have to go back track for an item to actually enter said area because the game has no real sense of direction. In Ds1 you were told what you had to do, go ring 2 bells, go to Andor Londo, now go kill 4 bosses. Here's it's just go kill 4 lords, and how you get about doing that is up to you.* Bonfire placement is dumb. Close to the end of the game there were 2 bonfires within eyesight of one another. * Lore doesn't exist, or if it does they don't talk about it. It's like the apocalypse had an apocalypse. In Ds1 and Ds2 you could piece together at least MOST of what happens. Usually amounting to a King or someone screwing up. Here... it's just Dark Souls 1 if Dark Souls 1's new-game plus had additional story. From what I can gather it's all about continuing the cycle of relighting the fire, over and over again. It's feels really lazy. Dark Souls 2 was about breaking the cycle, here it's all about... doing it again... for some reason?* It's also buggy here and there. I've had a few bosses become near impossible to beat because they clipped through the wall, I shit you not.* Poise doesn't exist and so many enemies and bosses just love you combo lock you to death. * They buffed invaders by allowing them to heal. WHY?! They hide behind enemies and just ruin your day. They are cheap and they know it. ""Lol git gud"" you may say, when you should be telling that to the pussy hiding behind 5 instakill enemies. Despite that and much more I could rag on about, it's still Dark Souls at it's core. Mostly the same mechanics, bosses you will have to memorize on how to beat, lots of loot (and holy shit they spoil you with weapon upgrade materials). Is it worth playing? If you have a hard on for Dark Souls sure, but otherwise pass on it. Your $60 are better spent somewhere else."
Negative,elden ring is cheaper
Negative,Bad port of a mediocre game.
Negative,"Zero customer support and if you go the extra mile and send them an email they will say (Sorry we only can check if your Steam account have ban placed on it or not, we can't do jack sh!t to you) 10/10 customer feedback = toilet paper to them because they will see it and then throw it.Online is not accessible anymore on my main account (different account with different character works fine). Ignoring the customers as always and fix whatever they want to fix. Give us sh!t advice on Online while the community solve their mess ups.If I realized that swapping my character from one account to the another and then return it would solve my online problem I would have done it. Sadly I can't do it now because of the new update (Update 1.05 Regulation 1.08 FULL Patch) that prevent players from doing it. DON'T buy it on full price since the online have a chance of failing on you. Single player, is good where you have small glitches here and there but Online have a good chance of making you feel the offline mode is on. Buy ONLY on sale if you must get this game from this SH*t company and expect a Zero customer support because anyone tells you anything else is a Liar.And I now wait for the most crazy and irrational fans to down vote this to the ground. After all, they are known for sending threat msgs to people who gave honest review to this series sh!tty ports on PC. Go and ask TotalBiscuit why he doesn't cover this abomination port of a game on PC.*RIP*Edit: on 25th of June the online worked without me doing anything. So the problem was from the Stupid @ss Devs but they won't admit to anything. I almost finished the game and they just turned on the online, Fantastic. Also, who knows when the Next Online Blackout might happen. I see it a lot, people saying it come and goes(summoning Signs). Buy on Sale only, the Devs need to learn just like WB learned with their Batman's last game when all refunded their Sh!t."
Negative,"Doesn't accommodate to enough players for it to have a place at the table, but it's a fun time waster if you kind of hate yourself. 3/5"
Negative,Me: Any tips?Everyone: Git Gud
Negative,"fanservice, lagless rolling, walking estus, gimmick bossesbasically reddit dark souls"
Negative,Not Enough Soul point's to get every thing... Not only that not allowed to get every thing. :( Collecter's won't like this game. I'm a collecter and I would love to have all weapon's and try to make a max mixed CAC in game. but they don't want us too.
Negative,"Still no 4k support.  I play in a window at 2048 resolution, which makes this game feel like one of my emulated games.  I don’t expect this kind of problem to happen with a fairly new game either.  It is annoying that I can’t experience this in my native resolution years after the release, which is why I gave the pc port a thumb down.The game itself is very well done compared to the other dark souls games I have played.  The mechanics are better and all the movements are more fluid.  I like the twist on the spells not being limited to numbered uses too.  It could be playing more of the series, but I was introduced more to unique fighting styles in this game as well.One major downside to this game is there is a lot of revisiting places, or levels, with not much change in scenery.  I prefer the first and second game for the change of scenery in the progression of the game.  This makes the game seem shorter than the others as well.  This also results in enemies being recycled throughout the game, with changes to the difficulty.  DS2, and DS1, had a lot of variation when it came to enemies compared to this one.Overall this game is a good improvement on the game engine and mechanics, yet there are some setbacks.  Progression through the story seems a little repetitive with the same enemies and scenery being recycled.  The lack of 4k support still baffles me, as DS1 and 2 support it just fine."
Negative,"Worst game in the series:- Cheap tactics.- Enemy tracks player movement so precise it feels just dumb.- Speed of the enemy is closer to Bloodborne but game lacks 'rally' combat mechanic to compensate it.- Enemies with unlimited respawn (dlc, not skeletons).- Artificial difficulty without creativity.- Scripted ambushes and events that take away player freedom from previous entries.- Worst netcode for pvp.- Lets not even start on poise.The only game in the series i didn't finish completely - it is not as interesting as DS 1, 2 and BB.Maybe it is for the best that From closed this franchise - if that is how they would develop it farther."
Negative,"So this game is the first time steam review ratings trapped me. This is seriously the worst console port ive ever seen. Apparently you are supposed to play with 60 fps - or even with 30 fps because else you will get severe glitches - wtf?60 fps feels like a fucking lagfest when you are used to 100+ fps.Next issue : Mouse sensitivity. So i've set the mouse sensitivity to ""0"" and  the camera still moves at hyperspeed. You can ""fix"" this by downloading some external mods. Go on, if you want to waste your time some more. So you play with keyboard and mouse? This game doesnt care, who the fuck needs a keyboard tutorial?You better like Youtube videos and reddit posts to even make this game playable on PC - For me : instant refund"
Negative,"I was excited to play a game people say is hard. Everyone says the gameplay is fantastic, but I wouldn't know...KB/M controls are horribly horribly horrible and prompts are all for controllers. Did they even try? Whats this the forums/reviews say? Get a controller? F*** you! I'm on a PC, the standard interface is KB/M, where it should be expected that is how people play! Don't port it if the controls for KB/M are gonna suck this bad. If I wanted to play this with a controller I'd have bought it for console. This day and age a port with this bad of KB/M control and support is unacceptable.Good thing I got it cheap."
Negative,"its too hard, why would you make a game this hard for no reason. very poor game design"
Negative,this game is broken as hell; just after the first bonfire the game crashes.will it be the next batman?
Negative,Games kinda hard...can't recommend...
Negative,"Telling me ""Unable to connect to Dark Soul 3 server"" since I opened the game for the first time, searched and tried every possible solution online and didn't work, seems like the official doesn't even care about those ""small problems"" that occurs randomly among users, really frustrating."
Negative,"I bought  this game on sale, only to find out that there's no sound except for the cinematic opening. i've yet to find a solution for this problem. would not recommend buying it until they fix this problem. dark souls isn't the same without its amazing boss music."
Negative,"Horribly optimized, constant frame drops, trail and error traps, artifical difficulty is everywhere. Trail and error =/= Difficult"
Negative,Not optimized to be played without controller. Ridiculous console game port to PC.
Negative,Everything wants to kill u. One way or another...Everything....
Negative,how do i pass the very first boss?? ;(((((
Negative,They put a full powered boss enemy in the tutorial. I've been playing for nearly 10 hours and this boss is next to impossible. So I'm stuck 5 minutes of game time in. You can't farm souls and level up before this boss. You can't find new gear before you fight this boss. If this sounds like fun to you then go for it. I loved the dark souls 1 remaster. I can't get the combat down in this game. Not worth the effort thus far.
Negative,"Requires controller - keyboard and mouse is just not fun.  I'm not a fan of controllers, and all help hints are in xbox controller language.If this game supported KBM more, I would re-purchase.  Until then, I simply cannot recommend for my fellow KBM users."
Negative,"First of all, this was the last game I played in the order of Elden Ring, DS1, DS2, DS3 to get all games 100%.What was portrayed as the best of the sequence (with or without Elden Ring) and the high expectations I must admit it created because of it, resulted in me being terribly let down. I've split up the good and bad things about DS3 and tried to sort the critics aswell.Start positive:It did have some hard bosses, think of Nameless King and Midir as examples.Nice looking gear and weapons.The areas that aren't copied, or based of previous games have nice visuals.Now the bad things in DS3:1. The bad things about the difficulty in bosses was that the hard ones are all optional.2. The covenant grinds for spells/ring/100% are ridiculous. My safe file was 54 hours for 100% and 34 hours of that were pointless grinding sessions for the covenant specific items. Bare in mind I was able to do 2 covenants online so it would be even more painful if you decide to do them all 'offline'.3. The combat at first seemed to have improved from the homing DS2 system, but this was made worse for me if looking at the following:-A lot of regular enemies and bosses, have seperate attacks, but they are in fact stringed together when you can tell it's not ment to be that way. This created a lot of massive hits or even one shot kills. In these attacks, you could be smashing your roll but not get away from the 'second' attack.-Most bosses (most main bosses) have attacks that have been proven are too quick for the human eye to respond to.-Back stabs seem the worst out of the entire series. In the three runs you need to do for 100% I would estimate my backstabs to be around 20 in the entire game. So my recommendation is to not bother with them.- Poise registration. Don't count on stunning any enemies, this results in a lot of hack & slashing which is not the skill a game should ask for.4. Mimic chests, especially at the start, you become overwhelmed by the amount of mimic chests you find. Only in later stages it becomes more regular for the chests to not be a mimic.5. The starting area ( Firelink ) being seperated of from the whole main area seems so dull and not original. Taking examples from DS1 and DS2 how intricate the links were from the main area this is a huge step backwards.6. Small textures bugs.7. The enemies sometimes transform in these weird dark mutations, that seem not needed. Like why am I killing a massive dragon by killing a small mutant at its foot.8. DLC seems to be rushed in, because after killing the main bosses, you just have a sequence of 4 bonfires that just insta teleport you to an other DLC area.Conclusion: I would only recommend this game if you aren't too attached to how good DS1, DS2 and Elden Ring are because it drops in quality. I felt I had too do it because it would make the list of all four games 100% complete, and if I started with DS3 I don't think I would have ever finished it."
Negative,"It's a definitive maybe. I say no, because I think it's heavily flawed (in my opinion) in it's overall design, and way overhyped.I would recommend the game, if you like old-school games, that have difficult controls, and don't tell you at all, what you are supposed to do, and how the game works. If you plan on spending less than 200 hours in any Dark Souls, don't buy it.I'm playing the game with mods, since I don't like some of the vanilla aspects. I've played Demon Souls, and the first two Dark Souls without mods though, so I know how the game plays without mods.There already is said more than enough about what Dark Souls does right. Here my few cents about what it does wrong.The game is not difficult, it's tediousA lot of people say, that Dark Souls is a difficult game, which I don't really think. You will need a few tries per boss, but the bosses are mechanically not that complex. The difficult part in Dark Souls is, that every mistake will cost a couple of minutes. You will usually do really well on your first try, then do poorly on the next couple of tries, since you try to rush to the boss, and then you finally defeat the boss. A lot of bosses can actually be defeated easily on the first try, once you understand how dodges work. You don't need to actually evade any attack, you just need to press roll in the right moment, since it makes you invincable for (I think) 1/4 second, and you can just roll right into the attacks. Took me 3 games to realize that. Blocking is actually much more difficult than dodging, therefore you should definetively start with a dodge character.In my opinion, the game would defenively be better, if there were bonfires before bosses. The travel from the bonfire to the boss after your initial run is not hard, as you won't be fighting any enemies. In Dark Souls 3 especially, you can see that the levels are designed in a way, to enable you to run past every enemy. It will just take you a minute or to per attempt, in order to break your rythm.The RPG element is badYou can't say it any other way. You will mess up your first character, if you don't use a guide. The ingame menu explain very little about what you actually gain, and you won't know which weapons require which skills. You can fix that either by spending lots of time farming souls to get the attributes you actually need, or by restarting.As in any other game: you should be able to respec. No respec does not make a game more difficult, it just forces new players into standard builds, especially if you can mess up. It's basically just a way to gatekeep people, who don't have the time or motivation to play a game several times.Edit:If you want a difficult game, with enemies that are balanced against the player, get Sekiro. The fights are much more difficult, especially the boss fights. Still, Sekiro seems much more fair in it's difficulty, as the fights are more about perfrect timing than about waiting, like in DS."

Negative,"WHY did I just spend $60 bucks for a game on PC that tells me ""A"" and ""B"" buttons plus ""L3"" ""R1"" etc....? Not sure if it's a Dark Souls problem or Steam related issue but seriously? I can't even open the main menu in game to see key bindings, or to even close the game for that matter.. I had to use the Task Manager to do so.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone on PC until the issue is fixed, unless you have a controller"
Negative,"I'll change this to a positive when From Software learns to port games. This crap is inexcusable considering the uncounted millions the PC sales earn them.On the other hand, this is a decently made game, but lacks the charm of DS1, while keeping all the clunk and adding to it... It is bloated with feature-creep all around the place, never removed anything, just added since releasing the first game.The music however is on a whole different level, one of the greatest I've heard in games.While DS1 made me want to play all From Software games, DS3 made me vow never to touch them again. It's a chore to play, a mess to learn (wrong button hints, unresponsive mouse & keyboard controls, extremely annoying glitches) and overall not a great experience, except for some rare occasions.Maybe if they do a half-decent port, I'll reconsider, but other studios are catching up to the formula. Studios that can actually design games that play well both on PC and console."
Negative,"worst game i've payed for on steam.in short, good graphics but very bad controls. i played it for 10 min and got bored from it, even fustraded by the controls.it took me less time to decide about deleting the game from my list then to decide to buy it."
Negative,"It's extremely difficult to give a positive review to a game that gives it's players such an incredibly difficult time progressing past the first tutorial area.  I wouldn't consider myself a novice or casual gamer by any means, but I still can't get passed the first boss, and that's just a little ridiculous.  3 hours of attempting this has left a sour taste in my mouth, so no, I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who doesn't love repetitive, aggravating attempts for small rewards."
Negative,"Just not for me.Been pressured to play this game for a long time. Going into the game I just didn't enjoy it, the intro phase where you fight the first boss I was just incredibly bored through it and continuing past the first stage I was never really pulled into the world or the gameplay. I'm sure a lot of people like this game but its just not my vibe."
Negative,Don't do this to yourself.You will regret it.
Negative,It's just really bad
Negative,do not buys this game unless you hate your self.
Negative,"The game's good, but I'm angry that one of my saves glitched on NG+ rending that playthrough broken and unprogressible."
Negative,"Dont buy, waste of money, the game is boring, you keep dying, no fun at all , after death spawn system sucks, the game is for consols only, so you keep getting X, C  or that evey instead of the keyboard"
Negative,terrible pc port they dont even bother changing the icons from the xbox to pc icons very hard to begin playing and understanding controls navigating the menu is torture
Negative,Games easy already
Negative,"Absolute failure, annoying and frustrating enemies with random extremely quick attacks to create fake difficulty, oversaturated graphics which make it difficult to spot anything, completely broken lock on which worked perfect in Dark Souls 2, again unclear and unintuitive interface which again was perfect in Dark Souls 2. They clearly tried so hard to make a fake difficulty in this game and they succeeded but there is no pleasure in playing. I don't like when companies take a leap back, it's a third game in a series and it shows no evolution or progress. It's better to stick to Dark Souls 2, felt like that one was made with passion, originality and fresh ideas, this one is just a lazy, boring cash grab."
Negative,"Here are details i have gathered about ds3:-Has mild PvP system with a variety of hardcore players who wanna to be, the the very best, like no one ever was.-Weapons have somewhat interesting attack moves.-Hackers exist, but you are more likely to crash than to meet a hacker.-Plenty of armor sets but mix matching is pointless unless you plan to hyper armor with an ultra GS.-Community is cancerous and more concerned with invasions, grammar, forum salt, than actual gameplay or game improvement.-Season pass is probably going to be a $20 lore addition with a dull reminder that the only ds3 gameplay is PvP.-female armor is limited to literally 2 sets, 4 if you count the armorless style and hollowing, assuming you care for the basic atrocious female mesh.-coop is just like the previous games. whether you find your friends sign or not, you will be invaded.-gankers sit around using fingers and summon purples for the sole purpose of slaughtering the helpless duelist. -searching for the ancient stone shield is about the only thing i would call farming in this game.-bugs glitches patches galore!-fixes, tweaks, updates, and news is as vague as giving you freight, but you can only unload, handle, and sign for while blindfolded, which is ok if your freight weighs nothing and has no damage.-patches dindu nuffinthere is no middle option but i honestly think that this game wasnt worth full price and probably never will be."
Negative,don't buy dark sous 3 or dark souls 2sotfs on pc they suck! both have bad fps performance issues. if you feel like replaying the dark souls series just play on console.
Negative,It's the lack of compassion and understanding for the unfortunate that made you choose to not include a difficulty option.
Negative,bad optimization? idk im getting fps drops every 5 seconds or so and the specs arent problem
Negative,"If you're using a controller, you're good to go. If you're using keyboard and mouse...good luck!(This is a port from console to PC.)"
Negative,elden ring copy
Negative,sorry my sibling said its awful and you shouldnt play it
Negative,"Honestly, just go play DS2 or Bloodbourne. This game honestly is just not fun. Instead of making interesting fights, it's just ""Oh look, another gank squad of enemies, oh am I being invaded? Awesome, time for hitreg to be absolutely busted as I get destroyed by a dude who has end-game equipment. Fun."" Maps are bland, enemies are bland, it's bland and the combat is fun up until it decides to throw 5 enemies that impale you at once, followed by another 3-4 that if you run, will hunt you down."
Negative,I honestly just cried.
Negative,"You enemy is not the enemy, your enemy are the controls. The camera! Spinning like crazy near walls or when an enemy is aribore on larger than a player. Furthermore, the dodge/quickstep direction dipends from camera so it will happen too often that player have no idea what is going on. Since that does not contribute to enough deaths, developers succeeded to create enviroment where player caracter gets stuck on everything. Oh yes, mobs can hit you through walls, no problem.Update after 100h: Playing this game could be considered fun as much as falling down the stairs (bumping your head a lot) is excersise for a good health. However, some people like it and some people do need head slapped too.TLDR: Big, huge thumb down because for this level of difficulty, even as third game in the series, the developer were not able to make a good port to PC. Crap camera, crap controls, abysmal dodge system and poor performance. (and after reading the comments for Elden Ring they did it again).Although the game is excelent, it does deserve very big non-recommendation."
Negative,safe file corrupted bye
Negative,this game was fuckin ass hate this game with a passion
Negative,I recommend playing it but... the game still doesn't have anti cheat of any kind. I run into cheaters on the regular and its annoying enough to come across casual pvp twinks pretending they're good when all they did is over gear themselves. But its getting to the point its more common to run into cheaters and I just dont see an end to it now that Fromsoft is working on something else. The game is great. The game management isn't.
Negative,Wanted to enjoy campaign COOP with my GF - got attacked 10 minutes into the game after first boss by a twink invader. If you're looking for a coop game to enjoy with friends i suggest looking elsewhere as it's definitely not it. The game handles the mode poorly offering very little if no choice how you want to play it. Would love a refund.
Negative,Downvote due to unforgiveable control scheme explanation. Am I using a PC? Yes. Is this a lazy port that cannot be bothered to put even a single iotas worth of effort into explaining the non console controls? Yes. Will I get over this? Maybe. Will I ever figure out how to jump? Probably but triple A games not caring about PC users QOL is just unforgivable in my book so this is staying a downvote for good cos you know Bandai Namco anit gonna do a thing about it.
Negative,"The game is cheap trash port from console to pc. When in the menu, trying to configure my settings, imagine my surprise when pressing ESC didn't work! No, I had to right click, then click on a console style button that would let me go back.In-game, everything you find, be it interacting or tutorials, will show controller commands even though I am playing with mouse and keyboard.Stay away."
Negative,Basically it's unplayable with keyboard/mouse.  Would have been nice to know that before wasting my money on it.
Negative,i cant git gud
Negative,Waste of money. Need a controller and agravatingly hard.
Negative,"If you buy this game, prepared to face hackers every time you're invaded, unless you play offline. People with weapons you can only get after killing certain dlc bosses, people literally unable to die, etc. During a two hour play session on a new character I ran into a person using the Crucifix of the Mad King as well as another wielding the Frayed Blade.While both are technically not impossible to get without cheating, it's highly unlikely."
Negative,"Every enemy is the same. Every enemy has, even the slowest and heaviest, have a gap closing lung attack. Every enemy, even the most awkward and broken, has a combo that forces roll spam. Every enemy, even the beefy and chunky, has the same shrill ear rape sound design."
Negative,"bad interface and ui port for pc. tried with m&k but it didnt work well, tried with controller but still doesnt feel comfortable. it did have unique , gothic art style but the story is un-welcoming for new gamers to the series. maybe im just noob :P"
Negative,Probably one of the worst ports i've ever seen. Do the developers even know that they released this game on PC?It only shows the XBox buttons and i'll have to open the badly designed settings menu every time i want to see which button i have to press.
Negative,Virtually unplable with a Steam Controller due to a dirty hack used to selct targets and other things with the d-pad. Yet another dissapointment (of so many) for the Steam conroller and clearly never properly tested game for use with the Steam Controller.
Negative,"Be warned, this game's controls are not friendly to PC players."
Negative,Huge negative for community.
Negative,"Bugs, bad hitboxes, alot of enemy attacks clipping through walls, floating objects."
Negative,this is my review of bloodbo... o wait this is dark souls 3. this is just a  huge fuck u to the fans. dont buy it pls for the love of god buy dark souls 1 or 2 this game sucks. all the levels are the same bullshit roll and mash attack. all the bosses are just a huge boring dodge fest. go play dark souls 1 or if u wanted to buy this for the pvp go play chivalry
Negative,"Decent PVE.. probably..Very bad PVP with lags and bad servers, people hitting the air and damaging you. Unbalanced/buged weapons where a swing from a GIANT halberd is much faster than a katana swing.Expensive DLC's with lack of content and gameplay hours. Another thing regarding PVP, whenever me and my enemy hit one another at the same time, we get staggered, and then we both try to atack one another, enemy weapong is always faster and always hits first and does damage, making me stagger and me not being able to hit my enemy. No matter what weapon enemy uses, ultra greatsword, greatsword, curved/straight sword, scythe for example, is much faster then my weapon.Frustrating.Also this garbage can randomly crash your whole PC, corrupting save files beoynd repair. It deletes the saves files, otherwise you will not be able to play the game at all. And so I personally lost a save file worth 300+ game hous and garbage namco or fromalware don't care one bit about stuff like that. There is only one save and if you didn't do backup manually your character is lost for good, since degenerates do not create any previous save files."
Negative,"Short and to the point...Dark souls 1 was good, I loved dark souls 2 couldnt get enough of it. This game I can only recommend if on sale. Im not sure if its just me but feels the same old, same old, same old....I have had enough! This game just doesnt offer anything new or exciting...its tedious, punishing and boring."
Negative,"90 hours on my other account... so fun to get banned. Deleted all my saves, reinstalled the game, copied my save file from this account and nothing woked. Fix your fucking game.If they ever get off their lazy fucking asses and stop letting hackers ban people whenever they feel like it, I'd say it's a good game, untill then I'm going to play with the like 500 people playing dark souls 1 world wide."
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 is a great game, it plays really well, has a level of challenge most games lack and a solid annoying, but fun PvP. However the online for this game is Rampant with hackers and modders with zero effort from steam or the publisher to curb it. The hacking does ruin the games online functionality, and for that reason I cannot reccomend the PC port for anyone that intends on playing online. Graphically it is beautiful on the pc and plays much smoother, while the pvp system on console is slower at the very least people who are breaking the game are in short supply."
Negative,"Extremely linear and thus 0 replayability.Covenants are copy paste from the old games, except the good ones have been removed.Mechanics like poise have been completely destroyed instead you are forced to use certain weapons and moves to get hyperarmor.Instead of leveling at the bonfire you are forced to level at ""firelink shrine"" since the linear structure of the game would otherwise mean that there is absolutely no reason to return there.Of course they also give you the ability to teleport, because it would be way to much effort to create a cohesive, interconnected world. Just connect a bunch levels together via tunnels and elevators and that will be enough for those morons.Game looks worse then DS1 and DS2 even, how did they manage that?Graphics are UGLY and make absolutely no sense, everything is grey and desaturated.Funny to select a certain hair or tatoo color in the character creator only for it to appear completely different in the preview.Blood of red blooded enemies sticks to you and turns into a ugly greyish brown mess?Performance is bad thanks to the unnecessary amount of clutter and needlessly high poly count on irrelevant objects.Immersion breaking fan service.Played it once and then never again. Game overhaul mods are the only reason to play this disgrace.Apparently a bunch of unpayed gamers are better at creating fun games then the actual owners of the franchise."
Negative,"Combat is very meh, feels like you are controlling a tank. Also the lore and story is pretty much non-existant"
Negative,no this game blows too easy especially with infinite health
Negative,"Never seen a game as garbage as this. Last checkpoint is 10 miles far from the boss. Die and repeat the 10 miles distance walk again, Did I mention there is armor in the game? Oh btw its useless, Wear armor and your character will roll like a dying whale on the beach eating every hit from the boss.Oh and even more! There is a parry mechanic! Exciting isn't it? Well too bad. It's pretty much just a meme addition.Also note that you actually need a controller to play this game. There is a massive input delay with the mouse and keyboard, it's not worth trying without a controller. I literally had to buy a controller + learn how to use it ( Yes, I never held a controller in my life ) just to play this overrated hot garbage of a game."
Negative,"boring linear gameplay, bad combat"
Negative,This game sucks ass because I'm incompetent. I wish I was born with less chromosomes.
Negative,"Visually this game is a treat to the eyes, just beautiful! The cinematics are impressive, and the enemies were both varied and haunting. It truly did feel like stepping into another world. More than once I stopped on a cliff just to look out at the stunningly beautiful vista for a minute. I also had no issues with lag or framerate, which was refreshing in this age of poorly optimized games. Character creation was unique, and there were enough options that it made me feel like had I not hated the experience (see below), this game would have had a lot of replay value.Unfortunately, two things ruined the experience for me:1) It is clearly a TERRIBLE console port. Every instruction is listed by its controller button, so if you're playing keyboard / mouse every time the game gives you a tip on something you can do, you will have to navigate the (also terrible) menus to the keybindings section and look up which key they were actually referring to. Navigating menus is as unintuitive as it gets. Pressing escape did not seem to back me out of a screen or menu, forcing me to hunt for the plain white text which crowded the screen and made everything look cluttered, and which was clearly tacked on as an afterthought during port to the PC. I ended up pressing ALT-F4 just to get out of the @#$ game, and next time I loaded up it complained at me for doing so.2) Combat is also TERRIBLE. It was one of the things that supposedly is so great about this game, I read numerous reviews praising the combat. It's not that it's hard (although it is challenging and that's good) it's that it is just not... good. You can dodge in a limited fashion by hitting space, but usually when I did so the enemy sword just moved at the last possible second to impale me anyway. What's the point of having a dodge if it doesn't move you out of the way of the enemy sword? Nor could I find a way to dodge any direction except for where the camera was pointing. (Usually, the idea of a dodge is not to leap TOWARDS the enemy weapon...) My character could not even jump or climb, which is a baffling omission in a game as modern as this one.Who won combat turned out to simply amount to who attacked first. If I hit attack first I could simply hit attack twice and the average enemy was dead. If the enemy attacked first it would simply interrupt any attack, dodge, or block I attempted and kill me in like two hits instead. After playing the superb combat in Witcher III, such crude simplicity was just... disappointing.In similar games, when facing multiple enemies I would have to adapt and use my mobility against them, but here my character had no mobility to speak of. I was simply forced to retreat until my enemies all came at me from the same direction, and then make sure I got the first attack in as noted above. Large enemies are not slow and clumsy like I would expect them to be, but rather move giant spears that take up half the screen around like light plastic toys while my character had about as much chance of moving out of the way as that last tiny ant I stepped on yesterday. What's the point of having massive lumbering enemies if you can't use your agility against them? All things considered, if I had not played Witcher III before this I probably would have been impressed over all, but I have, and compared to it, combat in this game feels clumsy and primitive. My character wielded a saber-looking sword using fencing moves, but with all the grace and speed of a toddler swinging a heavy axe.Again, it's not the challenge itself. Witcher III could be extremely challenging in places, especially when facing multiple enemies and bosses, but it was also fun, and combat was sublime. Here, the game felt needlessly punishing not because the combat system was challenging and fun, but because the combat system was clumsy and the interface a mess.Might be fun on the console, but I cannot recommend avoiding the PC port strongly enough."
Negative,"Grossly overrated....clunky UI, story pretty much non-exisitant, and coop system pathetic....It looks nice and its hard....pretty much it..."
Negative,"I can't play the game without it crashing my entire computer. Until they fix this, which has yet to happen, I would NOT purchase this game."
Negative,Can't make it past first boss
Negative,"on the whole I like the dark souls series. The gameplay starts challenging but is consistent, meaning among other things, that it becomes not so hard, arguably easy other than human opponents and mobs you have yet to encounter. This is a good thing. It rewards learning...The problem is dark souls 3 breaks some of its own rules. There are several sins in this iterration. The three that bother me most are:1)mobs use the fact that you target them to move you(literally move you since the game also reads inputs)2)magnet mob movement(moves previously had there range and that was that) mobs routinely get exaggerated movement to either close with or evade players at this point, both in general(giant backsteps) and situationally to negate player input(for instance backstep after the mob has started a tight spin...and he is stuck to you...end of story...if he executed far away from you he would have moved 1 meter..but when he started in range and you moved he moved 4 meters...just because), related is their target autocorrects at this point, they in essence never miss a strafe except because you hit dodge at a specific time in their swing...ie distance and angle are no longer relevant3)Acceleration. Mobs move can execute faster than they should be able to...and its not just an issue of the manipulation of power attack with the hold either...which was itself cheap. No, Havels club performed a swinging arc faster than a quick tap from a long sword...and started swinging after it...and many many other examples but this should make the point super clear.I could go on about for instance how players recoil from wall hits but mobs not only don't recoil, their attacks literally pass through them...This sort of thing was less common in previous iterrartions which tell me it is intentional...and breaks what is best about dark souls. Poor form."
Negative,doesnt have cloud save
Negative,Overhyped and a broken game that somehow gets defended 10/10
Negative,"I've invested some hours into the game now and am still disappointed. Mind you that this is my first Dark Souls game. I hope the first two were better and they just tried some new things with this one that didn't go well. Skip to the bottom for a summary.With all the hype, I thought this was going to be a well made game, but it's more like a horror movie that relies entirely on jump scares rather than any real substance. It's just cheap and shallow. Everything in the game from awkward controls, camera, and move sets are made to work against you.Frequently, during combat especially, your character will act on it's own, late, or not at all. There is a confusing kick attack that occurs, seemingly at random during attacks. This cannot be turned off and will frequently leave you completely open to attack as it will break your combo with its lack of range, damage, and drain of stamina. The camera should be an enemy in itself. It is quiet possibly the most hindering aspect of this game as it will roll awkwardly along walls, block your view, turn wildly mid combat (this can only be waited out as the mouse no longer operates it during these phases), and even its resting position has your character directly in the center, forcing the player to guess where an enemy directly in front of you is. This makes aiming ranged attacks unnecessarily difficult. Making the player slightly transparent when equipping ranged weapons, or even lifting the camera angle slightly would solve this issue, but I believe this was intentional.This game needs to rely on cheap tricks such as these to make it seem difficult. It certainly can't rely on the AI of its monsters. Throughout the game, there will be ledges and levels you are able to ascend while enemies may be above or below you. Once made aware of your presence, most will wildly attack in your direction, completely oblivious to the fact that you are well out of reach and cannot be harmed. Occasionally you will witness enemies simply walking off of edges to their deaths due to poor path finding. I believe these gross limitation are the key reason every boss battle (I've yet to beat the entire game but there is a clear pattern) will only occur in a confined box of a room with only one level. Any more would confuse the simple AI and lead to laughable and disappointing 'fights'.As they are, bosses all follow a similar pattern, just as their stages. They all have ridiculous damage (1-3 hits to death, depending on your build), range for their attacks (covering great areas of the arena), unreasonable speed (able to close what little distance there is in a second), and extensive health bars (generally divided in two with the boss becoming even more powerful when its health is halved), allowing them to take full advantage of their tiny prisons. Battles with them are a panic, not a measure of power or skill, they will always have the upper hand there. The most you can ever do is roll, run wildly, and hope to get enough hits in during their brief pauses in often elaborate combos.As mentioned, the regular enemies are a joke in terms of intelligence and are given absurd advantages in an effort to make their handicap less apparent. For example, all enemy ranged attacks, magic or mundane, will home in on you from great distances. This includes the earliest enemies firing bolts and arrows. With enough distance, you can clearly see the projectiles angling mid-air toward you despite moving out of the original path. These homing capabilities even occur when you are not visible to the enemy, such as when behind a wall or other obstruction. This comes as one of many disappointments when you try using your own ranged attacks, only to see that they do not home, and as mentioned before, are unnecessarily difficult to aim at range. This often results in arrows and magic flying harmlessly between monster legs and under arm pits. Magic occasionally will track, poorly, if the enemy is close enough to be targeted with the players incredibly poor targeting system.This is another cheap trick to make the game seem more difficult. All enemies can track you with homing spells and arrows from tremendous ranges, through walls and over ledges. Your tracking is only effective within maybe twenty feet, sometimes, and is broken by even slight obstruction. Similar to the lazy, or more likely purposeful, making of the anomalous kick move the same button as regular attack, the target button is also, unalterably, the same as 'align camera'. This means if the enemy you are trying to track is out of your laughable tracking range, or even partially obstructed, hitting the tracking button will align your camera in the direction you are facing, and if it isn't the direction of the enemy, congratulations, it is now off screen.Another dirty little trick is enemy attacks clipping through walls. Enemies can track you through solid objects and will attack through them when close enough. This means limbs and weapons of there's will poke through otherwise impassable barriers to lash out at you. This tends to look very awkward and just helps to point out how little attention the mechanics of the game where really given. But what is really showing is that they took the time to remove the player's ability to do the same. If the player strikes too close to a wall, your weapon will bounce off of it in a shower of sparks, causing not only the attack to halt, but for the player to suffer a delay before being able to strike again. This will often leave you open to attack. Just another in a list of cheap tricks designed to limit the player while giving advantage to the AI. I fully understand why they'd need to do these things. All the series has is being difficult, but I believe it all could have been handled better, especially for the price of this title.As mentioned earlier, this is my first experience with a Dark Souls game, but if this is an indication of what the series is about, I have to say, I'm very disappointed. For an RPG, the game is very shallow and relies on cheap tricks rather than inventive design to offer challenge. While the graphics are nice, and the environments are beautiful to see, the gameplay is purposely frustrating, making for an all around unenjoyable gaming experience. The only incentive to play seems to be, intentionally, anger, to finally see that enemy that has frustrated you so much finally fall. There is no interesting story to uncover here, no grand heroic tale, just some lore loosely slapped together around the enemies, uncovered by their items. Considering the frustration these titles seem designed to incite and what little reward they offer, I can't help but think these types of games may even be dangerous for players because of the stress they cause."
Negative,"What can I say? The main menu is great but the rest simply doesn't work.This game is killing my PC, and it's a high-end PC, I didn't even know so much errors could appear just playing a game. Nvidia errors, Windows errors... grammar errors, it's even worse than the early days of Dark Souls II, it was badly optimized but at least it worked, well... most of the time. This doesn't.Even if they'll fix it this behaviour starts being unacceptable to me, I'm tired of the Dark Souls games never properly work on PC, and as a PC user I'm offended, they keep asking my money now to do their fucking job later. They really don't deserve all the money they make with these games considering how they treat us.If you decide to sell your console game to PC users, and you sell it at the same price, you simply can't offer a worse product, and ""This is a port"" is not an excuse, it's actually a double standard between Console and PC users. The first time it happens it could be a forgivable mistake as long as they fix it, the second time I can still try to believe in their good faith and forgive their porting problems, but not the third time, now I start to think they just don't give a shit, it's a routine, and it has to stop!LEARN YOUR SHIT AND MAKE YOUR GAMES WORK TILL DAY ONE!But if you really need to play this, well, it seems great for what i could play and see, surely better than Dark Souls II, maybe even better than the previous. I just suggest you to wait for the patch which will fix the game.Problem is it's becoming a routine: releasing the game when it still doesn't work - taking the money - making a patch to fix it after a while - and - this - is - not - ok."
Negative,Garbage half-assed port.
Negative,"The game has a tagline of ""Prepare to Die"", probably added after the fact to make it go down easier. The game was made by a guy who, as a masochist, said ""These are all the ways I want to die,"" and had the game try to kill the player at every step. The game is just dying your way forward. That's it. It is that, rather than fun. If you like to conquer games, rather than play them for enjoyment, this is the game for you. If you're a normal person, this game sucks."
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 is probably a great game if you get it for Xbox. But as a PC user:""Press any button"" yeah, any button except any button on my keyboard. The only button I was allowed to press was the text itself, with my mouse.ToS, I was forced to scroll through it with my mousewheel.All, and I mean ALL of the controls are listed for Xbox controllers. During the ""tutorial"" I had to constantly hop into settings to see how things are mapped because the tutorial didn't teach me anything at all.It took me about 30 minutes before I even got into the actual game because of the controls being seemingly random, and 9 more minutes to figure out how you can sprint.That's when I decided to refund. 60€ is way too much for a game made by developers who does not care about other platforms than xbox unless you have an xbox controller properly mapped, yet they market it for PC. I wouldn't recommend this game."
Negative,"- awesome game, not as good as dark souls 1 to be honest, but it's still good- getting banned even though you didn't cheat- shitty multiplayer, almost only ganking and estus-chugging- overpowered noobweapons like estoc and dark sword- GREATSHIELDS RIDICULOUSLY OVERPOWERED- poise doesn't work at all- no 'well, what is it?'from pls"
Negative,"I wanted to try this game as my first actual souls game, unfortunately it is very dysfunctional on pc, there is delay on pressing keys, doesnt tell you what the controls are because it thinks you want to use a controller even though you are playing it on pc, the 60fps lock is annoying, and felt like some of the mechanics didnt work so well on pc. Overall I wouldn't recommend this on pc, it seems like a terrible port from console."
Negative,I KNOW i m not very good at this kind of game but after 5 hour of trying to pass the first boss which is about 5 min in ... this game sucks as f.... i just wish i never got this game ...
Negative,"While undeniably a well-crafted and decent game, it just has no identity outside of the 'big armored guy with weapon' enemies. I didn't hate it, but I would recommend the other soulsborne titles much more."
Negative,worst game in the souls series
Negative,too easy. needs to be harder
Negative,1st boss made me rage 10/10
Negative,This isn't Dark Souls. This is Bloodborne 1.5. Dont even bother using a shield.
Negative,"most enemies are unfair and will never give you a chance to attack, only chance you have is if you kill them in 1 or 2 hits, as well as most of the cancer enemies the areas themselves are garbage designed to punish the player in every way with exploration, making running past every thing pretty much the only viable option if you wanna make it to the next bonfire without dying several dozen times."
Negative,"Everyone's going to hate me for saying this, but this game is actually that unenjoyable.It has an extremely steep learning curve, with unintuitive controls. I played it for a couple hours and made it to probably the second stage of the tutorial. The bosses and enemies look cool, but that's all the credit I'll give. When playing this game, I was with my housemate who is a darksouls superfan, he made sure to guide me through what to do, and it was still too difficult. He kept trying to tell me how the fighting controls work, but in the end, al I gathered was- spam roll (temporary invincibility) and quick attack...That's the combat in this game...Spam free invincibility and quick attack.The last thing that was a deal breaker for me was- I wasn't aware that the game is technically always multiplayer, where people can ""invade"" your world and kill you for haha lol funny's I got killed by a smurf holding end game items as an early level. I've finally played it, and it sucks."
Negative,"Maybe i'm pedantic but i can't recommend this game for the full price for the pc platform. If you're not a fanboy, a weeaboo or more of a console player than a pc gamer, then read on, otherwise succumb to your base instincts...Pros:- mostly nice graphics 8/10 or so- wasn't too greedy on my ssd (25something gigs, really low for the quality of the graphics)- very fast - haven't experienced any glitches etc on my setup (gtx 1060 with both an old bulldozer 8350 and a ryzen 1800x)- challenging enemies: if you don't spend a bit of time dodging attacks and 'reading' their patterns you're missing on a big part of the game (the biggest i'd say, not much to this game apart from tons of combat), battles can be very strategic. Enemies follow patterns on their attacks, it's fun trying to guess what their stamina is and how to exhaust them/bait their attacks once you understand their programming and defeat them taking minimal damage. There's a couple of enemies that seem to be broken - Boreal Outrider Knight comes to mind, who seem to have endless stamina, with which you need to either use brute force, play very patiently against their patterns or try to use glitches to your advantage (there's tons of glitches you can exploit, narrow passages/corners, half open doors the enemies can't get through etc). - 'lightweight' rpg, simple mechanics yet not overly simplistic (e.g. witcher3 is an order of magnitude more 'complicated' than ds3, both in fighting/gaming mechanics and everything else really), manages to be fun enough- has a fun-ish manga tune to it, even though the setting is european (methinks, based on the architecture of buildings etc), you can walk around holding a sword twice your size, smacking things on the head - that's worth somethingCons:- if you play this game without a controller you'll be frustrated.. alot..- it's a straight port from console to pc, zero effort has been put into making this game pc friendly, it's not worth the full price if you're buying for your pc and plan to use pc controls occasionally: the first time i used an item from my inventory using my mouse i happened to be standing in front of a npc, using the mouse instead of my controller resulted in the character attacking after using the item, npc almost died and i lost favour with them... It's really frustrating trying to play this game with a keyboard as well, again, zero effort has been put into something that would take minimal coding and would have made the game playable on a pc (while at the same time this game sells for 40£, like a proper pc game). I'm dead serious, steam should have a warning on this game's store page, the rage this game can cause when played with a keyboard/mouse setup is unreal..- idiotic mechanics at times: if you 'fall' from a step (like a foot high step) on an npc it might damage them/cause aggression- the control is lacking, if you're used to fast paced games where 100ms of latency is a thing, this game will frustrate you beyond belief, for example:         swinging a sword can take about a second, if you change your mind while you're swinging said sword you have to wait for the animation to finish. If you're one of these gamers who survive on red bull and blink one eye at a time when playing, because 25ms is a lifetime and blinking both eyes will give your opponent a competitive advantage, then this is probably not the game for you        if you press the roll button while you're swinging your sword, that roll will be cached - this game has a ridiculously long input buffer and actions get cached but you can't 'override' them by hitting something else.. If you get staggered while a roll is cached there's no way you can change your cached action, your character will stagger for a second and then the cached actions will be played. For the life of me i can't understand who came up with this system or the reason behind it, it can be incredibly annoying during boss fights, where for example you might press attack, roll, attack, then your roll fails because the boss hit you and you stagger and then after a second or two of your character being staggered/acting like drunk, instead of rolling away while you're furiously hitting the roll button, the character stabs into the air because of the cached action from 5 seconds ago, while the boss proceeds to ravage you from behind.. The only way around this is to play this game in ""slow motion"", one keystroke/button push at a time and expect that once you start an action there's no turning back (even if it is a 3 second animation of your character trying to lift his/her sword, during which you could have rolled a ciggy and finish your latte)- 10? npcs, with a combined total of 20 kind of meaningful conversations, maybe about 5 of them present you with a choice, maybe a couple of choices actually have consequences..- i got the feeling that there's a lot of lore in this game (to be fair, i haven't played the previous souls games), however my main source of understanding what's going on was google.. There's absolutely nothing in the game content wise, compared to witcher the content is 1/100, compared to planescape torment 1/1000, how is this game branded an rpg when trine has a (literally) richer story is beyond me..- multiplayer is extremely laggy about 30% of the time (typically during invasions...) I live in London, my broadband is 'fibre' bt infinity2, ping times are single digits with anything hosted in the UK, low double digits with anything in europe, no online problems outside ds3"
Negative,"Dear FromSoft          F%#K YOU. You third rate console developing PoS. What kind of company makes a game like DS3 and doesnt enable steam cloud saves? MAYBE it wouldnt be so bad if they chose to address their cheater problem. Not only do cheaters constantly ruin PVP, but cheaters can literally corrupt your save forcing you to start (all charaacters) over. Imagine losing a 1000hr save game because FromSoft  was too lazy to enable cloud saves. Or,  your C drive takes a crap  (like mine did) and you lose everything that isnt backed up....which happens to ONLY be the dark souls 3 saved game (because it doesnt cloud backup like every other game). And what about that camera? Every other game on earth these days makes enemies and environments translucent if they block your view. Not DS3. if enemy or environment block your camera, Tough Shiz. If the above wasnt enough, It doesnt support ulrtawide, is locked to 60 fps and has a PVP cheater problem on par with Grand Theft Auto 5. It Stutters if you use the Xbox accessories app and they still do ignorant shiz like leaving item pickups on screen blocking your view until you dismiss them (which you cant do during any action other than walking). And the antiailasing is TERRIBLE. Some of the worst creep and edge shimmer of any game in history. This game is also FAR easier and noob friendly than other entries in the series (not a good thing).  It feels like "" Dark Souls Lite"". It's TRUE difficulty comes from having a Poor Dev who makes questionable decisions like the camera and item pickup things i mentioned that screw you in heated moments. At its core, there is a good game here that is hamstrung by a dev that considers PC an afterthought. I NEVER thought i would say something like this, but if you want to play DS3 you are better of playing this game on console. At least there, you get cloud saves and protection against cheaters"
Negative,they turned the servers back on
Negative,Only things i love about this game are Abyss Watchers OST and Nameless King/Lothric-Lorian Boss Fights . The rest is a total bs.
Negative,"Its a nice game from what I can see. But I´m at a loss for words. If you use your computer with mouse you can not jump or kick. Also all the instructions are for an xbox controller. For a game that came out 11 Apr, 2016 I really thought such simple things would have been fixed by now. It pains me to do this but I will give this a downvote since they have not done a single thing so that it would be user friendly on a computer.(edit) I have found how to jump and use all comandos. The information i found online that it was impossible was wrong. Though it is still very hard with mouse and keyboard.I also read that to get the storyline in dark souls you would need to dive into the game deeper and try to look for it. With that in mind I tried but still have a hard time feeling anything for the world or its content. It is just a hack ans slash without the feeling of developing the story further. This might be a fault on my part and I want to be spoon fed with the story, but it makes for me a bit harder to play this game again and continue with the grind without feeling that im closer to prevent the hellportal to open (diablo), or punish the one that did experimentations on you (baldurs gate 2), bring the last resistance to heel under the iron boot of Overlord Kyros (tyranny). So with this in mind I would still have a hard time to recomend this game to someone who plays it with mouse/ keyboard and are looking for a new world to explore and save/destroy. After 23 h of the game I have a hard time continue it. The one thing that drags me back is it unforgiving nature. I love that this game is hard as so few other games are now days. It is nice to actually have to try new tactics and fail time and time again. Will try to finnish it and if my impression changes my review will to."
Negative,"really bad game, i cant kill shit without dying"
Negative,Dark Souls III: Prepare to Crash Edition
Negative,This game might be better with an Xbox controller since that is what it was clearly designed with in mind. The keyboard/mouse controls are clunky and hard to use and are not explained at all in the game (explanations are all for Xbox controls) so you have to figure it out for yourself or search online.Other than the control issues it seemed like a good game. I might pick it up again if I ever buy a controller of some kind.
Negative,"Played this game when it first came out, since then i have upgraded my CPU, and GPU, from a fx8350 to a fx9590.GPU from a gtx980 to a 980ti hybrid. Game does not work any more for me now. Also updated my bios to see if it was that. wasnt the case..."
Negative,"If you want to play game like watch 30 sec. of a video on youtube and then do the same yourself then buy it, otherwise if u want to play game without spoilers and just play and not google everything where to go what to do then i recommend you Lies of P not this trash game."
Negative,Playing PVP twice in a row without being matched with hackers that can even crash your game is just impossible.
Negative,not enough content
Negative,"if you were a fan of the first Dark Souls and loved the game for what it was, dont play this game.This game feels like its more of a fan tribute than an actually hard game. there is no sense of progression when playing. for example, if you were struggling with a really fast tough enemy in one area and finally manage to defeat him, more often than not there are more of them in the next room. so the game feels really slow and if your not the best at the souls games you will struggle alot (espessially if your not a die-hard souls player).Dark Souls 3 feels unfinished at times with the sudden frame drops, enemy spam, and broken hit detection. This game is no where near as fun and rewarding to play as the first Dark Souls game was. The style and speed at which enemies fight feel as if this is just a huge DLC for Bloodborne, but with sword and shield combat, and even worse than that, playing with a sword and shield is near useless. Both bosses and standard enemies attack fast as lightning and are ruthless, so sitting back with a shield is useless unless your building stamina and are a master at parying.All in all this game does not feel like true Souls game and is more like a game that some fans made in a year. If you are new to the Souls games and are looking for an oppinion on what the best one is, get the first one, even with the low frames (that can be fixed) its far more supperior than this."
Negative,10/10 game I like the onion man. Also best souls game but thumbs down  for the new patch that broke the game unplayable now
Negative,Easily the least creative and worst entry to the seriesAlso >2016 release >no cloud support
Negative,"I got criticism on my last review for being too vague so this is my more detailed rewrite:Everything that made DS what it is has been gutted and streamlined and painted up as a BS horror genre game. Theres a list of bugs that weaken the game but honestly what kills it for me is some of the shamefully bad-taste design choices.Heres a bulleted list of bad design choices related to unfun gameplay:r1 spam removing all technicality from combat. Axes and hammers used to have a penalty associated with missing, but compensated this with high damage. Now they all share a moveset and animation, no penalty, just keep tapping that r1 like it's prom night and your gf let you get an under-the-dress-but-over-the-panties feelskie. It's dark souls: propeller modeinvasions that only happen when it's 2 or 3v1. Thats not even fun for the invadee. They finally fix the algorithm to pair people with others that have comparable gear and it's not even 1 on 1.broken covenants mean +++hours+++ of mindless farming. Funnnnnarmor being irrelevant, making gear completely cosmetic. You usedtocould upgrade your armor, which meant that selecting a particular set of gear was a commitment of souls and time. Now they've trivialized the entire thing by making every piece of gear virtually as inneffective as any other piece. If you want a f#&%ing paperdoll game play Kim Kardashians dress up game. poise. F#&k you From. In full armor, lets die to a couple rats who are biting in rhythm because we can't get a swing off. But especially fuck you for making the Wolf Ring a thing again, making me farm for hoursssss (because the autosummon covenants are not working) only to get it and find it beyond worthless.""unable to summon phantom"" x30. I'm glad the floor is luminescent with summon signs because I'm going to have to stutterstep over them like it's DDR while mashing my controller to get one to work. Idk why they even have the avatar that appears over them, it's not like you have time to see them if you actually want a summon. Spending time working around a broken online mechanism sounds fun, right?warping means you are only as far from anything as you are to the closest bonfire. This effectively strips from the game what I consider to be one of the major strengths of the ds1 gameplay. Finding shortcuts and bulldozing through enemies that used to slow you down, as well as planning routes around your needs was what made ds a game with unique memorable qualities instead of another helicopter simulator like chivalry. Now we get frustrating ""Door does not open from this side"" about 4 times in any level. That's not quite the same thing, From...unforgivable pvp lag. They had 3 chances to unf#%k this but we still have absurd lag issues and, weirdly new to the roster of issues, phantom hitboxes. For no reason at all, From has decided to make the combat even more retarded and purposely given some weapons this bullshit property of being able to strike people without being near them. Cool!Feels like a tumbleweed simulator at times because rolling costs so little stam and there is no poise so your only options a lot of times to spamspamspam roll. It's totally possible to get boxed in by enemies and you're like a just caged into this corner spamming roll hoping you can slip out but you never do, the enemies just swing until you dieSo they made estus chugging during invasions the name of the game by decreasing the time it takes to swig. This might be cool in PvE but it just drags out the PvP. Getting someone down to 2 health and having them spamroll out take a few chugs and then kill you... its just not f#$%ing funDark Souls finally brings something innovative with weapon arts, which could have been great, yet somehow all the weapons have become even more generic. All weapons fall into a category, axes hammers straightswords etc, and all of those weapons share the same weapon art and moveset, with trivial differences in swingtime, range, etc. There are more weapons and less variety...There are like 7 covenants and 5 of them are redundant. Two of them are literally the same covenant with the same leader, trophy and everything... and what about mound makers? Why do they exist????? Like they really couldn't come up with another covenant so they just make one that's worthless and whos rewards are trash? And actually the idea could have been good if say your sign wasn't purple, but who would summon a purple if there was a white or gold summon sign? People just drop purple signs to duel so they can get the shitty covenant rewards and unlock a trophy... funfunfun... There's no commitment to them at all, either. You switch in and out of covenants like pants to suite your needs in any moment. Sure its convenient but it removes one more element from the game that makes it compelling, and at this point there are few things left. I can't even say 'more covenants, less variety', there are actually few covenants and somehow less variety between them.The overall trend of making no commitments, painlessly being able to undo virtually anything you do in the game kills replay value. Don't like your point distrobution or face? Hey man, change it! That's cool, but why would I roll another toon after beating the game if I can just repurpose the one I have? Because the game is sooo goood, right?Heres a bulleted list of bugs that aren't necessarily game breaking but still suck and fanboys won't acknowledge:Low framerates across the board - firelink epsecially for me. I can run Ds2 on 1080 ultra at 60fps but Ds3 on lowest settings 1360x768 I get 12-25 fps in certain areas, never over 48fps. It looks like shit and runs like shit. Ds1 looks better because I can turn everything up. I've died from lag several times. This is an optimization problem, as they've reported significant increases in their upcoming patches.Going beyond just regular lag, how bout moving statues with NO animations? Enemies still take their damage. This occurs in pvp as well as pve summons. This happens a f#%kin lot. Ridicolusbonfires/quit game button that are grayed out out after summoning fails.summoned phantoms not being able to traverse boss fogs for no reasoninconsistencies in what triggers storyline events. Might be bugs, might be intentional. At this rate I'm not certain its intentionalbutton presses not going through sometimes (like trying to run or backstep as your stam bar is refilling but has stam to spend). This might be a bug or just shit design, I'm not sure but running/rolling while stam recharges is not working like it did in previous games, and when it causes a death or pvp loss it can be rage inducingloadscreens that never loadand finally it looks like their latest patch has caused a large hiccup stutter every several seconds for most people. Cool!I've reached my char limit, but suffice to say that neither I nor anyone I know that bought this game on release is still playing it. Some of those friends even bought the super expensive limited edition releases.This game is not fun. Look past the nostalgia. It fails. I've already uninstalled and I'm back to playing ds1. I'm starting to think they couldnt have made ds3 as good as 1 because they dont even know what made 1 good. They got lucky and tried to reverse engineer their own game and turn all the cool features up to 11, and in the process we have a game that has itself cracked and gone hollow. Maybe thats the big secret of miyazaki. He has made a game series that, like lordran, has become progressively more empty and soulless, hopeless, mindless with the waning of the first flame. Well played miyazaki. Well playe"
Negative,"I was very disappointed by this installment of DS. I spent 30 minutes on the character creation screen and the game froze.After hard-rebooting my machine, I spent another 30 minutes on the character creation screen and managed to save the template, then proceeded to start the game, where it froze on the introduction cinematic after about 3 seconds (just after the bell tolls).4 crashes and hard-reboots in exactly the same place later, I changed all the settings from ""GeForce Experience Optimised"" to ""Low/off"".Joy of joys, I got to play the game (finally)... and spent about 40 minutes learning the combat with the monsters dotted around the start area. I was starting to find myself getting immersed in the gloomy atmosphere and the feel of the game. First boss down and on and up to the next save point in the shrine.Saved the game. Spoke to the old woman that sells stuff and the game froze again. Force-reset, try again... freeze after loading. Tried mucking about with the settings to no avail. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling drivers without any luck.So, I created a new character (a knight, as it had been reported by the many others with the same issue that the knight seemed to fix the crashing issue) - but this didn't work for me.As there were so many other people complaining of exactly the same thing over the course of 2017-2018, I put it down to a terribly-coded game and got a refund.Shame, as this looks like a fantastic game...I give it a ""No"" for bad coding, but I would have given it a ""Yes"" had I been able to play the game."
Negative,Hard and story line is kinda bad. main reason is that i got eaten by a man eating chest.
Negative,"What a shame that there are so many reports of cheaters and hackers. What's the point? Just to destroy other player's enjoyment? Do these cheaters have nothing better to do than to CHEAT? Ridiculous that you can't just play a video game without some immature, insecure maggot proving he's better than you by cheating. Imagine the type of person these people are in the real world. Scum of the earth."
Negative,"TERRIBLE PORT , e."
Negative,"Bloodborne with Dark Souls paint smeared all over it = Dark Souls 3, don't go in looking for DArk Souls 1 combat. This game is shit"
Negative,cannot have sex with fire keeper -rep
Negative,bring back multiplayer you nerds
Negative,Makes you salty as fuck
Negative,"Fair graphics and an apparently intriguing world, although hardly explained. Vague item descriptions are not exactly why I bought the game. Would have been a positive review, had the game been balanced towards player enjoyment instead of frustration for the sake of frustration. It might seem fair, but all is not fair. Unless you've got nothing but free time to waste on trial and error-ing some video game, this will absolutely not respect your time. Notable pro: some of the boss tunes are exquisite."
Negative,Combat system isn't good comparing to many other games.Does not hit well if you don't target lock.Does not move well if you target locked.Controller buttons binding is unnatural (take for example Run and Dodge are same button)
Negative,"I've played this game for a few hours now and can say with certainty this game is not meant for any casual player, or just for people like me. My experience with this game only brought stress ; that's funny because a game is meant to be a stress reliever. To not die and let me say  to not die in this game is better said than done."
Negative,"Way too hard to be entertaining. ""Co-op"" needs ingame summoning every time other player dies and thus makes it hard to be useful."
Negative,It was promising but controls made it unplayable.
Negative,"So, After almost 1,400 hours ( on this and my alt. ) I have to say.The game. Is shit. The story is boring, Dull and repetitive after 3 builds, The weapons are bad, The character creator is garbage, And the game barely runs at even the lowest possible settings. The colors and bland and uninteresting, The servers are buggy and laggy as fuck, Even with someone who's in your same city.I've made some good friends thanks to this game - but even most of them stopped playing this.The invasion system is absolutely fucking awful in this game. In DS2? it worked just fine. You didn't need a goddamn MOD to find invasions for you, OR need cheat engine just to be a fucking build. Why the mod, You ask? because the red eye is dysfunctional. The watch dogs of farron? same problem. Aldrich faithful seems to be the only one they actually put a damned effort into.With three years of playing this game, I've just gotta say.Stick with Dark Souls 2. An actually fucking good souls game. Not this."
Negative,"I played through the game 23 times now. Yes, it has its moments. However, if you liked Demon's Souls and Dark Souls 1 for its game design and atmosphere, this may not be for you.+A good PC port at last+More Souls!-Very few bosses. They've been releasing a Soulsborne every year now.-Incomplete. But hey, buy the dlc! Right?-Way too easy-No real NG+ unlike the other games. The enemies hardly scale-Netcode still sucks-Suffers from the fact that it had to run on consolesShould I recommend it then? Well, yes. I liked it. It's more of the same in every shape or form. It brings nothing new to the table and is way too short (10h on my first playthrough). Probably worth 40€, but for 85€ for the complete experience, I will not recommend it."
Negative,"This bad console port is an insult to PC gamers.The developers didn't even bother replacing the tutorial text. So you are greeted in the game by messages instructing you to press B or X or whatever to swing the sword. Escape key doesn't work in menus (aparently the developers decided that the 'Q' keyboard key is the controller B so that's that). Basically a giant ""fuck you"" to you Mr paying PC gamer.In terms of actual game breaking stuff: the camera assumes you are using a controller so it tries to be smart and rotate around walls. Except every time it rotates, ""forward"" becomes ""back"" and ""back"" becomes ""forward"". Except for that one time, when it was behind my character and it thought it was on the right. So suddenly forward became right, right became back... you get the idea. Not ideal for a game that requires precise movement. Played this garbadge for an hour before getting a refund."
Negative,controls are hot garbage and thenif you wana play with friends hope you like dieing and using a consumable to some maxed out red boyi dont get it why do people like this game the only thing it has for it is world
Negative,pp poo poo check i shidded at lothrcoc pls help me i cannot wim and i am super based af. this game is cringe
Negative,"This game was made for controllers. I don't have a controller.Here is my experience with keyboard&mouse:Kicking is a complete gamble on keyboard, it works 50% when you want it to work. And to make it worse, when you don't want to kick it randomly happens.Camera locking is a nightmare. The character face away in the worst moments when an enemy hides behind a wall, your character turns his back to the enemy, the enemy will re-occur and hit your back instead of the shield.Bows have actual control, which is useful, but spells require you to guess the destination via the peak of your wizard's hat. Or you can use locking, which randomly unlocks.The keyboard implementation for controls must have received 0 attention from the developers, as the fix should not be hard: Add an option to lock the characters view to the mouse - and with lock I mean no wall evasion, no cinematic adjustments, nothing.For me personally the bosses are the most boring part of the game. It's just about learning where the invisible hit boxes of the boss and his attacks are. After recognizing invisible boxes evading is just like a boring mini game, the boss is completely irrelevant and all my mind sees is boxes.What I love is the level design, this is what really kept me playing this game. You return to places again and again discovering new paths, and you are rewarded for exploring."
Negative,"I only got this game because of my brother, and didn't have any fun playing it. it was boring, and repetitive. The combat was entirely unoriginal and uninspired, and was a key factor in how boring the game was. It seemed to me as if you just dodge and mash the attack button. I'm sure ""pros"" or whatever would tell you there's more strategy to it, and I'm sure there is, I just didn't get it.I would not get this game again, or any other dark souls game. I was hopeful because of how highly my brother talked about it but I was extremely disappointed. If you want to complete this game just because its hard, and want to have completed a hard game, there are MUCH better games to complete.I may be a little biased, because after I discovered how lackluster my experience was, my brother started to pressure me to ""give it another try"". It didn't help. I just couldn't find any enjoyment during my first or second try. His constant pestering has made me even more annoyed and now those two things have given dark souls (to me) a terrible reputation. I'm sure not everyone has someone to pester them, but I have met other dark souls fans who are the same  way, so that experience may not be unique to me.Anyway - just save your money. Don't get dark souls."
Negative,sHIT GAME DONT BUY
Negative,"only good thing about the game is the boss fights, the good weapons are just straightsword and claymore and the pvp is just boring. most of everything in this game is a callback to dark souls 1 or 2 and strokes itself off."
Negative,Quality?! How cares!
Negative,"It was hard to rank this game.  Although the story and premise are cool, the game is too hard for most people to enjoy it.  The fact that I can't get past the second level is ridiculous."
Negative,No cloud saves... I'd have to start all over gain...Good game but I'm way to frustrated to give it a good rating.
Negative,no cloud save. lost all of my data. great game
Negative,"I'm not allowing comments on this review simply because it's an old game and I don't like beeing flooded by Toxic players. I bought this game back in 2016, and was unable to refund the game because I pre-purchased it. The Gameplay control is not easy to use. I only played it for 27 minutes back then, but now I finally made an review of it. I guess I missed making a review of this game back then but here you go."
Negative,"Like the other souls games there's potential for a really enjoyable game. A solid foundation, but ultimately wasted. A dreadful control scheme without the ability to customise controls. About a three hour input buffer, which will get you killed a lot. Clunky movement, which is fine stylistically but when the game puts platforming aspects in the game it's not good. Lazy, artificial difficulty curves just giving enemies essentially infinite stamina etc. Forget learning enemy movesets and behaviours because sometimes they just do completely random things, pull combos out their ass, that you've never seen before despite having fought that enemy many times. Dodgy hit boxes exacerbated by dodgy terrain. Also having played the others I still find the mechanic of losing all your souls when dying twice pretty over the top and needlessly harsh. If the game were tighter and more polished that would be less of a concern. But often I find I die purely due do random, out of left field surprises or things mentioned previously, rather than my own mistakes. So either you end up backtracking to a bonfire often to spend your souls for a level up, which turns this into a repetitive snore-fest. Or you just go along and lose all your souls. Neither of these eventualities are rewarding. As I said, the potential for a great game is there. When you're fighting an enemy where all feels pretty fair, going toe to toe, it's great. But that's such a tiny part of the game. Too, there's random nonsense and most of the time the enemies are over the top huge creatures or akira like monsters that are essentially nothing but a time-sink, i.e fight them over and over learn their moves and your openings etc. Which for me is boring. A game like this should be able to reward you for being successful on the spot. Not force you into wasting your time doing homework fighting them over and over again. Because of this I don't find myself compelled to press on. The game feels more like work than fun and that's not good."
Negative,The game after putting 60 hours in it freezes just for standing/walking for 5 seconds. Shit port :D
Negative,Not recommanded for austistic people.Tyler1
Negative,PVE 10\10PVP -10/100
Negative,"If you liked first and second dark souls, you dont want to play this title ... difficulty is not about timing and skill any more its 50/50 skill/luck ... difficulty in this title seems to be artifficialy increased by small areas with big monsters with big aoes so you r kinda lucky if you can see the telegraphs on your screen provided that your camera isn't stuck in the wall somewhere ... still not a bad game but worst in the franchise so far"
Negative,"For full price this game is disappointing. There are way too many bonfires, the zones feel small, and overall the regular mosters arent that tough to kill. That being said, the overall physics and mechanics of the game have imporved but thats about it. Aside from the physics portions of the game they have added very little to make the game any better/different from the first.  There is very little intrigue and or things to cause wonder; the whole thing just feels unimaginative.The physics are great though."
Negative,"All technical issues aside, if you want to play this game on a PC with keyboard and mouse then STAY AWAY!The controls are utterly crap on a keyboard and it's very frustrating.To even view info about a certain stat/item/attribute, etc you need to go through 2-3 submenus and activate a Info Menu and then hover over what you want.There is no Strafe and if you hit Back then your char will turn his back on the enemy and you'll have to do a lot of correction moves (camera included) to be able to face the monster again! Pathetically unintuitive for PC !I hate these times when everything is being done for consoles and THEN (crappy) ported on PC."
Negative,"Being a HUGE souls fan since Demon's souls on PS3, I have to say I was very hyped and have been anticipating this release for a wile now. Unfortunately, amidst a game filled with interesting lore, new genre gameplay and unforgiving harsh levels, lies a body of bugs, programming mistakes and compability headaches with a compagny that seems to fail pc ports attempt after attempt. Yes, it is normal for first week releases to be filled with bug which will be patched as soon as possible. But beyod the fact that the game is still COMPLETLY UNPLAYABLE still on my tower pc with decent specs and up-to-date drivers, I still can't manage to game a whole session without a random problem popping up. From crashes to absurd low fps followed by controller compatability issues, I am now confronted with the weirdest bug i've seen to date. My right trigger ( light/soft attack ) will sometimes stop responding in middle of a boss / npc fight. Thinking it was my controller, I immediatly pressed start to realized that the SAME TRIGGER STILL WORKS IN THE MENU. After multiple restarts, the same reccurrent problem happens after the first 10 minutes. This is absurd. I WANT TO PLAY THE GAME I LOVE WITHOUT HAVING TO BUY A DAMN PS4 CONSOLE FOR 400 BIG ONES. Let's not forget the fact that FROM SOFTWARE has banned THOUSANDS of LEGIT Accounts that were using 3rd party programs TO MAKE THEIR GOD DAMN CONTROLLERS WORK FOR THIS DARN GAME !!!!!!! Applications that were used IN PREVIOUS SOULS GAMES WITH NO REPERCUSSION.I'm done, get you stuff together. I've been relentlessly trying to kill the Ancient Watchers with only R2 ( strong attack ) but gave up since this wasn't the way the game was meant to be played. ____GREAT___ GAME          but unplayable for a lot of consumers. It's sad really. I'll give it a month before asking for a refund but this looks like the end of an era for me and the souls series. RIP"
Negative,"Piece of shit game, devs can't even add Keyboard/ Mouse support.  Like seriously? Months after its realease also they can't come up with a patch to fix it? The game is all about combat play and that is messed up you're using Keyboard/ Mouse."
Negative,"Console software sold for PC, without proper porting.Congrats."
Negative,"I have wanted to get this game for a long time because the reviews are great! I snagged it for this steam sale and was dissapointed from the start. The first thing that irked me was that the ""tutorial"" was all on controller. No big deal I can just check keybindings and figure it out... Well unfortunately you have to memorize that stuff beforehand because you can't pause during combat to check your keybindings. I can't remember anything past 5 minutes so this was crippling to me and apparently there is no intention to provide more PC support. The answers I found online were mainly ""suck it up and use a controller"" and that is what made me give up. If you have no interest in using a controller my advice is to do more research into the game than I did before buying."
Negative,shit ass game but still buy it
Negative,"I cant fucking play it because when i do go to play it either crashes or the enemies have no fucking collision, bandai namco if you see this, help me because i would love to play this game"
Negative,"Im not going to give a reason.We all know exactly what's wrong with the game by now. And until it's fixed, cant recommend."
Negative,Fuck this game
Negative,"Dark Souls 3, better than Dark Souls 2, and almost as good as Dark Souls 1.  Painted World of Ariandel is short, and gets decent - after a huge, tedious snow zone. The Ringed City is almost unplayable due to horrific draw distance defects in the starting zone, still very short - and certainly not a good ""ending"" for the series.New Game + = Easy mode, and very, very, disappointing.I have a gazillion hours playing this delightful virtual reality defect and bug testing system - and have enjoyed testing the same exact bugs present from Dark Souls 1 to Dark Souls 3 !!!  Battle obscene amounts of game defects that have absolutely nothing to do with P.C. Hardware - but showcase all of the wonderful design anti-patterns from the 1980s!Experience ""Elite Battle"" by learning how to master the Defect Driven Combat System (patent pending, I presume) : a quest event system triggered by exiting the game; broken questlines for main characters, (Greirat and Orbeck); game achievements that are bugged - and never register, (Master of Rings); browser-style ""pop-ups"" that obstruct the camera; bizarre camera clipping; combat code that is based off of framerates - rather than CPU clock-timers; hitting enemies through invulnerable brick walls - with daggers; learning how to avoid ""Draw Distance"" defects, by staring at the ground while you run around; frequent game crashes due to bad license detection code; inconsistent framerates that result in random kicks from online gaming; and so much more !!!And oh yes!  Don't forget more elite combat strategies like chopping elite bosses to death by clipping their toe-nails, and spanking them until they ""Prepare to Die"" from it !!!I bet you think I am kidding about all that.  Disclaimer : I enjoy the very excellant Art Direction and Thematic elements - very much.  Seriously - the best part of the game."
Negative,if you expect to play with friends this game is not for you pretty much only sigle player/ ramdom encounters
Negative,"No cloud saving? Well, RIP :)"
Negative,"Shortlist of problems that make me not recommend this game.-Boring GRAY level design, everywhere including the dlc is gray.-some textures are missing-popping in of the environment-some awful enemies like dogs that can teleport-balance issues-designed with the notion that wasted time=difficulty (elevators not resetting, multiphase bosses with unskippable cutscenes and other things i wont mention here)-feels unfinished and rushed-some of the worst hitboxes i've ever seen in any game-very few bosses-inconsistency-pvpThere are things i hate that i left out i wont mention the positives since you have probably heard those everywhere else but the game is a solid 6/10Pick it up -50% its not worth the full price. Dlc feels more unfinished than the base game."
Negative,"Dark Souls is about the harvesting of men's creative power (libido) by women.The point of this game is that you should stop playing this game and use your creative power for something useful.This game is also about the tragic inevitability of our creative power being sucked by the female dark soul (hole).Whatever endeavor we partake, however Apollonian, decays into the dark female matter, be that re-linking the fire, building a house, NoFap, etc.It's a Greek tragedy, an exposition of man's impotence in face of raw chaos, that we get to embody (play) over and over again.Since both points are contradictory, this game exposes our paradoxical choice in this life: embrace the tragedy of being or surrender and be consumed by the matter.I cannot recommend this game while at the same time I cannot recommend it enough."
Negative,"buggy, crashes constantly. fk u"
Negative,"This really needs 21:9 support, as do all games in (nearly) 2019 for crying out loud."
Negative,"So boring, I enjoyed dark souls 1 but disliked 2 but 3 is just the same thing as 2. This is the only game that I own that doesn't implement cloud saves, that's just lazy on From software part, game is poorly optimized for some reason when I get hit the game drops to 3 FPS but run fine every where else? what a waste of money, really wish I could get a refund for this piece of trash game."
Negative,"It's like the rest of the series. If that's what you want, great... but it's definitely the least inspired of the series. The level design lacks the care of the previous games, they just feel like videogame levels rather than ""Dark Souls"" levels. The weapon skills are a nice addition, but they really don't bring enough for this to feel like a new game. The camera is still awful and the controls are still a bit clunky... but, if you're here, you are probably already used to that."
Negative,The game is great. But I wouldn't have bought it if I'd have known that half way through the game you can't maintain 60fps no matter what you do to your settings (dropped it to 800x600 resolution and couldn't get more than 42fps.) Feel like I got ripped off. This game requires solid 60 fps in my opinion. Dodging sucks without it. Buy it if the fps issue doesn't bother you. Also could be isolated to just me that has this issue as well.
Negative,no cloud saves for 60$ is crazy
Negative,worse than the other souls games by a mile
Negative,"worst PC port that has ever been made, as if the game didn't already have 2 decades old game mechanics"
Negative,"Crashing at first bonfire.  Read tips in discussion, but nothing works.  May want to wait until they start rolling out some fixes to buy this one."
Negative,"Too many gimmick boss fights, camera was a pain, fair few crashes. If there was a ""meh"" option this would be it"
Negative,"Do NOT buy this game guys , i gave up after 2 hours stuck in the starter zone you cannot level up your character  and the first boss to leave the starter area is ridiculously hard , spend your money else where"
Negative,Looks nice. Plays shit.
Negative,Don't let bad reviews stop you from buying this incredible game. Buy the game.
Negative,"Going to keep it short. The game is the best one in the entire series, some of the best boss designs(NOT THE FUCKING OLD DEMON KING THOUGH) so far - mostly well balanced apart from the devs removing poise.Negative because anti cheat. Anti cheat arbitrarily bans innocent players and fails to punish actual hackers(joining the game of a hacker might get you banned or vica versa - going PvP is a huge risk atm). Will not recommend until fixed, this is just a lazy excuse for an anti cheat mechanism and it in fact rapes a large part of the fun because of the potential threat of losing your high level character."
Negative,"Awful PC play, key + mouse binds are unusable, worst RPG i've encountered........."
Negative,WORST GAME EVERWHY DID I SPEND MONEY ON THIS??????NOT RECOMMENDED UNLESS YOU'RE A BASEMENT DWELLER
Negative,"They should tell you it is a console game. All this A, B, X etc is soooo  frustrating!!!!!!! I bought it on a PC and it should play on a PC!!!!!!!!!!! RETURN!"
Negative,"I`d like to start off by stating that i`m a fan of the dark souls series which makes it all the more difficult for meto write this review.The game has killed off:-Magic; Purely magical builds are not viable anymore and as a whole are lacking in diversity, thus losing in most casesin pvp to Dex builds.-Poise; It`s non-existent and as always the community was first to find out that it should be a working feature. The onlything to be done to fix this problem is setting one value from naught to one.-Questlines; It`s ridiculously easy to miss one. One step in the wrong direction and characters don`t show up throughout theentirety of the game. Why make it non-linear if so many quests are lost just because you enter a different area.-Covenants; No matter what Failsoftware says in their patchnotes about levels, the covenants are still not functioning properly-Pvp; It`s currently  a failed bloodborne copy a great experience. Again, poise doesn`t work andphantom range on some weapons is idiotic. Remember the  retarded  genious bloodvial mechanic in bloodborne pvp? When every battle was a(an)  shitfest  honorable experience and everybody had fun? Were you tired of endless bloodvial injection sprees that made pulp fiction heroine scenes look nothing more than a child`s play? Well as per  no ones`s  community`s request From added estuses even for phantoms. ""Oh the joys of a chugging ganking squad of 4 people vs 1 invader, what a nice pvp environment we`re experiencing"" - said no one ever. Also, prepare for soft bans from online for having an invader modify your data with cheats or by dropping you an item or hitting you with a knife, giving you hundred thousand souls. He doesn`t get a ban, but you do.Additionally, a common theme can be easily noticed throughout the entirety of the game, asset reuse. Due to parallel development of Bloodborne with Dark Souls 3, the latter one is noticeably lacking in original content, mobs and locations. For example, remember silver knights with their greatbows in dark souls 3? Did you love them? Did you hate them? Was it a memorable experience? Well, fear not, cuz we are going to reuse it to play on your nostalgia feelings once again!Furthermore, mob reuse in this game is nothing short of ridiculous. They even have a boss that is made out of the very samemobs you`ve been fiting in the very same area.Deacons of the deep. Finally, i`d like to say that i`m absolutely dissapointed in most vanilla DS3 locations. I`m more than sure From is goingto release the best armour and maps in the Autumn DLC pack. Don`t buy this game, it`s shite. P.S. Get your shit together, From."
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 is a bizarre game.I enjoy it greatly and it is definitely playable and still quite enjoyable with keyboard and mouse. However... as much as I love the game I won't recommend it to any PC gamers for a few reasons:1. First of all, let me state this - Dark Souls 3 and seemingly the entire Dark Souls franchise is based on old design philosophies that are considered by today's standard quite bad. This is both what makes Dark Souls a very enjoyable game because it is like nothing else on the market, but it is also the reason why trying to have a conversation with someone why Dark Souls may be a bad game isn't appreciated.Dark Souls 3 does have a significantly fewer traps for newer players and have made sure that important gameplay features are there... except...2. If you play without a controller, there aren't any tutorials.Period. All prompts you get at the tutorial area are for a controller; I don't have a controller plugged into my computer and even more so don't even own one. I still have prompts that are for a controller and that means that a lot of things are trial and error in figuring out what does what and how it even works.Things such as kicking took me two hours into the game to figure out what was causing it to happen and I can't perform it intentionally simply because of how the game works. Even more so I keep finding things after almost 7 hours of play that I had no idea about and doesn't even show up in the keyboard and mouse settings. Which brings me onto ...3. The settings.Dear.God.Above.You can change your keybindings but it can require you to close and open the game several times before the settings are saved. Furthermore some settings simply aren't possible to change, either because they are all on the same keybinding or because they simply won't let you change it. A good example of this is interchangeable with the UI where things such as selecting items, confirming or cancelling something or heck even just moving around the UI. It is designed for a controller in mind so it's understandable but never the less lazy and really, really dull to see basic inventory management become a hassle.4. This is going to be my final complaint and it is more directed towards the UI than the settings because fuck me...Everything requires you to click in order to change it. May not seem like a big deal but the best way to phrase it is like this:Imagine a slider with values between 1 and 128 and you start in the middle. You can't click on the slider to change the value, type a number or anything. At best you can hold down an arrow to make it move at single digits-speed in order to make a change.That is how I would summarize the UI; it can take you minutes to make a SINGLE CHANGE ... because it will keep reverting back, it won't let you do it at a reasonable speed, menus are hidden in menus and so on and so on. Add that together with the complaints I had about how annoying confirming or cancelling something and you have a nightmare of an UI that you have to fight to make it work or do what you want it to do.This is why as a PC gamer, even though the core gameplay is perfectly fine and if you are looking at the game you already know if you like it or not... I cannot with a good conscience recommend the game despite the fact I am enjoying it.It has stellar moments where fights are tense and makes you feel thoroughly rewarded when you beat them... but I know that I only find them rewarding because the game is punishing you for playing it. Ontop of that the game is by far the absolute WORST game I have ever played on PC, not for the quality but for the frustration of actually getting to these tense gameplay moments.So... if you are a PC gamer, avoid the game.If you aren't... well, you probably already know what you think about the game so this review is kinda' pointless.Still, I am gonna go and die to some more enemies in the game now and try to avoid falling off things. I seem to be quite bad at staying on the ground apparently. Well, at least in an alive state! ^^"
Negative,"They ruined this series since the first. Everything else about this game is great, except...With adding in a 2nd summon in multiplayer, the game has become easy, and invasions have become fruitless.I watch as i, the invader, watch a trio mill through the difficulty of the mobs and bosses. Do i win fights? No, not even kiting them into enemies. Im requesting a refund right now."
Negative,"The game MatchMaking system its still broken, since the release, the issue of players going into shadow pools of no auto covenants summons, or invasions as blue sentynels is still here, there was a fix for this that would force you to create an alter account, and use your Primary save file, into the secondary, account fake character, that would grant you with instants summons, no matter the covenant, weapon level, or character level. after 180 hours i finish all my achivements, playing with a secondary account, geting summons non stop for blue sentinels ... dark moon, or others covenants..But gues what? This retarded company decided to ignore this real issue and Patch the Family share Save fix, for this... yea for real, instead of fixing the covenant system making it playable and enjoyable for everybody, they just block the only way that you could use to make it work. But hey dont worry brothers, there is a DLC to buy, Go run and get it!And yea, the game works properly for X amout of players, but the other X amout its dealing with this issue."
Negative,"This is probabbly one of the least intresting games that I've ever played. It's got an intresting world, and really cool atmosphere, but..But what the game does with the world..? It's really fucking boring. After the first area, exploring the enviorment already gets boring. The combat really isn't all that fun, it's not terribly difficult, just needs good timing. The animations for combat are so ridiculously long, that it adds an arbtary, and entirely artifical level of difficulty. Honestly, there are a few things that are nice here and there, but overall this game is littered with absoutely fucking awful game design choices. I genuenly do not understand how this is a popular Triple-A title.I played this game though Steam Home Share as per recomendation.(Updated because of a typo. lol)"
Negative,"I really wanted to like this, but the challenge of a game should not be in how to control the actions of your character.  Perhaps it is because I prefer mouse and keyboard, but this game is made unplayable for me just by how crappy the controls are.  I even tried it with my steam controller, still no go."
Negative,"This Game Man. You get banned Every Week it seems For No reason. It Luckly Still Allows you to play the game but makes online play nearly impossible. and the Developer Support?  They Dont Care. They'll just ban you again.Note, I Played On a New Account, Ran into a hacker, got killed, then 5 hours got invalid game data."
Negative,doodoo caca game. dont recommend
Negative,Bamco is screwing everyone. Get out now.
Negative,"This too difficult, but if you like hard game you must buy this game"
Negative,boring. i don't even need to mention the community either
Negative,"I think it would be more fun to bash my head into a wall.  It's what the game feels like.  Die and restart, and die again.  I don't feel any connection to the character and the story feels lacking.  Not sure how this game has so many positive reviews.  I have uninstalled this game 2x now (I forgot how bad it was and why I uninstalled the first time).  I like RPGs, I like FPS, I like games like Batman Arkham City.  I hate this game."
Negative,"I've never written a review before in my 5,000 hours of gametime on steam, but this game proved so bad that I felt compelled to.I can safely say this is possibly the worst port of any console game to pc I have seen in my thousands of hours of playing pc games. Throughout the entirety of this game I was completely unable to have a single moment of enjoyable gametime due to the unending failures that this port provided. It was made abundantly clear that this game was made solely for console, and that playing it on pc was never intended.  Even still it is possible to make a game playable on pc if it is designed for XBOX, but this game fails to even show an attempt at that.  The tooltips that pop-up saying what to press for this or that action appear with xbox symbols rather than keyboard keybinds so it is impossible to find some keybinds as they do not even appear in the keybinds section of options.  There is a 'kick' attack that the player can use that is very low damage, for example.  You use this attack by pressing w(move forward) and melee attack.  However, you use these two buttons almost always.  So it becomes nearly impossible to complete any meaningful fight within Dark Souls III without just spamming kicks accidentally.  But wait, can't you just rebind the kick?  Nope.  They excluded the ability to rebind SEVERAL key abilites, kick included.  You cannot rebind kick.  Not only this but the dodge ability is incredibly hard to use on keyboard, something that could have easily been fixed by simply adding a 'double-tap a to dodge instead of walk' or some similar functionality.  I am very confident when I say that I will not be buying any games from this publisher in the future due to, frankly, the worst port I have seen in my over 5,000 hours.  I may reconsider my decision if they decide, in future, to up their level of workmanship, but I refuse to support cashgrabs, and Dark Souls PC Edition is exactly that, as stands.  This port failed miserably, and I'm sad to say that as I was a huge fan of bloodborne and similar titles on console."
Negative,No way to use controller without gyroscope button locked to the on position.  The game is unplayable.  I've spent over 2 hours trying to fix this problem and now I can't return it.  If you plan on playing with a controller than AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!!!!!!!!
Negative,"A classic series with a bad case of ""innovation"" syndrome. This title takes the direction of sc-fi horror as you and your team of space marines must battle your way through hoards of bugs to reach your mother. Who is also a bug."
Negative,"The core game was fun enough to do NG+ in an effort to get my money's worth, but there are some massive issues with the game as a whole that make it hard to recommend unless it's on sale. Between dodgy multiplayer (latency all around, quests and certain events require you to be emberred so you can't simply opt out of invasions) and non-sensible moderation (hackers go free, false positives get banned), rushed elements (how much of non-endings the endings are), DS3 is a fun yet flawed game that unfortunately highlights a lot of problems with the series as a whole."
Negative,"Have to use Cheat Engine just to get poise to work. 0/10, Fromsoft is still too lazy to fix their own games."
Negative,The season pass will never get on sale.
Negative,This review does not consider the actual gameplay simply because I never got to experience itThe game appears to have severe compatibility issues with:Windows 10Nvidia GTX 10XX graphic boardsmultiple connected input devicesAs a result the game will crash after approximately five-ish minutes but only if you can get past the white screen you may experience when starting the game.Appearantly neither the developer nor the publisher care about these grave mistakes which originate from a bad port.Even upon contacting the support they couldn't provide a satisfying or working solution not to mention a solution that doesn't doubt that the customer is hardly intelligen enough to breathe.Dark Souls 3 may be a fun game to play but the Steam version of the game is poorly ported and in my honest opinion a blatant cash grab. To fully enjoy the game and to avoid any unpleasant issues I recommend playing the game on console.
Negative,i have played this game way too many times. so i believe i am qualified to say this one is. Way too easy. yeah you heard it rightYou will barely spend any time in the beautiful enviroments.The bosses will not lastThe NPC's will make you cryBut what for? What makes this game so easy?Armor does nothing. There are barely any bonuses for wearing any specific type of armor. thus there is no pointAll you need is a straight sword and everything in this game becomes swiss cheeseThe pvp is excellent but is ultimately ruined by the Harpe quickstep meta Which is a dagger that has the same amount of hitstun as a ultra greatsword. and allows people to wear full havels armor with an excellent dodge and poise with no downside of the extreme weight of the setGoing back on my earlier point some of the bosses will challenge you. however the other 90% are either gimmick bosses or die in about 12 secondsDont get me wrong. I adore this game i really do its one of the few games that can immerse anyone into its beautiful world. get this game for the pvp or to experience the story. do not expect a challenge unless you plan to do the DLC
Negative,"PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME! Don't get me wrong, this game is a lot of fun; but it is so buggy. My brother and I spent an hour & half trying to connect to play co-op together and it would not match us.And yes, I did have my damn Ember, and I did try matchmaking with a password, I even tried using a different IP address from how desperate I got. When I tried to matchmake without a password other players would appear, but when trying to matchmake with people I actually want to matchmake with, it would work once every 30-40 tries. Please stop supporting companies who make half-assed games, and charge 60 dollars for them. Unfortunatly, I should have followed this advice as well. I kind of jumped the gun because I wanted to play with my brother and I was excited about that. However that seems to be impossible. The game has also crashed on me twice, which isn't a huge deal. Pros:Lots of funGood challengeCons:Everything else you can think of that can go wrong in a game, it happens in DARK SOULS 3.Please fix your servers, it is a shame to charge loyal customers 60 dollars for a crap game.If I could return this game, I would however, I've played more then 2 hours. I have a total of 7 hours of in game-play 5 of of those hours was me trying to match-make."
Negative,why dont i like this game
Negative,game made for console and controlers ... not for mouse and keyboard ...
Negative,It is a very challenging game. I did not like the bland mix of colors. Very grey colored game.
Negative,DO NOT BUY - SERVER ISSUES ALL DAY LONG. And they force u to quit YOUR game when their server is down.
Negative,game gets very boring after the first boss and the multiplayer feature is very bad.
Negative,Pretty bad PC port. Horrible screen tearing and mouse/keyboard support sucks.Who is this game for? People that don't mind the game being capped at 60fps and have a controller lying around.
Negative,Tried everything on the planet to get Xbox control  to work. Total fail. Just got refund from steam. Well miffed off. Customer service don't exist.
Negative,Worst fucking game ever do not play this shit ass game
Negative,"Kinda garbageHere's an idea for a drinking game. You drink every time pvp encounter was not fun, and every time you see a mechanic that worked better in DS 1 or 2. Spoiler, you'll find yourself barfing under the table in like 10 mins."
Negative,"Update: Came back 4/21/2021 and tried using a controller rather than keyboard and mouse. The controls are terrible. They put three different inputs into movement. You have to hold down B to sprint, while moving forward, while clicking the stick down while moving forward while holding B while aiming in the direction you want to go. Add combat jump attacks to this and it's ridiculous. Also, who makes dodge be on release rather than on press? This means if I was to, for example, hit x, the dodge will not happen until I release X. Putting running and dodging on the same button is a special kind of special. I feel like I am playing a game made by a person who doesn't understand how combat controls work. They put the controls in the most awkward areas so you are battling your controller more than the enemies themselves. Forget how you are supposed to jump over things so you progress. I'd waste my time learning the controls if the game wasn't so bad, clunky, and slow.Don't get me started on the reviews. Praise the sun isn't commentary on the game. Do you even understand how reviews work? How is ""good"" supposed to be a review? Have you even explained anything about why it is good? Why should I believe you?The bugs, glitches, and hacks are dumb. Your save file can be corrupted by hackers and you can be suspended by unknowingly picking up a hacked item. The community is full of trolls thinking they are amazing at video games by mastering clunky garbage controls. The combat is extremely slow and there are only a couple viable builds. Your stats always have to include endurance because casting magic clearly means you are using stamina. Your stamina bar is extremely low, enemies can grab you when you are behind them without you turning around (No, it's not a feature. The enemy was a human who somehow teleported me in front of them after I avoided their grab by sidestepping all the way to behind them.The mobs have infinite stamina while yours is garbage. Giving the mobs more speed than you can ever achieve is dumb if you love being fast yourself.  Invasions ruin co-op (and the game) due to people hiding and not even doing PvP. They are just wanting to waste your time. You cannot use the campfire during this time to save your progress and you can't continue forward, lest you be attacked by both the npcs and the players. You can die due to stupid reasons like jumping from three centimeters. This would be fine... If I didn't jump three feet beforehand and didn't take damage.PvP is a parry fest and it's all about who can waste a persons time better. It's garbage and should have never been implemented in this game. In fact, this game shouldn't even be a thing. After playing Nioh 2, I realized how bad this game actually was. Granted, Nioh 2 it's own problems, but by God. The artificial difficulty in this game is real. Souls-like? More like artificial like. The fact we named games difficult by comparing games to this garbage shows how bad the state of gaming is."
Negative,"I love the souls series and I really had a good time with DS2, and I thought with the combination of DS2 PVP and DS1 PVE that we would get a pretty great game! I'm a little dissapointed though, it really seems like they discounted a lot of good things DS2 brought to the souls series like better PVP, powerstancing, and reduced abillity to stun lock an enemy player into infinity. These are all pretty petty reasons for not enjoying the game, but the big thing that hit me hard was that they changed the whip back to its weak predecessors moveset of long delays between all of your whip strikes making for poor combo, you can't backstab with your fist while using the whip anymore and I thought that was hilarious and fun, and the cherry on top is that you don't get to shove your whipe into someones gut when you guard break them. Also the PVP really seems a lot more about playing like a dick, and ganking than it was before, and even when you did get ganked in Dark Souls 2 you could still find a good way to handle gankers and slowly take them on while backtracking and laying quick blows here and there to widdle the phantoms down, wheras in DS3 you just get hit once and stunlocked by three phantoms with little hope of escape. Overall though it's a pretty solid game for PVE and you can really get your challenges worth out of these new boss battles and zones, and the exploration is fucking rad as hell, like I absolutely dig the non linear exploring and awesome adventures I can have with my friends as we share tales of ridiculous things we're fighting, but I don't think I'm gonna get nearly as much out of this as DS2SotFS"
Negative,P v e is good. ge this game if you and friends are playing it. p v p is shit. from changed the ds 2 move sets to awful ds 1 move sets for some weapons makeing them useless. kick is awful compaired to guard break so turtleing is hard to stop. any poison or bleed builds are worthless due to hitting someone is faster way to win. from still hasent fixed the broken katana running attack. and to make things worse the game bearly can keep up a frame rate. ds 2 mid settings needed a  i5 cpu and my pc ran it a at 40-50 fps while ds 3 needed a mid setting i5 cpu can realy hold its frames.wait till the game of the year edition that way you can get a working copy with the dlc for cheap and keep ds 2 for pvp
Negative,"an update corrupted my save, and now i'm softbanned and can't play without cheatersapparently I can be unbanned automatically if I delete all my characters and play with cheating invaders for 100+ hoursyeah, no. fuck you. and the enemies are more rote memorization rather than timing"
Negative,"It is really dull, the only souls game I just can't make myself finish. The gameplay is also unresponsive and self defeating. It still runs like shit on pc, and there just aren't any fixes. Wish I hadn't spent money on this trash."

Negative,Played part way through previously and had a good time. Unfortunately the updated controller support is terrible. Often makes the game unplayable by requiring simultaneous use of controller and keyboard.
Negative,until they make an offical first person mod i cannot recommend this over ds2. weapon arts are a tired gimmic of games bye for now.
Negative,"Shittiest Souls-Like ever.I mean, really. Dark Souls 2 SOTFS is much balanced and have pretty movement. This game is like Bandai just made everything faster...PvP just can't be worse, worse and worse.

Negative,"""Players will be immersed into a world of epic atmosphere and darkness through faster gameplay and amplified combat intensity. Fans and newcomers alike will get lost in the game hallmark rewarding gameplay and immersive graphics.""I don't get the hype.Dark Souls 3 looks like an upscaled PS2 game where attacking more than once = bad & punished, spamming the roll button = ""amplified combat intensity"" and vaguely explained lore = ""epic""Play Jedi Fallen Order if you want a ""Souls-like"" game with coherence and doesn't look like someone threw a pile of sh*t at your monitor and called it ""immersive graphics"""
Negative,"""How to fail a potential Game of the Year Guide"" - by FromSoft.1: Create Hype2: Mess up the whole release.3: Dont put enough effort into the actual game.4: Make hitboxes and models with chop sticks.FromSoft wanted this game to fail. They succeded."
Negative,"Edit: Decided to comeback and make a more proffesional review, the controls are gross. Full stop, and trying to use KB/M was impossible because I was being given instructions for if I was using an xbox controller. WHY!?Old Review: The controls are clunky as shit and fucking gross. Requires a controller to play and even then it's still shitty."
Negative,"i want to like the game more yet i dont. it genuinely has artificial difficulty which means bosses and enemies designed to throw out attacks that always catch rolls, wind up an attack so you roll fine yet then they throw it a second later still hitting you, or too fast to react to... its not difficult, its artificial difficulty. to learn a move set just to beat a boss you cant react to isnt fun. ive played these games for years and even though id give ds3 a 6 or 7 out of 10 personally, id still not recommend it for most unless your doing co op with a friend. i mostly like it for end game pvp."
Negative,"EPIC GAME WORST COOP EVER !!!!!!!U FRIENDS DIE, Restart Coop Ritual .. Server Lags, Wait 10 Minutes For The Sign, Redo."
Negative,"I had heard this one was better than the other 2, but it has the same shitty controls and camera.  I am never able to tell if any of the actual game content is any good."
Negative,"Fucking god awful experience on PC. Controls are terrible,  also the games difficulty starts at a 9 and almost immediately goes to 11. The game basically dumps you in to a story already taking place without explaining much before you start. There's no proper tutorial or area where you work your way through a zone to learn the basics, you essentially get assraped out of the gate with no reach around. I absolutely can not recommend this unless your some sort of masochist or something. I got it on sale and still feel ripped off."
Negative,"Nothing wrong with the game itself, but I find the controls extremely confusing and difficult to use.  The separate camera panning and directional control are hard to use.  For me anyway it is difficult to get behind an enemy and then realign the view and direction in time to strike or react to them.  It's a shame because otherwise I would love this game.  If I could have my wish it would be this: a setting to disable the camera panning so the game always shows where the character is facing no matter what.  This isn't unique to this game: I've never liked the camera pan ""feature"".  Some games allow you to turn that off.  I wish this game would."
Negative,":- people who enjoy challenge over everything else- people who enjoy being in a toxic community:- people who like to experience a mysterious narrative in a well crafted dark fantasy world. It has that, but you will never see the end of it unless you like min-maxing attack pattern observations, and reatttempting to beat the same boss for a couple hours every day in a row. (Might be different if you have more experience in this time of game than me)- people who like to express themselves in their character build. Doing this is not advisable as it is not optimal. This game is meant to be played strictly on-meta (i.e. optimally).ps: the playtime does not reflect my actual playtime, I played this for hundreds of hours. Offline."
Negative,"Worst souls game by far.  Poise is completely disabled.  A few enemies in the late game have poise, but for the player, poise is ONE HUNDRED PERCENT DISABLED.  There is NO POISE.  So 70% of the armor choices in the game are useless.  I was lukewarm to it, and then I found out there is no poise.   Yes I know they released a statement two weeks after launch saying 'Poise is working as intended'.  They said that intentionally knowing it was disabled, and meant 'yes its not working and that's what we wanted', or they lied to trick people.  Hyperarmor (when swinging weapons) is not poise.You can literally get Havel's armor set, and go to the tutorial area, and a basic undead with a dagger poises you on stabs.  IN HAVELS SET.  Fromsoft caved to featherweight crybabies who want to solo the game naked, and figured 'if there's no poise, its easier to balance weapons'.Essentially, Fromsoft knew this was the last game, and took the easy road because they're scared of backlash from fans.  I honestly wish I could get a refund."
Negative,"DS3 is very linear with its world design and there is little incentive to explore really for any secrets in the same way that there was for DS1. You will find the environment to be very stale, boring with its choice of colors, rehash and plagurism of numerous places in DS1(Grand Archives= Dukes Archives, Undead Settlement=Undeads Berg ect) after the initial 'omg' phase ends as a new player. The lack of originality gets really annoying after a while.  The soundtrack of the game isn't very particularly good IMO with a few excepts and I find many osts to be generic with extreme repetition.   Going back to the inferiorities in DS3 what DS1 had an advantage of DS3 was that the maps within the game were very interconnected and so it didn't feel as repetitive when going through reruns. NG does not reward the player with anything new except +1,+2 or +3 rings, bosses have overinflated HP and  there are a few weapons you can only pick up(Twins Sword ex) on the second playthrough.  The difficulty of the bosses is insultingly easy; this game relies on you simply dying enough times to memorize their patterns(which are basic combos, I get it DS1 did this too, but it wasn't this easy), even the DLC bosses are a joke and can be easily cheesed. By the 2nd or 3rd play through you will be so overpowered that you can cheese the game in just an hour or two tops if you run through it. The Ashes of Andi DLC Is crap, don't bother it with it and the Ringed City is an okay DLC by the way.  DS3 suffers from being 'dumbed down' for casual players.  You will not be punished for not thinking carefully you can run past every mob if you so choose I did it and I can assure you. The lack of critical thinking that's rampant in this game where you can R1 spam and beat it in a couple hours no doubt  attracts people who are persistent with  whining in the DS3 forums(if I said it was as easy  as I did now, how come people complain about bosses?  They're really that bad. Yes, you can pool into stamina and r1 spam for days with estoc to stunlock enemies into oblivion(no, I never had this to me because I parry, but parrying is difficult).  Some examples of this whining include complaining about every boss in the game, complaining about invaders(even though they have a clear advantage), boosting about being skilled when using 4  phantoms in PVP(to carry them and in PVE) and asking what is the most OP weapons(so they don't have to think for the game).   This game very strongly encourages you to pool your stats into a strength character.  You will suffer greatly within the game if you so choose to be a mage or a dex character(you will be a glass tank throughout the game, you will die over and over and over, now people will say 'git-gud', but remember these people are overleveled and have been soul's veterans(yes, many people use cheat engine to level up fast especially and having prior exp is a factor). The reason I am saying this is that as a strength character you get access to heavy weapons that make it very difficult for you to get staggered(this is a problem considering this makes the game hilariously easy and this also is a problem on PVP). You will find on PVP many players opt to take the easy path by using heavy weapons a long with heavy armor(I did not mention you cannot upgrade your armor sets like in DS1) so its impossible to stagger them. You will also be strongly encouraged to use very specific weapons as well. What do I mean? You will find 99% of the boss weapons are useless along with many of the weapons in the game. For example, the online really good dex weapons are the Chaos Blade, Frayed Blade and Uchigata, heavy weapons for hyperarmor. For the magic users as I have played as one,  as  a mage you will find many spells to be completely useless and faith completely is terrible(there are very few good offensive miracles) so your options are limited. Anyways,  If you so feel that you become tired of PVE and switch to PVP as a remedy to this lineraity, given the problems I've previously stated with the community you will soon grow quickly tired of playing with players online. I did not mention the epidemic of encountering PVP hackers online either. Community members say they do not exist or trivialize their presence, but that's simply incorrect. I have personally encountered numerous PVP players that use infinite HP and teleportation hacks. Finally, you may also encounter  random FPS drops, high CPU usage(and no I have a very good CPU and 970) and severe lag on PVP.BTW,  if you make hostile comments I'll just remove them. I killed 40 people in the last 3 days on PVP, pretty sure im pretty good at this game.===[]=== XXXXXXXX Toddlers XXXXXXXX Kids☐ Everyone Casual (CASULS) players☐ Pro players===[]=== ☐ Potato☐ Really bad☐ Bad☐ OKXXXXX Good ☐ Beautiful ☐ Masterpiece===[]===  Full price☑ Wait for sale☐ Average☐ Refund it if you canXXXXXXX Don't do it===[]=== ☐ 90' PC☐ Minimum☑ Medium ☐ Fast☐ High end XXXXXX NASA computer===[]=== XXXXXXX You just need 2 arms ☐ Ez☐Easy to learn / Hard to master ☐ Hard (first few hours) Dark Souls===[]=== ☐ Really short ( 0 - 2 hours)☐ Short ( 2 - 8 hours)☐ Few hours ( 8 - 12 hours)XXXXX Long ( 12+ hours) Endless===[] === ☐ It doesn't have☐ Still better than TwilightXXXXXXX Average☐ Good Fantastic===[]=== ☐ Game itself is one big BUG☐ Bugs destroying the gameLot of bugs XXXX Few Bugs☐ You can use them for speedrun☐ Nothing"
Negative,"So I attacked this guy on sight because he looks totally indistinguishable from one of the tutorial enemies, dressed in black and crouching in a corner and everything, and turn out he's not an enemy, he's an NPC called something Deserter, and now every time I respawn he kills me on sight, as if somehow it was my fault? Like I, at level 9, only hurt him a tiny bit anyway? And now, without a way to ask him to forgive me, I'm doomed to be killed on sight forever? I mean Iudex Gundyr is torturing enough for me but this guy is like 5x more agile and it's just impossible. Also the game is kind enough to tell me what each button does, but decides to not tell me that NPCs exist and I can hurt them and I shouldn't? Just why?Being humiliated by a boss is one thing. Being chased and killed on sight, after every single respawn, for an infinite number of times in all eternity, by one NPC that is supposed to be on my side? This exceeded my wildest expectations on the sadism of this game. I give up. And I'm not starting over. I have better things to do in life than tiptoeing around some stupid NPCs."
Negative,"Dark Souls III was the most disappointing thing since Dark Souls II.I mean how much more could you possibly ♥♥♥♥ up the entire backstory of Souls Series?And while Dark Souls II was picked on as this weird souls game and got easily forgotten, the unfortunate reality of Dark Souls III is that it will be around. Forever... It will never go awayIT CAN NEVER BE UNDONE"

Negative,go fuck yourself miamoto or who ever you are
Negative,dont torture yourself. its not worth it.
Negative,"Alot of say about this game. I would however, not reccomend it."
Negative,"""Hey! that was nowhere near me!"" Simulator Current Year"
Negative,simply put this game sucks. For starters there is no ADP. This is very disappointing and is a major downgrade from Dark Souls 2. Next there is no gank fights which was my favorite part of Dark Souls 2. My last gripe about this game is there is no bed of chaos which is HUGELY disappointing as the BoC was my favorite fight in Dark Souls. It perfected the Souls-Like formula so early into the series. The only thing that comes close to BoC was the Royal Rat Authority. To summarize the first two Dark Souls were far superior to this game. Do not give this cash grab any money or respect.
Negative,"The controls are so awful that half the difficulty is just QWOP-difficulty: sometimes instead of attacking, your character will uselessly try to kick. Forget about ever parrying, it's not possible with PC controls. If you start an action and then get interrupted, your character will then proceed to do that action after getting staggered for half a second, whether you initiate it or not; whether doing so will kill you or not. If you can manage to find a weapon whose moveset isn't completely broken on PC, and you manage to get your character to do what you tell it most of the time, congrats! You've mastered half of Dark Souls's difficulty.Half of the remaining difficulty is utter randomness. Most bosses have a move that, if they spammed it, they would be literally impossible to beat. If you get unlucky and they choose to spam it too many times in a row, you just have to dodge it until you run out of stamina and then die. Getting past a boss fight is therefore a matter of trying it enough times that you get lucky and the boss never spams their unbeatable move too many times in a row.That makes about 25% of the difficulty actually a fun challenge. And it is! It's a very fun, ruthless, difficult challenge. You'll have lots of fun working to get better, get your timing down perfectly, understand boss moves and tells, read them perfectly, execute them perfectly, and then ... die at the last minute because they did something bullshit. The game stuttered for 200ms because someone rated one of your messages: fuck you, you're dead. The boss decided to spam its winning move too many times and you ran out of stamina to dodge it? Fuck you: you're dead. Camera decides to suddenly zoom in on the back of your head (this isn't too common, but it can happen)? Fuck you: you're dead. So it kinda ruins the fun-challenge aspect of the game anyway.And on many boss fights, every time you die, you have to spend a LONG time just running back. It's great that bosses are hard and can kill you in 10 seconds if you do something wrong (or, more likely, some of the above bullshit happens). The problem is that you then spend 60 seconds running back. When you're working on learning a boss, you should not spend more time running through empty areas and waiting on lifts than you spend actually fighting that boss. It's just stupid, shitty design for no reason.The game is really pretty good outside of boss fights, although DS3 does feel completely rail-roaded compared to DS2. There's almost no feeling of exploration at all: it's just a straight line. The whole game: a straight line. A very gorgeous, mostly fun straight line. Until you have to fight a boss, and then all the above bullshit comes right back."
Negative,crashes a lot
Negative,[EDIT]There is NO POISE.  Heavy armor is totally useless.StunLock Souls 3.

Negative,"I used to love this game until I bought a 21:9 Ultrawide monitor, then I realized how terrible Bandai Namco's support is for Ultrawide in their games.  It's completely ridiculous in this modern age they don't patch it into ANY games, like DS3, Sekiro, Ace Combat 7.Guess what?  If you use a fan mad mode Dark Souls 3 Unsqueezed and any of it's latest versions you will get permanently banned by Bandai Namco!  What a great publisher/game company.  I have no faith that Elden Ring will also include UW support because they are terrible.Also the Anti-Aliasing in this game is not pretty when playing at 1080p, it barely does anything and looks jaggy as heck.  If only they added TAA or something for 1080p users it might look a bit better but they never update the game to include anything useful.  They did patch Sekiro but no UW support for that game either."
Negative,"First off, if you have any type of integrated graphics In your cpu, avoid this game altogether, as I have been waiting since the game came out to play. Secondly from what I've seen in the community Poise is turned off by default and From says it's fine as it is. Thirdly there's the stuttering. Even if you have dual 980's, six core processor, good luck, stuttering seems to get worse with every update. It's pretty much Russian roulette if you can even play the game. And finally they don't even tell you the keyboard controls in the tutorial or anywhere, almost forcing you to use a controller. Other than all these flaws, it is an excellent game, just don't buy it on pc right now."
Negative,its really hard :(
Negative,difficulty is so high it ends up being horribly boring. Just playing the same part over an over again is so annoying.
Negative,you fucked the mods with your update nice one.
Negative,They broke pvp to get you to buy the new game. Finally they are fixing it and guess what this ♥♥♥♥ game has no cloud save I need to play it from the beginning. After 79 hours of grinding souls and finding every weapon ring etc. At least add m&k support. I'm not gonna suffer for this ♥♥♥♥ again.
Negative,"Friend dropped me because i didnt give him a dark souls trading card, im not even joking thats literally what happened.seriously this isnt a joke im deadass frlike actually"
Negative,Reminds me of witcher 3. Really not a fan of that type of game. Wish I had known before I got it. At least in skyrim you can mod it up to make it more endurable.
Negative,worst game i have ever played
Negative,"So far the worst in the series. Enemies feel more frustrating than challenging. Less attack patterns and those that remain just deal flat out more dmg or consist of many more attacks. If I can lose all my hp in one attack chain as a super heavy tank, there is something wrong.Most of the fights is just dodging everything I can despite being in a super heavy plate with a ton of HP because I still feel paperthin.And the zones? I still haven't encountered a memorable zone or one that is somehow challenging. I honestly do not even remember how I got to the point I am. It's just, bland and frustrating instead of challenging."
Negative,"Tried to play with keyboard and mouse. Reassigned keys from WASD to QWES. Game would randomly decide Q, A and E, D controlled different elements of the game. Sometimes roll would roll, sometimes it would interact. Sometimes it swapped midcombat. Scrapped that idea. Tried to play with a Playstation controller. The Dpad would randomly fire while using the left stick. Taking off the shield and weapon. Tried a different Playstation controller. Same problem.Scrapped that idea. Bought a Logitech G310. Seemed fine. Hit escape and tabbed out of the game to check something on Chrome. Tabbed back in, and the left stick was now controlling the Dpad. Without using the mode button. Unreal.I've been extremely stingy on buying any game that was built or sold on console. Going to double down on that. Can't believe how ridiculous this experience has been. Maybe it works fine on WASD. Maybe it works fine on an Xbox 360. Maybe it works great for Martians. I'm sure the content is grand and I'll get to it eventually, but I can't in good faith recommend such an initial pain in the neck."
Negative,"Even on all low, a Radeon 7870 will encounter problems past the first area. If your system can play this game I 100% recomend, but there are several egerigious optimization issues. Fuck I wanted to play... :("
Negative,This game lacks fun its just a whole lot of frustration. I don't mind difficult games but i dont  accept difficulty due to terrible controller lag.
Negative,"If you are into honing a skill through a rinse & repeat learning process. Analysing patterns in enemy attacks and perfecting your craft at a game through repitition then this is for you. I have heard great things about Dark Souls III and im sure for the right person this is a great game, but I find repeating a section in any game tedious. If you have time to burn, this game is for you."
Negative,"If you like getting your ass kicked and have no guidelines in the game, it's the game for you, otherwise I have no clue why so many praise it. Also, the game has not been ported properly to PC, when it says to press a key, even in tutorials it would show you the XBox keys, you have to go then in settings and look at bindings.In short, this game is about fighting the same mob over and over until you learn faithfully every key key that you have to press at the right time in the right order definitely not a casual game."
Negative,"Do not waste your time and money if you don't own a controller. It's a good game as long as you don't play it with keyboard and mouse because movememt and camera are too clunky sometimes. I don't want to see my fucking camera spinning out of control while finishing an enemy. Also, the developers were too lazy to translate controller layouts into mouse and keyboard layout. You will realize this problem at the beginning of the game."
Negative,It's too hard
Negative,no ultrawide support

Even a ""failed"" competitor, Lords of the fallen, which couldn't make the game not crash repeatedly, can make KB&M work. You have to CHOOSE to do a port poorly. From Software chose to."

Negative,You know this game would be great IF ANY FUCKING CONTROLLERS WOULD BE COMPATABLE WITH THE GAME CAUSE ITS UNPLAYABLE WITH A KEYBOARD
Negative,"The port for this game on PC is absolutely terrible and horrific to play. I can't get past the first boss, but on console the game is a challange but is atleast playable."
Negative,"Unless you wanna spend 100 hours learning the basic stuff or simply look it up on Google, this game is meh. They think designing a game with hidden mechanics and rooms makes it fun / challenging, it doesn't. It's just bad design."
Negative,"Updating for new users: Fromsoftware is refusing (or EXTREMELY incompetent to fix) a massive exploit that a hacker can use to gain control/brick your hardware etc.Servers ARE NOT ONLINE. Multiplayer IS NOT POSSIBLE at the time.It has been well near 2 weeks now with no updates.Elden Ring will have this same issue.Do not give this company a dime. They do not deserve it....Eh.Thats how I feel about this. (And YAY FOR THE MASSIVE AMOUNT OF BUGS THAT DEVS NEVER FIX WOOO (See cons list for what I mean)I loved 1 and 2.. This? It seems like they keep travelling further away from what made the others good, but I can't put my finger on what.. Oh, wait. It's not trying to make anything difficult in the sense of tactical. This installment is all 1 shots and every mob hits for a hell of a lot. (I played all games, I know all have 1 shot mechanics and hard hitting mobs, but this 1 kind of puts the icing on the stale cake by making most mechanics in it either 1 shot, stunlock, or just ""...what?"" moments)Short pros and cons.Pro: Still great level design, fun to explore and exploring is still rewarding in a lot of aspects.Same 'ol controls....Thats all I really have as pros compared to the other 2 game which have a lot more.Cons:-Lack of depth to combat. Very simple and mobs can be cheesed almost in the same way through most of the game. (See AI comment below)-Even more broke multiplayer (somehow) I got and stayed connected in co op /PvP MORE in the other 2 games steadily than this 1 that has DEDICATED SERVERS. (Que the ""Failed to join session"" spam cause FROM sucks at any networking and gets worse each game imo)---Regards to multi: No soul memory means to newcomers constant losers gank camping low zones with maxed estus (potions basically) to heal themselves for 3x more than the newbie can even do, let alone that loser also has 1 shotting weps or the like. Granted, these losers usually depend on 1 gimmick to get kills BUT its severely boring and annoying to kill them due to how long it takes because of the estus abuse and poor matchmaking in this regard.----No way to play just with friends. Sometimes you just want to PvE with a buddy and drink or something. Can't have that, soon as you group you get spam invaded. A lot.YOU WILL GET GHOST HIT CONSTANTLY DUE TO BAD SERVERS. I.E. someone 20 ft away hits you multiple times with a shortsword/dagger and you cannot even try to fight due to this.-Same, oddly, even 'dumber' ai. I seriously don't get how the AI gets worse as the series goes on.. I should say ""lack of"" AI honestly, All mobs act very brain-dead to a lot. Every mob can be cheesed easily and they never learn or try to advance/counter. They repeat the same 1-3 moves and thats it.-Same, dumb backstab mechanic. I honestly hate this. It isn't engaging to just circle around mobs to fish for a backstab.. and it works on nearly all the mobs in the game. Tactical depth? Nope. Do 1 thing and win game? Yep-a LOT of invisble walls when trying to shoot with arrows/projectiles. Some stairs have giant invsible walls in between the railings, some don't when they have VERY little spacing on the railing. Some railings that have no room to actually shoot though you can shoot through... see my point here?-Pretty bad hitreg/hitboxes. Multi is the worse with hitreg. The hitboxes are laughable, I see people praise them but I honestly don't get it. There are some mobs in the game you can literally hit in the head/arm with a arrow, have said arrow stick to them like it hit, and just not do dmg. Then you proceed to try shooting their toe and it works. Wtf?Also, related to mob AI. Do the lie down emote in front of some mobs, and see how many can just never hit you cause they can't aim down at all or anything. Sigh- A lot of unviable weapons for builds they are suited for. (IE FTH weps being better as hybrid weps or just used on a pure STR char for some reason.) Higher lvl and upgrades may fix this, but I'm bored to tears to bring myself to play this anymore.-Again, AI. Some mobs literally spam 1 move only.BUGS!When I got this I had to spend literal HOURS figuring out why it was only running BELOW 30 FPS and struggling to hit even 30. (I have a 1600x and a 1080Ti)Turning graphic settings off or ultra didn't change FPS, Vsync options etc, nothing. Fiddling with settings in Nvidia control panel couldn't fix it. 1 day when I launched it randomly worked at 60 FPS. Stil have no idea how it randomly started working.FPS/Controller lock and controller FPS drop bug-IF I plg in my controller BEFORE or AFTER launching, the game stutters terribly and struggles to maintain 30FPS. The ONLY fix I found for this that works all the time is having my controlelr plugged in BEFORE booting my PC upI literally can't play the game at 60 FPS unless .. I have..Controller plugged in BEFORE powering on PCWhat the shit, From. Never had issues like this with other 2.While I loved the previous 2, I can't even begin to suggest picking this up. It has some charm, but I can't even bring myself to want to beat it anymore.Its boring, unimaginitive in regards to combat/AI (somehow dumber AI) and just.. cringy with the FPS bugs I run into."
Negative,"if someone tries to tell you they enjoy the game and you should try it, don't listen..i was a very normal person but now.. i am struggling with fits of anger and despair.. i can't sleep.. not because of the game but because of ur mom.anyway, skill issue might have something to do with it, but my professional opinion would be roses are red, violets are blue ,fuck this game and fuck you too"
Negative,"game so broken on so many level and enemies are over powering af and will attack through walls, somehow manage to hit you when your obviously way too far away for it to hit, controls feel crappy and even with a controller its bad, enemies attack with combo spam hit (with game breaking damage)  that are almost impossible to dodge cause the enemies lock on to yousome peeps say if you cant get past a part, get a friend or another player to help you but thats another thing, as i said below the game is full of toxic elitist who could care less and will harass you for being a noob (and to start the first boss you have to do solo)community is full of elitist fanboys that harass you for being new to the game ( literally had someone friend me to type ""KYS TRASH NOOB"" in my profile comments 30 times)comments have been disabled due to brain dead snowflakes kept telling me to kys in the comments repeatedlygame only shows xbox controls and pc controls are binded horrorably so unless you own a controller avoid game is also capped at 60fps cause devs were too lazy to optimize the game and uncapping it gets you bannedthey ban players for using xbox controller emulators0/10 avoid this broken mess (so glad i didnt pay for this garbage)edit 2022: still garbage even with a controller"
Negative,"Overrated game with poor controls. The ""difficulty"" of this game is entirely dependent on how well you can move your slow obese character's fat ass around to block or dodge. The ""story"" in the Souls ""series"" has become progressively more non existent as the series has gone on. At the same time more people who make, frankly dumb, fan fiction have created a lore for this series themselves, saving Fromsoftware countless hours and possible millions of dollars in the process. 6/10 in 2016 3/10 in 2022"
Negative,"It's still an ok game, but it's really bad compared to previous souls games.Instead of being challenging it's just annoying - enemies feel cheap with constant barrages of instant, 360' attack and sonic jumps and it plays more like twitchy slasher, not dark souls.World connectivity used to be one of the best points about souls series, but dark souls 3 is about as linear as possible which really lowers its replayability.PvP is a circus of infinite rolling and garbage hitboxes.Overall it feels like one step forward and three steps backward compared to Dark Souls 2."
Negative,This is a really bad port. It crashes constantly and it also manages to crash the whole computer while its at it.
Negative,"screw this piece of shit game, from top to bottom its bad.  uninstalled and never touching this again.  is it bad? not really, is it dog shit? extremely"
Negative,"nope, just nope"
Negative,I didn't feel trans rights were represented enough in this game.
Negative,shit game not worth the  money. is big scam.. go by some adult contet on internet instead.
Negative,Weird controls and not very responsiveTells you to use controller buttons when using keyboard and mouseInstantly dying way too oftenCan't bind mouse buttonsRespawn points way too sparseApparently you lose your money when you die
Negative,"Very enjoyable up until the abyss watchers (very nice boss fight!), then gets worse, and every time you think it gets better it gets even worse. Just play ds1 or 2, both are an overall better experience.Update after finishing the game: meh"
Negative,"Not bad, but easily the worst Souls game. It really feels like all the previous games in the series mashed together without much thought put into it. Very linear and aside from multiplayer there's pretty much no reason to replay it which completely goes against what made the other games in the series so great. Not going to get into specifics but there's a lot of odd decisions that the developers made and the balancing is complete nonsense. Half of the equipment/spells in the game aren't even worth using - killing build variety.Unless you're a huge fan of these games and have already played the previous ones, buy literally any game in the series that isn't this."
Negative,"I wont lie, I Love dark souls 3 but why i am not recomending this game is because 1. I have been banned for 2-3 months now because I apparently had invaled game data on my account and i honestly have no idea how to fix this2. when i invade someone as a aldrich faithful it userly dosent work in the slightest because the person i am invading either is a hacker or has also been invaded by a hacker and yet, they are able to run around free and happy3. The support for dark souls 3 is compleate crap, I have contacted them several times about my ban because of this ""invalid data"" and each time they reply with this or something similar to this.""Dear Customer,We have looked into this issue further for the profile you provided us and it appears that restrictions/limitations have been placed on this account due to the modification (having invalid parameters, hacked in souls, modified level/stats, etc.) of the character(s) on your save file.Players will still be able to play Dark Souls III in “Online” mode, but the restrictions on the profile/account will limit the online interactions with other players. The Dark Souls III server team does periodically review profile/accounts that were previously restricted (to see if players have removed the data and are playing legitimately). If a player removed their data, and it did not appear during one of their periodic checks, they may lift the restrictions. However, this is at the discretion of the Dark Souls III server team. This service has no ability to lift restrictions, expedite checks nor are we provided with a schedule for periodic checks.The decisions for these restrictions on a player’s profile/account are ultimately handled by the Dark Souls III server team in Japan that are monitoring the servers for the game and our support teams would have no control or ability to change their decisions (and in general we can only provide information regarding the status of a player profile/account, whether there are restrictions and why they were placed on the account).

Negative,i thought this game was fun but it was not i spent almost my whole life playing this game and its just a waste of time and this just gets me mad assassins creed unity is better than this
Negative,"trash of porting and overall this game is the biggest piece of shit I have ever played, I don't understand why they even brought it to pc"
Negative,"Not enjoyable, can't even get past the first boss. It's just simple not an enjoyable challenge, you get frusturated really fast!"
Negative,"2 hours played, felt like 2 millennia, can't even beat the first boss, the game must be bugged. I am a really good gamer otherwise. It isn't a skill issue. Trust me."
Negative,This game is so hyped I thought it had to be good. Well imagine Diablo amounts of enemies that respawn every time you die. (Which you will). Imagine slogging through these hordes tediously over and over and you have Dank Shit 3. Not only is the gameplay lacking but the grapics are somewhere in 2008 and the interface was designed by people who dont play games. Dont buy this crap. Play real RPGs like Witcher or Baldurs Gate.
Negative,"I AM TIRED of having dick companies pretend they have actually ported something from xbox to pc.  It's a LIE.  If you're not even going to be bothered to give the altered tool tips, you're actually charging people for wasting their time.  And I shouldn't be punished for not being cynical enough.  Idiots.  At least do a half-assed job like Fallout 4."
Negative,"Fromslop, my beloved...Gorgeous visuals wasted on generic low-fantasy castles and various maze-like dungeons that are hard to tell apart from one another, non-existant storytelling or characters for me to care about (no, reading descriptions of items to gleam ""Zanzibart... forgive me..."" from some NPC in the corner who has five lines of dialogue, is not a valid alternative to traditional storytelling), and overhyped gameplay (i-frame slop as opposed to actually PHYSICALLY moving out of the way of the swing (see: Mordhau and Chivalry with how you could contort your body in various ways to dodge); weapons having a hurtbox while they're still cocked behind your back in the beginning of the swing; the camera spazzing out during certain bosses (and even regular enemies, such as the headless golem)).If I was in prison and I had this in front of me with nothing to do, no books (with actual characters I could care about and a plot that made you WANT to turn the page), no TV, no nothing? Yeah, I'd continue playing this. But when I have the entirety of Steam and libraries of other games at my fingertips, all for free? Lol, lmao."
Negative,"Be warned: Dark souls COOP system is adhoc and not a full COOP system. It is a PVP invasion system with COOP features.You must be ""Embered"" and on the same server as your friend (There is no way to tell without logging in and out over and over until you can see the summoning sign), or you will not be able to join him as a ghost to play together. You can also only play together until the host dies/you run out of EMBERS and must farm more. This is not too bad, but you should be aware of how it works. You cannot simply invite your friend to join you.If looking for a coop dungeon crawler, avoid- it is a single player game with some coop elements and not a full COOP game."
Negative,"This game isn't for everyone.  I personally cannot continue, not because it is hard, but because it is boring.  I'm doing a melee build, and there are three parts to combat: move, roll, strike.  Power attacks are inefficient and slow.  Blocking is worse than rolling %90 of the time. Parrying is unecessary. Weapon arts are a good idea, but poorly implemented.Compare this to a game that most people say is an inferior knock-off: The Surge.  While being a soulslike, The Surge had limb targeting, stamina, energy meters, and brutal executions customized to each body part and weapon type.  Combat was fast and skill was rewarding, with dodging being only half of it. Every kill was satisfying, as you ripped a peice of loot off of every common mook. DS3 has you wade through mooks as a chore, and it incentivizes simply running past its game content to get to the next bonfire or boss.People applaud the world-building of this game, with good reason. Its lore and history is deep, and some locations are attractive. The characters are likeable, when they appear. However, most enviroments are extremely drab, and the game does a poor job of telling its story. Furthermore, the levels design is questionable. As an example, one bonfire in an early level is only accessable by jumping off a cliff, and has an exit but no other entrance.Overall, I could only enjoy this game for so long before its dated and stale gameplay outweighed its likable aesthetic and atmosphere. if you enjoy a challenge for the sake of it, and are prepared to repeat the same motions for 60+ hours, go for it.  For myself, I'll pass."
Negative,"Awfully overrated and seen as one of the best in the series due to the fact that it is similar to the first, it relies heavily on nostalgia for the first with areas and NPC's from that game. It is a mostly drab game with an awful hub area, grey everywhere. It is mostly linear which makes repeat play-through's tedious and boring. The best part is that is contains some enjoyable boss fights and one boss fight at the end of the second DLC that I personally think to be the best fight in the series. Although getting to the good parts is horribly tedious. On top of this the PvP is downright horrible.If you liked the first game you may like this, just remember to praise it because Miyazaki worked on it :)"
Negative,"Review of Dark Souls IIIIf you are a console gamer, you will like this. Straight forward type maps which funnel you to your enemies in a Doritos and Moutain Dew soaked button mashing frenzy.If you are a hardcore old school PC gamer, this is a steaming pile of crap that was half ass ported to PC. Seriously, I thought they stopped that lame crap sometime in the late 2000's. I guess stupid prevails.Here I thought Witcher 3 was crap, this beat it hands down. 46 minutes of play time that I will not get back.I am not going to devote anymore time to this game, it is not going to get better.The mechanics are arcade, the keymapping is crap.Just don't waste your time. I would return this had I purchased it on steam, instead this is the flag ship game from this months humble bundle subscription...I want to return the whole months bundle based of this...I don't even care what else is in the bundle this month.21gb that I am about to free up on my hard drive. If I could click ""No, I would not recommend this game more than once, I would hammer that button like Peter North."""
Negative,"I can no longer log into the Dark Souls 3 servers, which means absolutely no online play. The value of his game depreciated well bellow the price threshold with loss of online play. Do not recommend."
Negative,The Dark Souls without level design. Play BloodBorne.
Negative,sit at bondfire crash... use a ember crash... crash... crash
Negative,Darks Souls 3 is you and Dark Souls 1 is the guy she tells you not to worry about.
Negative,Just play Elden ring Save yourself from this hell
Negative,Game suddenly crasing after 1 st bonefire also game has important optimization problems. yes game is so good but if ı cant play with 16gb ram i7 computer what can ı do about that.
Negative,"Get Dark Souls 1 and 2, they are Dark Souls, this is basically a sequal to Bloodborne in a Dark Souls setting."
Negative,The Dark Souls 3 official soundtrack is no longer available on Spotify and Youtube.
Negative,"I did not like this game. Whether or not this is a masterpiece is another story.The story: I didn't really get anything anyone ever said. It's old, medieval-ish mood is way to exaggerated for me to enjoy it, I had to pay close attention to the dialogues, this distracted me from the combat and made the experience bad. It's one thing to try and get into character; adapt the mood of the story to the historical context. But it's an entirely different thing to try and poeticize the entire game; narrative is plain boring for me.Combat: Excessively difficult. Yes, the AI is quite impressive. But the game is so difficult it ceases to be fun. Maybe some will enjoy dying 10 times trying to kill a single boss. I am not the case; if I don't see any evident progress within 4 deaths I just get tired and stop playing. Like I said, for some it may be fun and challenging, for me it's just a waste of time.The one friend that introduced me to this game was very specific when he described how the story wasn't really the point of the game, and that the battles were extremely difficult. I knew what to expect, and my expectations were in fact met. I do not like this type of games."
Negative,"I have seen some Dark Souls III gameplay recently and it looked amazing.So I decided to give it a shot. Tbh I should have informed myself better before. The game is a port from console and it seems like there have been mande no adaptations to the controls. It is basically unplayable with keyboard and mouse if you actually want to hit your enemy.(Your mouse moves the camera but not the character, since you have separate controls for that on a controller. This would be super easy to fix if the would just lock the camera to show PoV and be done with it, we do not need to be able to rotate the camera independently from our character!!)So I cannot recommend this game for PC. Because I expect a game that is sold as a PC game to be playable with keyboard and mouse."
Negative,"So I dont know why but I checked so many different forums to try and figure out what was wrong with my game. Because every single time I tried to play this game something was corrupt. I think in my last 5 hrs of game play I have sat through 20+ hrs of download corrupt files. For instance I verify my files, and it says 4 files are bad and need to be required so I am like okay thats fine, but 4 files= 14.7 freakin GB like wtf. Why is it 14.7 I loved the game when I got to play it, but Its become unplayable, and I am at the end of the game. Now that is just a problem with loading in to the game. Now while in the game I get unexplained crashes, and my friends started to know my game was messed up because I would crash when I was going througha dungeon with them. This game is supposed to be hard, but I didnt know it was supposed to be hard just trying to even be allowed fuckin play it."
Negative,Way too hard for the avarage gamer
Negative,"Absolutely Positively FUCK THIS GAME, the game is basically a grind for souls while you upgrade in a simplistic RPG style. Go fight incredible bosses with beautiful scenery. ITS SO FUCKING HARD. Not for casual players, not for egomaniacs either. If anything hurts your pride, ego, or feelings easily don't play this game. This game will literally make you break all of your expensive computer equipment. HONEST OPINION, It's a beautifully made game it's just really fucking hard... two hours 300 deaths later I've decided to refund this game."
Negative,"the game is fun, but it is as stable as an old man without his walking stick. This game hardchrashes very often. A few days ago i had 5 hard chrashes in 30 minutes.and if ur pc is not that great u can forget online mode, you will be booted off the moment you interact with any player"
Negative,Locked at 60fps. All the instructions/tutorials are given for controllers and not KB/M. Not worth playing for the previous reason alone.
Negative,This game is not fun
Negative,The Garbage server
Negative,"got banned dont know why just says ""you have been penalized"" not the only one this happen alot of people saying the same thing"
Negative,Crashes everytime you go to a bonfire after defeating the first boss.
Negative,"The game itself isn't bad, but it requires a lot of patience to go on with it, you will be very frustrated as you die again and again, and the plot is subtle, it would be better if you played it from Dark Soul's first series. The graphics are good, the music is good, but you'd better think twice if you happen to think this is an easy game."
Negative,though fun i can't recommend the game till from software fixes the online server problem. which they are ignoring despite promising they'd get them working again after elden ring was releasedthe servers have been down since jan 23rd
Negative,"I'm a casual PC player with keyboard and mouse controls and this game just didn't do it for me. I couldn't follow the plot and failed to make it very far into the first real level despite putting quite a bit time into it. I nearly quit the game in the first 5 minutes because the in game tool tips are not translated to keyboard/mouse. I've never played the previous games, so maybe you have to know what's going on from those.Seriously, I have only 3 achievements and over 10 hours in game and I have no idea how to play it or why to keep trying."
Negative,"So i buy the game. First time playing. Immediately get my teeth kicked in. The first boss, does a 6 stance combo reaches the whole map. Mind you i have  a shield, a plastic fork , and couple healing potions that take 10 secs to drink while this samuria is taking what life you just Drank to recover. I want my 60 bucks back"
Negative,"When i first come to America, my english did cause me problems. In Soviet Russia i was strong teacher, my english i know is the best in all of Petropavlovsk. My brother, Mikhail, he say to me, ""Nikolai you go to America, they make you rich like czar, take many woman as lover, kill many bear"". My brother, he is very wise, is greatest toymaker in all of Russia. So next day i wake up, sell my house, say goodbye to wife and children, and go to America to become millionaire. Then in America, I go to job interview and they say to me ""Nikolai, you are not for the job here, you are not the skills we need, your english is poor like child"". I take that man and smash his table, i say ""someday i will be greatest man in all of country, your children will wish me their father!"". That day my anger is best of me. It is then i know i must learn better english, so i buy book ""English Grammer it is for Dummies"" by Mr.Woods. Now i am perfect english grammer! I write letter to Mikhail, he write back ""Nikolai, your english is like a god, you will be millionaire soon! all of Petropavlovsk is proud for you! good luck brother! please send letter when you are president or maybe even czar! Hahaha! also, your wife is killed by bear"". So i say thanks to Mr.Woods for his book! When i am czar your family will be spared!"
Negative,"Pretty not beginner friendly, the first boss was cool I guess, not recommended for people who dislike getting beaten"
Negative,$60 game won't even launch. Crashes on startup before I ever see so much as a menu.
Negative,Very bad pc implementationshows me only controllers buttons etccant disable v-snycWhy is this on steam?
Negative,Another franchise which has turned to shit.
Negative,i cant log in also why im i soft ban
Negative,"Can't play on my computer, this is the only game I can't play in all my library, I paid full price and missed my refund opportunity being away, such a disappointment. So my score is about technicalities, it's buggy as f*?&!!! 2/10P.S.: I might rewrite a review in the future if I can actually play the damn game without being slow as an injured obese turtle."
Negative,"Uhhhh.... so I don't get all the hype surrounding this game, to me it seems like some sort of masochistic fetish game. The ""challenging"" mechanics are just bullshit, they attempt to make you die so often that you do not progress far enough to see how TERRIBLE the lore and story are... If the game was rid of pointless difficulties it would have a 20 minutes long story, pretty pathetic.The pvp system is DREADFUL, honestly, there's so many fanboys in this game that it makes me sick. How can anyone defend this joke of a game?The devs should consider a career in the fast food industry.Overall awful game, pvp is shocking and barely functioning and the pve is a fricking joke."
Negative,"I could see this game being very good however there are many key things that are absolutely horrid with this game.* Lack of any optimizations for PC* Does not screen resolutions past 1920 in width* Game insists and giving all controls for a controller instead of keyboard* Camera is extremely shaky and is nauseatingThis is the very definition of a console port, if I did not get this in Humble monthly I would have asked for a refund, there are plenty of games that are just as hard that are better optimized for PC."
Negative,"these idiots released this 'gem' on PC without basic features like fov adjustments : without proper menu conversion to fit keyboard, without proper mouse sensitivity scale. and from what I read modding FOv results in ban. what the actual fk. too bad bought this outside steam so refund doesnt apply to me, good thing I didnt bother to pay full price tor this... what a shit3 port..."
Negative,"It is necessary to explain something first. I do not recommended it because of the mechanism of this game for a new player is difficult and burdensome, but I agree that it is a good game. So do not buy it UNLESS you really love this game.    Cool bosses and nice graphics quality with few bugs. Dark souls might be the top games in this area. If you had played this game, you definitely would have been impressed by this excellent game."
Negative,This game is for fat people who like memes.
Negative,"Wait, this isn't Elden Ring"
Negative,jank spaghetti game
Negative,"Other Dark Souls games are challenging but somehow fair, this one is just frustration."
Negative,No melina no torrent no fire giant no miquella no malenia no RADAGON no elden bist no graces no maidens no ranni no tree sentinel no rykard no godskin no margit no godrick no mimic tear no mohg no radahn can't recommend
Negative,"Probably a fine game but if you're coming here from Elden Ring, you will have to realize that the PC ports of FromSoft's other games are generally trash. Buy it on a console if you have one, or honestly don't buy it at all."
Negative,"I mean, its bad, for me. But if you were an actual human being. With motivation, drive ambition, maybe it could be great. Maybe if you werent as dogshit as me, maybe you would exit the tutorial by now. 6 hours, yup. At the end of the day, while technically positive, every review is of personal experience, SO very negative and a strong no. The only way i play this now is of EXTREME self hatred, wanting to feel bad."
Negative,"Same generic dark souls stuff, harder, not better, still doesnt seem to be a story, still no explanation as to what the icons mean or what a lot of the controls are, its basically a prettier version of the original game, as was dark souls 2.Six releases and they have all been practically the same game.I am genuinely curious to see whether From Software are capable of anything else without desperately clinging to the niche that they are in.At this point its just cheap fan service and hype.Edit: An explanation of the icons can be found in game but it is far from obvious."
Negative,"This game has some of the worst multiplayer I've ever seen. It could have just had the ability to summon a friend by inviting them through your Steam friends list, or hell, even having an IP address entry screen would have been more user friendly than this. But instead you have to type the same password in your options, and place a sign on the ground, which your friend then has to find to summon you to their world. Problem being that half of the time, they'll never see it. For some reason, it just doesn't work a lot of the time. And there's no way to get around it, since the summon sign system is the only one in the game. There's literally no other way to play with your friends, and when it wants to stop working for absolutely no reason, you pretty much can't play it. DS3 multiplayer is, in a word, counterintuitive. If you're getting this to play with friends, don't get it.===EDIT 7/29===If you want to know just how bad it is in practice, I've probably spent more collective time trying to figure out why I can't see my friend's summon sign than I've spent actually playing the damn game with him. Want to fight a boss? Sure, let me just spend the next hour doing everything I can possibly think of to see your summon sign. We just had to give up at a certain point and play Stardew instead. True story.This issue is minor compared to the multiplayer being completely broken and unusable, but you can't even get the ITEM you need to place a summon sign until you beat the first boss. It's a hard boss, and that's probably because it's Dark Souls. But I can't even understand the decision from a design standpoint. You literally have to go and buy an item just to play with your friends who, for all the developers know, might be the only reason you're playing. I'm not saying the boss should be made easier, I mean, it's Dark Souls. But not having multiplayer from the beginning just serves to be annoying.But oh boy, I completely forgot to mention the WORST part. Not only do you need an item to play with your friends, not only does it lock said item until you beat the first boss, not only does the summon sign fail to show up on your friend's screen 90% of the time, but you also need to be embered just to see summon signs in the first place. If you have no idea what that means, let me explain.There's this consumable, one-time-use item called the ember. It temporarily increases your max health, and lets you see summon signs on the ground. The ember lasts until you die, and then you have to use another one to see summon signs again. You can't buy them. Or, you CAN, but a limited number of them. Once you buy a couple from a specific vendor, they don't sell them anymore. At the very beginning, you can only buy 3 before you can't buy them anymore. By giving the vendors items and unlocking new vendors, you can increase the number they have in stock. But in total, you can only ever buy 18 throughout the entire game. After you unlock and buy all 18, you can't buy them anymore.You can find them lying around SOMETIMES while exploring, but you'll burn through your embers the fastest when you're trying a boss over and over, meaning you'll never have enough to play with your friend. So if you can only buy a limited number, where else can you get them? Well, they're rarely dropped by a couple enemies in a couple locations. Yep, I'm serious. There's a super-important consumable item the game FORCES you to have, and it also forces you to grind for them. You fight enemies until you make your way to the enemy that drops it, then you kill it, HOPE for it to drop one, return to the bonfire to reload the area and respawn the enemies, and repeat forever. You can TELL it's annoying when you Google ""Dark Souls 3 ember"" and the first autofill result is ""Dark Souls 3 ember farming"". If I wanted to do chores just to be able to play with a friend, I wouldn't be playing PC games.All in all, garbage multiplayer. Even when you fulfill ALL of the requirements, the sign just decides not to show most of the time. Even using the password system to make sure you don't see anybody's signs except for your friend's. If you think you want this game for the singleplayer, by all means go ahead. If Dark Souls is your cup of tea and you think you'd enjoy this game, I'm not stopping you. But if you're only playing it because you think it'd be fun to play with a friend, then don't get it. Get a game with a better multiplayer system. Otherwise, when making your purchasing decision, assume the multiplayer doesn't exist at all. Because it feels like it doesn't, sometimes."
Negative,"Short version:Playing Tetris is more challenging.Long version:Well..I was excited about this game. I play different kind of games, some you would play for the story, or the adventure and some you might play to explore and the character choices and some games you might even play just for how beautiful the world and design look..others you would play for their game play..for the challenge..like dark souls..or at least this is what I thought I would do based on my experience with the previous DS..it turns out this one is a joke.. I would never play dark souls for the story since 75% of the time you have no idea what's going on you are just slaying beasts and trying to survive until the next bonfire..but you play it for these desperate moments when you are trying to roll avoiding the fatal hit trying to land yours..Dark Souls 3 has failed to deliver this feeling to me. I can't say that for once I was really worried about facing a boss, never felt like I'm desperate to find the next bonfire or low on supplies. There is a g0damn bonfire every 2 meters! sometimes to find the next bonfire you don't even need to use your flasks at all! actually the amount of bonfires is tiring in this game! monsters are weak I kill them with 2-3 strikes on average or 5-7 for the big boys =) weapons are not interesting I've been using the ones I started with until now (twin blades). Bosses fall down from the first fight when you have entered the fight unprepared without full health. Summoning people is useless first because the game is too easy that you'd probably never need the help. 2nd is that summoning usually fails. And 3rd the lag makes it stupid and this also applies to when you get invaded..you don't hit the other guy you try to guess where the other guy will be in the next second and hit there hoping that your prediction with the lag will even each others. Yes the graphics are nice although after being spoiled with the Witcher 3 nothing will compare but they were lovely in general, but that doesn't make for the fact that the story isn't clear (I know you have to read, this is a DS game) but the gameplay sucks too which makes the game pretty boring. I'm not sure if I would even continue playing the game since I'm not really enjoying the challenge and the NPCs are pretty boring and nothing seems to be going on anyway. I might do it because I hate not finishing games. =\ disappointment."
Negative,"""When the world rots, we set it afire. For the sake of the next world. It's the one thing we do right, unlike those fools on the outside""."
Negative,Repeatedly crashing on startup.
Negative,"People told me DS is challenging lol, it is fucking easy as fuck not really hard tbh The attack patterns are very simple lol they should randomize them so it would be a bit more challenging overall too easy"
Negative,"Ended up having to refund because the game doesn't display any of the controls for keyboard, meaning either buy a controller, memorize which keys do what, or just don't buy it."
Negative,"the basic game itself is good and funny, but the real problem is the pvp aspect of this game... it's FULL of cheaters and when they aren't present there's always people that will gank you 1vs4 no stop, without a proper duel and it's not fun generally speaking cause everyone will tryhard with the same builds/weapons... if you want to buy it for the single player then do it without troubles because it's fun and satysfing, but if you buy it for the pvp aspect don't even think to have fun... you have been warned"
Negative,Are you guys really that lazy that you couldn't add computer controls? I want my money back. Anytime I go into details with character customization. The only way I can go back is if I plug in a controller. Do not release a game on PC if you are not going to support it's peripherals. Lazy assholes
Negative,"Bascially bloodborne 2 but not as good. if you haated dark souls 2 you will probably fall in love with this game, but personally its very clear where in the game the original team left and others step in because the quality of everything just falls so fast. Personally I hate this game, and you can tell by my hour count I can make that assertion."
Negative,"I'm posting this review mostly as a heads-up to anyone thinking of buying it: a vulnerability was discovered in Dark Souls 3 that allows an invader to execute arbitrary code on your computer. While the extent of what they can do with this isn't yet known, it's entirely possible that they could use it to install malware.The bug was reported to Bandai-Namco on multiple occasions, but was never fixed (and likely never will be). Be aware that if you are playing this online, you risk having your save file corrupted... or worse."
Negative,"It's a total regression of the series. Instead of having interesting move sets, every enemy spams a constant flurry of light attacks until you back off. Boring, derivative combat that rewards equally boring spammy mage builds. What an utter waste."
Negative,"Pure mindless console peasants rubbish. Nobody on PC should play this. Shallow and playable only if you have Xbox controller. Would be winner in the competition ""The worst and laziest console port to PC"". Triple A game devs should do better. Avoid.Boycott steam until they remove censorship which leads to 1984:"
Negative,"this game is really hard, so hard it is so hard that i didnt even beat it and for this reason i must give it a 8/10"
Negative,This is so dog shit after playing Elden Ring.
Negative,"The multiplayer is complete and utter trash. It's broken and it took steps baclwards from previous games due to FROM pointlessly removing mechanics to cater to the Bloodborne plebs. I would make a 20 item list to describe everything that's wrong with the multiplayer, but I will let you try it instead. That should make up for the pain and misery you won't experience in PvE from this faceroll of a game. The netcode seems like it was written by computer science interns who studied at community colleges. This game ruined my hopes and dreams and gave me cancer.Blood Souls/10"
Negative,good game for playing multy but no online claud save and its only local save and if you reinstal windows or lose date you have to start from begging.you cant get item from other player becase  for 98% you will get bann for 10 days after deleting your charechter and secend time is permanent.
Negative,"I've played many games where people kept raging about them being bad console ports, and never had a particularly big problem with any of them. Most were clunky but manageable; but THIS goes beyond ridiculous. I literally had to alt-tab and google what the menu keys were because I couldn't use the menus on PC (HINT: it uses Q/E instead of Esc/Enter); all of the tooltips use xbox controls, and the way the control scheme was designed you CANNOT play the game with a keyboard and mouse.Thankfully I have an xbox controller lying around, but if you don't have one and don't plan on buying one I absolutely suggest you DO NOT get this game.EDIT: After having spent considerable time playing the game I've come to realize it's perfectly playable with KB/Mouse (although I highly recommend a 4 button + wheel mouse); but for me this was only after I mastered the controls to the game so I knew exactly what I was looking for when browsing the keyboard settings.The bottom line is the game itself is quite solid and well worth playing, but the port is unforgiveably bad in ways that could easily have been fixed (such as properly displaying KB/M instead of xbox controls on PC when no controller is plugged in); that makes me keep my negative rating."
Negative,"I'm not gonna sugar coat anything. But, as a rpg this game is awful. From so much input delay, a lack of a propper leveling up system, level grinding feeling like it does nothing even after, battleing enemies for 30 minutes. An never once go from level 7 to level 8.   As a rpg this game fails at the most basic rpg mechanics. I really wanted to love this game. But, after playing many good rpgs. Dark Souls 3 is by far the worst rpg game out there . I can enjoy hard and broken games. But, the praise for this game is unjustified by the get good crowd.   This game is just not worth the money , Alot of patches need to be done. Before, I could even recommend this."
Negative,"There really is two fundamental reasons I wouldn't recommend this game to anybody, and especially not anybody who enjoyed any of the previous creations of dark souls.The first of which is that the community for invaders is absolutely absurd, they talk about how it isn't fair to them that they get prioritized into rooms with multiple white phantoms while simultaneously hiding behind every wall of NPC enemies they can find. The best way to counter this is a seed of the giant's tree. though if you didn't know where to get it, i.e. you are new to the game you would likely miss that it's literally in the firelink shrine if you go up the staircase to the right of the door. It becomes a staple to use it every time you get invaded though wait until they go into their 'hide in the mobs' strategy as it only lasts 45 seconds. I had to use it when someone decided to ambush me in a pack of basilisks so I let him get curse. If that was you, I hope you enjoyed and if you want to complain about how unfair it is as an invader to deal with this you can go jump off a bridge. Some people want to play dark souls for challenge and fun, not to show off their perfect overpowered pvp build. However, unfortunately due to the way the game was created we have to deal with it.Secondly, I can't even enjoy the game with my friends half the time I'm slogging through enemies in a state where I can't get invaded because no jolly cooperation in this game just soulless single player. I don't know why they even put in a multiplayer aspect. If you try to be alive you will be invaded in certain areas immediately, so often that literally as soon as I came to life it was ""Red phantom DoucheNozzle"" has invaded. I wish their names were not this blatantly stupid but no.All in all the combat can be kind of fun but can be exceptionally annoying at times as it very easily turns into a memorization game. Honestly, would recommend any other souls game."
Negative,WOW what crap played through all the others was excited about co-op but others enter as phantoms get 1 heal can't rest at bonfires.It costs souls for a player to join you and everytime you die you have to repeat the PITA process over.This could have been so much better.Plus the controller only icons tries to force you into playing with a controller or use a guide to translate to mouse and keyboard I had forgotten bout that aspect of these games.No thank you I choose to play games the way I want.
Negative,How the fuck could this game still be on the store? It crashed my pc multiple times on startup there are youtube videos with so many different tricks to get it running it's ridiculous. Buy it on console it's not worth the hassle.
Negative,this game so trash it doesnt make sense it just stupid 9yo saying 'I aM A dArKSoUlS VetErAn'  no its just trash worst game ever.
Negative,>opens game>its in xbox controls>cant invert back to pc>refund
Negative,this game is way to hard
Negative,"July, 2020If you haven't bought the game yet. DO NOT BUY! As of this writing it is completely over run with hackers who force banned items into your inventory.  Fromsoft is doing nothing to correct the problem so don't give them one penny. You'll end up paying and get banned permanently in less than a week."
Negative,">Play Dark Souls III online>Almost every other player is a stiff ghost hoverboarding into a telekenetic oneshot>The rest are hacking their way from the Pontiff Sulyvahn bonfire into a 1v4 gank oneshot-fest>Try the duplication glitch so I can get into pvp level and buy some rope firebombs>Get b&>Realise that the online pvp was shit anyways if you don't choose 1 of 3 weapons>Uninstall the game and wait for FromSoft to re-release the game for full price, but with less broken code and different enemy placements"
Negative,i played this game for the nudity tag and i dont see any gay porn yet so i was lied to[EDIT] i hate this game i cant even launch elden ring without a white screen on startup so i wasted 60 dollars i hate you fromsoft and eat my poop [EDIT EDIT] iamgoinmgt   to get a new graphgics cafrd soon and i will try to see if elden ring works electronic art you are still a big poop poop for not letting it wrok with my grafickx fcard
Negative,"WOW. This game is so far behind Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2 it's astounding. Besides the obvious visual upgrade (which is nice), everything else about this game just feels... strained. Combat is no longer smooth and skill focused, but the same difficulty with facreroll stupidity thrown in. It's not even a matter of difficulty; the AI has been programmed to 'always on, 100%'. There are no openings. There is no skill based dodging, attacks hit everything. There is no learning the opponents moves, they each have dozens they can chain endlessly in any order. This game took a great concept- a difficult game that you expect to die in, but can be beaten with perceverence and skill and turned it into a luck based madhouse."
Negative,"I get that a lot of people love this series. So I will begin by saying that it just wasnt for me; someone who has played most RPG's to death especially the Witcher. With that said this is my take on it. The controls are clunky and shitty. This is a sloppy shitty console port with zero thought put into how the PC experience will be. I have controllers but what other RPG's do you play with a controller? There IS NO 21:9 SUPPORT. It's 2017 and I can play most games (I.E Skyrim with the help of flawless widescreen) full screen but not this. So it looks like the sloppy dog shit mess it is at 1920x1080 instead of my native 2560x1080. The textures on the rocks and field look like runny baby shit. Save points are a nightmare and with zero guidance from the tool tips for the controls; pressing a wrong button is unforgiving. I will just finish with this: It wasnt how hard the game was that made me quit, it was how hard the devolpers fucked everything up that made me quit."
Negative,"Dark souls. What can i say? ITS PIECE OF SHIT.if tou want play like onetime with you friend. Only for 1 passing-its fun,IF YOU NOT BE BANNED FOR...FOR FUN. This ""nice"" game can ban you for no reason. Because you not lucky or some hax play with you or try kill you. GAME JUST FU****G BAN YOU. If you character was deleted because you reinstal windows or something else happend-you 90+ hours ingame will be useless. Becase game dont have CLOUD. OR YOU WANT PLACE SAVE IN CLOUD? HA. HA. You be banned! Why? BECASE YOU HAX. Nice anticheat software."
Negative,not fun at all
Negative,its a little hard :(
Negative,Very difficult game to figure out. Lost interest trying.
Negative,Terrible PC experience. The Screen-tearing is attrocious and I had to stop playing after 45 minutes with a massive headache. Why can't I go over 60hz on my 165hz monitor? I have a GTX 1080 and doubt that the GPU is the issue.I played on PS4 for over 40 hours and was hoping I could have a better experience on PC with mouse and keyboard. NOPE! They didn't even bother swapping the keys in the tutorial so you can figure out how to do anything. I gave up after 30 minutes of trying to figure out the controls and had to watch a youtube video.
Negative,"Extremely laggy online, invasion matches lvl20 invader against lvl 80 host,no dedicated pvp arena, and (due to input lags and online latency) parrying is not functioning.P.S. Input lag in single player is measured about 100-250 ms. P.P.S. Can we just have DS1 with upgraded graphics and NO gameplay changes? Also, where do I get my money back?"
Negative,"55 hours to beat this game with all bosses. In first two games I havent even scratched them first 50 hours. The game took a direction to Bloodborne, story is absolutely atrociuos, Miyazaki burried all the good mechanics of the previous games, fights feel just spongy (enemies are boring with a ton of health, no technics or tactics). Its just big disappointment."
Negative,"Runs like absolute shit, crashes all the time even after fixing it with fan based stuff as best possibleGame could be fun if it also didn't manage to ignore a perfectly fine i-net connection and give me lag in every invader scenario"
Negative,dogwater. from hitboxes to both UI and level design.might give it another chance in the future.
Negative,Sorry heaping POS......  Why sell as a PC game if it is not even a legit port to PC.  If I wanted subpar console games I would own a Console. Steam needs to add a new category for Console ports.
Negative,No possibility to change controller prompts to keyboard prompts.Don't bother buying unless you are planning on using a controller.
Negative,A shit of game. Tried to play with friends just for fun and I get retarded people invading me ALL the fucking time in the new people zone and broke my entire gear... SHIT OF GAME
Negative,"If you like hard games, go for it, it's like beating your head against a wall over and over again. Seems like a cool concept, but it's just brutally difficult, definitely lives up to it's reputation."
Negative,"Game is summed up in one word, dissapointing.Biggest complaint in this game is the linearity.  No sense of freedom whatsoever and the small amount of 'side quests' with NPCs isn't enthralling at all.Once you get past the initial honeymoon phase you realize this game is lacking in replayability compared to it's predecessors.  PVE isn't challenging at all, oh wow more mobs so hard.  PVP is a borderline joke compared to DS2, pretty much every invasion consists of a gankfest where you need to be absurdly methodical to the point of it being more a chore.  Disconnects are a common reward for an all but certain victory."
Negative,"- With steam link and TV: graphic is not that good- Camera control with Xbox controller is the main fight, not the bosses or any other enemy- I had to YouTube how to jump... i mean.. really? And that YouTube video had over 50k view for a reason.- Its more like a trial and error, but mainly pattern memorizing. You cant rely on reflexes, because you are slower than most hard hitting enemy. If that's your idea of fun, then sure, its fun.- Dead enemy lie on the floor and act like a paper doll. Kills the mood hard for me...- I cant really ""feel"" my character. I mean, there are some games where you really feel its a heavy armored hard hitting badass with slow reflexes. Here.. i don't know. Its just pattern memorizing. I cant feel like its real.. same issue as the dead enemy stuff. I guess its bad physics.- Character movement and attack needs a lot of ""get used to it"" And this is the other way they made the game hard. Its just not natural rhythm/movement at all.- Game menu feels like a low budget 20 years old game.- Most trash mobs are the same color as the environment. Is that something how you should make a game harder? Really? Wow.. how creative! (And yes, you have to remember where the trash is...i mean, there are much better memory games if you want that...)I was really hoping i was wrong not buying this game earlier, because i love the souls like games. But i did buy it now, and at least i know i was right. If you watch videos before you buy, and you are not sure you will like this or not, then i suggest you not to buy it. If you are happy to invest your time and accept the flaws for this price, then sure. I do respect the game because it made a new line of challenging melee combat games, but I'm not sure if this game would come now, without the 1-2 and hype where it would end up. For me, i gave it a few go, seen some bosses, killed a few, then realized: this will be it. This is all, but with more pattern to remember..What i love is the dance like melee combat what feels more tactical than just a simple hack and slash. And i was expecting that experience. And what i mean by that is the feeling of  your character, stepping in the right time and hitting at the right moment. This somehow cant deliver it.. I need to keep searching..."
Negative,"This is the WORST Dark Souls experience one could ask for. It is my own opinion however, but if you enjoyed Dark Souls 1 or 2, you might not like this game. Do not buy it or waste your time. Find a friend who will let you try it for free then go from there. I was miserable playing this game and do not want to finish it.thanks"
Negative,"Roll, Slash, Roll, Slash. Die, run back collect souls. Die, run back, die run back. Barely any campfires to save progress. So all you do is repeat the same part over and over. When you die all enemies respawn too. It seems the only way to beat any enemy is to roll behind him, every single time, same move!! Just so repetitive and dull. Played 5 hours and can honestly say it didn't enjoy it at all. So bored of this game."
Negative,"I purchased this game primarily for the PvP and secondly for the co-op. I've got 40 hours logged and I estimate that 30 minutes of that has been spent in multiplayer because the shits not working. It's buggy AF. I'm sure it'll be a great game when they get it working, but until then it's one big session of ""Summoning phantom. Unable to summon phantom"". Very annoying to say the least."
Negative,I fought with that katana guy about 1 hour and deleted game. Dodged him for 2 minutes and hit but cannot kill...
Negative,idk how to beat gundyr
Negative,Lazy console port with poor controls (at least with mouse/keyboard).  Sound appears to be messed up.  Simply too hard to be fun right from the get go.  Linear.  Don't waste your time.
Negative,-_- I bought this game as it have multiplayer support i can't even connect damn ithow do i refund this?
Negative,"Too easy, buy remastered instead"
Negative,"First boss is way too difficult. Very linear progression, you must defeat x boss in order to access the next area, no work arounds. Not open world. Cannot jump. Feels like there isn't much content overall, as compared to elden ring. No map at all, i get that it comes with this genre of games, but it's honestly and unnecessary annoyance. Elden Ring basically fixed all my personal issues with this game and is imo perfect. Edit: Cannot jump freely."
Negative,"I like this game, I've played it a bunch on PS4. The PC port, however, is awful. I had to fight with various settings to make the game stop registering my PS4's gyro controls as a camera movement option, and even then I'm experiencing issues that I can't find fixes to, or fix myself. Controlling the camera is a nightmare, as it's hyper sensitive, even when set to zero sensitivity. I had an issue somewhat similar to this in the game ""Absolver"", which was caused by the game already recognizing my controller, and the Steam controller support at the same time. I was able to resolve this issue by just deactiving the controller through Steam and using the game's built-in controller support. That doesn't work for Dark Souls 3 though, because it doesn't recognize my controller by default, so I have no idea why it's doing this.There's another issue where ambient sound, like the sound bonfires make, cuts out and returns in few second intervals. Not a game-breaking bug, but one that's irritating enough to make me not want to play. There's no excuse for any of this, as Dark Souls 1, while buggy and with its own issues, is playable even without DSfix. Same with Dark Souls 2, which has very few issues at all from my experience playing it.In conclusion, you should play this game, I like it a lot, but not this version. If you have anything else that Dark Souls 3 is on, buy it for that.EDIT: After uninstalling and reinstalling the game, the weird audio bug stopped happening, and using the program DS4 tool made my controller work normally. I don't know, get it if you want, still a good game.EDIT 2: The ambient sound bug is back again out of nowhere, screw this port, and screw Fromsoftware for not fixing it."
Negative,"I'm sick of games that add ""clunky controls"" and a lot of limitations in guise of making the game ""difficult"". The learning curve is really all about getting around your bass-ackwards control scheme? Not worth the sale price even."
Negative,Have fun or die trying.
Negative,I died one million times. bed geme
Negative,Singleplayer- I have no wordsMultiplayer- I have no wordsThis is the game for players who want the game to rape them until they love it
Negative,"no poise,useless armor and unbalanced pvp"
Negative,still a bad gaem
Negative,"dafuq literally just got cheesed and lost all my souls, dafuq is bloodlosscrap and toxic crap cheese game"
Negative,Poorly optimized.  Crashes at first bonfire.  Wait for several patches before considering.
Negative,"Great game, however for right now this is going to have to be a negative review. Skip all the other reviews and listen up kiddos, the games broken right now, and quite frankly I don't think From cares. Not one bit actually. This review is of course subject to change, however the games magics are so broken right now that they do petty damage, im doing this for my mage bro's and my sun bro's right now. Fix your game From!"
Negative,The series is amazing this game is great as well but the PC port is one of the worst abominations I have ever seen. The white screen/black screen crash on start up issue that has been in the game since late 2016 still is a rampant issue and have yet to see any ways to fix or any updates that address the issue. I cannot recomend this to someone on the PC.
Negative,"I... don't like it. don't get me wrong it's a great game, but it doesn't have the magic that the other entries in the series have, at least for me. And look, I 100% understand why people consider this the best souls game but for me, I just don't feel it. let me get the positives out of the way first. This game is has a MASTERPIECE of a story and is the perfect way to end the series lore wise. The visual design of the world is incredibly good and the overall atmosphere is pretty much perfect. The boss design is much better than elden ring's tbh. Now, what made this game fall short for me. The world design and the boss fights. Before going into this game I kept hearing it had the best bosses in the series, but honestly it just doesn't cut it for me. Overall I found them to be great visually and lore wise, but they were just kinda plain gameplay wise. It only took a few tries for 90% of the bosses, with me even being able to first try a few. I'm gonna do another full playthrough before I fully break down exactly why I didn't like them, and I'll edit this review when I do. The other problem I have is the way the world flows. It simply doesn't. A lot of times you'll get to the end of an area and expect there to be a shortcut to the next area, but most of the time there simply isn't one and you'll end up having to go on a massive backtrack to find the path to the next area. Another great example of this design is when you get to the first area. Instead of walking there from firelink shrine (which looks great btw) you just warp there. and that is how you get to most areas. It's not an inter connected world like ds1 and ds2 for the most part, which is what made ds1 and ds2 so special to me. overall a good game, but it's not for me. comments are open so feel free to tell me why I'm wrong lmao"
Negative,DS2 > DS3
Negative,duhh from software duhhh
Negative,Used to be able to play the game now whenever i launch all i get is black screen fix your shit
Negative,this game is so irritating by the third area it isnt even fun at this point. Glad i bought this on sale
Negative,Shit game made my monitor break...
Negative,"the most brain damage game if u hate yourself, play it"
Negative,"Would not recommend at all on PC--the game is an incredibly clunky console port, and it's clear there was no thought put into control schemes for keyboard and mouse play. I played for 30 minutes and gave up out of frustration, it was that awful. As someone who had been looking forward to playing this game for years, I'm really, really disappointed that there was no effort put into the PC version..."
Negative,"This PC port is... so terrible.For these reasons: 1. The controls lag horribly using keyboard and mouse, and are unreliable. Dodging, kicking(wtf), and so on, are slow and clunky when compared to a controller (gross).  2. The camera is especially FAST. Even at the slowest setting, its so fast that Hermes is jealous as heck. It's just hard to control with accuracy, which makes it frustrating, but also dizzying.If you can get past those factors (which are mission critical in a game like dark souls) then, its probably pretty fun."
Negative,"it's not a bad game but it has a lot of problems!Im amazed that the crash rate, the first 20 hrs i had a about the same amount of crashes.framerates sometimes goes to 0 during area transitions, some times randomly when you turn view camera and it may result in the game crashing. By turning the lighting settings to low you can reduce the amount of crashes, but thats it.Its fullscreen mode is windowed fullscreen, not sure why they dont have a none windowed mode, would give a boost to framerates for a lot of people.Alot of the areas have ""holes"" basicly u can peek behind the textures, or random texture is floating somewhere near where its suposed to be, or statues that are not on the ground but just floating above it so you can see behind the texture. Seen too many enemies just sidestep off ledges and die, literally just sidestepping off the edge, not kicked nor when they do an attack, just sidestepping of the edge. It could have been the developers feelings that has manifested in the ai, I would be depressed if I released any code in this state too.Dont invest money in it until its fixed tbh, shouldnt reward these half assed ports, safest bet is just to wait until the re-released polished version gets here, because they will make that since thats the new form of dlc: make somewhat working version of the game(just a little shitty, not so much reviews get too bad), re-release better version with less bugs all dlc included and a few reskinned and recycled items etc. for maximum profits."
Negative,Makes the first one look like a good port.
Negative,"This game isn't a dark souls game, it's a piece of shit. DS2 was literally better in every single way.  You wanted bloodborne for pc here you go."
Negative,I couldn't even get past the tutorial. Thanks guys.
Negative,if you want to play online co-op have fun being invaded by fatties who are geared up the wall.
Negative,spend 60$ and after 2 hours trying to fix it cant launch game am going to try to refund tomorrow
Negative,"After I'd finished DS2 (no DLCs) I couldn't wait for the next installment in the series. Having played it recently up until Farron's Keep, I have to say I'm not amused. It's a good game, but doesn't set itself apart from DS2 - just the same old grind, which after a certain age, I guess I grew tired of."
Negative,"DS3 requires less skill but more knowledge than previous games. Its dissapointingly easy for experienced players and unnecessarily unapproachable for new players. In my opinion From Software made all the wrong decisions. Also ""balancing all the gear"" to make all the gear viable or as i would say: ""removing most of the fun from the game"". If you are new to soulsborne games, dont start with this game. If you are not new, why are you even reading this?"
Negative,"Although the game has a lot of content and surely is rewarding here and there I still can not recommend playing it.it still has the same problems games before had. Camera, convoluted inventory system, auto-aiming PvE enemies.On top of that PvP demands from you to invest even more time ""outside"" of the game in forums, wikis and whatnot to even stand a chance with items suitable. The balancing is and continues to be horrible, it favors specifics you need to learn from out-of-game research and even worse a good PvE setup is not a good PvP setup.On top of that the Bosses lack of originality and interesting mechanics. Auto-aiming attack-spamming camera defeating badly animated hunks of polygons.remember the Tower Knight in Demon Souls? Yeah, nothing like that ever coming around.I just don't see the difficulty as everyone else seem to, it's unfair, badly programmed difficulty. It's not difficult because you lack skill, it's difficult because the game-mechanics itself hinder you.You fight against the game more than you fight against the enemies in it.I have expected more from a third season of this game honestly, especially for this price (including DLCs)"
Negative,"I have beyond the recommended requirements, and then some... And this game does not run smooth, even on poor quality. Even in windowed mode. Do not give these people money until they fix their game.UPDATE: Hey so like 6 years later I'm updating my review. Turns out the problem I was having before was that this game does not support SLI. So, I was forced to run it with only 1 GPU instead of 2. Either way, I went through the game and I was very underwhelmed, I'm sad to say.They have turned Dark Souls in a giant PVP arena to satisfy the fight club reddit losers who only want to play to get to like, a bidge or something.. Some crappy spot in the game where they can just repeatedly summon each other over and over infinitely and kill each other.Also, they allow you to summon like 19 people in this game. So none of the bosses are hard because you go in to all the fights with an army every single time, or you go in to them solo and they blast your ass hole shut with a pepper grinder.Still cant recommend it. OG Dark Souls is still better. Dark Souls 2 is also just as good as the first. So get those instead of this."
Negative,"TL;DR If you enjoy looking at Google and loading screens, more than you like gameplay, this is your game. If you're not a masochist, then there are more fun games to play than this.Yes, eventually you can get good at the game, but do you have time to waste, making progress inside a closed system, while not having fun? I don't.On recommended graphics settings or even low the game can stutter in the most inappropriate moment.No Keyboard + Mouse tool-tips, you have too look it up in the menu or online.Inconvenient control scheme on KB/M and Controller.No in-game pause, can't even go to bathroom while playing, if you're not at a checkpoint.Bad menu structure, probably the most serious challenge for a beginner. You'll have too look things up (twice as much if you're on KB+M).Poorly explained/unintuitive mechanics. You'll have to look things up to play.Toxic community. Even if you'll look things up online you'll be ridiculed and mocked.Stiff animations, no animation cancelling, very technical gameplay. It's intentional, I know. It still sucks. (If you feel the itch to tell me how wrong I am, kiss my ass).You'll likely get banned if you try to manipulate the game in any way, even if you only play offline. So you can't even play on your own rules, just to see the story. (technically you can, but the effort is not worth it)"
Negative,"TLDR: PC user finds this controller ported game unplayable, and unfun.Bizzare and convoluted port from controller to PC. Unplayable. I should not have to figure out what key is the equivalent of ESC in every PC game ever made. Why is it Q in this game? Movement feels very much like a console controlled character that lacks the precise control that a mouse and keyboard has. Even after tweaking configuration, it feels like an undeveloped broken arcade game for kids. Walked through the first area and it's a close off tunnel. Zero exploration. You can't just walk over there, or climb that rock face. You must follow the road. If you attempt to step backwards, the default configuration is to face away from your opponent, and he stabs you dead instantly. It's stupid on a fantastic scale."
Negative,I don't like this game.
Negative,not as good as das 2 or 1
Negative,The only game I have ever received a Steam refund for. It felt like a grindy game of Simon Says. I can see why some people like it but it's not for me.
Negative,This game  is a piece of hot garbage.
Negative,THOS GAME IS ASS
Negative,I played for 21 mins. Game was awesome besides that you couldn't switch so it had the keyboard and mouse information. It kept telling me to press A and B and down arrows. I tried to switch it but was unable to. Dont recommend this game unless you want to play with a controller.
Negative,"After playing and finishing the game and trying out new builds and reading a lot about Dark Souls and its creation process, I can confidently say that Dark Souls 3 has even less in common with Dark Souls 1 than Dark Souls 2. The entire Dark Souls series seem to have changed directors and team who works on it after the first one and the original team has moved on to make Bloodborne and is currently working on Elder Ring as Miyazaki seems to be uninterested in creating sequals. However as he stated himself and as is apparent from the game, he helped in creating story for this game as the story of Dark Souls 3 expands on story of Dark Souls 1 and gives the players a better explanation and finishes it. This is without a doubt the best part of the game(atleast for someone who really enjoyed DS1 like me). In summary the new team who has been working on the series was told by the company to make the games harder as that became their selling point after DS1 success. However this was never the point of DS1 as Miyazaki stated. DS1 wasnt difficult for difficulty sake, its difficulty came from way the creators wanted the player to become immersed within the game world. As the new teams goal was to simply add difficulty to the game, this immersion together with clever design of the game gave way to difficulty for difficultys sake, overblown fan service, forcing players into new game + to make them play the game more and straight up copied assets from other FromSoft games.This have has nothing to do with the inpiring game that DS1, this game is just attemp by the company at making more money off the popularity of the first game. While the game certainly isnt terribly it cant even come close to how good DS1 was and still is.If I were to choose one thing about DS3 that is the worst, it would definetly be the combat and I honestly dont understand the lack of commentary on this. The combat and sped up significantly but they completely forgot to make up for this in the game. There is an overbundance of big enemies who rush you or jump on you and keep relentlesly pressing on and the result of that for my playthrought was that about 80 percent of my deaths were me getting stuck in a wall with my camera glitching, meaning I was unable to see what is the enemy doing and dying. And its not just enemies. There bosses like that, for example the demon twins(demon prince) And especialy when it comes to boss fights, is where the poor decisions in developing this game come to the light, since most bosses in this game are so fast and can so easily turn and catch up to you, what it means is that they essencialy completely got rid of any strategy when it comes to dealing with them, where you stand doesnt matter, where you move doesnt matter, all you are left with is attack and roll and this is what they thought of as game being more difficult. After my fight with Gale I can say that its a great way how to make the game more boring. Its like we are moving into a call of duty category with this game where the directors thought that adding epic sound and visual effects to a 10 minute boss fight where all you can do is roll and attack, would make it impressive and memorable, you are not making a movie geniouses**There are things in this game that made me decide to give it a temporarily thumbs down, as I dont aprove of these design choices1. There are a few endings to the game. However to get certains endings, you have to complete quite elaborate quests that dont really tell you how to finish them or how you might fail them and for whatever reason, it is very easy to do things in the world that will fail them, like progressing in the game. Yes one of the quests will literaly punish you for progressing in the game and once you did that, there is no way around it which leaves you with three options- -Either your restarts the gameOr wait till new game +Or you play the entire game using wiki to know what you are doing+ Since most people wont know why did they fail the quest(or wtf even happened to their game in particular), the natural response is to pull up a wiki and figure it out, which in turn spoils a lot of the game for the player.It is very poorly executedLooking at these this, I believe that since the solution is to restart or starts a new game +, these choices have been implemented to artificialy lenghten the time people play this game, by forcing them to replay it. This is however at the cost of overall quality of the game.2. The lake with giant shooting crossbow arrows. Worstly designed area in the gameThe first giant archer was kinda neat. It was new and extremely cinematic so I can forgive it the fact that the giant could see you through objects and his arrows followed you, sometimes hitting you through objects.But here it is again, which is already not good but its horribly executed aswell. First of the giant shoots a barrage so its like 4 arrows in a row. Second the area is huge and empty. Second the only way to dodge the arrows is to either roll or hide behind trees. Meaning the natural and most logival thing is to just keep rolling the entire time you are there.Also the giant crossbow also has a clear position above you, but will shoot even if visualy it isnt able to. It will sometimes hit trees and sometimes hit you, its pretty unconsistant.And most of all, when you fight the giant worm, the arrows fly throught the worm, I could honestly forget the game all the above but not only being able to see the arrows thanks to the worm being in the way but also the arrows going throught the worm is horrible, immersion breaking, bad design.3. Constantly screaming enemy in Irithyl dungeonThis one is minor but still, no reason for it to exist. Hearing him screaching for the entire time I was there wasnt scary, it was annoying and immersion breaking.4. The bosses have tendecy to stun lock you into a corner where your camera glitches and lack of vision ensures a certain death.5. You can die from fall damage while wearing the ring that protects you from all fall damageAfter futher testing, the ring is completely useless expect for anor londo roofs maybe and some small jumps6. The whole smouldering lake area, giant crossbow, first time I got completely lost in a darksouls dungeon because all rooms look the same + there is an enemy that one shots you with his fire spell that is supposed to give you damage over time as you stand in his spell but the damage recieved was so fast it instantly melted my entire healthbar even with ember on and 30 vigor before I even managed to roll7. The combat seems clunky Game is not optimized for many of the enemies (monsters mainly), they tend to pin you to the walls of the level and even their bodies alone tend to completely cover up your whole screen once they get close, which gets even worse when the camera is pinned agansts a wall.Things that I believe were designed well -1. DLC contains a way how to get infinite amount of most rare gems. (big +)2. Most quests are somewhat backtrackable although I were only able to do it with the help of wiki (minor +)3. Main story lines are really well done while still staying true to its dark soulsy minimalism. Interesting dialogues and even different music in some areas depending on the path you chose aswell as some (very limited) character development. Exceptionaly well executed4. Design of the world on a large scale.This is at what I believe DS3 is best in the world right now. The whole world is designed that you can see it from high enough locations"
Negative,Made me smash my monitor
Negative,i suck at this game
Negative,"really bad pc port, unberable stuttering on a system above rec requirements.Not an isolated casecan reconfirm after switching to 6700k and 1070"
Negative,"Play Dark Souls 2 instead. It's alot better, and worth your money more than Dark Souls 3."
Negative,this game has no cloud save no customer support no assistance with false banns i would suggest to never buy this game ever and to never buy from the company
Negative,Game sucks. I will uninstall and never play it again.
Negative,help i thought i was free
Negative,The devs have no concept of continuity and any semblance of a coherent story has fallen to the wayside. They're either making references to the other games for fanservice or they're pulling shit out of their ass that makes absolutely no sense. The most egregious example I can think of off the top of my head is when the player returns to an area from the first Dark Souls game and they couldn't even be bothered to copy the architecture correctly. Entire mountain ranges and sections of the buildings are inexplicably gone with thousands of feet of vacant air in their place.
Negative,"pointless shit: I wrote a DaS1 review because I felt strongly about it. I didn't write one for DaS2:SotFS because I didn't feel strongly about it. I am writing this one because I do feel strongly about DaS3Dark Souls 3 is truly mind boggling, from area's filled with enemies that never stop attacking ganging up on you making encounters RNG since your chance of fighting them is determined by if they are attacking in sync or not (and yet DaS2 has the reputation for huge ganks) to seemingly hating its own existence and wishing it was just DaS1 with its near constant call backs to 1 that never serve a purpose other than what the callbacks to half-life 1 in half-life 2 where for, they are there you make you think of the game you enjoyed so the game you are currently playing doesn't have to try to be good, I mean, how could it be bad? It is Dark Souls 3 after all!While DaS1 and DaS2 had far and few inbetween moments where enemies would be hiding above you or around a corner to gank you, Dark Souls 3 is a porn game for people who love to get fucked hard in the ass by enemies they would have to watch someone else play first to stand a chance. It also shares a common problem with DaS1, DaS1 had a pretty interconnected world, but what is the point of this world if the end result is the player running back and forth long distances because fromsoft where too lazy to make proper shortcuts and gave up part way through with the warping later on? DaS3 has no huge interconnected world, but still has horrible shortcuts that make the player doubt the IQ of the fromsoft team who worked on this game. What was the point of the elevator shortcut at the bonfire right after dragonslayer armor if there is going to be the elevator that leads to Lothric quicker? Why not just remove the quicker shortcut and make the one closer to the bonfire better by removing the needless shit infront of the boss?So many enemies (and bosses!) now act totally differently from DaS1 and DaS2, while in 1 and 2 the slow methodical combat was engaging (when it worked in DaS1) and rewarding, in DaS3 almost every enemy with a health bar that takes more than 2 swings will attack 5 or 6 in a row, and than give you a picosecond to punish them before they put their shield up or are back to attacking again, combine this with fighting multiple at the same time and its a blessing this game is rather short.So. If the game is embarrassed to exist and has to rely on its many callbacks to DaS1 to justify itself instead of doing something like DaS2 and having its own identity, has bosses that are designed for a streamers chat rather than the person playing the game, and area's that are less fun and has the least engaging enemies in the series, what is the point?that is the end here are the complaints I couldn't be bother to fit neatly in the above section-what is the point of the storm ruler? If making the boss take a huge amount of damage every time sounds too easy, why make it exactly one step removed and the end result is a sword that scales like ass with STR and DEX-what was the point of Anor Londo being in the game? there could've been a cool build up to the O&S room fight but instead you find it within like 15 minutes of the game telling you its Anor Londo and nothing of importance is conveyed to the player (40 minute long youtube lore videos is not the game telling me things, item descriptions are one of the laziest ways of telling a story through a game, its a interactive form of media, you can do so much insane shit with that)-what was the point of the piece of cover in the Deacons of the Deep fight if they can just shoot projectiles through it?-what is up with fights like Abyss Walkers, Pontiff, and Lothric being complete ass and is nothing but a rollslop boss?Final boss was still really cool, shame its still the game trying to skinwalk DaS1 and try to make a better version of Gwyn. And atleast this game made me realize DaS1 isn't as bad as I thought since that game was just boring and at some points annoying. This game always felt like a way to self harmtl;dr I didn't know you could get more than 9 estus because I never found more estus shards since unlike DaS2 they are kept hidden from the player for being naughty I assume."
Negative,"*this will not cover the online co-op portionI'm a newcomer to the Dark Souls series, so I thought Dark Souls 3 would be worth the pick up. I have a friend who enjoyed Dark Souls 2 a lot, so I figured why not try DS3. I like challenging games and I've heard all about how the Souls series is a gruesome challenge.The game was challenging, and I really thought I was going to like the game after clearing the first boss and heading to the High Wall of Lothric. Let's talk about the GOOD things. I like the combat system and how stamina plays a role. It forces you to pull back and gather yourself, rather than just hacking away at an enemy or turtle behind a shield. Combat is challenging and rewarding. The level art, from what I've seen, looks fantastic. I stopped to look at the beautiful vista right as I entered Lothric. The art team deserves a 10/10. Character creation was also very in depth, a feature I liked a lot. Let's talk about the BAD.First thing I noticed was that the game basically forces you to use a controller. ALL of the tutorials use contoller buttons, so you have to painstakingly go to key bindings and try to figure how everything translates. The next thing is the story. I have no idea what is going on. I shouldn't have to go to outside sources (friends, the internet) to figure out what is happening and why. I should at least get the gist of what's happening 3 hours in. It's poor story-telling and unacceptable in an RPG. The bonfire system is awful. Sure, I could ""git gud"" and not die, but it's Dark Souls; you're gonna die. For a game that boasts how difficult it is, it does a shit job with checkpoints (bonfires). Dying at a boss and making me grind through trash again just to find it again is bad level design IMO, and it just adds another layer of tediousness. Making me run back to a boss through trash isn't adding difficulty to the game, it's adding frustration. Checkpoints at bosses would be the best, as getting to quickly re-attempt a boss does not detract from the difficulty of the actual fight.THE GRIND. As I attempted to second boss in the game, I noticed I didn't do a decent amount of damage and that I was basically getting one-shotted. My friend told me that I should level up by collecting souls. This means I would mindlessly kill monsters until I could fight the boss on better terms. I'm sick of grindy elements in games, whether it'd be an RPG or MMO, the grind sucks. Monotony is the death of any promising RPG/MMO, and it was the death of my fun with Dark Souls 3.Maybe it's just not my type of game. I gave it a shot, but didn't like it. Just proceed with caution if you've never played a Dark Souls game before. Try to play the game before buying it if at all possible."
Negative,if its dark souls 3 why does it run so fucking bad. dis shit is wack. if you have a low grade PC get scholar of the first sin it actually runs well. 1 and 3 are botched PC ports even w mods.
Negative,very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very hard to co-op.very very very very very very very very very very very very very bad UX
Negative,"Havoc engine still suck, and it has nothing to do with graphics. If one considers the fact that death has such huge ingame consequences, then the engine choice itself is a failure. Collusion problems still persist, so do the hit box problems and instant death polygon voids (haven't seen much of those since 97, ah, the nostalgia). I don't know if they are delusional or just didn't learn, but putting ""platform style gaming"" in this game with the engine and its mechanics are just asking for annoyance. Demons' Souls' ch 2-2 made a comeback in the Great Hollow, which you are required to traverse to get to Ash Lake. Even if people keep telling me that it's ""optional"", there is a boss and a covenant down there, and not to mention a quest chain ends there. Even if I ignore all the shiny geckos, getting down there is still a pain.Anyway, ignoring the control and game mechanics problems that are caused by the engine and can possibly be a deal breaker for some, this game is alright.The graphics are more polished than before, and the some of the voice overs are quite well done which was surprising. Of course, having one actress portraying several different characters did break the immersion. Some quest glitches are still around even after 1.05 patch. Most of the patches seem to be focused on nerfing a lot of things to make the game more ""difficult"" for some. As of 1.05, the Forest Hunter covenant, Knight Lautrec, Solaire and Patches glitches still seem to depend on your luck. If you don't want to be hunted online as a sinner, then don't go near the forest unless you are just farming mosses and staying the hell away from the Forest Hunters.As for the supposed difficulty of the game, well, one shouldn't believe the hype unless one plays it and judges it for one's self. In my experience, the engine and the actual environment will kill you more times than enemies or bosses, in that order. As long as you pay attention to where you are going and pull aggro carefully so you usually end up fighting one on one, then you will be fine. Regular enemies are way more annoying than most bosses, and some quickly spring to mind - magically enhanced undead crystal archers, darkwraith knights (the most annoying move in the game, humanity sucking grab :roll: ) , ghosts, engorged zombies, harpies or wheel skeletons just to name a few. Annoying locations will include the usual, such as the aforementioned Great Hollow (a jumping platform game where you can't jump, yea!) , Crystal Cave (invisible walkway? a long trek to the only blue slab in the game while walking in mid air? check and check), and New Londo Ruins (a place made more annoying by its residents, however the map will be easier once you get the key to open the flood gate).Blight Town wasn't as bad as everyone made out to be, since as long as you enter through the ""exit"" from the New Londo Ruins' elevator, you can practically backstab everything (and the famous blowdart snipers lose their vantage points). Btw, the graphic slow down is do to the mobs pathfinding calculations, so it has nothing to do with graphics. If the swamp gives you problems, grab the rusted iron ring from the beginning area. The mosquitoes can be eliminated entirely, since they only spawns in pairs of 2 and ends after 4 - 5 waves at each location. Tomb of Giants wasn't that bad either, but that's probably because I picked up the light spell and the enhanced duration ring. The enemies weren't that bad, and even if you are a melee build, you can clear the map using bought pyromancies. You just need to make sure you spend the souls to upgrade the gloves, and buying the bellowing ring off Griggs before he goes so you can get the 20% bonus damage. If you didn't spend any souls on spell slots, then you are out of luck here.As for the bosses, only 2 gave me trouble, one is the hellkite wyvern and the other is the stray demon. The first one is because on your fire run, you won't have much gear to deal with him when you find him, and the location makes it a difficult fight. I ended up using the pull aggro with arrows and attempt to aim the drake sword at his head on where he might land tactic. Stray demon was a pain because I was sleep deprived and I tried to brute force it, which was stupid and I died like 8 times. I didn't have poise so obviously that wouldn't work seeing he has a lot of staggering attacks. A bit of poise and running behind him plus a few well aimed spells, and voila, dead demon.Most of the other bosses were fine, since you can call on meat shields( NPCs too, no online required) to pull aggro for you ( on quite a lot of them) and you can just bust out whatever the biggest attack you have and learn to block or roll away from attacks should they come your way."
Negative,"The concepts of Bloodborne ruined what was otherwise a perfectly acceptable RPG franchise. After having played as a mage and various caster hybrids in this game's predecessor for countless hours, I was looking forward to doing this game as a co-op RPG. After having made the mistake of getting this game, I found out that mages and the like are ridiculously nerfed. We have limited spell usage that does not come back. The Bloodborne-esque qualities of this game pace it as a slasher rather than as a RPG thus making most of your spells worthless as everything can outrun most, if not all, of your casts. The first of the Cinder Lords that you fight plays just like a battle straight out of Bloodborne, which being a slasher is not well suited for casting or archery builds on characters. The obsession of a minority group of players stating ""melee only"" has definitely made this unplayable for people looking to mix things up with alternatives to melee. I find it funny that in the end, ""R1 spam"" and ""magic ez mode"" in this game describes everything that's wrong about melee. You want to be able to actually progress without having to overlevel for a battle? Spam your melee from R1. You want enemies to flinch after an attack to reflect them actually taking damage? Melee R1. Don't want to be proverbially castrated by this game? Don't play archers or casters. Melee is the only play style this game seems to allow for and very effectively breaks your progression if you dare to think or play otherwise. I would not recommend buying this game unless it is patched to balance player options, as they should have been all-along."
Negative,"This is a horrible port. It's painfully clear that the game was intended for consolefags, because there's no controls for mouse/keyboard. If you don't have an XBOX-controller then you just have to guess what everything does. Everything is mapped to the CONTROLLER-BUTTONS 'A' and 'B'. Ridiculous.I looked forward to this game, actually, I finally got it in Humble Bundle but now I know I didn't miss anything. Note that this has nothing to do with the difficulty of the game, the game is so horribly done it doesn't deserve to be reviewed by the content. It fails completely to present itself which is so sad because I really wanted to get my ass handed to me and really beat the game."
Negative,"If you like this game becuase you have played it this brand before by all means go for it, if you get this game like me wanting to play with a friend let me tell you its not worth the money the co-op take extreamly long time to be able to do so and when you finally do you find out that whom ever is summon is gimped and when they die they go back to thier world and have to redo the summons; furthermore, they do not get any drops nor do they get credit for fighting the bosses. i tried to get a refund because its not what is i expected im disappointed. they have denied my refund becuase of the hours played. so buyers beware if you want a co-op game this is not the game for you."
Negative,"Not the game for you if you want to play as a caster. The game is drastically unbalanced in favor of melee builds(More specifically heavy melee). The spell casting too slow, so much so that it would take a miracle for one of your spells to hit in pvp but even in pve its still so slow that enemies will hit you even though you started your cast before they started their attack from a distance. The game is challenging but not because its properly challenging but because cheap tricks primarily the mobs even the trash ones hitting for like a minimum of 40% of your HP. Almost every mob in the game 2 or 3 shots you as a mage but even as a heavy melee its not much better. The sense of danger is defintely there but there is almost never a sense of superiority and not much of a sense of equality because its just kill them first or they kill you really fast. I can't condone games being challenging by limiting your character. Casters definitely get the short end of the stick with this series. Also i had a number of pvp fights where i got the guy down to like 15% they healed for the 5+ time and then a second phantom comes along. Seriously the pvp is just terrible.If I were interested in playing melee builds in this game I could give it a thumbs up(except for the rediculuous damage every mob in the game puts out) but I find melee to be too easy outside of tanking in mmorpgs."
Negative,"Первую часть прошел взахлёб. Вторую ещё более-менее было интересно. Эту пытаюсь закончить через силу, просто невыносимо. Я конечно понимаю что игра должна быть сложной, но в ней должны быть и позитивные моменты. Все что я тут вижу это гимплей вокруг одной механики боя и куча декораций которые по своей сути не отличаются. Отвратительный приевшийся гейм дизайн. Локации вроде разнообразные, при этом они всё одинаково скучные, а за счет противников исследование становится неприятным делом в принципе.Я просто хочу чтобы это всё закончилось и о творениях этого автора я больше никогда не слышал."
Negative,"Let me summarize every interaction you will ever have with another player, regardless of whether you win, lose, or even summoned them to help you fight a boss that has been giving you trouble for the past three hours.You have been invited to Steam group: ""kysfgt"""
Negative,"I think this game should only be played if you played the first 2 games, i think the first boss is way too hard for someone who just started playing or is on mouse and keyboard, i think they should make the first boss a little easier"
Negative,The game does not use Cloud Save System of Steam...You have a new Pc and want play the game where you left?Boom...
Negative,"Don't bother buying, Shittiest game I've ever played overall. Play something better like Bad Rats."
Negative,"This game is the most anoying game i've ever played. From it's constant backtracking to boring map to moronic combat, i would reccomed that nobody gets this game. it is not worth it in the slightest"
Negative,Only play this game if you hate fun and yourself.
Negative,DLC installedGame crash>100h playtime save gone forever♥♥♥♥ it!
Negative,"Don't get the hype. Just not fun. Boring and repetitive gameplay, terrible combat, nasty interface, average visuals. No thanks."
Negative,"TL:DR its DS1 with more bugs and nicer to look atcontrols are still shit so thats 3/3 dark souls games where they failed basic tasks, mu aaa game lolthe camera will still try to break your wrist or eyes, keep in mind they had about 10 years to fix this and the only reason DS 1 was playable was because a random dude or dudes made a fix for itand now we got a new feature phasing enemies, the terrain is optional for enemies meaning they are able to charge through terrain cus pathfinding is hard dafug"
Negative,"Ima be honest, this game kinda sucks ass.  The primary reason I played it is to play some randomizer content and I'm not sure if I'll actually do that after beating NG++.  Played through the whole thing with SSTB, and the only boss fight I genuinely enjoyed doing was Gael.  If you want a game that's hard, but with actual good fighting mechanics, well-designed bosses, and impressive visuals, just play Sekiro.  It's way better."
Negative,Bosses are too difficult to defeat+when you re-spawn after being defeated by a boss you have to fight your way back through re-spawned enemies just to die again and repeat the process over and over=ZERO FUN!Only buy if you are a masochist.The End.
Negative,"This game is unplayable on pc, cannot be played with a keyboard.Not all button icons that appear in the game are not for PC, which removes the gaming experience.The camera does not follow the player.It's a shame that a promising game should fall on the fact that the game developers have not redone the controls for the PC."
Negative,"Uses Xbox controls even though it's on the PC, rendering it completely unplayable. The graphics are also subpar."
Negative,"good game, terrible optimization.gave me pyrophobiathese bonfires are out to get me"
Negative,have 73 hours on this crashed way too much
Negative,Almost every design choice they made is terrible and they haven't fixed any bugs since launch 9 years ago and the game is mostly not fun.
Negative,Dark Souls more like Dog Shit.
Negative,The game does not work from on my Computer anymore. It keeps crashing right on startup and all i see is a white screen with a pop-up. That says DarkSouls III has Stopped Working. HELP ME PLEASE!
Negative,"i played 1.5 hours. The frustration of not having any mouse and keyboard tutorials or button hints drove me to start drinking, i refunded the game a 1.9 hours. While i dont regret refunding, ill buy it again when it goes on sale for 75% off or more. Not paying full price for a game that doesnt even have mnk support."
Negative,"I couldnt w8 to try this game cos of all the great reviews and the slick grafics!I found out that i couldnt play it with mouse/keyboard. So, okey i w8ed for the steamcontroller to arrive much later... (cos i ordered the game with the controller in the summer sale) Then i retryed it again.  Well, Ive played a lot of games in my live cos i grew up living above a video store and must add that I dont give up easy either! But this learning curve was   soooooo unforgiving  i just couldnt beat first boss after zillion try's :S !!! and ofcourse i did reseach reading about it on discussions and a ton of youtube movies.....for advise and tips but that didnt help either. Bleh :SFirst time ever i wanted a refund and actually ask for it. This is deffo for hardcore gamers if you ask me.. No, this is not a game for me. The steamcontroller is awsome ! :DPS.All due respect for ppl that like this sort of game ofcourse. Kitsuneki"
Negative,"I hope you have patience. There is no instruction for the game, which means you have to read walkthroughs. Even after reading walkthroughs the learning curve is so high its unplayable. This is the type of game to get if you REALLY enjoy doing the same battle sequences for days. Random mobs just turn into monsters that 1 hit you causing you to re-clear the entire sequence. I got this on sale for $15 and honestly I wish I got a Big Mac meal instead."
Negative,"Broken, unfair, complete bullshit.Enemy's poise and stamina is broken.I-Rolls - Broken.Parrying - Broken.Hitboxes - Broken.Bosses - Unfair pieces of shit.PC Port - Can't get it right the third time around.Keyboard input lag which caused numerous deaths.DS3 is more about abusing exploits than testing your skill or giving you a challenge.Enemies, their placement, move sets and stats are complete and utter bullshit. From Software thought that they needed to up the ante and dial the difficulty to 11, cause the 'git gud' idiots weren't having enough hardcore. So they basically gave unreadable, split second attacks to any threat above your average hollow knight and added RNG into the mix. Alongside the broken i-rolls and parry making health builds your ONLY options (so much for build variety). Oh, and the cheap, weak or glass cannon enemies? Let's just cramp them in tight hallways so the'll just gangbang and stun lock you where also your camera gets face planted into the wall and you can't see shit and/or react, thanks to the broken poise, which is none existent (for you).Not to mention a completely useless Skill system for weapons which only the NPC can use properly. Forget about fairness or skill, it's all about how lucky you are or know the exploits, and not the good kind.Not worth the new features. Avoid this and get DS1 Remastered. Finishing it twice I can assure that it's way more balanced. The controls are fluid and responsive, and I can comfortably play on my PC without having to install mods. And unlike DS3 I actually finished it."
Negative,"It is a port, like all the others.  You can't even get through the Key Binding menu without seeing some required game controller button to push, and NO KB option.  Had to look it up on the net; Q is the key that replaced CIRCLE A and CIRCLE B.  GEES! even the menus are hard.  The direction system is still based on an D-pad 8 point configuration so you might not be facing your enemy when you are defending or attacking.  Which makes the mechanics a complete mess.  Nothing is consistent; you have no idea what will happen next.  You can't be sure if you'll take damage at this angle, and the system won't let you fix it.  So incentive to dance around and time your attack.  Not like you want to get to the next part of the story.  OH!  Where's the MAP?  DS doesn't need a map because its so canned that the only thing it has going for it is some people like to kill the same set of enemies over and  over and over until they  figure out to hit the boss in the arm, or some other stupid trope that doesn't make any sense in context and wasn't even a part of the game.  Just some random fact that you have to die over and over to figure out.  BORING.  That's literally the definition of WORK.And there still is no save system.  This thing, all three of these things remind me of the old arcade games that were programmed to keep you dumping money into them.  It's not fun.  Dude really I work 60 hour weeks doing the same thing over and over; I don't want to come home and sit down to have fun by doing the same thing over and over.  And for those who are saying oh its so much fun to figure out how to..... no, no it isn't.  It's not like there's a riddle in the clues that will tell me how to beat the next boss.  And it is not fun to see the boss just get to hack and slash (which is fun) with no finesse while I'm supposed to wait and time attacks and leap here and there.  This is why the OG DRAGON's LAIR was hated.  It was pretty but you spent all your money by the time you figured out where all the chimey lights were so you could hit the controller just as they appeared on screen.  But back to Dark Souls  (which sounds like a euphemism now like ""don't go in there I had tacos and had to let some dark souls out"")   All the clues are press LT for swing jab.  It's a port of a game that was designed for the most masochistic people who like to fail and fail and fail and know it is objective failure.  SERIOUSLY stop playing these things they are gross."
Negative,DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU ARE ON A LOW END COMPUTER.
Negative,everything this game does every other game in the souls series does too but better
Negative,0.5/1 second input lag while dodging and doing basically anything. No other game has given me similar problems. Nice game Hideo Kojima
Negative,"This game is worse than DS2 in every way except graphics.Linear, uninspired world. Clunky controls. Gimmicky bosses that aren't nearly as fun to fight. Game is also way too short and repetitive. Endgame feels cheap in a bad way."
Negative,"Well its the Lord's year <Current Year> and if you haven't played Dark Souls 3 yet and are trying to figure out if its worth your money or not, maybe my review can help. This game is very frustrating. And not because it's a souls game, I've played the previous souls entries and had a lot of fun, and I decided after my most recent Elden Ring play(which I absolutely loved) that Id come back to try DS3 and see if I can remember why I didnt like it when it came out. Let's get the housekeeping out of the way, the bosses are tough but out of all of them there was like maybe 1 or 2 frustrating bosses that didn't feel fun. I didnt struggle on any of the bosses. My 2 recent playthroughs I genuinely was not enjoying the Abyss watchers, so I took my level 30 character and instead did Dancer, Oceiros, Champion Gundyr, and Dragonslayer Armor. That is to say, with a very underlevelled character I took out 4 mid-late game bosses many consider to be among the tougher bosses in the game.The bosses were not what made me dislike the game. Killing bosses is the ighlight of the game and ultimately what made me stick it out. sunbroing for people and helping them kill bosses is ds3 at it's bestNo, what I had issues with was the ""rest of the game"".Everything about the game feels like it was designed by devs that hate you. Enemy placement, map design, worst camera of any souls game, right down to how punishing fall damage is. Yes, fall damage is worse in ds3 than any other souls game. You fall 3 inches and take fall damage.Enemies: every enemy moves at half the speed of smell until they decide to attack you then theyre usain bolt with 17 hit combos. Basic enemies in the world. Enemy placement: For every enemy you see chillin in the open, theres 2-3 more enemies artisanly placed behind a wall waiting for you to get in range and gank you. And the enemy you were originally trying to attack knows this. They will sit there and turtle behind a shield or throw daggers or whatever at you. Will not engage, because it's a trap meant for the player.Camera: easily the worst camera in any of the souls games. the camera is the true final boss on ds3. you have to be already in attacking range of enemies before you can lock on and i *any* bit of their body is obscured behind a wall or something and you try to lock on, wrong, your camera is now fucked as they initiate their attack. ds1 and 2s camera was probably this bad as well but its really exacerbated in ds3 when a lot of the bosses have very aggressive movements that are designed to break your camera lock on. Runbacks from bonfire: Yes, because it's apparently not a souls game if you dont have to run back a mile from every bonfire to the boss room, and youre going to have to juke 17 enemies that have 10 foot long arms trying to attack you every step of the way. Yes they run as fast as you do, and yes, they WILL chase you right up to the fog wall and spam attacks at the fog wall that can clip you even when youve made it into the boss roomTldr: the game feels like it's trying to punish the player every step of the way. And what is the game trying to punish you for? For simpy starting the game.Dont play ds3. Go play elden ring or ds 2 or bloodborn or sekiroEdit: not even alone on this. there seems to be some consensus in the community that while the bosses are fun, the world and level design..isnt.. https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/1ef9k4b/might_be_a_hot_take_but_as_someone_plays_ds3_for/"
Negative,"Let me just start by saying ; The fact that this is viewed as the best game of the Dark Souls trilogy is appalling.There really isn't much detail to go into rather than to say that this franchise has gone down hill, consistently. The first game, I'm pretty sure everyone agrees is damn near a masterpiece. Dark Souls II came out, and from what I understand, it wasn't supposed to even have a sequel, but they made it anyway, and it was far worse than the first game.. Now, Dark Souls III came out, and I had been hearing so many great things about how it brought the franchise back and was phenomenal, even better than the first!But it's not.They haven't changed any of the mechanics that actually need adjusting, broke the ones that already work well (like Poise.. It even has a slot in game, but it's been broken since the game released? With no patch to fix it?), and completely kept with the horrendous enemy spam and disgustingly cheesy tactics to make their game 'hard'. It is my strong recommendation that you not even waste money, nor time on this game, but instead, play the first."
Negative,What a fucking pile of shit for the PC.. all of the menus are entirely designed for consoles to the degree that A or B are you options for confirm / reject and they do not fucking work on your keyboard.  Fuck this half-assed port.
Negative,"I hate this game. I've beaten most 2 other souls games being Sekiro and Elden Ring. Both of those game are fun and difficult. This game, however, is not difficult just annoying. I only have a handful of deaths but the world is frustrating there are swamps everywhere and the level design is just awful. The boss runs suck and they have to add multiple enemies for the bosses to be even somewhat challenging."
Negative,"Shit game, Good series. Go play DS2."
Negative,"good game, but its too bad that lag is rewarding for invaders.if the enemy lags, you are going to pay the price. that's just lazy game development"
Negative,"As you might have guessed and read from the other comments, kb&m does not work AT ALL.Or well, it does in that sense that you can do things in the game. But all button prompts are for an xbox controller and the camera is abysmal. It's actually so bad that it gave me motion sickness after playing for about 20 minutes. This is probably the only game that gives me motion sickness.So no, I do not want to give it a thumbs up at all. It's literaly vomit inducing.Aside from this, how IS Dark Souls 3?After picking up a controller, the game becomes playable, but what is there, isn't what I wanted or expected.See, Dark Souls 1, for me, is the pinnacle of these games. The impact the early areas made still remains unbeaten. Undead Burg, The Asylum, stumbling into the Catacombs, Darkroot, the whole shebang. Dark Souls 3 is somewhat lacking in this sense - the level design is something out of say, Devil May Cry. The world is very much linear (with backtracking enabled of course), but linear nonetheless. It's all tied together by the Firelink Shrine, your main hub for allies and services. Removing FLS from the world is not something I like, and further shatters the interconnectednes that made Dark Souls fun and awe-inspiring.""Ok, the level design isn't stellar, but surely everything else is?"". Well, no. See, I like Dark Souls because it wasn't uber fast, but almost kinda cerebral. You had to weigh your options in PVP and PVE to succeed. Sure, I have a lot of hours in DS1 compared to DS3, but I find that Dark Souls 3 has given up on what made the first game so good - the pacing in combat. Almost ALL enemies in the game have massive pools of stamina, almost unlimited poise and combos that will make you jealous. They also recover instantly, strike through walls and home in on you like they'd be equipped with spinbots. This means that it's almost impossible to play pure sword-and-board without a high-end shield, and that pressing your offense to the max is almost always the best way to play. Faster weapons feel a LOT better than slower weapons since the enemies WILL recover from your strikes before you do (the saw-wielding undead from the Dilapitated Bridge come to mind) and if you mess up or heaven forbid, tank a combo with your shield, you will find your endurance drained, your ""poise"" gone and soon your health too. So mash away skeleton and hope you can bring your enemy down before they bring you down!As always, Dark Souls offers no tutorial, no hints to its mechanics, and no real assistance to finding a playstyle that IT deeply wants you to favour. Instead it just throws frustrating mechanics at the player, hoping to impede progress and fredom of choice. I don't mind that Dark Souls games are kinda vague and opaque, but at least DS1 felt like a sandbox where everything is viable. DS3 feels like a strange halfbreed between a more action-oriented adventure and the original fan favourite. So no, I don't like it as much as I could, and therefore I'd recommend people to play something else. Or at least not pay full price for this, since you WILL need a controller to play this."
Negative,fun game if you can play it but it wont do anything but crash
Negative,"The game is unplayable without a controller.  Keyboard/mouse is useless. Exisiting key bindings do not work as described. For example, space key is supposed to cause evasive role or jump.  Jump never happens. Tested in static and movement context. You need jump to play the game.  The game presumably allows you to change key binding.  It doesn't work. You can enter new key bindings, but they don't take. I can't comment on play with a controller, but without a controller the game is useless.  I've requested a refund, but Steam requests a reason for refund and does not have an option to specifiy that controls are broken.  We'll see if they refund the purchase price."
Negative,"I bought this game as I had read that there have been improvemnts (for PC users) over the previous versions. And I did really want to like this series, so I thought I'll give it one more go...The game looks decent enough (probably great on the console they originated on). Character design has a lot of scope for personal preference. That being said I did struggle to create a character that didnt look like they should be taken out back and put out of thier misery. Even the presets looked kind of odd.The controls and camera system (from what I must assume) are desinged without the PC user in mind. As I dont have a console background I just found it annoying and tbh a serious oversight on behalf of the devs. There are enough great rpg's out there that have been devoloped for the PC, so I find myself asking why bother learning this game? I really dont have the time to get used to the ways of DS 3. I guess I have just got too pampered by PC rpg.s. No pause, no save (just check points) and the loss of items if you die before getting back to the point where you previously died are things that could have perhaps been part of higher difficulties.They have a flawed masterpiece here and seemingly have tried hard to make it as unpleasent to learn as possible.If you are into tough RPG's with a high learning curve then you will love DS3. Unfortuanlty its not for me, although I truely wish I could see why people love this game."
Negative,"Very trigger-happy when it comes to shooting bans at anyone who so much as looks at a modder. Would be a decent free-to-play game, but the fact that I spent money on this, with customer service like this, is simply insulting."
Negative,"Game won't run, many people have the same problems with crashingWait untill April 18th to see if patch fixes it, or look on /r/darksouls3 to see if they say it's been fixed"
Negative,"this game sucks i would rather play people playground for more than 100 hours and get a degree in culinary arts than play this shithole of a game, the one thing you do is roll around then hit then one or two times and then die like 30 fucking times before you finaly realise that with the time you spend on the game could have been used more wisley, and while your on your deathbed you start wishing that you could have more time to spend with your family than playing dark souls for 100 hours straight."
Negative,"Too hard, spent 467 hours fighting first boss. Total bullshit, do not buy. Add easy mode."
Negative,trash tiling game
Negative,Can't play the game for more than 5 minuites wihtout crashing.  Do yourself a favore and wait until it is half off and they patch this crap.
Negative,Anime Souls 3: Prepare to be Ganked Once Again
Negative,Play DS2-SOFS Insted of this hot garbage.
Negative,This game is just too difficult. I couldn't beat the 1st boss even after trying 10 times. I just gave up
Negative,"Dark souls 3, it isn't fun because its hard, its hard and that supposed to make it fun? its not a fun hard tho, its a ""ill stuff 3 overpowered enemies in a corner and force to to get stuck in the corner constantly"" only a few good fights.  the timing is always so slow for the I frames so its like you have to prepare 20 frames ahead. the leveling up system feels pointless when you're at a high lvl and still getting corner trapped by lvl 1 creatures"
Negative,"First, I want to start off by saying that this PC port has a game-breaking bug at the start. If you don't install this on a secondary HDD/SSD other than your main drive, you literally cannot move once you get into the game proper.I don't know if they ever fixed it, but considering Steam doesn't let you create a second folder on the same hard drive anymore, that means anyone who doesn't have two storage drives in their PC could potentially get this bug and never be able to play the game. This marred my opinion of the game for a while until I was finally able to play it many years back.I've had a lot of time to think about the game since then and while I would overall recommend the game, and I think it's easily one of the best of the trilogy thanks in no small part to its improved controls and plethora of armor, weapon and spell options, far surpassing Dark Souls 1 with its variety (which was already not that bad considering it was over 50 different armor sets, even if some were absolute trash and you didn't have great ring options to mitigate their failing defenses like you do in Dark Souls 3 here).The game has a lot of interesting areas, some really tough and outright unfair fights, and overall is an improvement over the past two games, even if it's not perfect and moves in an unhealthy direction that Elden Ring later continues. FromSoftware seems obsessed with ramping up the difficulty these days. Midir is a prime example of their failing to understand that balance was the key to making Dark Souls good, not just making things so difficult you want to slam your controller into the ground and quit. No boss should be able to shoot lasers in front of his face for two minutes straight that deal 80% of your health (if not all of it). It's not balanced, it's not fun, and it's certainly not fucking fair.Despite enjoying the game, though, I simply cannot recommend it anymore unless you have a dedicated friend to play with... and that becomes inconvenient since you both have to repeat the same boss in order to progress together (once in your world and then once in theirs so that they can get past them and put their summon sign in the next area).In fact, I was so certain I wouldn't find enough players for coop to enjoy myself that I didn't even bother. I modded the game and played offline with the Phantom Soul mod. There was still a lot of bullshit, but I had fun with it and didn't have to deal with player invasions (which are not optional when you play online) and waiting around hoping to find a player to summon (which is my favorite aspect of this game second only to customizing my character and setting up their final build).Some problems with the game:1. They've taken cues from their design of Bloodborne by speeding up the combat and locking the healthbar to the head of enemies, as well as not speeding up your character or at least not by much. So you've got this feeling of Bloodborne's unpredictability and pace in combat, where you can't waste a second, but you're using a character that was built to move slowly and cautiously in typical Dark Souls fashion. It's very conflicting. On top of that you don't heal back your health by being aggressive like you do in Bloodborne, so they're using a system of combat that was never meant to be in place for Dark Souls, which is supposed to be slower and more methodical.2. The online is effectively dead. Not completely dead, especially if you play at higher levels, I'm sure you can find plenty of people to PvP with if that's your thing, but if you just want to coop through the game, you're unlikely to find people to summon the further in you go. If you don't believe me, my game time should be all the proof you need: that is not from playing the game a ton of times, it's from sitting around waiting for a summon sign to appear so I can play the game the way I enjoy. Most of that was from years back when the game was more active, no less, and you also have to consider how upgrading your weapons too much bars you from other players at lower tiers, which further kills the game's online. You can use a password shared with another player to play online with people of any level, but that also removes the level limit on PvP which means... well, you're gonna get slaughtered by some max level gimp.3. The glitch. Again, so long as that glitch exists and remains unfixed, I cannot in good conscience recommend this product. You shouldn't need to blow extra money on hard drive space (or worse a new computer, as some motherboards have limited support for expansion, especially with laptops) just so you can play the game you purchased. It's as much Steam's fault for removing a simple feature, and they've fucked up with other things in the past (like not being able to turn off updates on certain games anymore), but FromSoftware is the reason the glitch exists, make no mistake. They can fix it, they just won't.As always, I feel like pointing out the beauty of Nioh 2's AI summon system. Without the need for mods, you can connect online to see summon markers that other players have put down in the past and summon an AI-controlled copy of their character. They're powered down so they aren't overpowered no matter what build they set up, but still incredibly useful while playing and a lot of fun if you like playing with others, even if they are just computer-controlled characters. Nioh 2 is the golden child I point to whenever I want to discuss what a soulslike should strive to be. A ton of unique features that let it stand out from even FromSoftware's titles without just copying the formula and calling it a day, a clear-cut story that doesn't require you to watch over a hundred lore speculation videos, and a unique setting in Sengoku-era Japan that differentiates itself from the other games with their ""soulless husk of a dying medieval fantasy world"" design. Don't get me wrong, I like that Dark Souls has that theme and I'd never want them to change it... for Dark Souls, at least (doing it all over again with Elden Ring was a bit much), but it was really refreshing to be in a thriving world that just so happened to be at war in that place in time.But I digress. If you enjoy solo play and like a challenge, then I would probably recommend Dark Souls 3 if, again, that obnoxious game-breaking glitch did not exist. But it does. So I do not recommend the game and I probably never will. That is despite overall loving the game and wanting more people to enjoy playing it, as well.My views on the game have always been conflicted, but more-so now that I've seen the greener pastures of Nioh 2 and Code Vein. Hard isn't a problem, but balance is just so important and From is effectively losing their touch. The numbers don't show it yet, but I suspect people will grow tired of their design philosophy after the next two or three games are just Dark Souls clones but harder and less fun."
Negative,"Dont fucking play, only game i know where a boss's scrotum rubbing up against you will take away half your motherfucking health. this shit is extremely fucking unfun. not ""not fun"", fucking unfunAnd to those who want to put a goof ass clown emoji on this review nice take, i hope you know it's shit lul. my bad i'm not devoting 10+ hours a day into practicing this shit, my bad i have a job, my bad i have a life"
Negative,"The game was initially good, but now since the game bottlenecks my 1080 gpu so hard.  The game is now unplayable, I cant go 2 minutes without droping to 2 frames.  I tried to get support for this, but to no avail.  Apparently others are facing this same issue according to the forums.  I would not get this game till they they fix it."
Negative,"everything was at peace, until the devs fixed the online issuenot a minute in and I already got invaded, died, and got the pointing down gesture6.9/10 not so fun game"
Negative,There is way too much cheating and there is no protection from cheating.
Negative,Got this on sale its a fun game but way over priced for an old game just wait for a sale.
Negative,not as good as elden ring
Negative,"This game is Bad, donrt bother."
Negative,"garbage.-bad optimization-disconnected from server cause of ""low"" frame rate (in main menu while checking settings)-no interface for pc users-stuck in menu cause the game say the keys for xbox controller instead of keyboardthe devs should be ashamed for releasing AAA game like this."
Negative,Nice game design. Horrible game system. After playing for 3 hrs I got invaded by 6 smurf players and I never pass the first lvl.  This game is good if you play since the game open but not now. There is no place for new players. So if you're finding good combat-rpg just buy MH-World.
Negative,"It's what it says on the tin: more Dark Souls. With all the same problems the previous PC versions had. Again the game does not display the keyboard prompts and shows controller controls. Again there is no separately bindable Guardbreak/Jump-attack button, meaning you have to use AutoHotkey. Again there are technical issues (this time around it was ambient sound problems). After spending roughly 70 minutes fiddling with the game I managed to get it to work on an acceptable level. Fromsoftware never seems to be able to polish the PC version to the end and leave in some of the most amateurish mistakes that would take a day for a few programmers to fix. Oh yeah, and the online multiplayer is full of hackers, just like DS2. Avoid like the fire unless you're a die-hard fan of the PVE and you don't mind putting in a bit of work yourself to get this game working properly. I can't believe I'm saying this, but you're probably better off playing this on a console."
Negative,39 min was all I could take. Controls are terrible and the camera is clunky. Felt like I was playing a game from the early 2000's. After playing an amazing game like the Witcher 3 this was a huge let down.
Negative,Will not recommend this until this fix the online bug where you can't connect online PERIOD.
Negative,"too many inappropriate ""butthole"" references"
Negative,"its really beautiful game, but impossible to enjoy"
Negative,"too hard, too boring, recommend to noone"
Negative,God awful UI and the controls where hellish
Negative,Easy game finished in 10secons
Negative,"For a game that cost 60 dollars thats 80 bux AU. i sure hope it would be a lot better than this., This is the laziest port of a game i ever saw. there is NO effort to make it at home on PC. all the tutorials are given using the controler buttons, its a complicated enough control system without having to constantly tab to control binding so find out what all the bloody mesages are about... I really want to like or at least play this game anyway but after under 2 hours in 3 sesions.. im over it.  AND i forgot to refund it."
Negative,"Played the game for over 300 hours, completed many times up to NG+7 and with many characters to try different kind of pvp builds and pve setups.... Having said that, this game is garbage, there are a ton of netcode issues, especially for coop games, covenant not working at all (right darkmoon?!?) and the worst part is that the game lacks of identity, way TOO MANY times you will find yourself to say ""Oh look! this is from dark souls 1! and look this as well, is also from dark souls 1!, and this enemy was also in dark souls1!!!"". The game also almost completely ignores the existence of the second chapter of this trilogy, felling almost like a huge DLC of the first game, too bad that it also carries the negative sides ; phantom backstab-check, shitty hitbox-check, recycled bosses concept-check, terrible pvp system-check... continuing on the route of terrible ideas, they removed the dual wielding with any weapon added in dark souls 2, made most of the infusions pointless, made poison and bleed builds pratically unusuable and why not, add a new completely useless status!Moving on the dlc side now, someone in From had the genial idea to make two dlcs linked to eachother sold separately and without even a proper ending, the first is simply a huge reference to dark souls 1... because why not, we needed even more references, while the second, and most important of the two, finally add real new content, and overall is the best part of the whole dark souls 3 experience.What can I say in conclusion, this game is just a dlc of the 1st chapter of this trilogy, with extra dlc on itself, surely the whole thing doesn't deserve more than 10€, if anything, really, keep playing dark souls 1 or simply move to dark souls 2.Small edit after almost 600 hours of gameplay with the mods cinder and convergence: the base game is still garbage and totally not recommended, but if you do play the game with one of these two mods, it become quite nice and improve the whole experience so much! it is almost impossible to describe."
Negative,"Well as of now i cant recommend the game, it runs smooth on 60 fps and the game feels and looks awesome. But everytime i get to the first bonfire i crash. my computer freezes and i have to force a reboot.*UPDATE*I tried lowering my lighting quality to low, and as of now i havent crashed. hopefully this helps! will update again later on.*UPDATE*After i lowered my lighting quality i got past the first bonfire and the first boss bonfire but i have crashed in the firelink shrine. i think im gonna give up for tonight and hope a fix is made by the devs or a solution is found by the community.i would wait with buying the game untill this is sorted out but so far it looks amazing, if only i could play...i have posted some more info in the comments below this review."
Negative,"Terrible game, would not recommend."
Negative,I now know how Sonic fanboys feel like
Negative,"i disliked all of it, dont buy this"
Negative,"huge frame rate drops, reguardless of graphic settingsdropping to 1080 from 4k had no substantial performance increase"
Negative,"Shit game, never play it. And I should know, I beat ALL the bosses in the game. FUCKING SUCKS."
Negative,"Too addicting make me break my fan, still love it tho"
Negative,"Couldn't get into it, I think you'd have to really be a huge fan of the series. I found the gameplay really clunky, specifically the combat. Yes it's a lot of rolling around, but I could have gotten over that if the combat mechanics didn't feel so disconnected, clunky and dated. For example Witcher 3 or Arkham Knight are basically mashing the roll button too, but you can actually feel yourself connect with the game and there is satisfaction in delivering a blow. With this game you might as well be shadow boxing and watching enemies rag doll around you in weird ways."
Negative,"Unnecessarily hard from the start. Tuts are a joke, you'll need to read guides online. I expect most people who are new to or don't like this genre to quit at the first mini-boss so early in the game. Clunky weapon switching (even via controller, which should be the go-to for 3rd person games like these). Battles are artificial, seems to be just about timing and pattern recognition. Perhaps it's the nature of this genre, but if the one-shotting was just toned-down a bit it might be enjoyable. Having to resort to online coop is not the answer. Also nothing is straightforward in this game. They seriously need to hire some English technical writers to explain game mechanics more if they want to make it this difficult. This must be the third time I gave it a shot, but seriously, I can't be bothered investing in it. Nor any other evolution of this genre, including Elden Rings."
Negative,"This game isn't good it has bad hig registration, the enemy design is boring and 2 dimensional and the difficulty scales way too hard even for someone like me who enjoys these kinds of games that are designed to make you mad. Honestly I'd just use your money and buy another game."
Negative,this game makes me want to stab myself with a coiled sword.
Negative,Thanks to this game I am now so paranoid of treasure chests I attack tresure chests in every other game I play including Zelda games
Negative,"lmao. Uninstalling myself irl after this. Fromsoft ruined my life. Goodbye world, goodbye steam."
Negative,"if memorizing attack windups in order to play the ""when do i tap the dodge button"" game sounds like your idea of skill and fun, then this is the game for you!"
Negative,Not a fan of souls games. Too frustrating and complex for me.
Negative,I dont like it cuse i have crashapp i can't fix it and i was so hoping to play it ;(
Negative,"I just can't bring myself to enjoy this game.I don't really have an argument for why; I just, for whatever reason, can't bring myself to enjoy this game. I feel like, of the time I've played, I've done it only out of obligation, as if it were something I merely needed to do, rather than wanted to.It just isn't for me, I guess."
Negative,This game is like a high school dudes cock. Super hard and incredibly unsatisfying.
Negative,"EDIT: Thought that might do the trick. You're welcome! Companies that pull that kind of BS don't deserve to make money, though; if From were to go bankrupt and disappear tomorrow, it could only enrich the gaming scene by paving the way for other—better—developers to create the next—better—generation of similar games - so this review is staying negative 'til the end of Steam time. This is a predominantly MULTIPLAYER game... for which NO servers presently exist. It's officially abandonware.Obviously the Steam Money Machine could never be influenced by matters of mere ""ethics"" or even ""legality,"" but in most countries it's actually illegal to sell this game in its current state - including this one. And yet... here it is. If it were an indie game—i.e. one that didn't generate millions in revenue for Valve—you can be absolutely sure it would've been pulled from the store within hours of it shutting down. — that shutdown was 7 months ago now.I'm not saying don't play it offline if you are a die hard fan - but absolutely don't even consider paying money for what is essentially now just a single-player-only demo."
Negative,"If you like laggy servers, bad coop system, no hitreg on players. -12 tick, toxic community, spam, badly optimized gameplay and glitches, then we have the game just for you, GLITCH SOULS 3 the game that is based around glitches and no actual skill, like being backstabbed from the front. Did you know that this game was never intended to play online? No? Well I'll tell you what instead of joining your friends through steam or creating a lobby, you'll need 2 items before you can play with your fellow friends, one will need a soapstone and one will need an ember, but thats not enough, both of you need the same password but still that isnt enough because you'll need to find your friends soapstone before you can summon him, if you guys die, well then you just need to start over. Have fun on your adventures. (Side note: PVE is quite fun, like the game was meant for it) PVP was never supposed to be a thing"
Negative,game performance is complete sh1t 0/10 would not buy again piece of f4cking sh1t game
Negative,I have not gone for a refund as when this game is playable I am sure I will enjoy it but that is not currently the case. Extensive issue with crashing have lead me to decide to wait in hopes one day this game actually works.
Negative,Dark Souls III < Demon Souls
Negative,"Ok I'm sorry for hard core people who have enjoyed this game - This is my honest review and experience of it. I'm not an easily defeatable gamer but this just ended up in frustration after frustration for me.Bought the game on sale - heard epic things about it being challenging (huge huge huge under statement).Never played any of the previosu Dark Souls so this could be my own fault for jumping in expecting to do accomplishment too much (I accomplished nothing). First problem - the controls in the ""tutorial"" (you can't even call it that... I had to go on to youtube to search out how to do the most simplest of things such as how to kick and jump) are explained for xbox mappings and have mention or relevenace at all to keyboard and mouse mappings, leaving you guessing. Difficulty - Good thing the tutorial equips you so well for what is an utterly unforgivable game isn't it! - Oh no wait, I had to go to Youtube to search out how to jump... The difficulty is crazy. So you know your general minions and throw away baddies that are there for you to rag doll around during the tutorial? Well if you get cuaght in between 3 of them and make a single mistake, its game over start again at the beginning of the ""tutorial"". For those of you with dual monitors!!!! - So I went down the ""don't go down here"" bit in the ""tutorial"" and came across some ice mosnters thing. I battled it 5 times and failed. during those moments of frantic tense action, my mouse slipped onto the next monitor some home and took me back to desktop - Dark Souls doesn't lock you mouse in - again I went on youtube for a soluation and found one by downloading ""dual monitor tools"". Use their tool called swap screen and then you can sort it. The first boss (in the ""tutorial"") - He will fuck you up in 3 hits. If you're still alive, you will restore your health and he will  fuck you up again, if not kill you.. putting you back to the start of the ""tutorial"". I got him below half HP twice getting him to morph into some massive thing... and he killed me both times. Sorry to Dark Souls purists who got a lot out of this game. I'm just simply giving warning to those who aren't used to the DS series, the DS difficulty level and also I'm giving warning to people that in no way, shape or form does this game glide you in smoothly.It was frustrating from start to finish because of the in game guide for key bindings being absent for keyboard and mouse, for the dual monitor big issue with the cursor and with the extreme difficulty. Not for me."
Negative,At least I only paid 20 bucks for it.
Negative,"VERY MINOR INTRO SPOILERSSo this review kind of sucks to write. The game itself, in terms of gameplay/lore/art is fantastic. I have gotten up to the Lothric Wall or whatever, the area immediately after Firelink shrine. Iudex Gundyr was a solid fight if basic, and certainly fun to roll around as a duel wielding mercenary class. The designs are excellent and feel like an exact middle ground between Dark Souls style stuff and Bloodborne, with a significantly faster more Bloodborne-esque pace to the gameplay.Sadly, once I started on the Lothric wall, my game began to crash. A lot. Sometimes it would crash after killing some random mob. Sometimes it would crash when the dragon breathed fire across the bridge. Sometimes it just crashed for no reason at all. And let me say, this was not a CTD. This was a HARDLOCK. My monitor would go completely black, fall into sleep mode, and I would be forced to shut down with the power button.I tried all of the suggestions I found; changing my armor, setting all the graphics settings to low, avoiding fire, but nothing seemed to keep my game stable. This seems to be a rare occurence overall but I needed to put this out there. I just cannot recommend this game if there is even the possibility of this happening. Look at my specs below, I comfortably meet the recommended system designated by FromSoft...Specs:i7 4790S 3.2GHz16GB DDR3 1600MHzR9 285 2GB GDDR5 (No overclock) Catalyst 16.5.1Windows 10 x64"
Negative,options include a setting to invert camera Y axisgame completely ignores this setting because ???
Negative,I dot recommed this for pc whit out a controller but if you want buy it
Negative,"very mixed on this game, adds nothing new and scraps a lot of good mechanics from dark souls 2, to name a few like bonfire aesthetics, hexes being int/faith based, making pyros int/faith?????? power stancing removed in favor of shitty limited dual wield weapons, cast usage & spell restore items in favor of badly implemented demon's souls mana bar and a couple of other smaller QoL changes 2 brought to the table. It's worth like 1 play through and that's about it. typical smelly tryhard le xd git gud trash reddit smooth brain player base so ignore everything about it and you'll enjoy what is fresh about this game. I've played every entry in the series and overall this game is 1 step forward like 10 steps backwards."
Negative,"Dark Souls III is a 3rd person RPG slasher. The graphics are great, cinematics breathtaking, and the story intriguing -- but all that is quickly overrun by the tedium of simply getting this bloated thing to run. I hate to complain like this about a game that I scarcely managed to endure for 5 minutes of actual play, but there is a lot wrong with the basics here.First, the game seems to open up randomly into a tucked away square of screen in the top left of the monitor. By ""randomly"", I mean it happens more often than not, but sometimes not, and appears to have no reason for doing so. There are some tricks to fixing it, and some people have managed to tweak their video cards, or change a setting in the graphics of the game, but in my case re-starting the game 3 to 10 times did it, too. So I'm annoyed. But once it boots full-screen (for whatever reason) the very next immediate issue you'll face is that all key tutorials / instructions are for a controller rather than KB+M. In fact, even if we completely remove all controller inputs, the game still gives us a middle finger by mapping it's instructions to blanks, rather than the keyboard. I'm a PC Gamer, and to each his own with the device you love, but I want to play on a KB+M, and I managed to kinda bumble my way through that at first, until key combos became important and I frankly had not enjoyed enough of the game to want to keep referencing back to the main menu for my next move. Dark Souls III is just tedium on top of tedium. Before the game even begins.And those magnificent visuals which are oh, so alluring? Well, they're an absolute beast for processing power unlike anything I've quite seen before. You won't be able to enjoy them on most machines. Unfortunately, the graphics turned down low makes the game look like slop.Now I guarantee people who play with a controller, or who may have different specs, WILL get something out of this adventure. It looks and sounds like so much fun, from what I've seen. In my own experience, however, Dark Souls III is broken. I'm not sure what else to say. I got nothing out of it and have to return it."
Negative,"as a note. I played Demon Souls through several times, Dark souls 1 several times, and Dark Souls 2 several times. I can safely say that this game is trash compared to the previous games.  I will not buy another one unless they get ravving reviewswhy:same shit you have seen for 3 games in a row.  I guess they didnt have the money to create any new assets.  which means you will see the same zombie model with different weapons and clothing 1500 timesno more creativity in the zones, Demon and Dark Souls 1 did this the best, 2 and 3 got lazyheavy weapons and high strength build is ruinedblocking is useless and hell nowenemies are so fast and furious that you will die long before you kill them, even with heavy weaponsheavy weapons dont stagger until WAAAAY late game, and even then they only stagger retarded noob creaturesThe heaviest armor in the game plus a shield that doubles poise can be staggered by an retarded noob creatures daggerRolling is now THE ONE AND ONLY TRUE GOD of this ridiculous game.  I have no problem with a fun agile build, but like I said, rolling is god in this game.  its stupid, they ruined the dynamic.stamina recovers much faster, so you can roll forever, but shield stability doesnt do shit, so you always break your gaurd.  again ruining shield use while strengthening rolling build.multiplayer is broken/useless.  blue sentinels and darkmoon convenant never get summoned.  Some people think that its a bug that was not handled.  others think that there are just no players in level range.  Which means there is an inherent problem."
Negative,"The game itself is good, however, on a setup above recommended requirements, running on SSD, the game has-autosave macrostuttering-general stuttering worsened by patch 1.03.1-framerate instability the issues are really hindering mine, and lots of other users experience"
Negative,"Nice graphics, great story(so i read), horrible controls...it's a staight console port, A button is action B button is cancel... really...asked for a refund, unplayable for me on keyboard and mouse..Keyboard has 100+ buttons, mouse has 5...and still roll, sprint and jump are all 1 key??(spacebar) Sad that a bunch of short-sighted, too lazy to make proper pc control options, game ""devs"" fuck something so beautiful up...thanks for nothing guys!"
Negative,"A complete mess of a game compared to Dark Souls 1. If you've played any of the previous installments, you know about poise, enemy stamina, and and how effective armor is. All 3 mean nothing in DS3 (Along with numerous other issues).Poise is ""there"", but it apparently means nothing because you can withstand a huge knight's swing, but get interrupted with some lowly 'gollum-like' creature's stab with a broken sword.Most enemies are relentless, which isn't a bad thing in terms of being challenged, however there comes a point where ""challenged"" becomes infuriating. In DS1 you had to memorize enemies' attacks and respond appropriately to win, but in DS3, that is replaced with ""I hope the enemy doesn't immediately use the same attack again, except this time with +3 swings added on with no opportunity."" It feels overly frustrating rather than rewarding.Armor means absolutely nothing, and if you do try to build heavy armor, you're shooting yourself in the foot. With the enemies having infinite stamina and with poise virtually gone, you find yourself being juggled by an enemy relentlessly until they finally finish you off. The defense on the armor isn't nearly enough to justify the disadvantages, which leads to a select few ""successful"" builds in PvP and PvE.PvP is beyond worthless; with awful servers, a rather toxic community, and the same cheap builds, you'll find yourself constantly invaded while playing with a friend. I'm not sure how they managed to screw over the PvP in 3, DS2 had the strongest and most balanced, all they had to do was look at it and what it did right. Honestly, I enjoyed DS2 over DS3.TL;DR get DS1 and don't bother with this game. The port is awful, PvP is very poorly designed, and the balance is completely off."
Negative,Too hard. There is nothing special about this game apart from the difficulty.
Negative,i'd (still) rather play tetris
Negative,"Why are DS 3 players depressed?Because every time they died, they lost their soul.-ChatGPT"
Negative,Good setting and environment but some of the weapons look silly and way too oversized. Combat is very telegraphed and comes off as clunky and slow and the gimmick of finding a weakness in an enemy and repeatedly exploiting it is unfun.
Negative,Massive RNG simulator in which half the animations are broken resulting in your perfectly timed dodge roll  either killing you instantly or teleporting you through the boss's attacks depending on how the game is feeling that day. Anyone bragging about being good at this game is basically bragging about being the top dog on the short bus. Don't waste your money.
Negative,Simple review here.I feel that games on Steam regardless of their origination should either: A. Provide full mouse & keyboard support orB. Give a disclaimer saying you need a controller to fully access the game.Dark Souls III did neither of these.
Negative,"The Coop never works and is buggy as hell, I get that you want to be unique but just add a goddamn coop connection NPC or whatever at the Firelink Shrine, I bought this for Coop if I wanted to play alone I would have pirated it duh.Tried every single troubleshooting on the internet and it's spotty as hell, and I live in the same house as the other person."
Negative,"The first thing I want to say, is that I do realise that I have very little time in the game. However, that fact has no bearing on my ability to fairly review it. I got the game on sale because i was curious and i heard lots of good things about it. It's safe to say i was dissapointed. The first thing that really just seems like a lack of effort on the devs part is the control tutorials. They're in xbox buttons. It wouldn't be that much harder to just make it show up as the keybinds you have set, even if it's just the defaults. That might be a minor thing. However, that display of xbox buttons for people that are on pc makes the menus hard to navigate. You basically have to memorize the xbox controls at the same time as your own if you want to get anything done. There isn't an excuse for this other than sheer laziness. This company makes millions daily, I think you can put in the effort to make the tutorials show the controls for the platform its played on. Secondly, the movement system is abysmal. I realise that it might be better on a controller or console, but this is pc where most people use mouse and keyboard. Therefore, you have to account for that by changing the controls. Pressing back doesnt make your character walk backwards like any normal person would expect, it makes you turn around. That leads to serious confusion when trying to roll or avoid attacks. It wouldnt be that hard to do, the devs should maybe just stopped being lazy. Overall, dark souls 3 on the pc is just a crappy console port that was basically copy and pasted without any adjustment for the platform. The whole thing reeks of laziness and an unwillingness to actually work. The PC community is bigger than all of the other communities, so maybe treat them like customers, not consumers."
Negative,"from soft fix ur crap portBut to be more serious, they still haven't and have no intention to fix the static hitbox glitch (if you don't know what that is, google it). From Software has even accused the proccessors of the those who are victims of this glitch to be the problem. It's been a well known glitch that has been apparent since release and the only reason why I have more than 10 minutes of playtime is because I could get it to work in permanent offline mode on my craptop, with it taking a couple of seconds before it kicked me from online mode for fps issues. I could add that a less than reputable source declared poise as ""working as intended"" but poise is the smallest issue I have with this poorly coded mess, and that's saying a lot.In conclusion, look at forum posts all over the web to make sure your cpu isn't afflicted with crappyportitus. And if you have an A6 series amd proccessor, go spend you 60$ on literally anything else, they're never gonna fix it.no srsly fix ur port from soft"
Negative,"I REALLY want to be able to recommend this game, but I can't. I played DS2 and loved it. I made 3-4 characters and got a ton of gameplay out of it. I thought I'd like DS3 for these reasons.Here's what's wrong with DS3: - It's another semi-poor port; although it's certainly better than DS1. I have a decent gaming laptop, and still needed to lower the resolution and graphis settings, and tweak with the driver for the good part of an hour. - The mouse lag is also back, and worse than in DS2. It also seems to extend to the space bar, as rolling has a noticable delay. - They f'd up leveling. You seem to aquire FAR less souls, but levels seem to require more souls. The result is slower advancement, which I found boring.It's not all bad though: - They fixed the available skills to spend souls on. Resistences are now spread out among several attributes."
Negative,"Overrated trash. Better to play Dragons Dogma or Skyrim. At least there you can actually play an RPG game rather than having to be little a bitch 24/7, roll spamming and poking enemies' health to death throughout the whole entire game. It is a tedious and repetitive game series that shouldn't be praised so highly.PVP? Roll Spam. Trash. TY Sakurai for removing roll spam in Smash Ultimate. <--Better PVP game btw PVE? Forced PVP. Complicated and highly discourages any co-op. No point in multiplayer. Trash.Gameplay? R1 spam. Viable builds? Everyone becomes a ""knight"" in the end or some sort of it. Trash.Story? Lol. It's so vague you can't even compile one from just playing the game normally. Trash.World? Pretty good. Too bad everything else is TRASH."
Negative,Lego Star Wars puzzles are more difficult.
Negative,it's too hard :c
Negative,Bosses are fun and challenging but normal enemies are harder then them because they are hiding or one shots u or hyper armor or they gang bang u.If this was only with bosses i would have love this game.
Negative,disgusting lagging pvp that can't even be compared whit ds2 really: I would refound this game if I didn't played more than 15h whit this shit
Negative,"Dark Souls 1 was a very patient game. It was a game where if you took your time, paid attention and didn't rush into things without thinking through the situation, you would do fine. It was definitely challenging, but it was never an unfair game. It was massively successful because of this and its masterful world design. It was an excellent example of a hard game that made its challenge fun.Bloodborne was a very different game, taking place in a different universe and all. It's a more visceral experience, with much faster combat. It compacted the careful experience of trying to plan out and commit a route from one checkpoint to the next, and made it more about the muscle memory and reactiveness of the combat with much quicker enemies. It was still a game about paying attention- Learning attack patterns, watching for secrets, navigating your way around the world. But the way the levels, enemies and weapons were designed all worked in favour of rather than against the idea of shortening the core loop of Dark Souls.Now, this is relevant to Dark Souls 3 for a very simple reason: Dark Souls 3 has the level design and movement of Dark Souls 1 and the enemy design of Bloodborne.Bloodborne simplified a lot of Dark Souls' character advancement. Most weapons have lower stat requirements than you'd expect, meaning the majority of the game's arsenal is available to use immediately as you pick it up. Armour is mostly cosmetic, with the majority of bonuses offered by different pieces being negligible. You still feel like you're getting stronger throughout the game, and it's still possible to make an unbalanced, lop-sided character if you're negligent, but overall, Bloodborne keeps the focus on the combat and exploration. Of course, these limits to character progression have implications in gameplay: You can't make a very tanky character, and by extension, a slow character. Generally speaking, you move at one set speed, which is more than fast enough to deal with what the game throws at you.Dark Souls 3 keeps parts of this mentality in ways that breaks its character progression. It's similarly impossible to build a tanky character, because armour is, once again, mostly cosmetic- the differences in resistance between extremely heavy and extremely light armour sets are almost nonexistant. All that making a steel-clad knight gets you is a severe penalty to your movement speed, a part of the Souls formula that was preserved despite this change. This, paired with the incredibly fast and high-damage enemies that were also carried over from Bloodborne's design philosophy, serves only to limit viability of certain ways you can build your character. Even in Dark Souls 2, a game I tried so hard to enjoy but ultimately couldn't, a big guy with an even bigger sword has value because larger weapons are often better for dealing with the groups of enemies the game is wont to throw at you. Your character build felt like it mattered, and more importantly, felt like it wasn't restricted.Now, the obvious solution would be to just build a lighter character, even if it's a less satisfying experience for me. I'd be willing to accept that, but there are still a number of Souls combat elements that make the combat frustrating against what are functionally Bloodborne enemies. You can move while healing, but it's much slower than Bloodborne. Rather than dashes that offer a long series of iframes at a low stamina cost, you roll, with much more limited iframes at a stamina cost that is standard to the series. I know it sounds weird to complain about what's standard issue for these games, but I can't express how irritating combat with standard enemies can be because of what has been changed. It all comes down to a war of attrition, with your constant inability to survive more than one or two attacks from most enemies and the relentlessness of most enemies not allowing for healing in combat more often than not.The final nail in the coffin for my experience in this game was the bosses. In any Souls game you pick up you should be able to count on the idea that the bosses will at the very least be interesting, even if not all of them are all that challenging. Dark Souls 3 delivers on neither of these ideas. This is a game full of exceptionally easy bosses. Well over half of any given boss I encountered was quickly dealt with on my first try. The bosses always do damage comparable to the standard enemies, which would only be devastating if they were as fast. They aren't. Most of the bosses have extremely long windups and cooldowns. Even in a long series of attacks, the windows to dodge are always obvious and easy to take. If you do get hit, it's always simple to find time to heal. Regardless of your weapon of choice, none of them have the health to take very long. TL;DRDark Souls 3 took just enough of Bloodborne's mentality of faster-paced combat for a more generally exciting gameplay loop to break the way a Souls game is played. It's just not enjoyable."
Negative,"So this game gave me mixed feelings unfortunately, though I loved the game overall. The atmosphere is phenomenal, story is amazing, graphics are good, music is to die for, companions and characters are notable and act as memories of another era, and the concept of a post apocolyptic medieval fantasy game is original and interesting.There are however some fatal wounds in the game that, while many won't agree with me, I believe to be critical errors in its design that overall kill the experience of the game. They will be listed below, so read them if you're willing and not already triggered and heading towards your safespace.This isn't the worst of the games flaws, but undoubtedly is noticeable to a point where it makes the game confusing and hard to understand. To put it simply, there are way to many elements to character customization in the game, and the ways you do so and what you should even atempt to change or level up is obscure to say the least. This was my first adventure into the Dark Souls series, so I have no experience with the previous titles in the series. As such, some of this could be a subjective problem, but from what I have read, they changed a lot of the mechanics in this game vs previous titles so I'm not sure. That being said, there is too much to keep track of. The first time I played this game, I played as a pyromancer as in most games I usually play (A spell sword offensive character). During that first time, I took a look at the character upgrade screen in the firelink shrine and literally just sat there mouth agape for 5 minutes. The names are obscure, there is no direction in what the best perks to invest in for your specific route are, and the worst thing is THERE ARE NO LIMITS on what you can upgrade. That means if you were particualrily confused at the beginning, like myself, there is a fair chance you would upgrade your damage in magic and effects of miracles, which is apparently the worst thing you can do, according to the interwebs. This brings me to my second point...My god, this is one of the most blatant problems of this game. I can't recall how many times I had to result to consulting the internet in order to understand in game problems and events that were happening. How do you save the Clreic Girl? Internet. How do you get past this group of enemies? Internet. How do you get the Rusty Ring which is an inevitable part of beating the level/getting through the swamps? Internet. Etc, etc. This is unacceptable. A game should not rely on the community to explain the level design of its interworkings to future players of said game, its a rediculous practice that leads to unclear instructions and overall animosity amongst players, not to mention the frustration it causes players who do get stuck. Its also generaly as a rule unfair to make something purposfuly obscure without any hint of it being there accept for a brief flash of the entrance or a fleeting glimps of the soultion.""But wait, the games supposed to be realistic, like real life. Real life doesnt hold your hand you filthy casual, hur hur!"" Yes, but rarely in real life do I go on gigantic pilgrimages into the heart of the wilds of the world without planning ahead, or at least understanding my general course of action beforehand. If there was some kind of warning or person who hinted towards you needing some of the intrinsic items this game reqiures you to have, I guarentee this game would have less of a cult following, and more of an avid fanbase such as The Witcher posseses.And now the part that everyone is going to yell at me for.On a completely unrelated note, this game doesn't support the keyboard. Don't even try setting it up, do yourslef a favor and buy a controller for your pc. Its basicaly required.Now this is a flaw that I think really holds this game back. Don't get me wrong, the combat damage in this game I have a huge appreciation for. I find the amount of damage that enemies do to be completely accurate for there size and/or bulk and armaments. A soildier charging at you with a giant TH sword is indeed going to kill you in one hit, believe me, this is coming from a person who is a competetive fencer. No its not the damage that irks me, but the hitboxes of enemies and you as well as the overall input reaction and movement of npcs in the game. This games animations are beautiful, but unfortunately, thats all they are. The way they track contact and your movements is an extremely complicated mess that is fully intended and designed for you to die.Enemies animations are akward in comparison to yours. Usually, the enemies movements move slightly before or behind your own. Because of this, combined with the games extremely sensetive hitboxes (literally being grazed on your foot counts as a full contact hit), almost always your character ends up dying if they try to interact with enemies in normal combative fashion. This usually forces players to be constantly rolling in order to throw off the enemies A.I so that you can get a hit in. And even THAT ends up backfiring in some horrible way because once you start to roll you can't change the rolls direction, leading to many stamina drained deaths, or simply deaths purely caused by negligence. This is an absurd practice, and I can't stand people telling me it's ""Just good game design, its hard, get gud.""It is not good game design, it is not realistic, and these two things combined is why you don't see this happening 24/7 in other triple a titles. As a fencer, I can tell you personally that my movements are rarely inconsiderate of that of my opponents. Whatever my opponent does I have been trained to counter in a swit and fluid motion, to the point where it is almost a dance between me and my opponent where we try to get the other to mess up. It is rarely if ever my opponent being slightly faster than me and us just trying to smack the other before they do the same. If they are faster than me, I use my advantages to help me compensate, such as my unusual hight and reach, which usually ends up as I said previously (the whole dance thing).  Invasions I'm all for Co-Op interaction between players, but when I'm starting out the game, I dont appreciate a game that summons Phantoms of players who do nothing but eat dorritos in there basements playing this game all day. I have like a woodcutters axe game, they have a level 50000000 scyth of frosty death. Bandai put some calculators in your game for god's sake. Enemy placement There are many instances of enemies being placed in inconvenient places, or places where you wont be able to see them. Some of these ambushes are ok, I can understand there being sections where you need to be on the aware. But there are many instances of hidden ambushes that overall are simply unfair, especially considering you loose your souls when you die. Putting a hidden goatman at the very end of a level that jumps out and kills you in one hit is not good level design, nor is it good sportsmanship... Bonfire PlacementsDo I have to explain? If you're going to put checkpoints in a game, make them at least visible half the time and not in random corners or crevices. Otherwise, let players set there own spawnpoints, and let them only do it twice or something.: 6.5/10. Love the game, but I almost don't count this as a game. Its more like a pc social torture experience that makes people so mad they love it because ""It brings back old game difficulty vibes."" My answer to you is thats not true. Legend of Zelda was not hard because it was like this, it was hard because It required you to think through the game and not preform rash actions, which this game throws out the window."
Negative,not very hard
Negative,fix the camera and maybe ill play this again
Negative,"This game forever crashes, big waste of $$$."
Negative,It's just garbage compared to Dark Souls 1. Should be called Roll Souls since the only thing you do this entire game is roll around.
Negative,bad console port
Negative,its still not bloodborne on pc
Negative,"Game is absolute shit, doesn't even have an option to display pc controls."
Negative,account frozen barly played and char data curropted and i like a refund
Negative,Pretty much the worst entry in the entire soulsborne series. I preordered this game and I've been disappointed every time I play it since 2016. We should have gotten a fleshed out DS1 with a proper second-half instead of a new game that's shit.
Negative,bad game. Ive been atempting the first boss so longggggggg >:( !!!!!!!!! Firt boss ith so hord!!!!@!1 I cant get pas thim!!! I wan refun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1121!!!!@%!!!!!!!!!!!!edit: I still havent beat him :((((( could sombodyt give me sum helkp????
Negative,Micro-stutter of the camera movement and poor introduction to the game controls when using keyboard and mouse. Game-setting screens are not designed to use keyboard and mouse.
Negative,"God knows I tried, but I was never able to get into this game. Even though I love DS 1, DS 2 and Bloodborne.There are lots of little reasons for that:The blatant callbacks to DS1, complete with revisiting entire sections of that game and some of the same NPCs. The truckload of exposition the NPCs pile on you. The overly gimmicky bosses, or, on that note, the multi-stage bosses with multiple health bars. The bad graphics engine, that constantly pops textures and environmental details in and out in full display. (Old GPU, but still)The contrived story. (Remember the dude you killed two games ago? Kill him again!)The at times boring environments. (Thinking of you, Catacombs of Carthus!)The copy-pastes of ideas and areas. (i.e. Irithyll is just Central Yharnam with a different color filter)The overly greyish tone of the game. (While maybe appropriate for a world ostensibly covered in ash, it is not very appealing)The ash system. (I don't like the Shrine handmaid)I may try sometime again in the future, but for now I am burnt out of trying to force myself to love a game I do not enjoy."
Negative,Game's dog shit. Play Demon Souls on emulator or ps5. Then play dark souls. And 2 if you want. This one's just shit.
Negative,"playing as a female character and my hips are rigidno movementlike a stick on high heelsplayable, but has room for improvement"
Negative,Easily the worst souls game
Negative,Graphics from 2012 and controls from 2008.
Negative,"shit game, fuck the creators of the game. THE MOST FOOLISH AND STUPID GAME."
Negative,"Friend got me this game. Don't like it, can't recommend it unless: you like a game where you either time dodges properly or you die, and are capable of waiting for slim windows of opportunity to attack. Also, you have to like console ports and use a controller, game controls do not translate well to PC.You additionally have to put up with seeing stupid people responding with 'git gud' to any complaint in any forums, instead of offering valid criticism, most of the time.Enjoy?"
Negative,"I had bought the game being hyped by the Remaster of the first Dark Souls hoping to get into my beloved experience before the re-release of the original. And I have nothing but pure hate towards this game after 20 hours of playing. EVERYTHING's wrong with it. - Atmosphere: it's dead. The levels feel empty, design is unoriginal, every monster type is just spilling black ooze around. The feeling of the mistery is lost, the feeling of a dark fairytale is lost. Instead, Everything is just oozing black ooze. So original, like I haven't seen it before. - Level design. Awful, just awful. First of all the levels are both lineal and open. You go either run around the platoue of swamp/mist/snowstorm/can't-see-shit-weather-effect or through a incoherent labyrinth filled with monsters. It's no more -vania. There's nothing to explore, nothing to navigate. The sense of progression is lost, both because the game is incredibly linear and the content is awfuly repetitive. Which is something to discuss in the next topic.- Difficulty. It's just retarded. The game isn't difficult because you need to learn timings and be cautios or anything close to that. The game's difficult because it SPAMS everything at you. 7 monsters at a time? every 2 minutes. Another lame ass trap with a dude jumping off the roof? Every 3 minutes. Monsters with spamming attacks that leave very little room to counter? EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. There's basically one tactic in this game. Keep close to a monster, turn him around, land a single or sometimes two attacks. Repeat until it dies. If there's 7 monsters like that - pull them apart. Repeat until they die. And that's the only thing you do for the 90% of the game. - Bosses. First of all, they're all ugly. There's not one beautifuly designed boss. They either spit ooze at you, or spit ooze at themselves. And just as every other monster in this game, the difficulty in beating them is keeping to a gameplan laid above. Avoid their attack circling, land a single blow, repeat until they die. - Story. Suddenly, you're THE MAN. THE HOLLOW. You're the baws and everybody is bowing to you. You help kids around and they join you at your base, hanging there and throwing lame ass dialogues at you. And that's about it. By this point, I'm just tired of going through everything that's wrong with this game. It's like Call of Duty 17. They had a successful game once, a decent but different sequel and then everything went to shit after that. There's no imagination, no passion, no desire to make a good game seen in this. This is the game made to be sold, not to be played. I rate this game Lords of the Fallen out of 10. Terrible game, absolutely terrible."
Negative,"This is the worst one, where the franchise became Dork Souls and dropped the ball that Bloodborne was juggling effortlessly, never to pick it up again."
Negative,The worst DS of the three.
Negative,On 2nd load up of the game and all afterwards the game did not load any of the enemies or my weapons.  Unplayable. 1/10
Negative,"Some BS techniques enemies have, like hitting you through geometry and losing souls when you die, what rubbish"
Negative,Full of bugs!
Negative,"If I could refund the hype and expectations of a free game given to me, I would.How could they only make one good souls game, and deliver shit thereafter?"
Negative,unplayable for people with slower thinking that 1st boss is reason why i uninstalled this game and yes i beat him some months ago but since there is no cloud saving if game gone saves going down 2 graphics great combat great but not ene pick me up dont works agains any of bosses
Negative,"edit: I will be avoiding pvp for the most part from here on out.  My review will change back to positive when the pvp is fixed.  Sigh..this is souls game..5?  Are we at 5 souls game now and still dealing with MAJOR pvp issues.[old review]Hey they got it all right this time, gj FSedit: Invading is terrible and some of the factions are broken but I am not into pvp so I don't care too much.  Blue Sentinels and Darkmoon Blades covenants are totally broken and worthless.Some achievements and items like rings are tied to covenants and near impossible to get because they are not designed properly.  Invaders are punished too hard.  Black Seperation Crystal is your best friend for 3 out of 4 invasions with 3v1 fights (4v1+ is best tho).  NO THANKS I SUCK AT PVP AND THIS IS BANANAS SILLY BS THANKS BUT NO THANKS.  lol.So some achievements are close to impossible to get."
Negative,"Never played DS before and I gotta say I like the challenge that the enemies pose, but I think the biggest challenge is that I have to learn wtf xbox controls translate to on the keyboard and mouse over and over again. I might be able to excuse the bad port if I got a little tutorial on certain things. For example I picked up a ""west shield"" but I have no idea where it went. I got ""fire bombs""- how to use? Souls, what they do? I like how hardcore the game is but that's not what frustrates me and it's what should frustrate me, 5 out of 10 for bad effort on pc port."
Negative,"Ive played mostly for the online aspect of the game, now it is pointless for me to play"
Negative,Controls were made for a console.  And it's pretty boring game.  Not what I expected.  Too much hack and slash.  Did I say the game was made for console?  Don't play on a PC.  Awful.
Negative,It's like someone tried to make the original Dark Souls again except they did it like shit.
Negative,"Can't connect to the server at all, tried everything. SUCKS!"
Negative,Good story AWFUL GAMEPLAY
Negative,dog shit camera anglesgood bosses though
Negative,"I can't even play the game! It boots up fine with normal 60+ fps, but when i click ""New Game"" the fps drops to like 3-4 like wtf and then it'll kick me back to the main menu because my frame rate is ""Unsuitable For Online Play"".  I honestly tried looking up how to fix this but nothing worked.  If anyone knows how to fix this, please comment. :("
Negative,"Not much hours, but I can already tell the multiplayer function of the game will ruin the game for anyone who wants to co-op with some friends. Can't even walk out the door before some random turd (random invaders) comes and kill you. You lag or server lags? you will get killed from a mile away by the other player. I just want to play the game with a mate... is it really that hard? Sometimes, you can't even see the player's model, you can only lock on to them... wtfEmber (item needed to summon friend) isnt exactly easy to get at early levels, so Over-powered randoms that can kill you from the other side of the room isnt going to let co-op happen. Nice game, i like it. But if you want to play with friends, nah. Find something else, they punish co-op by making you buy or farm for Embers but you get invaded so easily. Also, since you have only just started, you are low on level and gear making it all the worse to fight against invaders who have obviously made it further than you to get the item needed to invade others. Unless you progressed decently, which defeats the purpose of playing with a friend, it will be hard to fend off invaders and avoiding wasting embers.It's too hard to play co-op which is the reason why I would get the game in the first place =.="
Negative,"Definition in overrated, every single aspect of the game is stupid as a concept and lazily implemented. Unbelievable that a 3d game where the only useful buttons are directions, dodge and basic attack could even compete as game of the year."
Negative,waste of $
Negative,"Better bosses, but other than that a downgrade from Dark Souls 2"
Negative,"says it supports ultra wide screen or multi monitors but it does not. bad console port. poor controls, camera, etc. impossible to play the game properly with keyboard & mouse. controller only."
Negative,Either this game is impossibly hard or I majorly suck at it! lol :(
Negative,"crashing a lot now , I don't know why; tried everything ..."
Negative,This game is dogshit it is very easy to beat and is boring if you want to play a true dark souls buy dark souls 2
Negative,"I love the dark souls franchise, but frankly darksouls 3 just didnt cut it. The single player is a bore, the multiplayer is a lag fest with spaghetti code and broken hitboxes. The game isnt balanced at all, parrying is way too easy, there no poise, small weapons do insane damage.Compared to the other souls games this one was shit. Darksouls 2 had better combat, ds 1 had a much better immersion. If this game wasnt a dark souls game and instead was a debuting title, I doubt anyone would play this trash.Only play this game if you want to get pissed off, or if you want to support trash games."
Negative,"An interesting game that i just could not get into. Pissed me off for sure but i suppose that is what it's suppose to do. I personally cant give this a great review based on the core machanics of combat and the way that the controls work. This game feels like at its roots that it should not be on PC, and that it was a complete after thought. For me it feels as though it was just a terrible xbox port where key mapping is at best sub par. I am not the best ""gamer"" and felt like this game is not for everyone with its combat style. Graphically, it is beautiful and makes you feel like the world is dead. I would like to say that I would recommend this game like many others but if I personally can't get past the first 5 minutes of the game, then in my opinion this is not a great game as sad as that is."
Negative,The Soulsening. Still awful. It's literally the same game.
Negative,This game is unplayable without a controller. Do not buy it if you like to pay with keyboard and mouse
Negative,i just died to a shit grab hitbox on my sl1 run when the final boss was 1 hit from death.
Negative,"I don't really understand, where is the joy and fun in rolling around the boss in full plate mail, just to have tiny window for 2 strikes. Then repeat again."
Negative,"Maybe game is good, but i can't play it at 60fps. Its eyecrashing, back to 10year old gameplay? No."
Negative,YEA THE BOYS
Negative,"It's like they took Bloodborne enemies and slapped them into Dark Souls. Couple that with no apparent functional poise and you're setting yourself up for a bad time. Double that, since a ton of enemies do insanely long combos that stunlock you into hell. Thanks but no thanks. I admit, the PVP and Co-op is what sucked me in for at least half of that 150-odd hours. I wouldn't take that back, but I still think the game is lackluster."
Negative,"This is just uninspired recycled content with inferior mechanics weapons and fashion. I have played this game extensively, and the most fun I can get out of it is being a lightning pope. The pvp is just bad. This was a rushed game, they rush games so hard that they don't even care. This is a ""SOULLESS"" money grab. Go buy a PS3 and play Demon's Souls."
Negative,"My review for the whole Dark Souls series: Great ideas and poor execution. The developers Fromsoftware are really incompetent when it comes to balancing and multiplayer. Multiplayer is laggy as hell, and hitboxes are broken. The only really good things about Dark Souls is the level design and PvE (WHEN IT'S FAIR). I've beaten all 3 Souls games and would have to say none of them are superior to one another. I'll name something good about each one. Dark souls 1- Level design, Dark Souls 2- The size of its areas, Dark Souls 3- The graphics and designs (especially the bosses, they're awesome). Since this is a Dark Souls 3 review, I'll finish by saying that the biggest disappointment was the size. It was shorter than the other games. Get the Souls games when they're on sale, they'll be worth it then.P.S: The host during a PvP invasion can be a total pussy and spawn/wait for other players (phantoms) to help them out. Don't forget that.P.S.S: Pay $30 for this at most, that's what I'd recommend."
Negative,Nowhere near as good as the previous two games.
Negative,it sucks (give bloodborne)
Negative,The watcher boss fight run is absolutely the worst boss run in all these games. Worth not playing just to avoid it.
Negative,No support for ultrawide.  Even indi games do that nowadays.
Negative,Boss swing the sword at 45 degree from the leftRoll to the leftboss missedBoss swing the sword at 45 degree from the leftRoll to the leftBoss hit me then do a 3 hit combowtf is this inconsistentfuk you Iudex Gundyr
Negative,well after all the hours i put into this game between console and due to my recent full move to pc and being busy i put off finishing this game on the last boss on a character with about 74 hours. my laptop started messing up so i had to reset it and thought it would be fine because of steam cloud. however ds3 doesnt have steam cloud and it doesnt notify you or warn you in any sort of way so now all the hours i put into this game on pc are gone completely. sucks im still gonna play this game but i am highly disappointed in how trash the devs are in supporting their own product from the server being down because they dont know how to fix their own stuff to the swarms of people using hacks in pvp bc they dont know how to play the game and learn just sad really. UPDATE*****still a great game but i still stand by what i said before fix the cloud save and maybe ill change my mind.
Negative,"I was having fun. It was frustrating, but I was getting the hang of the mechanics so I could play with the friend who bought me the game. I stopped having fun when I was invaded by a hacker who somehow triggered my boss fight, forcing me into the room from a completely different part of the map, and was unprepared to fight said boss, so was forced to loose almost 4.5k souls. I am a brand new player. That dude just messed up my entire experience because he thought it was funny to do this. I'm not uninstalling the game, but I'm not playing again for a while and I sure as heck won't be recommending this genuinely fun and challenging game to literally anyone."
Negative,"i would not recommend this game for the simple reason of all the bosses being the same, its a concerning amount of ""kill boss, boss comes back to life, OoOoO scary"" or ""boss has extra enemies also in the room because it cant handle itself"" and when it happens repeatedly it just comes off as lazy."
Negative,"After the first hour, sure cool game. After the next, I found myself in a bunch of copy and paste rooms, dull pve content. It doesn't feel open world like it should. After the 3rd hour I felt like I was forcing myself to play. Boring game."
Negative,I bought the game and was excited to play but I came across a glitch that makes it so I cant hurt enemies and they couldn't hurt me I looked up any fixes but I couldn't find one so I refunded and when this bug is fixed I might buy it again
Negative,"this game just gets worse and worse , more lighting more rolling."
Negative,Shit Controls for PC if you're used to keyboard and dont want to use a controller AND Disconnects everytime (shit experience). Not recommended.I want to refund.
Negative,Fix your fucking controller support.
Negative,Barely usable console port.
Negative,cant even beat the first boss ;-; definitely not for casual players like me
Negative,"A great looking game despite being locked at 60 FPS. Combat mechanics were fine (of what little I played) and there is an ok loot system (if the inventory is a little cumbersome and counter-intuitive). Game has promise but if you throw a boss at me after 10 minutes of play and I can't get past it after 100 minutes and 15 attempts of trying then that's no deal for me. Apologies to the ""git gud"" brigade but there are other more forgiving types of third-person hack & slash games out there that are a bit more fun than having your arse handed to you endlessly every three minutes."
Negative,"Well i dont see the Alure of a crock of shit port with controller buttons in menus when im using a mouse and keyboard, combat is simple hit roll block, spam spam. not great glad i never paid full price ! graphics are good but camera is dreadfull and randomly rolls around in the middle of combat, so no lock and youll end up facing the wrong way and die. speaking of dieing welcome to the dieing simulator that is dark souls.Cant agree more with this guy"
Negative,"It feels like their using internet  connection when fighting against mini bosses, hardly ever registeres when i hit, also that is another issue i have when being invaded, its basically just a luck game to see who's hits registered and who's didnt. why even have that in the game when it doesent work properly. Also i have noticed a couple unfortunate textures to say the least."
Negative,"First, let me get the big one out of the way. Undertale managed to support my PS4 controller. This game can't. In fact, all prompts in this game work for an X-box controller only. Even if you're using a keyboard, the prompts stay X-box. That is un-acceptable.Now, moving forward. I admit this is my first souls game, and after some time with it, I would never play another again.Don't get me wrong, it is a good game. It's atmosphere is it's strongest part- but it doesn't value your time. If you're not good with souls games, or don't know what to expect, as I didn't, do not get this game. Watch lets plays. Your frustration is NOT worth 60 dollars. Casuals should stay away, just as the game's playerbase demands. I cannot refund it, and part of me wishes I could. If you're a fan of the souls games, and it's lack of teaching the player the mechanics and just setting you loose in a world to die over and over is your thing, this game will deliver everything you've wanted. It is made only for you. For someone new? No. Do not buy this if you've never played the others, or are over the age of 30 and value your time and energy. This game is it's own hype, killing you over and over and over till you do regret ever picking it up."
Negative,"I really don't get why this game is loved by so many people. I will start off by saying this game is an AWFUL port. It's locked at 60 fps which is awful when you're using a high refresh rate monitor & on top of that, Anyone using the 21:9 resolution is screwed. Cause, this game only supports 16:9.The game play for the most part uses lock on combat & needs a controller.. So, If you don't have some sort of game pad you're out of luck playing this game. If you do happen to have a game pad the game is still sluggish & super clunky. All the combat is Simon says anyways.. It's not that great.The fact that this game has ""Overwhelmingly positive"" reviews here on Steam mean nothing to me honestly. The port is awful, the combat and movement is super clunky & the game doesn't have much purpose.. I can't recommend this one."
Negative,"uniliy skuchniy legkiy kal 1/10, xydshaya chast. disconnect s bossa v singl igre razrabi dauni"
Negative,Only play if you have a controller
Negative,Oh man! Definitely a lot harder than Minecraft...I wasn't expecting this.
Negative,get a life
Negative,Poorly ported console crap
Negative,Kinda boring. A lot of just going from A to B trying not to die and despite that dying a couple dozen times for the dumbest of reasons.
Negative,extremely clanky pc port
Negative,"Dark Souls III is a dumbed-down button masher. You spam roll and spam attack. No tactics. No variety. No depth in any builds. PvP is garbage. You spam roll and use estus with an animation that cannot be interrupted. Easily my least favorite Dark Souls installment in terms of character building, roleplay, and core mechanics. Now, I will say, the combat functions properly and is not bad in objective terms. That is to say that animations, interactions, and general feel are not clumsy or broken like they are in DSII. With that said, there is very little that can be said about something like this in objective terms. The overall pace and dynamic of combat is utterly atrocious, gamey, anime-wannabe cringe. The systems have been dumbed-down and the overall tactical, methodical medium that once was Dark Souls combat has been replaced by high octane, spammy ""whoever gets hit first gets KO'd"" kind of stuff."
Negative,A step back from dark souls 2 in every aspect except graphical fidelity and boss design.
Negative,nerf dark sword
Negative,Played 1k+ hours on xbox. This game is not FUN and never will be.
Negative,No cloud saving in 2019.
Negative,"If you want the full Dark Souls experience, I'd recommend waiting until servers are added back (if they ever are...)Otherwise, maybe consider getting it on console. The community aspect with the signs are a big part of a ""souls"" game imo, and it doesn't feel the same without it."
Negative,"Non-existent M+KB support.I play on MKB.  If I wanted to play with a controller, I'd buy a console.This game has worse support for PC players than Skyrim, a game a decade old now.I was told by several people it was totally playable on keyboard.  They lied.  I couldn't even back out of menus because the icons were all for controllers and it didn't use ESC, the industry standard for ""back up one menu"" for thirty freaking years.What a trash console port."
Negative,"Left 4 Dead 2 is probably one of the greatest videogames of my generation, I grew up playing it with friends and to this day I still open it to play a game from time to time. The subtle but still present visual storytelling, the graphics that were mindblowing at the time it released and still hold up to this day, the lovable and memorable characters... this game is just a goldmine of nostalgia and it is one of the few titles I'd feel comfortable rating a 10/10.Sadly Left 4 Dead 2 has aged poorly in a lot of regards, the comedy that comes off as dated and offensive, the faulty vehicle controls and the poorly written romance scenes immediately come to mind. Gaben really fucked up with this one, huh?It's also very disappointing to see that popular voice actor John DiMaggio (mainly known for his work in Futurama and Adventure Time) got included as a DLC character and one of his only special moves is shouting poorly written jokes about horses at his enemies. John's skill-tree also feels underwhelming at best and straight up not working at worst (I still don't understand why it has such a huge focus on Arcane Signet, that card hasn't been in the L4D2 meta for years!), I would not recomend the John DiMaggio DLC to anyone, it's definetely not worth its pricetag of 149,99 USD.That said: some of the DLC shows how the game can be objectively improved with just a few minor additions. One of the best examples of this is the Doctor Who DLC: it includes every single character and object that has ever appeared on the world-known british tv show Doctor Who and also a bunch of new spicy sex scenes (featuring fan-favorite characters such as Donkey from Shrek 3), all for the low low price of 31 JPY!in conclusion:Left 4 Dead 2 is a classic and something that every gamer should consider playing eventually, if you don't already own it do yourself a favor and buy it now!!"
Negative,"The game mechanics, and controls are vey clunky.  The menus are even worse.  Big let down after hearing the hype.  It very much seems like they tried to combine a very technical fighting enviorment with robust RPG gear and loot.  This is a good game for players who like to find loopholes and use poor game design to win."
Negative,"Still totally hate this gameonline 1/10 (the worst coop system I've ever seen, I'm so frustrated, this thing extremely annoying and ruin EVERYTHING)gameplay 5/10 (I'm not so interested in it)sounds 7/10hard to play? 8/10 (sure one of the most interesting side of this game)Don't buy this for full price. If you wanna more fun I'll suggest you to buy ""Sekiro Shadows Die Twice"", not this shit."
Negative,"First of all i've played all the souls gamesand i have a huge complain to make to From Software. This game is buggy filled with stupid errors. This morning summoned a buddy going to defeat Aldrich devourer of Gods, everything in Anor Londo went smooth. When i entered the boss area, after 25 seconds the game crashed ( and is not the first time it does this). I was really mad, reset my pc and went again this time killed the boss but somehow it killed me too. ( good for me the boss was killed) I was really angry that i didn't find my body anywhere. It should be on the boss area but it wasnt. ( i had more than 100 K souls ). This is clearly an unfinished product and a waste of my money. In other  words the game is more like Bloodborne, enemies are very quick and you'll die even often than previous versions. Graphically is beautiful but  in my opinion Dark Souls 2 surpases this part.  My pc config is :i7-4790 K16GB Ram980 TI240 GB ssd"
Negative,Unironically one of the worst games I've ever played.>DURRR I THINK GETTING HIT 3 TIMES AND DYING IS FUN URRRRRR DURRRRRterrible pc port as well
Negative,This game is not for normal people. I'll stop playing right now to avoid imminent destruction of my computer and kitchen appliances.
Negative,Everyone in PVP is a complete pussy.
Negative,This game is awful for the pc. Developers didn't even bother to change the control tutorial to reflect the pc keys. Frustrating experience to spend 60 dollars on a 'pc' game clearly not made for pcs.
Negative,"Хуже гейм-дизайна я не видел в жизни, игра типо не спамит мобами как всеми ненавистная дс2."
Negative,"If you like repetitive unbalanced boring games then this game is probably for you. I tried to force myself to like the game but the controls and the character movement feels very cheap. Story is very unclear and made in a way that you do not really care about, so you have no urges to complete the game. waste of money and time. Good soundtrack though."
Negative,"This game has good features and you will die alot yes. However, DO NOT buy the game unless you have an xbox controller. I spent an hour looking through tutorials/ect on how to set up the keybinds for the keyboard and it's just not there. Items are unusable, skills are unusable, spells unusable without a controller."
Negative,"repetitive , cheap death, annoying, sadistic,  cheating invaders, doesnt allow for the player to decide difficulty , the co-op is a huge pain as i can only summon ppl to help if i have farmed certain item.Maybe some people like it. ive no patience nor the time for it.   Dodging past an enemy while his swing auto aims me and follows exactly where i dodged to isnt difficulty its just bad AI.barely any story,  player has no indication where to go nor why , then die in a lame way then have to redo it all/lose all souls/ get invaded by cheaters . etc not for me."
Negative,its a very good game but dont read further if you wanna play the game dont read iti sweardont go any furtherhahahaa you just got pranked its the best game hahahahahahahah
Negative,if you enjoy being killed every ten seconds!! than this game is for you! the bosses are too difficult and you will die over and over again! F this game!!
Negative,Still has console controls on the screen even while playing on PC. Terrible.
Negative,Just not fun to play... clunky controls but good graphics though and runs smoothly
Negative,"Game is way, WAY too hard and therefore not fun."
Negative,"This RPG needs to be ur type of game, because its so hard and ur progress is so small that u nearly start crying. #69"
Negative,Im just bad that's it
Negative,"TL;DR: Don't get me wrong, this is a good game but... It feels like a remake of the 1st game but with forgettable bosses & places. Light on hardware and beautiful to look, but only worth it with the DLCs or if it's your first Souls game and you don't play as Mage class. If you do want to play as mage and/or want a harder experience, download the Cinders Mod or the Convergence Mod.--------I would recomend this IF they had not screwed sorceries. This was my first souls game and I love to play as mage, but they are so boring in this game. Few spells that are extremely repetitive and only really viable in PvE (Not only that but most of the cool weapons and spells are in the DLCs). When I found out that Dark Souls 1 had more spells than this one and Dark Souls 2 had twice as much, it was a double let down.Also, there are so many references and paralels that this game is almost a remake, if not a homage of the first game, lore wise.I would recomend to play this if you liked BloodBorne mechanics or if you don't play as mage. Its pretty challenging, but not that hard (yeah, you will die but its a learning experience) and a strong point is that this game is PERFECT FOR SCREENSHOTS.But yeah, can't give an upvote since half of the reasons I play RPGs is the magic systems. The other half is the story, and I had more fun watching videos about the lore then playing it, since it has no remarkable characters (With the exception of Greirat, mah buddy) and sidequests are pretty messed up and half-made. Also, bosses are pretty forgetable. I only felt joy and accomplishment with 2 (maybe 3 if I had bought the DLCs).Overall, gameplay mechanics is pretty good (PvP is variable since network is awful) and graphics are nice and can run in my potato laptop. However, if you care less for graphics and have patience for a more clunky gameplay, I'd advise to play the other two games first and only play this one if you want ""more of the same"". (Why no Jump Button Myazaki?!)On a final note, this game should be replayed with Mods."
Negative,"The classic stool covered in glitter. Awful camera, performance, PvP management, input delay and queueing in a game that relies on perfect timing, also ghost ranges and whatnot. Wait at least one year, maybe a definitive editionEdit: 8 months later, the game is awful as ever, online is unplayable due to horrible hitboxes, netcode and gameplay choices. Don't buyEdit 2: after the second DLC, one year later, the game is still full of the same technical problems. The developers keep fixing pointless things, but the awful gameplay choices remain. This is unacceptable for an AAA game. As always, the camera is one of the main antagonists, both in single and multiplayer; terrible hitboxes, ghost range, rubberbanding, desyncing, lack of consistency, input delay, input queueing, awful balance make the online game nothing more than a coin toss in a lot of occasions. As online play makes up at least 25% of the game, you actually get a butchered product. Buy responsibly, at least PvE can be enjoyed, if you don't care for camera and hitboxes"
Negative,"I was really hoping to play this game but the mouse+keyboard implementation is poor. It's not as bad as for ex Dragon Age but it suffers from being a direct consol port nonetheless. Even the tutorial at the start of the game lists only the pad key combos.I've commited 2hrs to try to get a handle on the basic controls but mouse and key is not the way to play this game. I personally don't like playing on a pad, nothing can beat the accuracy of the mouse.If you plan to play the pad then go ahead. If you're like me with mouse and key only then give this game a pass.It's a shame as properly implementing PC controls shouldn't be that hard. This definitely was not on the developer's agenda."
Negative,bloodborne2/10 would get hype again
Negative,Hackers galore. Better on console.
Negative,"I do enjoy and like  the game, but I encountered a lot of cheaters invading. Cheaters ruin a fun portion of the game!"
Negative,I could not play this without a controller so for that I will give this a 2/10 Not recommended.
Negative,get this thing away from meauk---/10
Negative,ds3 badds3 cinders mod good
Negative,WARNING - Prompts are in x-box controls ONLY. They don't port it to keyboard. You can map controls to keyboard but the prompts will all be in x-box buttons.No real intro in the beginning. Kinda just dumps you in the game and there's no real narrative to follow. This mixed with the lack of ported button prompts kinda turned me off.
Negative,"I love the game, the series as a whole really, but the anti-cheat is so abysmal that I can not recommend it to anyone as you could have someone invade you and use a hack to instantly break all your gear, take your souls, and permanently reduce your max health to 0 so that you have to restart the whole game.  And the worse part is that their are a LOT of these hackers out there.  Not all of them are as fucking BS as the one I just stated but there enough of them to make playing impossible.  The point of Dark Souls is to beat the odds but with the insane amount of instakill hackers out there the odds are 0.  There is no beating the odds because there is no chance to win in the first place.If you do decide to play anyways, I recommend making multiple back ups of your progress every hour or so."
Negative,"I bought this game in 2003 and It made me sad because my Dad eat sponge, when finished he tried to tuck into me, I said OI DAD NO ! DAT MY ARM. I called the police and they hit me when I tried to tell my Nan I was pansexual, she called a goblin and I unplugged her life support 10/100 Die"
Negative,Controls are horrible terrible console port!
Negative,"If you want to get this for the pvp don't invading is utter shit no reason to even try, arena is ok i guess though 90% of evryone is laging so it's imposible to ripost"
Negative,"Ban, no reason. Hate this bullshit."
Negative,A waste of time.
Negative,It isn't Dark Souls II Bad game
Negative,"You might think playing and beating this game will make you feel nice and accomplished, but I beat all the bosses three times and tried all the endings for which there are achievements and, I feel just about nothing."
Negative,"Bro play Dark Souls 2 Bro, it's so slow and methodical, it has a greater weight to it"
Negative,the game is great and all but when i try to play with a mouse all the button defaults go to controller and when i tried to play with a controller the sensitivity is way to high and it still gives me control of the mouse cursor
Negative,fuck this game the anti cheat is non existant hackers are barely punished and if they are banned they just create a new acount whit family share me nor my friends can play this game whitout encountering a hacker every 3 fucking minuts the game is not worth playing anymore good job fromshitware
Negative,"This is not a PC friendly game. Tutorial shows you for example to click ""A"" but if you hit A, nothing happens. You really want to hit E, as that's the default keybinding.  All the tutorial is completely wrong because of this."
Negative,Almost non exsistent support for mouse/keyboard
Negative,Its a realy nice game but after 3 games they still cant make the game work for pc its just a emulation of a consolgame
Negative,game too short + overpriced for a 7 year old game that doesn't include the DLCs in the base version.
Negative,Bad PC port. bad hit register. only play on a console controller.
Negative,"Bandai are losers i'm never buying another souls game again.. I understand this game is older now but your marketing techniques are crooked as can be, you should be offering a refund for DS3 and all other games affected by this RCE exploit that you knew about for years but did nothing about! Now you are using it as leverage to take the servers away and make people buy elden ring if they want to play dark souls PVP. Real smart."
Negative,"Same old garbage Souls gameplay. Absurd enemy hitboxes, stupid (although grossly OP) enemies attacking you through walls, annoying pools of poison you have to trek through, cheap enemy placement and for some idiotic reason they got rid of the leveling up improvement after the first Dark Souls and make you go back to the beginning area to talk with an NPC every time you want to level up. Sekiro is what these games should have been. The stealth and combat are both fun and fair. You start that game with everything you need to win. No souls/ xp grinding necessary. I've already suffered through the first Dark Souls and don't think I'd be missing anything other than the cool art skipping this one either. Don't even get me started on that turd called ""Dark Souls 2"". At least this is better than that one. Not that that says much."
Negative,"looks like dark souls and your character moves and feels like dark souls 1, but the enemies move like bloodborne leaving you feeling like a slow lumbering POS in a world occupied by lightning fast enemies with spammy movesets and no stamina bars. in other words it doesnt feel nearly as fair and balanced as ds1. it seems like they resorted to cheap tactics to make it feel difficult without balancing against the increased enemy speed and attack frequency. in other word the stamina managment no longer adds to the gameplay because the enemies themselves have infinite stamina. i want to like this game but it just falls flat, the exploration feels very linear and the bossed feel recycled."
Negative,I wouldn't recommend for any users using a keyboard and mouse. Even if you select keyboard & mouse as your primary control all of the displayed options including tutorial steps only show console controller tips. Really sad that the developers were so lazy with the pc version.
Negative,"Horrible controls if you are a keyboard / mouse player. I don't even have a controller connected to my PC and all i get in game is the allocated controller buttons for each function. To each their own, but I don't waste my time on this game any further.....again money burned for a crap purchase!!!"
Negative,"Deeply flawed game balance.Encounter balance is bad.  Most enemies have way more range than you do (most enemies are like 10 feet tall, even) or will step forward with every swing while tracking you aggressively, and so the only thing you can do is punish openings after they attack.  Most of their attacks come out extremely quickly as well, so you have to fumble through a few fights with any given enemy before you can predict them.  This is far more of a trial and error process than previous Dark Souls games.  Some enemies seem overpowered compared to other enemies in the same zone, which would be fine if they were on side paths.  No, they're on the main path.  They aren't gimmick fights either, there's no trick to it.  It would be fine, again, if you could just take some damage and get past, but the estus flask heals very little.Weapon balance is worse.  The standard longsword has absurd reach, as if it's 50% longer than the physical object.  It retains its versatile moveset from previous games so for quite some time there's no reason to use anything else.Estus flasks are extremely fast now so you basically can't interrupt someone healing in PvP.  This makes PvP a slog, and is even worse against NPC invaders because they get WAY larger heals from their estus than you do.Exploration feels strange.  The environment seems to have huge chasms everywhere and buildings are placed with no rhyme or reason, giving the impression that it's a patchwork world.  Maybe there's a lore reason for this, but I found it demotivating since nothing felt like a ""real place""."
Negative,"So, I got Dark Souls 3 the month it came out, and I've been trying, and waiting, for the game to actually run.  Now here we are, the second DLC is about to come out, and I know it's late, but I'm just sick of waiting.  The game takes almost twenty minutes to load any location, there are graphical glitches aboundant, and both enemies and my character do not take damage unless hit at the spawn point.At first, it was funny that I could just run into the middle of the room and kill both Iudex Gundir and Vordt of the Boreal Valley, but I couldn't go down the elevator to the Road of Sacrifice, because it would just drop me into a bottomless chazm.  I never challenged the Dancer, because I knew beyond that way lay another elevator, waiting for me.  So I've sat here and watched others play the game, both with enjoyment, and with rage.  The game looks wonderful, the story seems interesting. and there's a wide variety of playstyles I'd love to test out.  But alas, I am defeated by the two greatest enemies in the Soulsborne franchise.  Glitches and Gravity.I do not reccomend this game, if you have an AMD computer processor, because that seems to be what's causing the glitch, according to my research."
Negative,"This game isn't hard. It's frustrating. Dieing over and over until you memorize the boss's every movement and find an exploit in the pattern that you will now repeat over and over and over for ten minutes until you kill him.Now you repeat that, for the rest of the game. Oh no, you hit the wrong button because the controls make no sense and can't be rebound? Too bad, you just agro'd an NPC who will always be agro'd and you will never be able to kill because he's ten levels above you. Did I mention you can't progress now and have to make a new character?This game looks ten years old, runs terribly, is a terrible no effort port, and is an all around frustrating and exhausting experience with the same exact gameplay for hours at time."
Negative,"Personally, I can't recommend this game because of the poor port, and because you can't really play it with a friend. If you're looking for a challenging single player adventure, you'll probably like it.Pros:- Combat is good, very punishing, sense of accomplishment for beating enemies etc.- Immersive- Story is interestingCons:- Very poorly ported to mouse and keyboard. None of the tutorial messages are converted to mouse and keyboard, so you'll have to look all of the controls up yourself. Also you can't set your own keybindings. You can set them in the menu, but nothing happens.- Multiplayer exists and you can play with a friend, but if either of you dies you have to go farm an item again to play together. More of a 'recruit someone to help you with a boss' than a 'play through with a friend.'"
Negative,"my friend said this games 1% off overwhelmingly positive so im doing my part, ds2 CLEARS this"
Negative,"just get Dark Souls 1, it was a fluke. enjoy it."
Negative,"This game is good. Online has been too consistantly bad for me to enjoy it, been a big dark souls fan for a long time and this one (even though every soulsborne game hasn't been balanced well) this one is a little too in the deep end for me to enjoy it. I'd recommend this game after it gets a bit better, but too many problems and such a annoying community."
Negative,"It’s slightly frustrating trying to describe my feelings about this game because on one hand, it’s one of the best games in the Dark Souls series purely on the way it plays, but this being the third (fourth if you want to count Demon’s Souls due to a similar style) in the series means fatigue starts to take its toll. Dark Souls 3 is a fantastic entry in the series but instead of standing on its own, it feels more like a nostalgic romp and because of this ends on a less climactic note than I would’ve preferred.Pros:- Replay Value- Fast Based- Soundtrack- WeaponsCons:- Season Pass cash grab- Bosses- Magic- Side Quests/ characters- Story - Armor- Poise?5/10It Could Have Been Better. -IDNWTR"
Negative,"Iff you plan on playing this game by your self i would rate it 8/10 very good gameiff you plan on playing multiplayer its 3/10 horribly flawed bad mechanics.iff you plan on playing this coop with a friend its 0/10 its literaly unplayable because of how the game is set up.You will get invaded literaly evry 2 minutes by players 100-200 levels above you you and your coop friend have 0% chance to kill the invader and the game uses a limited item to use multiplayer and iff you get killed by the invader you lose 1 of that limited item once you run out of it you cant play multiplayer at all, horrible game decision godawful experience overall for coop."
Negative,"having played both it's predecessor's,i have to say this is the worst title of the souls franchise.the gameplay resembles more Bloodborne than Dark Souls,even some enemies use the same animating skeleton,not to mention that some of the animation from the player character looks recycled from that game.Don't believe me? look up some videos on bloodborne and you will find even a lot of the locations look familiar.If i wanted to play another bloodborne i would have waited for bloodborne 2."
Negative,"Crashing, bad controls, etc."
Negative,"Fun and challenging, but HORRIBLY optimized for mouse and keyboard."
Negative,More like dark soul 1.3.
Negative,Game Crashes before i even can play it 0/10
Negative,"The most boring game I have ever played, not to mention $60. Idk, maybe you'll like it, I'm just giving my opinion."
Negative,FUCK THIS GAME I JUST LOST ALL MY PROGRESS AND I KNOW FOR A FUCKING FACT I SAVED
Negative,"There's just too many crashes, bugs and glitches, textures freaking out and blocking the screen, the game shutting down just as you get close to the next bonfire....not good enough, I'm sure it will be great when it is playable."
Negative,"first souls game... and if these crash issue are not fixed soon. it will be my last. I was told the difficulty would make me quit and uninstall. but no, i want to uninstall because the game is crashing any time i get near a BONFIRE!. for the unitiated that's you're save point. so basicly the savepoint is now a crash point after 10 mins of gameplay!the game is overall good but these launch issues need to be quased immediately. im not playing anymore of this game so thaat i'm still eligible for a stem refund if after another week the issue is not fixed i go bu a game that works! 10/10 your savepoint will crash you again!"
Negative,"Bought it with the gabenbux i got from selling my cs go knife. TBH i had much more fun with the knife.I assume it's just a re-skin of BLOODBORNE, since it's so different from Dark Souls 1 and 2. They ruined the gameplay with infinite rolling and light attack spam. (Especially apparent in PVP) Multiplayer is still riddled with bugs, wait for 75% off at leastSHIT GAME AHEAD, THEREFORE DON'T YOU DARE"
Negative,"This whole souls genre forgot the main goal of playing video games which is to have fun and there is no fun in this whatsoever.After I finished Elden Ring i thought id go ahead and try the dark souls series and I picked up ds3 for around 20$ and started playing.Like always these games are super hard and way harder than Elden Ring which was already hard but at least you have tons of options to make the game easier, here you have none of that.i started as a warrior class and found it very weak so i tried a mage since people said it's the easy mod for souls games. Spoiler alert it's a lie at least for ds3.After trying the mage and finding him as hard as any other class I tried modding the game and to my surprise the devs decided to break all the game mods in their last patch and I had no idea so modding is a no-no unless you wanna go through downgrading the game version and downloading an exe from some random guy on the internet and i just had my enough so i passed on that.My final solution was to use a trainer and I hate using trainers but it was the only option available.After 8.5 hours I can comfortably give my opinions about this game.- In short, if you play games to have fun and enjoy your valuable free time don't touch this game.- If you enjoy a good story without watching some YouTuber 2-hour video about the story then this is not for you.- If you like a fair challenge and learning new mechanics this game is not for you.- If you have a life and value your free time because this game doesn't respect that at all.So who is exactly this game for you might ask?- It's for the hardcore Souls fans who enjoy fighting a boss for 30-plus times to beat it.- If you enjoy a disjointed story that needs multiple YouTube videos to decipher so you can understand what's going on.- If you like being swarmed by large groups of enemies with extremely aggressive attack patterns that leave you rolling on the ground like an idiot to avoid their attacks and still die in the end.- If you play games to prove to others how good you are at playing freakin video games.- If you enjoy frustration and banging your head on the wall till you win.Now I'll break down some of the problems of this game and the whole Souls genre in general:- The Game has one cut scene at the beginning and that's all you get story-wise.- this game loves to swarm you with enemies that you have no means to deal with beside rolling and your weak slow attacks even when you are at a high level, on top of that the game has way too many narrow areas that make it even harder to deal with the enemies.- Leveling up doesn't matter because the most basic enemies can take up to a quarter of your health in two hits so you never feel stronger at all no matter how high-level you are.- A lot of enemies have extremely fast attack patterns that you can't keep up with because your character isn't agile or as fast as these enemies so you end up just rolling around trying to find an opening, imagine that but with 3-4 enemies swarming you.- Hitboxes in general aren't consistent at all, sometimes you see your weapon hit the enemy but it doesn't register for some reason.- magic is as weak as mele options and its range is very short so a ranged playstyle isnt a thing in this game.- Bosses have gigantic health pools, and some of them have multiple fast consecutive attacks that are almost impossible to avoid. Any of their basic attacks takes at least half of your health.- The game feels bland overall mainly because of the lack of well-explained story and side characters.- 0 replayability since you will be frustrated that you won't play this ever again.- Its not fun even with a trainer.The only good thing about this game is the visuals, the enemy and world design and it's a shame because this would have been a decent game if it didn't use the soul's mechanics or have an easy mode and thanks to the last update we can't mod the game to make it playable so unless you are fine with playing the game with a trainer don't buy this, hell even with the trainer I have 0 fun playing this mainly because all the problems and weird design choices.i hope this trend of Souls games ends soon because it's ruining what could be great games with mechanics and gameplay that don't respect your time and expect you to waste hours upon hours fighting the same boss."
Negative,"Began my legendary conquest in dark souls with nothing but the wooden shield and club i was destined to rot with. I was met with a complex combat system that works seamlessly, paired with awful instructions on how to use my controls on a keyboard and mouse. Nevertheless, I continue on to the first boss whom i painstakingly learn from that this game is about dodging, and playing as a depraved is probably not too smart. After two hours of trial and error on top of wishing i had picked a different starting gift, I finally get to start playing the game... with my friend. That's when the real beauty of this game came through. I was told i need to grind our lives with something called embers, to play together. Okay, seems like a hardcore way to keep us together, fair enough. We finally get together and start our epic journey through this horrid world where everything seems more than capable of killing you. We choose our path and begin killing. ""Hey there's some loot here""""I can't loot on your world... or progress my own save on your world.""""I thought this game was multiplayer""10/10 game would definitely buy off g2a again"
Negative,I'm only writing this review because it's required in order to rate the game.
Negative,"Bloodborne is much cooler and fun than this, go buy PS4.fking sony give us bloodborne on pc"
Negative,PvP is now completely fucked. Heavy weapons are useless. Magic is useless. Use dex weapons instead.
Negative,"Currently in very poor condition, players with end game items and covenant abilities are able to invade new players.  Needs an overhaul to balance out who is invading who.  Game is almost devoid of friendly player base, and unfortunately is heavily dependent on who is coming through online, and if it is only hostile players changes the dynamic of the game considerably.   Core game is good, just play offline."
Negative,fan-service souls.edit: also roll-fest souls.still played it for 130 hrs because... i really don't know.thank you for reading my review ya'll and have a nice day.stupidSteamRatingSystem = TRUE
Negative,It should be clearly stated that this game is for gamepad only. Playing with pc controls is extremely infuriating since none of the UI or controls are explained for using a mouse and keyboard.Unplayable without a controller.
Negative,your AI suck
Negative,Probably the worst port of a console game that I have ever seen. All but unplayable
Negative,fucking had 15 hours on a character saved and everything logged back on and it was gone
Negative,hmmmm fuck this game!
Negative,"How can this have higher price than Elden ring, this game is from the ancient time.Dont buy this game and instead go buy ELDEN RING everyone"
Negative,this game is to hard to run and gay
Negative,"Stabbing myself in the eye with an icepick would probably be more fun.I'm okay with difficult games. Enemies with more health, more damage. Bring it on. But I call bullshit when they auto track you in the middle of thier attack animations after you've dodged BEHIND them. What's the point of a dodge button if it doesn't really dodge? It should be more than 'move from point A to point B with a little bit of flourish'.I've got better things to do with my time than get frustrated by a game that seemingly requires pinpoint precision and then punishes you unfairly for being a microsecond off."
Negative,"THIS GAME IS WORST THING I EVER PLAYED I CANT EVEN KILL FIRST BOS AND THERE IS NO CHANCE PLAY GAM,E WITOUT KILLING IT YES I WANNA PLAY A MAGE YES I PROPOBLY NOT PRO BUT TA HELL??"
Negative,"As someone who's legitimately bad at Dark Souls and has no problem saying that, I've generally had a mixed feeling with the Souls games as a whole. It's always been a matter of ""I'll play when I feel good enough about myself that my ego can take another hit"". This game, however, strikes a different chord.It's more difficult, I'll give it that. It punishes you a LOT, but bar one or two particular areas where enemies seemed to have a new trick every time I came with a counter to them, I never get discouraged. I won't let this game beat me, and as a result of feeling that rather than getting a feeling of dread every time I come to it, I think this game's done something right. Maybe it's the much more satisfying way the game controls, where nothing's too weighty (DS1) and nothing's too floaty (DS2), maybe it's the amazing sound design where every swing of a greatsword just sounds meaty and delicious, prompting me not to cower behind a torrent of magic and instead actually go in with a weapon for once, but this game keeps me coming back.However it's not without its glaring, game-breaking faults, and as a result of the downright ineptitude displayed by their lack of willingness to fix something that by rights should be a priority issue, I will not be giving this game a positive rating until the issue is fixed. Namely the bonfire bug. Approaching a bonfire with your lighting settings set to anything above low crashes your game. I tried this before and after updating my drivers, and there has been no change. The game even seems to randomly reset my lighting to Medium, altering no other graphics settings, upon its own whims, which adds an even more bizarre touch to an already puzzling bug.The game's not without its faults otherwise, but they're nothing I'd give the game too much flak about. The password system is clunky and obtuse where a straight-up invite system would have been more desirable, but it's functional. As usual if you want to get anywhere regarding certain items it helps to have a wiki page up but then again considering the popularity of games like Terraria and Minecraft nobody seems to have a problem with that, and from time to time it can just get exhausting having to traipse through the same stretch of murderous landscape, but that's more a personal gripe. It just makes it all the sweeter when you finally make some progress and reach that next bonfire.All in all it's a great game marred by a glaring fault that renders the game near unplayable at times, and as a result I can't rightly give it a positive rating until that problem is resolved."
Negative,Dark Souls 3 falls flat in numerous aspects making it an overall disappointing experience-enemy placement in this game is downright atrocious-unfair groupings and ambushes make every encounter feel like an exercise in annoyance rather than skill-despite its reputation for difficulty dark souls 3 is surprisingly easyIn summary Dark Souls 3 is plagued by poor enemy placement unreliable parry and backstab animations confusing map design an easy difficulty curve aggravating weapon degradation and an unnecessarily long duration with so many negative points working against it it's hard to recommend this game to anyone seeking a satisfying and a good gaming experienceplayed again and got invaded by a cheater who killed an npc so i had to restart the whole playtrough so ye good game
Negative,"they disabled the servers, now every time you launch the game you have to wait 5 minutes for the log in attempt to time-out before you can do anything"
Negative,"DON'T BUY THIS GAME, SERVER IS DEAD, REFUND FAST AS YOU CAN BEFORE YOU REGRET IT."
Negative,"shit game without cosideration for the players, if you want to fight a boss god forbid the spawn point is near the bgoss you gotta cross a whole lot of enemies who WILL damage you before you reach the boss"
Negative,"My first Dark Souls game. I have much to read regarding the lore but here's my review on a new player trying to appreciate Dark Souls franchise on a computer with a mouse and keyboard.The Good:+ Incredible character design and detail+ Incredible environment and locations+ Incredible equipment and item designs+ Locations are fun to explore+ Incredible sound design and music+ Very immersive from a visual and aural perspectiveThe Bad- Camera is messy and annoying, especially when staying close to a wall. As a PC player, I don't like the ""lock on the target"" that console players prefer.- Button remapping does not change on screen cue. Is it too much to ask?- Button combos are weird. It feels exremely console-ish.The Ugly--- I appreciate the difficulty design decision, but it is way out of proportion. The enemies aren't smart by any way, just with unlimited stamina and wallhack. --- Emenies attack with only one or two ways. There are no tactical decisions. --- The physics are fucked up. Projectiles follow you and they will curve if you run sideways. OK, magic projectiles are fine, but arrows? bolts? Really?--- The hitboxes are messed up even if you and the enemy aren't on the same level/ground. Sometimes the longer swords give you a longer reach illusion.--- If I release sprint button mid-air, I would expect the character continues the sprint until it lands. Unfortunately the game does not think so.--- If I press attack twice, sometimes the game registers as two attacks, sometimes it doesn't. Make the input window more sensible.Did I have fun? Somewhat. I spent too much time dealing with the game mechanics than I expected. I have the feeling that I missed some stuff in the story line constantly because I have to divert my mind frequently into mechanics. Once I get the mechanics then I found out many things that will take the immersion away as I mentioned above. TL;DR, A visually pleasing game marred by cryptic game mechanics and lazy AI-design decisions. Treat it as an interactive visual novel is a way to avoid disappointments. The game is not hard at all, it's just the game mechanics leave you tiny input windows to give you the illusion of being ""difficult."" Personally, the mechanics can be loosen quite a bit, and improve on the AI, i.e. make sensible and varied attack patterns.Do I recommend this game? No."
Negative,I've extensively played this game religiously for the past three years and I've come to the full-hearted conclusion that big man swing weapon fun. Fun is weapon swing and roll doing so play game is recommended.
Negative,"Anti-Cheat system is a joke which Namco have admitted falsely flags numerous accounts and DOES NOT PREVENT ACTUAL CHEATERS. Fought online against people in infinite health, infinite stamina, one hit KO's and yet they are still rampant and not being stopped at all. You summon a cheater via a random sign? You get punished because OBVIOUSLY you KNEW they were cheating. They won't though. I cannot believe such a system is actually still being used. If there's a chance you'll be banned from online play for doing absolutely NOTHING (they provide you no reason why you are penalized. You just are. Don't have a save game? Doesn't matter, penalized for reasons we won't tell you because we already have your money) you may as well not buy the retail copy and get it elsewhere, even if you pirate it you can still play online so it's not like giving them your money means you miss out. It's a shame because the game is great, some lazy and uninspired designs but honestly had a ton of fun. Can't recommend as is unless you're happy to play the campaign once and then never again as the more you play online the higher the chance of being penalized."
Negative,"When a game throws hoards of enemies at you, it's not always out of challenging you, sometimes it's because the game is treating you like you're stupid. Stupid levels of difficulty isn't fun, don't waste your time and energy on things that are that difficult. You might think I'm probably not good at the game. I wouldn't say this if I didn't think I was. The level of difficulty in this game starts like NG+2. Weak enemies hit hard, they gang up on you. You will face areas where there are countless enemies and you need to go back to the bonfire only to just run through the area. You will do this multiple times. This is the game treating you like you're an absolute idiot. Stop playing these kinds of games."
Negative,Probably the most unfun game I have ever played. If I could still return it I would. Putting a gun in my mouth everytime I lose in a boss fight because it means I have to spend the next 15 minutes running back to it just to die again.
Negative,"After beating Elden ring and all endings in Sekiro, I thought I would re-try this game for like the 5th time. It's still tedious, and convoluted. I enjoyed DS1 & DS2. I really can't say this game is anything other to me than tedious and frustrating. I would rather play Elden Ring or Sekiro. The difficulty isn't the issue, it's just an unfun grind to me."
Negative,controllers dont work on this shit
Negative,"I dislike the game.Everything is too fast, It's not a bad game.I just much prefer Dark Souls 2"
Negative,"too easy, easy souls , fromsoftware make E rated games, E FOR EASY, ONLY FOR CASUAL GAMERS"
Negative,THis game is fucking trash first boss is straight bull shit
Negative,"This game isn't fun no matter what they tell you. It's not challenging because it has unique enemies or anything like that, it's hard because the game has crap game mechanics. Do not buy."
Negative,Somehow the worst game of the seriesDownload Cinders to actually have fun
Negative,"This game is ridiculous.I have been a gamer for 20 years and I have never in my life not been able to get past the first level.I played for 2.5 hours trying to defeat the first boss, over and over and over again. Probably 50-60 times, and nothing.Not a fun time at all."
Negative,"hot garbage, multiplayer is agonizing to set up and you have to get an effect you lose on death from an expensive item that also forces you into pvp to play with friends, classes are horribly unbalanced, and the wiki is practically necessary for a lot of things"
Negative,"First off I've platinumed both ds1 + ds2. I've really enjoyed the series. That being said, ds3 was a huge disappointment. Worst of the 3 dark souls games. Not really a dark souls game. Its really a bloodborne trial game. Lock on camera sucks. Gives me an awful headache watching it. I don't like where they went with the graphics. Its like they couldnt make up their minds. Wanted a lot of detail but missed so much. I'd take back the graphics from ds1 any day over these. The fights give me headaches with excess rolling needed to win. I had a player tell me the lock on camera and more dodging makes it more ""real"". WTF does that mean. No one rolls in fight LOL. Many of the bosses make you roll more than anything. Had a headache the whole game. The thing I loved most about ds1 was it had great atmosphere. For a gameplay focused game they did a great job. Something that is lost in ds3. It does hold its ground as being a difficult game just like the other ds games. They had some great ideas but again, it shows that a lot of these ideas fall short. If this game looks somewhat appealing do yourself a favor and just play bloodborne. If you want a ds game play ds 1 or 2."
Negative,Very new-player friendly!
Negative,"This game is too dark, too scary..."
Negative,I'd rather play silver surfer on nes.
Negative,Trash. No reason for a game to be this hard. Its a game not life.
Negative,Full of bugs... can't even access the novice difficulty setting without beating the game.. Please fix...
Negative,Great game if it wasn't unplayable because of constant crashes. Got at least 4-6 crashes within an hour of play time today.
Negative,"Way too hard : couldn't even get pass tutorial, i was single handedly defeated by that monster of a first mob.Devs need to stop making incredibly hard games just to satisfy the ego of a minority of elitist gamers.Looks good beside that, but that single issue made the game absolutely and utterly unplayable."
Negative,Game not optimized for Pc  and nearly forcing you to use a controller. All controls tips and popup only show controller options. This is a console game with mechanics for console play and it should not be sold on Pc.refer to: https://steamcommunity.com/app/374320/discussions/0/365163686083613714/
Negative,"This game is a crash fest. I have a GTX 1060 6GB, i7-8700k, 32GB DDR4 RAM Win10 Pro and running the game off a SSD. It crashes every 5-10 minutes. Theres no fix from what I could fimnd and I spent 3hr searching and looking for one. Think carefully before investing as you'll probably just end up getting a refund. Maybe go for DS2 - I dunno but avoid this."
Negative,Unacceptable port on PC.
Negative,Even if got this game for free it would still be worse per the dollar compared to Dark Souls 2.
Negative,"I tried my best to like it but as a souls this game is just bad lmaoGo play Dark Souls 2, it's way better"
Negative,the controller support is SOOOO BADDDD
Negative,At the time of review ive got 34 hours and have yet to find 1 dark soul
Negative,It sucks your soul and it makes you cry.
Negative,"This is the worst souls series game. It has neither the world design of the early games, nor the refined combat of Sekiro and Bloodborne. It is a game that has nothing to offer besides its terrible combat system, in which the only challenge is how well you can press the roll button. It's Dark Souls 1's combat system, but injected into a twitch action, boss focused format that it was never designed for. It's an RPG where every character plays exactly the same and there are no decisions to make. It's a world where all the environments look exactly the same and are all painted with the same 4 colors of gray. Plot wise, this game never creates any novel ideas or experiences. The best emotional beats of this game are those directly referencing dark souls 1, and all the new content is uninteresting at best and insulting at worst. It might have been interesting that this game's lore is all about cycles and fading embers, but with a product this dreadful it just feels like lamp shading."
Negative,"Gave up playing this game on the PC, all the help and prompts are for the steam controller and you cant make it give prompts with keys to use instead ... found  it infuriating.My advice dont buy it."
Negative,"Apparently these devs can't be bothered fixing countless bugs and updating their game accordingly.Banning innocent players while allowing hackers to ride free, despicable. Won't be wasting money on any more FROM titles.P.S your game was ez."
Negative,"This game is largely a re imagining of the first Darksouls. In every way the game is a downgrade from the first. The level design is somehow prettier, and less interesting, than the original game's vision. Allot of what this game has to offer in updated game play is for the sake of the PVP at the cost of boring PVE. PVP in the first game was never intended to be anything more than a small side feature, this game seeks to cater to the worst and most toxic part of the Souls fanbase; the PVP MLG Mt.Dew crowd. Thus we find ourselves with DS3, the worst, and most generic of the souls games. Soulless, if you will. All thanks to those 11 year olds who just want to have epic anime battles, call each other f@gotts and fem boys, and throw dung pies at each other like the mentally ill. But who am I kidding? These people probably aren't 11, but 21 in college, and have all the time in the world to compare poop throws on Reddit; the Internets coo-coo nest. I played on PS4 and don't even remember buying this game on steam, which means I probably picked it on sale impulsively when I was baked on edibles. Paypal needs a weed test before I buy things on steam. Make it happen tech guys! Because controlling myself is just to damn hard, and as an American excepting responsibility for my actions is unamerican and something God never intended!"
Negative,So honestly  i haven't actually gotten to play the game  yet even get to the logo stuff and menu screen because there is a problem for the game that when you start it up for the first time one of 2 things will happen 1: the game plays as intended and you get to the menu screen and what not or whatever or 2: you get stuck at a white screen for a few seconds than it just becomes a pernament black screen forever untill you either fix it yourself or you reinstall the game so honestly i don't recommend the game (i also heard it's really hard and stuff but that has nothing to do with what i'm talking about right now so..... bai)
Negative,"Cant bang anyone like wtf is this game, 0/10 would buy again. But otherwise it is a good game, 8/10."
Negative,There is a fcking boss that doesnt die what kind of bullshit is that.
Negative,bad game dont buy
Negative,This may be one of the worst games I have ever had the unfortunate opportunity of playing. One word to describe this game? Wretched.
Negative,im not a virgin so i cant beat the game
Negative,Set up to use a controller and using keyboard/mouse combo isn't easy to decipher.  I'm sorry I have this game.  1/10 Do not recommend.
Negative,"this review is based on the state of the game as of right now.it is in no way representing the impressions about the final product.(a final product we might never, ever see)GTX 970FX-63508GB DDR 3 RAMWindows 10 Pro 1TB HDDacer UHD monitor 60 Hzi dont want to dig in too deep into atmosphere, gameplay, lore etc, because those are left behind when the game runs like shit on low settings and ridiculously low resolutions.so, why do i not recommend this game, despite the playtime i accumulated in such a short time ?its simple, really.the fps are very unstable, even on maximum settings and 1440p, the game can look very washed up and antique, in short: ugly as hell.it does have its beautiful spots and textures and animations, sure, but youll forget about them as soon as the fps drop to 13, just cause.if you are the ''fps drops are kay'' kind of person, you might find crashes, freezes, and blue screens annoying.youll find alot of them when playing dark souls 3, many players cannot even make it to the main menu.dark souls 3 pretty much unites fast paced bloodborne gameplay into a dark souls universe, which seems just like a direct sequel to dark souls 1, ignoring the second installation that tried too hard and failed.so, thats awesome, right ? RIGHT ?it couldve been, if it werent for lots of connectivitiy issues, many many bugs for normal mobs and even bosses, messed up hitboxes and very, very, VERY ridiculous enemy counts at times, paired with invaders that hit you from 600 feed away, because they can, and so much more bullshit that will put you off, and make you smash your 7th controller.you dont want that.you dont want to go and buy a completely messed up, hollow, broken, shitty, ugly game like this.trust me, you dont want to do this.i arrived at the last boss, but ive gone through so much trouble and shit, that i just want to take my steelbook, my controller, my pc and monitor, and throw them into a bonfire, then smash them with smoughs hammer.buy this if you want to torture yourself like i did, or if you are insane, or brainded, or a rich fuck with way too much money to spend, and more freetime than its good for you.if you want to stop shitty ports and fucked up money milking strategies like fromsoft is pulling them off, stay away.just, stay far, far, far away."
Negative,"It is very sad when the only compliment I can give about a game is that it is very pretty. This game is a very horribly unoptimised mess. Roughly every 45 seconds the game seizes up on itself and skips a few frames. And in those missing frames are hits and movements from the enemi\es that I couldn't see that bring me all the more closer to death. This game contains boss fights with weapons whose hit boxes are larger than the weapon model. I find myself incapable of recommending this game to anyone. And before I get any responses about getting good or anything, my skills of a longtime gamer has not been a factor to the issues I have been having trying to just play the game. I also know it is not an issue with my hardware because I have been playing games much more resource demanding than this game is without any issues."
Negative,"I'll put this out there for all the mouse and keyboard users out there. DO NOT BUY this game unless you have a controller (a xbox one at that). I had to look up how to dash and jump on the internet. In order to customize your character, you have to manually click the arrows beside scroll bar. And no the scroll bar does not let you drag it as you wish. You can however increase or decrease by 10 IF you have a controller. I want to play this game, it seems very cool and I love a good challenge. But the last straw was when I was trying to figure out how to equip a firebomb instead of health potions on my quick bar. I give up. I'm not spending half the time playing this game looking up how to do stuff with mouse and keyboard that you can do easily with a controller."
Negative,THIS GAME IS AN INSULT TO THE SERIES..... Dark souls PVE > Bloodborne PVE > Dark souls 2 PVE > Dark souls 3 PVEDark souls 2 PVP > Bloodborne PVP > Dark souls PVP > Dark souls 3 PVP
Negative,"not my type of game, the controls on pc (mosue and keyboard) are just terribly difficult. And it never fails to get you frustrated. Unfortunately I don't enjoy it."
Negative,ehh could be better
Negative,"If I could compare this game to anything it's the year 2020.  There was so much hype around this game I thought it would, at least, be ... finished.  The controls are incredibly clunky and the hit boxes are absurd.  At no point did I feel like I was actually doing anything.  It felt like I was controlling some creepy puppet with strings that were all jumbled."
Negative,"this game is utter DOG! i never even pressed down and it made me drink a flippin' ashen estus. also, these DAMN RATS get left on 0.00001 HP and then kill me, even though my shield was out. ALSO, this game is the most scuffed thing i've ever played. There's not a single mob who hasn't clutched it against me in a fight. Everything i fight gets left on HP so low i cant even see it. overall, bad"
Negative,game was working fine the first 2 launches but now it opens in a small screen in the top left and I can't change it to windowed it's stuck in fullscreen no matter if I change the config file or whatever it's just stuck in a tiny little thing in the top left corner oh god please fix this Also the game is too easy lol
Negative,"2021 edit.Everything I said is still true. The DLC does not help and the patches did not fix a large majority of the technical issues. Don't play this. Review has spoilers.Broken hitboxes on some enemiesA massive over-reliance on mobs instead of enemies with interesting and/or challenging movesets (a very distinct problem in Dark Souls 2, as well)Clearly unfinished in some areas (Old Wolf of Farron bonfire, after you go up the elevator comes to mind)Dumb AI that just falls off bridges and cliffs without player interactionA structure that is very reminiscent of Dark Souls 1 for the first few hours (Undead Burg/High Wall of Lothric plus Undead Settlement, Depths plus Blighttown plus Catacombs/Road of Sacrifices in it's entirety plus Catacombs of Carthus)Shameless nostalgia baiting (Literally Anor Londo is in this game, Andre the Giant is in this game, Firelink Shrine is in this game, Kiln of the First Flame is in this game, Crestfallen Warrior is in yet ANOTHER Souls game)Franchise fatigue is really starting to set inIt's really hard, which would be good, but it's hard for all the wrong reasonsCovenants are still meaningless at worst, kinda fun at bestLastly on the negative side, the marketing practices. This game had full English in the Japanese version which was released two weeks before the international version. There was no good reason for this, especially considering the game was in reviewers' hands at the same time. Now for the good.It looks niceIt plays mostly like the othersThey do a good job of mixing up mechanics from previous games, which would be more beneficial if it weren't for the bad enemy placement and rushed hitboxesWeapon arts are a neat idea, but they don't shake the formula enough (Except the dash, that's crazy in a good way)Fantastic and interesting level design (save for Farron Keep, it forces you to be very slow in a completely poison area with multiple mini-bosses)Asthetic is a nice blend between all of the previous games, including DeS and BloodborneEnemy visual design is quite strongYour character feels more like they're from DaS 1 and not 2Shield arts are very cool, making them actually have other uses and allowing for more diverse buildsIt's unfinished, it's trying too hard to be difficult (Like DaS 2), it's too similar to past games, and it really needs a better publisher. I'd say, if you haven't played 2 but have the others, this is the true Dark Souls 2, but if you have played them all, this really isn't worth your time until it either drops in price or you actually still want more, no matter the quality. If you haven't played any of the other Souls games, just go play 1. This is not where you should start in the series, unless you want a gradual increase in quality each game, in which case 1>Demon's>Bloodborne>3>2"
Negative,"I'm really conflicted about giving a thumbs down to Dark Souls 3. It has a lot going for it:Pros:*Best gameplay you'll find for any game in this genre*Varied playstyles*Tightly tuned encounter difficulty*Immersive in terms of music, sound effects, aesthetics and art styleCons:*Multiplayer. This is a personal choice, but multiplayer ruined Dark Souls 3 for me. Latency makes PvP grossly unfair, so I just turn it off. But then there are multiplayer items you need to get access to some of the game's weapons and spells, so you need to play multiplayer to get them... or farm them from enemies who have a dismal chance to drop them. If you want to get all of these weapons and spells, it'll take you about 20 hours of single-player farming for these rare drops. Whoever thought this was a good idea should be fired, and is completely responsible for my negative recommendation."
Negative,do you remember dark souls 1
Negative,"I struggled to enjoy Dark Souls 3. It wasn't the hardcore difficulty that this series is known for that irritated me. It was the flawed design choices that turned a fun game into a chore. For clarity, this is my first Souls game so I did not know what to expect going in.My biggest criticism with Dark Souls 3 is its total lack of direction for the player. Areas are fairly linear and it's not too challenging to discover new bonfires (save/heal zones). However, if you miss a bonfire (ANY bonfire) and then die, it's a painful and often punishing experience returning to your corpse to collect your lost experience points. After realizing the importance of bonfires, I had to turn to the internet to make sure I had not missed any, likely saving myself hours of added frustration from corpse-runs.Speaking of exploration, hidden secrets are too hidden and often too valuable to miss. Some of the best items in the game require you to run off tall ledges that look like they would kill you or destroy ""illusion"" walls that fit perfectly with the surrounding area. At no point in the game does it hint or suggest looking for these fake walls, yet simultaneously possess the best items that cannot be found anywhere else. If you don't want to miss out on any game-changing equipment, prepare to waste hours attacking walls and peeking over ledges.Another important, yet highly irritating, aspect of this game is the lack of item and stat descriptions. There are dozens of stats ranging from attributes which you can level up to sub-stats that are affected by your primary attributes and equipment. What does each stat do? Look online because you won't find it in game. Nearly every equipment has a vague and useless description of what it does. Each time I discovered a new item, I would have to look online for the actual values or use the item had. Weapons are designed in such a way for the player to prioritize one or two stats (some even more), but this is not explained yet has a significant impact on the damage you deal. Also, there are dozens of unique weapons in the game with unique special attacks briefly described in one or two words. What does the special attack do? Does it have increased damage or attack speed? How much energy does it require per use? Look online.Lastly, I missed out on nearly every story quest available to the player. The story of the game is almost non-existent without the aid of some story-telling by side characters. These characters appear often in the early stages of the game and talk to you briefly before disappearing. They are supposed to appear later in the game after fulfilling certain requirements, but all of them can also disappear permanently if you do a wrong action. While trying to explore and discover the game without a guide, you will undoubtedly mess up like I did and not be able to talk to these characters until your next playthrough WITH a guide. Suffice to say, I did not get to hear their stories.All of these design choices are meant to force players into experimenting with different character builds, fine-comb each area for secrets, and simply slow the player down to grind experience and more levels. In reality, I spent almost as much time playing the game as I did looking online for help on how to play the game. And even with the help of various guides, I still missed a large portion of the game.Dark Souls 3 did have some exciting moments. Each boss was challenging until I had optimized my character. There were constant sneak attacks from common enemies that kept me alert and attentive. Finding a new bonfire was a huge relief and made me feel like I was making good progress. However, all of these good moments were hindered by glitches such as enemies swinging their weapons through walls (players cannot), no pause feature (would be nice if I didn't have to minimize all the time), no borderless fullscreen setting (again my fault for minimizing the game so much), and multiplayer being completely and permanently disabled due to server exploits.I'm happy to say that I have finally beat my first Souls game, but unfortunately it was not a pleasurable experience."
Negative,"I only played Dark Souls 2 and this one, so I will be using Dark Souls 2 as reference point.THE GOOD-There are all new armors and weapons out, but some spells got removed. Overall it still got more things added than taken out-Better level design than dark souls 2, seriously. More detail in the areas, more varriation in enemies. -Better covenants, mound makers is a real solid idea and fun to be in. However, no more blue eye orbs and no more sin system for punishing people that invade alot.-Weapon skills, but most of them are boring like giving a flat damage buff. The few good ones create cool things like explosionsTHE BAD-Magic got drilled into the ground damage and speed wise. You also need to sacrifice some estus flask charges for a mana potion thing. Refer to video to see how bad hexes are in this game. Hexes are not even a spell catagory anymore. They got split up in dark pyromancy, dark sorcery and dark miracles. -No Powerstance, you got some weapons called ''twinspears'' or ''swords'' that you can 2 hand and will act like a proper dual wield, but outside that you are screwed.-You cannot infuse boss weapons. Seriously.-Annoying areas, there are MULTIPLE areas where you take poison damage for being in toxic water you HAVE to go through. Multiple times. Dark souls 2 had one poison area. One.-Invading got ruined, phantoms too, all in one go. Phantoms don't fullfill their duty until they beat the boss. So most of the people will have phantoms on them when you invade as they only go away after the boss"
Negative,The game is great the port is trash get it on console
Negative,"The death penalty is not ""punishing"" its stupid and tedious. I dont want to have to redo everything i did, and lose like 15 minutes of progress, just because i wanted to experiment or have fun. The whole game essentially feels like going through places youve already been to, because you make a tiny mistake. Theres not very many bonfires either, like sometimes you have to run really far to get somewhere, just because you for example accidentally fell from somewhere. The boss runbacks are also stupid, sometimes the actual time you spend fighting a boss is shorter than the time you spend running back to the boss."
Negative,"Terrible coop/online play.Plagued by ridiculous hackers that fly around/teleport straight to you, have infinite energy etc while you're in the first zone after the first boss....Needless to say the developers can't stop this shit - and their online play encourages this type of behavior."
Negative,Buggy game. Only runs on 1 CPU core. Fps doesn't change between high and low graphics settings. Multiple in game stats are useless along with some item description values are completely wrong when tested by the community. Pvp degeneration into R1 spamming. Some unfinished and rushed areas. This was a rushed game but hopefully they will fix most things in time. They should have kept more things from DS2. Wayyyyyyyyyyyy less replayability. Look at the reviewers time spent on this game compared to their time spent on DS1 and DS2Sword arts are amazing though and there are some great boss fights. All souls games are rushed and need patching but the bugs in this one really ruin the experience. DONT RELY ON PHANTOMS TO FIGHT ALL THE BOSSES FOR YOU.Edit: Unplayable now. It freezes and crashes. I can however play witcher 3 with zero problems. Should have paid full price for that instead of this.
Negative,"After all the hype I finally decided to jump into Dark Souls 3 and quickly realized this game is for players who want to waste 8-10 hours figuring out how to advance past the first stage.  Not sure how this type of game has become a ""thing"", I certainly enjoy a challenge, but this is just a mindless, repetitive, "" Well, I Hope this works"" , no way to advance (unless able to dump 8-10 hrs) grind-fest.  I'm glad I got this game on sale and even happier knowing I need not to try this style of game again-"
Negative,This Dark Souls game is joke bosses are waaay too easy and poise system is so broken you can have black night armor and get stun locked by someones fist but if you punch a black night he doesnt get stun lock oh by the way the wolf ring gives a solid 3 poise points. This game is for casual DS players
Negative,...dark souls 2 was better...
Negative,Bad console port. People love this game but I have no patience I guess. Refunded after 10 minutes of wasting time in the menu.
Negative,"One of the games I try and force myself to play but I just dont have any fun with these stlye games. But thats ok. Kinda fun with friend, but mine just carried as I got my ass whooped."
Negative,> Start coop> Get invaded by well equipped person within 10 seconds10/10 game would recommend to anyone.
Negative,New to the series........Meh
Negative,"DO NOT BUY! They're going to make millions on PC, and its practically unplayable in terms of controls. Nothing is intuitive whatsoever. It only displays console bindings. First boss 2 minutes into the game 2 hits you in 10 seconds.Found some fire bombs, cannot equip them to use them easily. I have to press ESC, click inventory, select them, click ""use"" then the character throws them randomly, this while you're getting face fucked by enemies. It's retarded. I cannot believe games this bad are still being made in 2016."
Negative,♥♥♥♥ing 50 dollar desktop Icon. Couldnt play Dark souls 2 because of the controller issues. Figured I'd try Darksouls 3 maybe they fixed it? Nope. ♥♥♥♥ From Software and ♥♥♥♥ the dark souls series. I dont understand how ♥♥♥♥ing hard it could be to make the game recognize a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ controller. Seriously MANY games work on a Pc with a controller without some stupid ♥♥♥♥ing work around because the developers are too ♥♥♥♥ing lazy.
Negative,"Great single player experience, garbage multiplayer that is plagued with dozens of problems. Such as password summoning doing the exact opposite of what it was meant to do, extremely bad netcode that leads to lagtastic fights, or just everyone is a gumby sliding punching bag that is basically a free kill that completely takes away the joy of the game. I'll probably change this to a positive review when they fix this in a year, unless they're gonna tell me its a PC exclusive feature again like they did with Dark Souls 2.Good thing they did a early release three weeks before worldwide (well, at least outside Japan) release to promote their game. Because that version of the game was still the buggy mess that we have today. Nothing like racking in good sales by making sure everyone sees how many times the game will crash or cause a fatal error and not bother to fix it. Three weeks before official outside of Japan worldwide release.Updated: Game is still not working properly, adding a poise stat and not having it function at all properly a month and a half after release. Banning victims of hackers rather than the hackers themselves while they are livestreaming this, then blaming the victims for not having backup saves for a game that clearly should have a cloud save feature for the money it makes. There's dozens of ways to fix their game, they just don't want to sink the time into it when they can formulate a statement instead of a few weeks worth of work. This game is definitely worth avoiding until it hits the $10 bargain bin."
Negative,"I'm a huge Dark Souls 1 fan. 2 didn't quite do it for me, but this game is awesome. The problem is that there are so many bugs the game is practically unplayable for me. I have quite a decent gaming rig;i5 4690k @ 4.3ghzGTX 1060 6gb16 gb RamGames installed on SSDAnd so this is not a hardware issue. The game is bugged. If you look at the steam forums it's full of people reporting crashes and there has not been any update to fix this. I've only had one issue, the game freezes and I have to sign out of my desktop and sign back in. I'm using windows 10. The game ran fine up until I got to the Road of Sacrifies area where the issue started. I can play about 10 minutes before the game freezes again. It's unplayable basically. I've tried chaging lighting settings to low as suggested, but the issue remains. I've tried changing clothing in game, but the issue remains. I've updated drivers, rolled them back, updated again, but the issue remains. If this is not fixed I will be asking for a refund which I'd hate to do because this is a great game when it works. I wouldn't recommend this game in it's current state to any PC gamer, because it's fundamentally broken."
Negative,"Kind of follows the old mario bros format, in a more modern way and with a dark, evil backdrop instead of the mushrooms and turtles. Still, basically just progressing through maps, trouncing bad guys along the way. Not for me, but the fans seem to really love it, so to them, enjoy!"
Negative,DARK SOULS 3: PREPARE TO BE PENALIZED EDITION
Negative,it is bad because the online dose not work if you have a bad pc
Negative,SADNESS DONT PLAY/ IM TRYING TO SAVE YOU/ IF HELL WAS A GAME IT WOULD BE THIS
Negative,"The game itself is fine, but they really need to optimize the conrols for PC. I knew this game was supposed to be aggravating, requiring a lot of do-overs, but not on the freaking character setup screen."
Negative,This game is shit.
Negative,"Dark souls 2 is better, change my mind"
Negative,"Game was on sale, I decided I'd try it out. I tested it for about 2 hours before I came to the realization that this is just poorly ported to the PC. Every objective is telling you to press the ""A"" button or ""RT"" on the controller, despite not having a controller connected.  The combat controls are ridiculous and largely unplayable. The story must follow on from the previous games because you will have absolutely no idea what is going on or why you should even care about what is going on."
Negative,"This game is glorious. The combat feels good- the timings feel excellent- and is a great place for first time Souls players to start. Performance on a 980 is great, the game looks excellent.But is it so hard to add support for 21:9 From?The aspect ratio is becoming so popular- though the only option they provide is a stretched 16:9. There is a fix available if you're willing to dive into the .HEX files and the games .prefs- but why isn't it built in? Dead Space was released in 2008 and supports Ultrawide resolutions up to 5760x1200."
Negative,If you do get this game then just play it offline. Theres too many hackers and cheaters everywhere that dont get caught by the anti-cheat and all what they do is make you unable to move and then break all your equipment and crash your game or torture you until you pull the plug. It's gotten bad to where they can manually put stuff in YOUR inventory and corrupt your save file getting you banned from online and putting you in the server full of people supposedly caught for cheating so its gonna be even more hell there. FROM's anti-cheat sucks more than any game I've ever played so just dont get it.
Negative,"Though it might be the most accessible game in the series, Dark Souls 3 borrows so many ideas from its predecessors that it becomes derivative. While it's not a bad game, I can only really recommend it if you've completed 1 and 2 and are just looking for more of the same gameplay, without the intrigue of their respective stories."
Negative,"Nope, not a game for me. Graphics are nice but the game play just sucked."
Negative,dark souls 2 is better
Negative,Not a bad game but is ruined by shitty pvp
Negative,"Only just starting out on this game now, but first note: When playing on the PC and using mouse and keyboard, it's less than helpful having ""tips"" you can read that remind you what controller buttons do...In short, I'm barely in, but if you're planning to play this on PC without a controller, I'd have to advise to give it a miss. It's very poorly introduced, and you'll be left constantly having to try to ""translate"" the not so helpful tips from ""controller to keyboard"". PC support seems to be an afterthought, and as such, your introduction into the game will not be enjoyable.So far, the PC / keyboard interface is confusing and unfriendly ie poorly thought out and in some cases counter intuitive. Casting spells as far as I can see involves switching to a ""staff type"" weapon in one hand at which point you can left/ right click to cast the selected spell. I don't yet see how to change weapons on the move.EDIT: From google, I can see other people have had this issue. Hit ESC and go to equipment. you'll see slots for weapon 1, weapon 2 etc ie right hand. Assign your melee to slot 1, staff to slot 2 etc. Now use SHIFT and up on the mouse wheel to toggle them.In short though, NOT recommended unless you're a console player / use a controller. It's just not well polished and ready for PC release in this state. I don't expect a PC release in this state. It shows a lack of professionalism and attention to detail."
Negative,This game is crashing every 5 minutes.  Its basically unplayable.
Negative,This game is the most sitem game ever
Negative,"The game is a very good game, but it's not a great souls game. I enjoy boss fights too, but this isn't a monster hunter and bosses shouldn't be the main focus. I loved Dark Souls, I played it on release. The levels were long and the bonfires very scarce. Sometimes there was a single bonfire in a very long level and there were shortcuts instead of new bonfires, I'm talking about Undead Burg. Sometimes there weren't any bonfires at all till later in the level like Blight Town, reaching those bonfires felt like pure bliss. And in the former games bosses were just the final challenge at the end of the level, but the level itself was very challenging with lots of bottlenecks full of enemies and multiple ambushes. Dark Souls 3 just feels like lot of filler between boss fights; you can just run past enemies since the levels are so open and the bonfires and extremely close. I also didn't like the fact that you can teleport since the beginning and you have a big lobby with all the venderos you need... I dark souls 1 you actually had to plan your visits to the blacksmith and vendors... Other thing that let me down was the weapons and armor, it feels like 75% are recycled from previous games, this game didn't add iconic NPCs or equipment and it abuses references from previous games.Overall it's a very good game, no doubt about it. But it doesn't live to the expectations of the previous games."
Negative,"crystal sage is the shittiest boss design in the history, stupid fucking hitbox, impossible to predict no sound que no movement que just a fat fuck with like 5 copies that long range you at the same time, walk fucking 100 miles every time you die, boring ass levels. played 4 hours spent 3 hours fucking tryna find bonfires. story goes crazy tho, but yea, fuck that stupid boss and the level designs"
Negative,"I think this game is good if you want to suffer in pain or like a challenge but the reason i don't recommend it is because the multiplayer system the worst ive seen in all of my life. If you buy the game to play multiplayer, just don't. Also, I found it quite boring and i don't like the linear game-play, its almost like there are levels and u just gotta try-hard to beat em and if u die u start the level over again kinda like geometry dash but for PVP. Additionally, the combat is clunky for keyboard and mouse players, the graphics suck (not the shaders, mainly the anti aliasing ), the game is dated and doesn't show controls for keyboard players, only controller. The main mechanic in this game is dodge rolling then left clicking, there isn't really any combos that are useful as enemies attack so much and its not worth it most of the time. Lastly, it seems like this game was made solo and for console then just added multiplayer in 1 day and made it terrible then ported it over to PC with no effort at all. If u like souls games u will like this game but if u wanna have a fun relaxed experience with friends don't bother reading further reviews."
Negative,"Honestly, if you wanna play a souls game, look elsewhere. The regular enemies have more HP than the bosses who range from easy and uninteresting to tediously long. I like to call this 'bloodborne at home' though even that is generous. If you like the vibes play ds1 if you like the combat play elden ring or bloodborne. If you just don't like this game, play DS2, it is better in every way. This game is the most linear fromsoft gets, and of every souls game I've played the only one so miserable I put it down. Its only truly redeeming factor is it has better lore than 2, but you don't need to play the game for that.and lastly, they did my girl Gwyndolin dirty. I will never forgive it for that."
Negative,Bad game Honestly
Negative,"too slow, too clunky. cant change my mind, getting good can also happening with action instead of patience"
Negative,Hit Boxes Are Poopy
Negative,who ever made this game i will fucking murder you
Negative,This game is harder then Elden Ring...
Negative,"-1 xbox controller, fuck this game."
Negative,Dog water game not a fan
Negative,No. I'm sorry but parts of this are too frustrating to be fun. I prefer to play for the story and exploration but the gameplay stands in the way.
Negative,worst souls 3
Negative,I tried this game like 20 times but I just can't . What a fucking awful wooden piece of crap. Sheesh/
Negative,I didn't want to write a review. I just wanted to click no that I would not recommend this game to other players.
Negative,fuck this game
Negative,"shity fcking game. SUX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the game blows, folks....."
Negative,"Yes, Hard game, I can accept the fact that it is suppost to be hard, but what is the deal with enemies that attak non stop, and dodge that is not always working and not always is being used even when spamming the dodge button, same with the attack that sometimes i spammed attack button but it refused to attack even when I wasn't getting hit by anything. Not even mentionning the fact I was using dodge button and all i got is me seesing what the enemy had for breakfast which was nothing"
Negative,"Soul-like games are great concepts.  Difficult game, where the player satisfaction comes from within, intrinsic.  If you like it, great.  But there are just so many ass-backward game designs that could be improved to modern standards, yet they are regarded as pure by the fans.I don't like having to walk one entire minute to the boss if I'm defeated, it's just like unskippable cut-scenes, but worse since you have to control the character.  The devs do realize this, and added elevators and short cuts, but just won't ever in hell to put the bonfire right before the boss; because it wouldn't be ""hardcore"" enough if we aren't given a chance to mess up on our way to the boss and lose all of our souls.Nothing in the game is described clearly.  Alright, ring gives me more damage when I'm about to die.  How much damage?  at what health?  Stuff like this makes have to look up the wiki for.  Make no mistakes, I love look though game wikis, but it's just retarded to look though the wiki because nothing is defined or described clearly in game.  Oh, and don't get me started on the giant where you have to use the stormblade to beat.  No hint, no nothing.  Half-life games were great because they explain things without having to really rub the information in your face and is intuitive, not dark souls.The first few chapters are great, steady learning curve and difficult yet fair mobs, the last few got really bad.  Akin to the monster hunter world DLC where everything is unfair just to give the illusion of being difficult.Like I said, if you like the franchise, great.  But jesus christ do the devs and some elitism fans need to get off their high horses and make fundamental improvements to the game.  This thing is missing so many obvious modern game designs ideas that gives off the feeling that the game is stuck at demon souls and never improved.and the devs wants easy PC money but can't even be bothered to make PC localized UI.  What a joke.inb4, ""git gud"" but this game is just not for me, brings more frustration than fun or satisfaction."
Negative,"Awful game incapable of standing on its own two legs, forced to rely on nostalgia to distract you from its myriad flaws. Coasts by without too much flak solely because DS2 catches most of the hate and not much filters through to this dumpster fire."
Negative,"No tutorial, no direction during levels, terrible combat(getting hit through walls and stairs?) UI is ugly, its made for consoles...  There are games that are challenging and then theres this- banging your head against a wall.  I get why people like this game for being tedious but it surpasses any enjoyment for me.  Visuals are great though."
Negative,"Lacks native controller support. Maybe it is a partial issue with my computer being a laptop that I can't disconnect all keyboards and mice to force the game to recognize the controller. But that is hardly an excuse considering that I have never run across such an issue before using controllers for games, and this is a major triple A developer, not some 3 guys in a garage indie early access team. I can't be bothered to waste my time perfecting angles of dodges on keyboard when the developers can't bother to hold themselves to basic industry standards. And this is hardly an issue that I alone have faced. Googling ""How to play Dark Souls 3 PC"" brings up multiple pages of people jumping through hoops to disable drivers and unplug devices to get there controllers working. Where else can you find such issues with a game? This is a first for me."
Negative,"for me its dark souls without soul. i was already disappointed by ds2, but it was much, much better. ds3 trying hard to be proper dark souls game with same battle system, plenty of weapons and enemies, some returning npc, obscure lore and even same good old crazy laugh, but its just deception - all common enemies and almost all bosses are not interesting - i already forgot them, quests are dull, plot is copy paste from ds1... if your want true dark souls game with more or less updated gfx - buy ds1 remaster.p.s. still pretty solid as separate game, but its looks like degradation after ds1 and even ds2. i hope elden ring will be better."
Negative,"God, I honestly wanted to give this game a chance. I knew this game was hard going into it, however its not really hard just poorly designed. I died a lot beating the first boss, like over 15 times, sometimes id just jump off the cliff just not to give the AI the satisfaction of the kill. I finally killed the boss, and let me tell you when I did I felt amazing. However there is an intentional save bricking NPC that is just as probably stronger then the boss you just fought. Keep in mind that every single NPC at this point has been hostile, so when you come across this NPC you just assume hey look another new cannon fodder mob and attack him; THEN BOOOM your save is bricked cause now hes just going to kick your ass repetitively. I'm not doing that first boss again because of shitty game design. 5/10  story is probably good i just don't know cause the game design is shit."
Negative,the game sucks its way to hard to play i bought it on sale and the first boss is way to hard and i cant refund dont buy
Negative,very shit ass game mechanics are trash very unbalanced unplesent and overall the worst game i ve ever played
Negative,this game sucks
Negative,">>>PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK<<< I NEARLY HAD A MAJOR MELTDOWN AND A LITTLE HEART ATTACK CUZ OF THIS GAME, TO SOME IT IS A WALK IN THE PARK BUT THIS GAME ISN'T WORTH YOUR TIME. YOU'D BE BETTE OFF PLAYING A DIFFERENT FANTASY GAME LIKE ELDER SCROLLS, FF XIV, OR WOW. F..K THIS GAME!"
Negative,"Only fun you can have playing this game is with a friend because I can't imagine a person playing this game for the sake of it being a good game, but solely to say the beat Dark souls 3.The game is horribly designed with league of enemies that you can fight the exact same way with go-to strategies for large enemies being literally sitting underneath their legs because they were not coded to attack underneath them. This kind of laziness in coding is evident throughout the entirety of the game because it feels like every enemy was designed on the first try and put into the game with no buffs or nerfs. They didn't get any playtesters to comment on combat strategies or level design.I think putting a bonfire before every major boss is a must because even though the max amount of tries for a single boss I went through was about 9, the tediousness of having to walk even 1 minute to get to a boss fight, gives you enough time to just question who thought that was a good idea to put into the game. Sometimes you don't see a bonfire for a good half hour of game play and you have instances where you can LITERALLY see two bonfires in one frame. I'll probably get some outback bent-neck diehards to say ""YoU'rE jUsT bAD"" or ""tHaTs dArK sOuLs"" but these kinds of problem don't lead to enjoyment when playing a game and that's something I think every game dev strives for. The only genuinely good boss design I've seen was in the final boss, Lothric princes, and champion gundyr (second time you fight him) because they had a good sense of combat memorization; every other boss or enemy was either camp their legs or hit them before they hit you so stagger them so they don't get to stun-lock you"
Negative,"The flawed boss design is what makes the game unbearably hard, this isn’t “good game design”. This game is a pathetic attempt to make a “hard” game, and by hard Fromsoft means broken game mechanics and unbalanced power levels. Don’t buy this game if you want to actually enjoy your life unlike all the slantie weebs it was designed for."
Negative,"impossible to play.. extremely low fps no matter what I tried. this game must have the worst fps I have ever had in any game and I cant see the reason why... I have no problem running pretty much any game so imagine my surprise :/I'ts a shame because I really like the game and wanted to play it for a long time, now that I just bought it its unplayable :/"
Negative,huge pain really irritating not enough free time for me to figure out everything cant even coop with friends without jumping through hoops i dont understand why people think this series is good
Negative,"COMPLETE TRASH, NOT GOOD FOR PC.........."
Negative,"Cannot recommend anyone buy itPC port- no FOV slider and the default FOV is 70°. If you get motion sickness, this game will give you nausea. This alone would be a dealbreaker were it not for third-party tools that can change FOV- button prompts are always for an Xbox controller, and do not update with keyboard bindings- menus are very clunky to navigate with a mouse, and are scaled for TV gameplay instead of monitor- the in-game menus (inventory, character etc.) are in the same menu as the actual options menu. Very bad design.- artifact of designing for controllers: Spacebar is bound to backstep/roll AND to sprint, which means rolling happens on key RELEASE and so is extremely laggy. Sprint should be a separate binding so you can put it on a different key. Then rolling can happen the instant you press space.- no 'Quit to Desktop' button - in order to quit the game you have to Alt+F4 or quit to the main menu, wait for it to log in and load, and THEN close the game. Bad design.+ supports KBM and controller input simultaneously+ every control can be rebound, and mouselook and keyboard input works properlyAccessibility- no difficulty options whatsoever. You might think DS doesn't need difficulty options because it's fairly balanced, but you'd be wrong. The same game is a vastly different challenge level for different people and Dark Souls doesn't account for that at all. Fortunately, there are tools that let you tweak the balance yourself. Look at Pathologic 2 for an example of how to do difficulty settings correctly.- no pausing, even in singleplayer or offline. Not pausing while in the inventory is fine, but offering NO way to pause a singleplayer game is unacceptable.- no way to opt-out of invasions. If someone is embered or summoning, it's because they're struggling - dumping an invader on them is the absolute last thing the game should be doing. PvP should be opt-in.+ all dialogue has subtitlesThe good stuff+ fantastic combat system+ excellent level design+ highly varied enemy and boss design+ extremely broad playstyle choice+ satisfying sound design+ atmosphere and worldbuilding is grim in a fun wayMisc problems- toxic community. Getting frustrated or suggesting that the game needs difficulty options is invariably met with ""just git gud lol""- occasional bad hitboxes. The Dancer has a few attacks that hit for too long, and almost every grab attack has a broken hitbox that can get you from what seems like a kilometer away."
Negative,"Invaders with infinite Heath hack can't play, don't buy waste time."
Negative,Error and trial. Meant for feeble people that need to git good.
Negative,"Impossible to recommand this game to anyone yet.TECH :- Xbox controls are weirds (RT/RB to attack ? LT/LB to parry is ok, but attack? RB? seriously?)- Some of the controls need extensive explanation to understand how to do it : https://steamcommunity.com/app/374320/discussions/0/365163686083414158/ . The in-game tootip for this move is L+RB . Controls should be clear.- PC controls are a bit better (for me) BUT the game tells you to screw yourself because there is only xbox controls displayed in help tooltips.- Camera is fine with a controler, but it's a shaky mess with a mouse (even with mouse acceleration at 0 and camera speed at 2)- The game can't seem to handle a correct framerate, whatever the detail level I use (linked to previous point)GAMEPLAY- You can't level up until you beat the first boss : either you can do it with the character you start with, or you 'just' have to start again- Most ennemies present near to no challenge (even with multiple ennemies together)- Starting weapons give no feeling of hitting (could expect anything else from a rapier)- You may find weapons that you can't use right from the beggining : it's just frustrating. Why do this ?- Character creation is bad (and any character you create will by an ugly mess... intended ?)The good points :- Aesthetics of the world is really good- Good use of diegetic informations to guide the playerI will update this review as I go further into the gameUPDATE : I defeated another boss, and my biggest struggle so far is to find any funUPDATE2 : I just beated a huge tree boss by kicking its balls... Maybe it's just the best game in the universe after all..."
Negative,That moment when you get backstabbed by the person right in FRONT of you
Negative,"Two words, Bark, Balls.In other words, SHIT."
Negative,"A bit boring if i'm honest. Just seems like a rolling simulator. I can deal with that though so long as the story is engaging. The Witcher 3 being a good example. But Dark Souls in my opinion wasn't engaging enough to keep me interested in constantly rolling in combat. Also the fact that using a mouse and keyboard is next to impossible so i had to use my controller was a huge negative in my eyes, so if you don't have a controller you are screwed."
Negative,"People may enjoy the combat system but I don't. You feel like a tank in the worst way in regards to movement. The story isn't very interesting, and the general atmosphere is quite depressing. I don't enjoy having a general feeling of disorientation since there is no accesible map. Overall, not my kind of game. I feel that people may enjoy it because of the challenge and not because the gameplay is actually fun."
Negative,DLC souls 3
Negative,"GOOD GAME, but i got banned for loading in characters saves so i can make pvp builds. retarded."
Negative,0/5 No poise
Negative,"I could accept everything in this game.. really evertything.. but not the loosing all of my XP / Souls upon death, and the stamina limit compared to a lot of enemies you have to fight in this game. The XP waiste makes me feel I waisted my time gathering them before.."
Negative,"This is a game designed to replicate Hell. It doesn't do it in quite the same way as Dante's Inferno, since that replicated the geography and denizens of Hell. This game replicates the experience of Hell, except that where Sisyphus had no choice in the matter... you do. You can choose to push that boulder up the mountain over and over again, only for it to roll down as it nears the top over and over again, and then once you finally (finally, in a Herculean feat) get it to the top by sheer luck (usually) you can upgrade your boulder to a slightly smoother one before being faced with an even bigger mountain... and another and another and another. Plus you can go online to allow internet trolls to mess with your boulder at random intervals, for if you didn't think that this game was horrible and sadistic enough. This is a game for masochists, and I suspect that forcing people to play it would contravene their human rights under the Geneva Convention. The dragon was awesome, though."
Negative,"You walk through an entire ""level"", get beat repeat, it takes a decent amount of time to get to bosses from campfires and when you finally get there they 3 hit you, and also this game was designed for an xbox controller, it tells you all the controls with xbox controls, where you either have to guess or go through the controls in the settings, but when you do that the game doesn't pause, I wanted to like this game but I just can't, it wasn't made for mouse and keyboard, and imo everyone says it's great but I can't see it, it's almost like beer, people don't like it but they think others like it so they try to like it"
Negative,"Overrated shit, clunky animation, riddicoulus hitboxes, the delay between my character performing an action and pressing a button is insane, just garbage. 1st boss is random AF, if the other ones are the same I do not see the point in playing.Great artstyle, but no substantial plot. Highly Overhyped GAME!"
Negative,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/358987749963071509/393887392597147648/unknown.png WTF is this. when ever i kill an enemy in dark souls 3 this happens!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Negative,DO NOT BUY FOR PC!!!!! The controls are ment for xbox and ps4 :/ they dont even change display for the button like it would say hit (A) to interact etc (for xbox) but for pc its e .... its like that for everything .... very annoying... dont buy for pc waste of money
Negative,Crashes too often
Negative,"boring, dark souls 2 is better"
Negative,"total garbage, dark souls 1 wannabe"
Negative,"Dumb ass devs couldnt even bother to put PC controls for it. mouse sensitvity is way to fucking high, i have it at 0 out of 10 and its still too high"
Negative,"Third installment into the franchise and no ultrawide support. Graphics on MAX and the game looks worse than a modded DS1 PtDE. Jesus, am I disappointed.To me there's only one game in this franchise, and that's DS1 PtDE."
Negative,"I know this will be an unpopular opinion but this game is garbage. Yes it is addictive, you will want to keep playing it but only because the game makes you so mad that the only way to appease the hatred that it seeds into your soul is to keep playing so that you may take out your anger on the same creatures that caused it. This game could be best described as a loop based death simulator. You play the same areas over and over and over again to collect souls, which you use to level up. While doing this, you die, a lot. Even the weakest enemies can kill you in one or two hits and they hide enemies in weird places, almost guaranteeing that they will kill you since the only way to know where they are is through trial and error. I was going to keep my opinion to myself until just now when the game decided to add elevators into the mix without any warning that the elevators don't reset. So I fell down an elevator shaft and lost about 5000 souls as a result of it. Cheap deaths, lots and lots of cheap deaths, grinding, so much grinding. I hate that I bought this game, it's like digital heroin and should be illegal. You know it's slowly destroying you yet you will come back. At the end of each play session you will hate yourself a little bit more than the one before. Do yourself a favor and make better life choices, just say no to Dark Souls."
Negative,"it's good but the only thing that is bad  is that if you don't spend 5 dollars on the steam store page you can't add FRIENDS to your account, i tried clearing the cache and everything.....so i am not happy with this game in the playstation version you can add as many as you like for FREE.......best stick with playstation!!"
Negative,"I can't pass the first boss. So if you are hard core gamer, then play the game."
Negative,Honest merchant killed this games online.
Negative,"whenever i load up the game kevin puts six long swords in his ass to ""cosplay"" the characters to make the experience better, but its kinda scary because instead of putting on armor he puts on his furry suit"
Negative,"i have heard of hard mode then there is this game.... if you like a challenge then this game is for you, sadly I am at the stage of throwing it out the window..... :("
Negative,i got a new computer and deleted everything on my old hdd soooooooo i don t have any progress with a dlc and 40hrs in the game nice:)
Negative,"Worst game of the series, nothing more."
Negative,"unless you have, or get, the steam controller it is completely pointless buying this game. its terrible with just keyboard and mouse, even if you dont have the steam controller attached it still displays all buttons, help popups, and gameplay like you have the controller. this is the first game i've ever owned that has made my computer crash, and the first game that will randomly restart if it thinks my framerate isn't high enough."
Negative,"Hands down the worst game I've ever played, while also being one of the worst PC ports I've ever played.- 60 FPS lock- No ultrawide support- Game menus are ugly and dated- Graphics are ugly and dated- Clunky controls and movement, feels like a 2005 game- Combat offers no gore or anything special- First boss 10 minutes into the game is absurdly difficult, poorly designed, and unfair- Overall very amateurish and unpolished game; feels like a low budget indie gameGame is pretty much everything you'd expect from a lousy console port to PC.  Baffling how this game can have overwhelmingly positive reviews with how bad the port itself is apart from the terrible gameplay."
Negative,"Lazy port, hard to play without controller with the guide showing controller buttons rather than keyboard when using one."
Negative,No cloud saves. RIP my character.
Negative,"PC unfriendly due to all instruction is written in controller, which forces to get a controller to play"
Negative,was too easy and i beat it fast bad game
Negative,"Level design is noticably linear, combat has numerous issues, glitches galore, terrible balance issues especially in multiplayer, awful netcode and summoning reliability, mediocre bosses that are overwhelmingly poorly thought out gimmicks, a bland cast of enemies, uninteresting encounter design focused solely around enemy hordes and obvious ambushes, constant frame drops and infrequent crashes, and numerous mechanics are broken or in poise's case just outright accidentally disabled.If you want it for the PvP, just play on the eventually modified pirate servers.If you want it for the PvE, just play DaS1 or [legally download] it.If you want to pay for it wait until a key reseller has the DLC re-release for cheap.Edit: Additional flaws.Numberous PvP mechanics have been dropped.Ieterative NG+s have been entirely removed from the game in favor of stat bloating each cycle.PC has had patches with delayed releases of upwards of a week.It's well over a month past launch and numerous major issues haven't been fixed, with no word on From's part.Hackers, cheaters, and exploiters are completely unchecked in their rampancy and the anti-cheat system is only useful in allowing them to softban legitimate characters."
Negative,"if your looking for dark souls im not  sure this will be too great.they seem to have heavily altered parrying times, and the uchigatana guy   that you find in one of the earlier zones seems to flat out ignore it if you're doing too well. game still made the parry noise and he's just like hurr durr i dun curr. and yet he can be tricked off a wall.theres a fair number of situations (and im prolly not even 2 hrs in) that paying attention will not save your life, which is what i felt brought a lot of the ""dark souls"" feel, ya it's hard but if you pay attention and think about it you can avoid all deaths.to make it worse you can just run past all the monsters cause their tethering allows for you to not be zerged if you choose toThis game just feels like it's trying too hard to be dark souls, or maybe even trying too hard to be demons souls."
Negative,"Enemies are too fast while you're only slightly faster compared to DS1. Enemies feel too much like bloodborneSome enemies feel like they have infinate stamina. They will spam the hell out of you with long ass combos and it seems like they never have a ""cooldown"" where you can counter them.Story is poorly written and people still dunno wtf is going on lore wise.Shields are damn near worthless vs a lot of enemies and poise is irrelevent. In DS1 you could be a tanky player turtle style or a fast dex build with dodging which was awesome. In DS3 you might as well throw your shield away becuase 2-3 hits and your guard is broken from 6 hit combos enemies throw at you.Heavy weapons suck because you won't have time counter enemies with their infinate stamina and constant barrage of combos.Every time you take a hit it will stun you becuase high poise is gimped.The port is a buggy mess with crashes often for some people, but works pretty good for me ( no crashes yet).Keyboard and mouse are improved this time around, but still shit compared to a controller (lazy devs)Devs also too lazy to map mouse and keyboard into tutorial level (lazy devs)I'd give this game a 6.5/10  compared to a 8.5/10 for DS1I can't recommend this game for $60 bucks, but i'd say if it was $35 it would be worth it if you're a huge fan of the series.This is the first game I've paid $60 bucks for in prolly 6 years and its reminded me why I never spend so much on ""new"" games.... Sadly most games aren't worth 60 bucks, DarkSouls III included"
Negative,"Worst game I have ever played.   If you have never had a girlfriend in your life then this is the game for you!  Everyone else will not make it past the first boss who is harder than any final fantasy ""ultiima weapon"" fight."
Negative,"Very bad port to PC.  Seriously, why put out the game for PC if you're not even going to bother to do a proper job of it?"
Negative,"Whole game is bugged, can't defeat the first boss, plz fix"
Negative,Horrible unpresise controls
Negative,game sucks i hate it
Negative,"____________________________________________   Gameplay 4/10Combat 4/10Story didn't caredBosses 3/10Level design 2/10____________________________________________I was really disappointed after finishing Dark Souls 3. I really tried to enjoy it, but basically I can't. Combat feels odd, like they tried to put Dark Souls Skin on Bloodborne or something, enemies are boring, and bosses are the biggest ""whatever"" I ever had in a video game. There are maybe 3 boss fights I consider some kind of enjoyable, but most of the time is just [Spam R1 → panic roll through all the attacks → repeat until boss is dead]. This game has probably the most uninteresting world in series, it's literally a straight line... WHERE'S ALL METROIDVANIA LIKE WORLD BUILDING KNOWN FROM PREVIOUS SOULS TITLES? There are literally 2 moments in the entire game where you have to backtrack to get to new locations, and every time it's optional. Is this even a Souls game at this point?____________________________________________ Dark Souls 3 is a  TERRIBLE  sequel to ambitious Dark Souls 1 and the flawed masterpiece Dark Souls 2. There's not a single good thing I can say about this game. Bosses are mediocre and generic, Locations are boring and enemies are nothing special. There's not that much replayability because they got rid of metroidvania like world-building, and difficulty is comically low"
Negative,"Game's fun, but can't play w/ my dad cause we keep getting preyed on by invaders. Played the game offline in the past so it's not an answer. I just wanted to have some fun moments with my dad, but that's not possible."
Negative,"Constant crashes, unplayable."
Negative,Game is just designed to punish players and remove any fun they might attempt to have. I tried to give it another shot and while I did get further it's still just punishment without fun. I won't be purchasing anymore FromSoftware games if they're like this.
Negative,"Overall, it seems like it WOULD be a fun game -- unfortunately, the developers decided Not to convert controls information for the PC version.  Most of my time playing this game was spent online trying to figure out the buttons, and once I got the basics down, it was still confusing to interpret with the wrong information constantly popping up and present in every GUI.  Would play and recommend this game if the controls were sorted out -- refuse to support this lazy conversion, though.  I've requested a refund and may consider revisiting if this obvious oversight is corrected."
Negative,"There's a specific bug that it doesnt allow you to hit enemies or be killed, the hitboxes gets stuck to their spawn and at some point you will get stuck by a boss whoose hitboxl is unreachable by normal methods.I played with a friend's account 2 years before buying it now, and I had the exact same glitch... Pretty sad you know, that in 2 years they havent found a fix yet.And thats why I do not recommend this game for this pc specs."
Negative,"Absolute trash. Dual wield weapons are useless since they do less damage with L1 than R1. Clearing out the area is almost impossible because of ganks,absent poise for players. NO REPLAYABILITY, only viable weapons are straight swords,anything else sucks against normal enemies. In the end i cant just look at the area or look for items AFTER killing all enemies,i just have to run from bonfire to bonfire to boss,and thats it,theres nothing else to that game since just RUNNING FROM ENEMIES ALL THE TIME is 1000 times superior to actually fighting them without poise or straight sword. Why? infinite rolls and infinite i-frames on doors! great game all things considered,but not for me. suck my ass git gudders,i play games for a good time,i play to ENJOY MY TIME IN THEM AND NOT GET HARRASED BY 10 ENEMIES ON EACH CORNER! not gonna finish ds3 or ds1,good bye!"
Negative,Crap of a game. way overrated. boring. waste of money. find something better to spend your money on. game was never meant to run on pc.
Negative,The game is not optimized for PC which is just lazy when people are still paying for the game.
Negative,Prepare to get banned because got invaded by a hacker.
Negative,"shit game took me 7 times to get it to work and it's written in ""xbox language"""
Negative,"no guns, very bad"
Negative,Absolutely the worst fighting game I've ever played.  Controls make the character unmanagable. And every fight is repeated over and over and over.  Don't waste your money here.
Negative,The only thing I died from in this game was sheer boredom.
Negative,"Beyond frustrating. It doesn't matter what I say though because there'll be some idiot telling you to ""git gud."" Buy it if you want, I don't care."
Negative,"waste of £40,as game crashes every time i have tryed all possible fixes still crashes i have a decent pc so please dont tell me it my pc,do not buy as very disapointed"
Negative,"Pile of steaming shit.Do NOT make a magic build - it´s completely nerfed: you have to get close to lock on, and the binoculars aren´t much help aiming spells either. Go for sword crap or something, if you made the sorry mistake of buying this POS like i did."
Negative,DARK SOULS™ III is just a Twitter femboy version of Mario Bros (1983)
Negative,No UltraWide mode(
Negative,"The game is too hard. I guess if I was better at this I would enjoy it more, and I dont want to grind the same area for hours in order to be able to advance further. Sorry."
Negative,"if you have never played this type of game, TURN BACK NOW. unless you want to fight the FIRST boss WITHIN 10 MINIUTES of starting the game for 2 hours, #Refunded  and yes i know im terrible, but come on -_-"
Negative,BB>DeS>DS>DS II>DS III
Negative,"Wow, very cool game haha, nice hitboxes and animations! hahah :)))))))))))))))))"
Negative,"Difficult game are enjoyable when there is a progression. This game punishes you ridiculously hard after just a few minutes by making you fight a boss harder than most other games final encounters. There is no difficulty settings and the game seems designed for kids who were born with a gamepad in hands. That's a shame cause the game seems otherwise appealing and run suprisingly well on older hardware. That makes you try again and again until you realize its not a game : its a frustration generator. Except if you are some sort of hardcore gamer, i guess."
Negative,"So as someone who's played and beaten all souls games ill have to be honest, this one isn't my favorite. the gameplay is off as its built from bloodborne yet still keeping souls movement. it just to me feels like a poor mix. the combat didn't feel as tight as darksouls nor bloodborne because of this.   pontiff knights being an example of this weird mesh of souls and bloodborne because they don't feel like a good back and forth they feel like you wait for them to do their flashy animations then get a hit or two and then doge and wait again due to their speed and sweeping attacks wile in bloodborne you would weave in and out of their attacks chipping them away. id bring this complaint to elden as well because it does hold the same issue to a lesser extent.  The world feels a bit incomplete as well. there is a glut of castles and wile returning to anor londo is cool, the rest wasn't too standout. overall i feel the world in this game just wasn't as good as darksouls and i felt that just didn't have the vision that the games around it had. overall i think this is the low spot in the series. two had issues but i feel it was closer to darksouls than this and elden takes what this did wrong and did right and runs with it to make a full complete game."
Negative,"*Update* Stream says I've played an additional 18 hours since my first review so I'm updating here: It's still SUPER hit or miss. You know if you're the kind of person who will like this game. And if you don't know if you'll like it, then you probably will not. It has some extremely annoying technical bugs, some of which have persisted across much of the developer's games, and you're going to be hit by attacks that are several feet from connecting because reasons.There are some brilliant game design decisions in here, but they sometimes feel so sloppy it spoils some of the fun. So even though I plan to keep playing for the time being, I would only recommend the game on sale unless you really just enjoy banging your head on a wall until the game says you win.------------------------------------------------------------You'll wish Fromsoft could figure out how to make a character not handle like a tank. The platforming aspects are awful, so if you get a handle on the combat, be prepared to fall to your death because your brain-dead character doesn't know how to control their legs."
Negative,"After watching some of my friends stream this game I thought I would give it a try. I really wanted to like this game, I really did. However I can't. If you are on the fence about this game or never played any of the other dark souls like me, save yourself the money and buy a game that's worth your time. You fight everything in this game. Like literally everything. The bosses, the endless enemies spread throughout the area, gravity, the camera, lock on, the menus, the animation, the mechanics, etc... you name it, you'll be fighting it. I'll start off with the positive. The graphics are great. Oh and the level design is pretty good too. Now for the negatives...You are grossly underpowered compared to everything in this game. There is no such thing as a fair fight, even when fighting the regular enemies during your travel. Even when you do get the chance to level up, get ""better gear"" and what not, you hardly notice a difference when it comes to damage dealt or taken. Falling more than 2 inches typically results in more than half, if not all, of your health. The lock on.... OH GOD THE LOCK ON. Don't even get me started. You want to lock on to the enemy 2ft behind you while your running away? nope. Do you have to enemies in front of you, one 5ft away, one a mile away and want to lock on to the closer one? HA think again you fool! Your gunna lock on to the one a mile away. Did a column 1ft in diameter go between you and the thing your fighting? Say good bye to your lock on. Want to lock onto that enemy LITERALLY STANDING 5FT IN FRONT OF YOU that your didn't aggro yet? NOPE, try again. I think you understand my frustration with the lock on. The menus are garbage. It took me about 10 hours to go into the right menu and actually equip ""better"" gear and weapons that I and found. You would think that ""oh I picked this item up and it is in my inventory, so I'll go to my inventory and equip it"" Makes sense doesn't it? Not in Dark Souls. Animations are a far greater enemy than the actual enemies. 90% of the time I died was because I was stuck in an animation and couldn't to the dodge, hit, heal, etc... or have enemies endlessly hit you because they have infinite stamina while blinking your eyes drains the stamina bar completely. And lastly, the game mechanics.... Want a good story? nope. Want to know how to properly play the game? nope. Did you make an hours worth of progress and want to keep that progress? nope. Want to spawn right outside that boss room because you finally got to the boss after hours and hours of trying to get to the boss? nope. Plan on doing the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again to make ZERO progress. Oh did I mention you will be doing the same boring stuff over and over and over again? Just recently I asked myself why am I playing this game? I realized that the game provides ZERO incentive to actually play it. There are no cool or interesting weapons or gear sets. Weapons barely make a difference. The story is practically non-ex...wait is there even a story? Oh that's right! I forgot! There is lore on the wiki, unless you go full on inspecter gadget  LMAO. You just spend hours getting to a boss and beat them..... for nothing and to just do the exact same thing. The game gives me absolutely zero reason or motivation to progress. Save your self the time and money, you'll value that a lot more than this game."
Negative,"Its bad, mm'kay?"
Negative,the controlls are horrible
Negative,"shit, trash game made by absolute idiots"
Negative,All style no substance stick to dark souls 1 the only good dark souls game.
Negative,Play this game if you hate yourself.
Negative,GUD (i love black men)
Negative,"fuck whoever put invading into this game, fuck you and i hope you see your children burn, that and the basilisks, from the bottom of my heart i wish for you to see your children suffer and die you absolute cunt"
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 is an amazing game. However, this steam version is literally unplayable with startup crashes, mid-game crashes, dualshock4 connectivity and compatibility issues, so on an so forth. It was dumb of me that I even purchased DLC before trying out the game. Now, I wish I could get a refund but I doubt thats going to happen."
Negative,"First off i noticed that none of the tutorial pieces set up in the beginning are even formatted for pc, it all still explains the controls in terms of an xbox controller. the camera panning during combat sucks so you lose sight of the enemy all the time, this especially sucks during ANY boss fight, there's also trouble with the dodge mechanic not working after a melee strike, and to top it all off its $60 dollars!!!!!!! what a complete waste of money, time, and patience."
Negative,this game sucks
Negative,i played 92 hours and after i reset my pc i lost my saveNICE
Negative,Poor mechanic. Clueless gameplay.
Negative,my friends forced me to play this. i did not enjoy
Negative,Constantly crashing garbage! 5 characters have been ruined in attemp to progress to 3-rd boss.Not recommended!Buy only on huge sale!
Negative,"you know, dark souls made it´s name through the ""hardest game"" title. but if you wear armor with 40 poise and you get staggered with the first hit, then why have that stat at all? so it´s harder? dark souls 1 was god tier, dark souls 2 was a good game. this feels more like a late adopted child that tries to fit in the family"
Negative,WTF is wrong with developers who put out PC ports and can't be bothered to update the basic tutorial to show keyboard instructions based on what input method is used. Exact same thing with DSII which i refunded immediately. I assumed the less than 2h of effort it would take to adjust the coding could have been managed for DSIII.Press A to continue? I actually have to get an external tutorial just to play the game.
Negative,"The only quality this game have is difficulty. It has mediocre graphic, mediocre BGM, mediocre story, mediocre gameplay. Action is slow and sluggish. STAT and weapon customization is useless since it slightly change your playstyles or not effective at all. You don't really need your skill to play this. Just a lot of patience and time to torment yourself and feel briefly fake successful after defeat each bosses.If you want to challenge your limit. this is your answer. But if you want something fun on relax time, it's not. Great perchase at discount price though."
Negative,"If you like the kinda game that is relentlessly unforgiving that gives you little to no clue as to what you should be doing then maybe this is for you.  If you like having to look up every move and every action to try to improve because if you don't your in for even more tortuous game play then give it a go. If you don't like being spoon fed, rather having the spoon taken away and a sword bashed over your head then play on. if you like to die a lot and having to replay the same areas over and over again to level up then this is for you. Some people enjoy and even thrive on this. The challenge is immense. I however are not one of them. I have played a good amount of time and can quite honestly say I have had enough. Good luck to those that begin the journey. Is it a challenging and enjoyable good game....for some. Is it just far too demanding and a bad experience.....for some. Who ever tries it.....good luck."
Negative,"Complete fucking piece of crap! Not only does this game require a fucking game controller, even though its a PC game, it's like playing a sluggish fucking character and no sence of either physics or logic. This game might have been a reward winning title back in -99, but for a game released in -16 its crap. Even if this where to be played on a console, it would be crap. Shit game, and I bought it from G2A, probably no refund option what so ever... DO NOT BUY!!! Graphics are totally worthless as well as the gameplay. Story mode? Well, it cannot make up for a bad fucking game. Coop? Nowhere to be seen.!! If you use keyboard and mouse, the mapping tips that popup still show controller buttons, so you have to memorize the keys before starting to play, and just a hint; the mappings are not anywhere near standard mappings. I.e You ""accept"" with E, and go back with ""Q"". You use some drinkning action with ""F"" wich is usually ""use"" and so on... In-game menus are a mess and does not make any kind of sense. Yet again, to save anything you must press ""E"", which is not indicated anywhere. REMEBER E!!! Thank me later.And to top it off, there is nothing fluid about this game, and it puts you in an environment where keyboard mapping is all messed up, and it expects you to fight a boss who will kill you in 3 hits. The camera is all over the place (as you'd expect by a console game, but this is on an entriely new level of messed up camera). If you try to block a hit, you'd be wrong, the fucking boss doesn't care, and as you try to get up and jump away, he will hit you facing the wrong direction and still hit you.Seriously, don't buy this game. I have no idea why people recommend it, but I guess thats fan-boys or just kiddos that watch a twitch-streamer and think ""hey, this idiot likes the game, therefor i must too"". It's a piece of crap. Also, it utilize WAAAAY more resources than a game looking 5 times as good. It's a bad port from a bad gaming console, made by a bad company.Ohh, and the last point; there is no support to be found anywhere. Their homepage looks to be something from the early 00's, and even their navigation on the website isn't making any sense.So, take my word for it, don't buy it."
Negative,"from have outdone themselves again, with two of the toughest bosses in the series to date: ""Shit Framerate"" and ""Never-Ending Loading Screen""10/10 great port"
Negative,Removed multiplayer from all 3 games and now removed the multiplayer tag.Won't refund either. Big L
Negative,literally one of the worst games ive ever played. built to piss you off. i would avoid if you enjoy being happy and not wanting to kill yourselves !!
Negative,"trash full of bullshit. How does oceiros running at you do more damage then yhorm?? Before you say get good ive beaten every boss. Sister friede and midir as well. Ive also played through the game 6 times. Last complaint, LOWER THE PRICE OF ASHES OF ARIANDEL, ITS A SCAM"
Negative,"This game is dangerous for your hardware. The devs never did a single effort to protect their users and of the hudnreds of games i own, not a single one of them need that i install COMMUNITY MADE mods just to protect my character and saves from being corrupted, let alone not to get banned or having my hardware's integrity breavhed and my privacy and data openly accessible to hackers. This is a SHAME. And if you really want to get into Dark Souls i'd suggest playing the 1 and the 2, DS3 is dark souls if it was made by a team who doesn't have enough ressources to create a real open world and are stuck with PS3 graphics, damn can you believe this was released in 2016 ?? look at the NPCs faces oh God.I paid 8 euros for the game + all DLCs and i stil lfelt bad for my 8 euros. The fact that they still sell this joke for 84 euros is shameful and no one in their right mind should pay more than 15 bucks for this half a DECADE old and lazy piece of shit game"
Negative,"By far the worst entry in the series.There is nothing worth exploring, the enemies all just flail around with wild, unreadable, tracking attacks, if you play a knight you basically start with the best gear in the game, so all the gear you find is worthless and you can tank your way through enemies, like you're playing skyrim, there is no sense of adventure - every level is just a long chain of very similar enemy encounters the world is boring and incoherent - it's just a fucking shame. The game has one good level - the cathedral of the deep - three good bosses - Lothric brothers, Soul of Cinder and Champoin Gundir - and everything else is forgettable filler.I had to force myself to finish Dark Souls 3, not because it's hard, but because it is boring af.One of my greatest disappointments in gaming."
Negative,"Is this a Dark Souls game? Yeah.Is it a good Dark Souls game? Not in my experience.Why? Combat is far too fast-paced, invaders are cowardly dogs who waste your time by running crying to the nearest enemy groups, monsters that'd be slow and lumbering in previous games ripped a line of white lightning, and can now 100 to 0 you in the blink of an eye... Weapons feel more limited, as do builds. Bosses are unchallenging, and barely noteworthy for a vast majority of them.I'd give this mess a pass. Go get Scholar of the First Sin instead."
Negative,"*Contains minor spoilers a.k.a the names of two bosses* Before anything i must say i am a diehard fan of the series. I will probably play this game alot more than i currently have. But as far as the game goes, it is just a huge nostalgic trip for players of dark souls 1. By that i mean 80% of the weapons are not new and were already in dark souls 1. The only things ""boss-wise"" that i liked about the game is the nameless king and the soul of cinder. And WHAT REALLY PISSES ME OFF is the fact that ALL weapon animations are COPIED AND PASTED FROM DARK SOULS 1, which really makes it NOT feel like its own game. AND THE MAGIC OOOOHHHH MY GOD THE MAGIC, the MAGIC is COMPLETE TRASH in this game almost COMPLETLEY unviable in PvP and PvE, It is so depressing considering how amazing dark souls 2's magic was and still is! The devs were SO F*CKING LAZY with the magic, DARK MAGIC which was a big category of magic in dark souls 2 DOESNT even feel like its own class of magic anymore in dks3 its so sh*t now its actually ridiculous. AND ANOTHER MAJOR P*SS OFF FOR ME IS the fact that they dropped the very cool and dynamic casting animation for sorcery in dark souls 2 and gave dks3 the sh*tty ""lift your staff up"" animation for sorcery from dark souls 1, adding more to the big copy and paste that is dark souls 3. GOD HAVE MERCY THE PVP, Invasions are nearly impossible now becasue they are always ganking ALWAYS!! What happened to the good old days of invading without the 99% chance of gank. After bloodborne you would think that the devs would know that we HATED the gank that you always got EVERY time you invaded. And dark souls 3 bore the most ATROCIOUS F*CKING thing i HAVE EVER SEEN, the dark sword. I don't f*cking care if they patched it they never should have let a weapon that powerful be so easy to use. It was so pathetic when people posted videos of them R1 spamming with the dark sword and ACTUALLY BEING PROUD OF IT LOL!!! IN THE END,,, Dont buy the game if your not a long time fan. Buy dark souls 1 to get you started and then 2."
Negative,"PC users beware - especially if you usually remap the default keyboard controls!I found this game to be close to unplayable using keyboard/mouse ... all help is controller based and it's very difficult to remap the keys (note that Q and E correspond to controller A and B if you try - and I'm not sure if it's even possible to remap those two).   I wanted to like this game, but unfortunately requested a refund after two hours of trying to get the controls mapped the way I always map my other games.  Sigh and sad face."
Negative,"If you have played all your games in your library, have the afternoon to do nothing, grab this game, a gun, and get ready to have an afternoon of torture and death. 1/10 kill yourself with that gun you have"
Negative,"what can I say, disgrace of a game. utterly disgusted!!"
Negative,Antiquated and annoying game mechanics.  6/10
Negative,no storyartificial difficulty at start of game is cancer
Negative,Try Dark Souls 2 instead.
Negative,"Was gonna play DS3 this Friday, then throw a party on Saturday, but since DS3 is so good, I won't even need to buy a strobe light for the party AND since I won't even want to play DS3 this Friday night, I can just party both nights!  If only the game was also a keg of beer, then it'd be a 10.  Sadly I'm just gonna give it a 9/10 since it just bought me extra free time and a strobe light.  I'll change this review once this gets patched, though I doubt I'll recommend it, since the game SHOULD have been PLAYABLE at launch.EDIT:4 days later, the game still starts up as a strobe light in fullscreen mode. However, because of being able to edit startup files, I can change the game to start up in windowed mode, and use third party software to force the game to expand to windowed fullscreen (an option not currently in game) and be playable w/o causing seizure inducing screen flashing. The game is good so far, but the game still stands as the problem is unfixed by the devs. If I didn't do my homework on this situation, I'd be HIGHLY disappointed, if you have an NVIDIA video card be VERY careful in purchasing this game.Also anyone downvoting this review likely doesn't understand this prevalent issue or the use of sarcastic satire.  Ignorance is indeed bliss."
Negative,"To easy, sorry Dark souls."
Negative,It's just like Dark Souls 1. Only problem is that this game is not fun at all.
Negative,"It's a big step back from Dark Souls II, and has a disappointing 2 hour long dlc."
Negative,"Game controls are dogsh*t. Looks like the common thread for those that enjoy the game is ""get good"" whenever someone points out that the controls are terrible. But the same thing could be said literally about any game ever made though.Edit:So heres where I'm a with DS3. Im NG++ and building a 2nd build because I cant pvp with my first build because I guess Im over leveled at 150 and looking for fights takes for ever. So, note to anyone buying; if you plan on playing pvp dont level past 120 - 130 tops. The experience will suffer.If you plan on pve only level to as far as possible if you so desire. Kind of what I have to do now with my first character.The story and the game itself is amazing and captivating. Its why I kept playing and have beat the game twice and leveled halfway to a 3rd time before starting a brand new character at which point as of this post Im about to kill Nameless King again at level 86 and continue progressing this character to 120 for pvp.All that said, the controls for this game are some of the worst I've ever experienced in any game. They are god awful and unreliable. If the game itself were not spectacular, I doubt the franchise could have survived with such terrible handling capability.So, unless  you find the story/boss fights/leveling as compelling as I do, I would steer clear of Dark Souls 3. There are games that play much smoother and to my understanding, games even by the Developers of DS that handle better such as Sekiro.If you are a lore fan and enjoy good challenging games with awesome boss fights, then you can simply overlook the terrible game controls and just go for broke. The story really is fantastic, the pvp is fun and rewarding when you can find the fights. The customization is some of the best in gaming with a wide array of play styles and weapons.Hope this helps someone with their decision for purchasing. Cheers"
Negative,this game is good but online is pretty bad!! Do not play offlibne for too long....lest you get invalid data...and you have to restart or get penalised....I f you want a fair online I repeat do not play offline....
Negative,"horibl geme. dosen't buy geme, geme sukas. TW ! kanser geme ! чертовски дерьмовая игра"
Negative,"Never liked the Soul Series.  Bought the first one but was told my opinion of it was tainted with PC version bugs and port issues.  My common complaints include:-Toxic ravenous community who would commonly say ""git gud"" as if the game was hard.  Newsflash, it's not a hard game at all.  It's actually...-Tedious at best.  No section in the game was actually challenging and can eventually be overcome if you level up enough.  You can also cheat the game a lot via exploiting bad ai (most mobs are tethered), or provoking a very predictable pattern.  Just as well since most of the game involves...-Unfair systems.  From arrows that change paths mid-air, infinite stamina enemies, and my favourite - enemy attacks that clip freely through walls while yours bounce off readily.  Any tactic that makes logical sense is probably a bad idea.  A monster with a huge weapon?  You would think luring it to a tight confined space where they can't swing freely would be a strategy but no, that's just the best way to get yourself killed because they'll swing freely while you die.- Hidden mechanics that had to be hacked to be exposed, specifically poise.  A bunch of hackers found out that this mechanic doesn't function in any way or form.  Wearing heavy armor that has high poise doesn't help whatsoever.  Might as well run around in the lightest armor available because at least you can dodge attacks that way.I can keep going but this game thrives on cheesing the player as well as vague storytelling that masquerades as depth.  This review is more intended to new players who are looking for a game with actual challenge.  The only way I got through this game was pretending I was playing a dumbed down and 3d version of Ghosts and Goblins."
Negative,Bad game with poor opimization
Negative,DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!
Negative,"Ok, this game runs absolutely fine on my 4790k with gtx970 and 16 gb of ram but:- what the F is that menu (and tutorial) only with controller options? Are the developers crazy? I don't have a controller - why the F is everything in ""controller language"" ???- Graphics are boring (at max), nothing really new or cool, i have seen better graphics and more interesting visuals on Painkiller games.- The combat with mouse and keyboard seems painfully to me. I played a lot of action rpgs but i have never seen such a lag-by-design combat moves.. What is this crappy combat system? Is anyone enjoying this..?So i think this is a hype induced, money shaking, masochistic game only for people with consoles or pcs with controllers.."
Negative,"HORRIBLE MULTIPLAYER EXPERIENCE! The sole reason i bought this game is to play with a friend of mine. Its such a hassle to get it to work in the first place. You have to be kindled, you have to purchase an item from a lady at the temple... then you both have to be in the same area and the same spot, then you have to match your passwords, and after waiting 3 minutes THEN FINALLY a white text on the ground shows up... The fact that you even have to do all this is just so fucking ridiculous.WHY CANT THEY JUST LET YOU JOIN EACHOTHERS WORLD VIA STEAM OR SOME SHIT?! Oh and what i forgot to mention is this: So you have to be kindled (on fire effect) every time you want to summon someone to your world. If you die.... the summoned person leaves your world... you lose the kindled effect (which you buy for 2500 souls BTW!) and then they cant join your world anymore till you become kindled again and do the whole proces over! Not to mention the fact that other players can just randomly invade you at ANY TIME and kill you!Honestly, just fuck this game, i know singleplayer is a lot better then this, but what idiot came up with this crooked system.And you can also play with your summon for 1 ENTIRE AREA before having to go back to your own world and do the whole area by YOURSELF AGAIN!"
Negative,this game sucks ass
Negative,"Great game.... until you get invaded they keep running away till they can whitle down your flasks with creeps, refuse to fight you and have no consequence for doing so. Completely ruins the game. If you play never stay embered because it ruins the game completely."
Negative,finish the game less than 20 hoursToo easy not recommended
Negative,"Wow, Fromsoftware. Really? Talk about recycling old content. This game is basically just Elden Ring 1. It's basically the same game, but worse. Like, you can't even jump or crouch in this game. And the world is just so linear. You walk straight, and fight stuff. How boring, there's not even a map. You can summon people to help you, just like Elden Ring, but no spirit animals. Lame. Same weapons, same classes, we've seen it all before. Try creating something new, From. The level giver isn't even hot. Don't even get me started on the bosses. I've beaten Godric naked with a torch a hundred times and you expect me to have fun with this game? What a joke. I'd suggest hopping on your Torrent and riding as far away from this game as you can. What a complete waste of time. I've got a contact on the inside with a journalist from IGN that says Dark Souls 2 is in production. He says Miyazaki himself is going to be in charge and the game is going to flop. The guy is pretty reputable so I believe it."
Negative,"I haven't played this for long but so far I really don't get the hype....maybe I am missing something? But so far I have found this mind numbingly boring with little change from hacking and slashing my way through every area I go to....rinse and repeat. Build some souls &  level up, then the mobs all respawn and rinse and repeat again across the very area you've cleared three or four times already. So the bosses are a real challenge and some regular mobs are tough but where is the story? I read people say you have to work at it but there's nothing there from the first few hours and it hasn't immersed me one little bit. Doesn't even get anywhere near some of the brilliant RPG's out there at the moment.I feel like it's a waste of my time and will be uninstalling it very soon if the game continues to progress like this...just sorry I wasted my money even with it on offer."
Negative,"My ""somebody got paid to design this"" scale broke down with this game. And almost none of it had to do with simple combat mechanics. It was all the bullshit. The lava runs, the platforming that made you magically slide ten feet to side and then fall. Constantly having to use Cheat Engine to combat some of the more egregious and hostile systems to even make the game playable. If this was just the bosses, the world design and fighting enemies in the overworld, it would easily be a 7/10, even though some of the bosses are F-tier, none of them are particularly hard or time-wasting. It's all the other crap. Like having a great pizza but for every slice you have to watch an episode of The Apprentice."
Negative,WORST GAME EVER MADE!! I CAN'T JUMP!!
Negative,"Great game, terrible experience. There is a special place in hell reserved for the creators."
Negative,"I played a whole bunch of Dark Souls III back on the PS4. Nowadays, the Fire has indeed faded. The advent of a jump button in Elden Ring, along with the myriad of improvements it brought to the ""Souls"" formula, have rendered Dark Souls III a shadow of its former self."
Negative,"This game is a failure, just like what From Software deserves"
Negative,meta and spam
Negative,"I want a refund , ive had this game for over a year and still cannot get it to work. I pass the min requirments by a mile its not my computer its your bs."
Negative,Bad old game with new good price
Negative,"The game was a good game, but failed to come online is really very bad, someone else can come to me, but others can't get in here? Please help me to solve!!!!!"
Negative,thank you dark souls
Negative,could you actually work to make a keyboard display rather than assumng everyone uses controllers. and quit having the window grab attention it is not the most important thing for fu.cks sake i just want to change my sound by hitting alt tab. and would you fuc.king add an apply button to the settings menu for fuc.ks sake i couldn't even start the game without being fuc.king frustrating.
Negative,"Really bad game.Doesnt respect your time .A lot of bugs.Overpriced.You need 20-25 hours to beat the game(half of them is running back to boss just because they didnt want to put some bonefires).It reminded me running shadow( a free game on steam like subway surfers) but with bosses here and there.I would recommend elden ring over this.It's in the same price, a bit more chaotic but surely you can do more stuff, more bosses more builds(here in your first run if you are lucky youll use 2-3 weapons , in elden ring you can use 3-4 in one run).The only good thing i can tell is that the bosses do feel good they are well designed but glitchy and sometimes unpredictable.Once again overhyped fromsoftware game."
Negative,I got the game 1 year later I don't have it anymore what happend dark souls? what happend? that's why I don't buy these gamesI'mma go cry (-_-)I mean I like the game but it took it away sooo...No I don't like ittt
Negative,"Holy hell this game is bad.Before I rip it open, I'd like to say it has some good aspects. Visually it's stunning, every enemy and boss is gut-wrenchingly beautiful. The sound design is phenomenal, the voice acting top notch, and each character is endearing in their own way. The armor looks awesome, and the environments are the perfect backdrop to your adventure.So, why would I never recommend this game to any living soul? The design of this game is anti-fun, anti-player, and anti-game. This game incentives you to never fight any of their beautifully designed enemies by offering way too few souls for trash mobs, and populating areas with too many enemies to make it desirable to get those few souls they drop. So already the game is pushing you to not play it, and to run as fast as you can to the next bonfire. Should you die, they decide to reduce your maximum hp, because clearly the area you just died in was not hard enough, they need to handicap you more. This design choice is blatantly anti-player. All of this stacked with a hidden enemy around every corner, more mimic chests than real chests, miles between bonfires, and you've got the least fun experience I've ever had playing a video game. The Farron Keep to Abyss Watchers segment is by far the most obnoxious part of any video game I've ever played. For my money, just go play Elden Ring. It is the far superior experience in every way, and it should be considering each installment should improve on the last. But the leap between DS3 and Elden Ring is a world of difference."
Negative,This game was terrible. Combat control on PC was awful. I knew after 30 minutes I had wasted my money.
Negative,"1/10 - quit at the irithyll dungeon to profaned capital run, worst level design i've ever seen in a video game, made me realise that this whole game is about farming rage clips from youtubers/streamers, there is no fun or fair challenge, only challenge here is the mentally challenged developers who made this game. Ambush after ambush, terrible bosses, you can still sit inside a boss' asshole and they can't hit you, biggest challenge in most of the bosses is still the camera, Horrible anti-aliasing gives me a fucking migraine every session.  sekiro mustve been outsourced to some other company for 90% of it cuz there's 0 way fromsoft made it. Play lies of p instead. They took the good parts of souls games/sekiro, added some more good shit and ditched the garbage. Not to mention, the game doesn't require mods and endless tinkering to run well (locked 60 fps/hz is a joke)."
Negative,"Great game, love the part where the screen goes white and tells me that Dark Souls 3 has crashed."
Negative,"Locked to 60 fps, causes weird ghosting issues on high refresh rate monitors that makes the game disgusting looking.Not only that, but the UI design is gross looking too, blurry pictograms is not how you design a menu."
Negative,"Perspective from a first time player of Dark Souls; decent but marred by just plain bad design decisions, there's some things with this game that feel just absolutely inexcusable for a game that gets as much praise as DS3. Combat is fun but really doesn't make up for the lack of polish imo"
Negative,"I loved this series, but I was invaded by a hacker who made me die an infinite amount of times, and i have to start my run all over again from scratch. The game is great, but this ruined the experience. Is there nothing I can do about it?"
Negative,"No more family sharing as their way of ""combating hackers""This hurts legitmate players banned by hackers more than fixing the problem.You can also no longer safely play mods on an alternate account either since you can't family share.Absolutely terrible decision and now the multiplayer is even more dead.Just remove your ""anti-cheat"" that does not work at all and let modders do their thing with watchdogs like in DS1."
Negative,i dont care if i get flamed for this this is the worst fucking dark souls game.i hate the fucking combat idc about your getting good comments parrying does not work blocking does not work it is spam dodge roll simulator.gear doesnt do shit but slow you down and the classes alll fucking suck but the spell based classes and knights fuck this game bro im going back to ds1 or fucking elden ring whenever it finally goes on sale
Negative,⚠⚠⚠ WARNING! ⚠⚠⚠⚠⚠⚠ WARNING! ⚠⚠⚠YOU WILL CUSS ALOT⚠⚠⚠ WARNING! ⚠⚠⚠⚠⚠⚠ WARNING! ⚠⚠⚠
Negative,"Seriously needs to be optimized, some parts were a beautiful  30+ fps. Others were a staggering 5-15 fps. Would not recommend unless you have a really up to date set up."
Negative,better than dark souls 1. not as good as dark souls 2.
Negative,"The changes to poise make this unplayable garbage. Shame, since it looks so good and the world is exciting"
Negative,i don t get why people like these games .
Negative,"Has really good moments, but I'm not a fan of having a guide open while I play (and too tedious otherwise).  Like the other souls games there's some shit that shouldn't have passed QA."
Negative,its shit all the controls are wank better on console
Negative,Designed for Console. Stupid way of navigating menu's for the PC.
Negative,How these developers and the series keep getting praise I don't even know. What idiots think it's a good idea to link the engine to framerate like some flash game in the 90s? What idiots can't seem to come up with capable controls/ui function for mouse/keyboard or even gamepad. What idiots can't keep to understand that input delay is bad when it comes to critical things like rolling.
Negative,cant play because it just keeps on crashing. really disappointed.
Negative,"Janky controls, lots of time to waste trying, best advice people give is to not play the game. Would like to see a remake with improvements and quality of life."
Negative,"console game to the core even with the annoying ""go find your crap"" thing when you get killed"
Negative,The camera is just too CRAZY!!!
Negative,"Not recommended as the game does not run in fullscreen on modern monitors in fullscreen (that is, monitor with refresh rates beyond 60 Hz)."
Negative,ez game compared too elden ring
Negative,"one small mistake and your whole journey ahead is screwed up, accidentally killed someone youre not suppose to and say goodbye to them they wouldnt appear anymore, died once all your currency is gone all the grind before that is all into waste, this is why you can see people clocked such high amount of time onto the game they probably keep re-playing to ensure they dont kill people who are not suppose to die, better off if you watch youtube for walkthrough and guide before wasting your money on this"
Negative,"+ I like the idea of a challenging PvE for a change.- But there's a difference between challenging and cheesy. Not the game combat, but the implications of game rules are not clear. When you die, you go back to a checkpoint but you lose the items used. Enemies you killed respawn but some spoils are gone. You lose the right bottom number whatever that means. If you get to the point you died, you can retrieve the soul without an idea of what that does.- The game forces us to use local language.- A gamepad is *required* to play. All instructions are in xbox gamepad buttons even if I disconnect it before starting the game. If only xbox one controller would work on windows 10. (I know, right!?). This is one of the games that doesn't work with the gamepad.- What are those blood puddles on the level? You click, see a ghost and nothing. Also, was it so hard to at least align to the terrain instead of laying it flat floating in the air?- Full screen performance is much worse than the same resolution windowed.These points made me think the game was rushed out of production and I'm reluctant to put more time into it to discover the challenging hype is actually just cheesy stuff instead of a tailored interesting experience."
Negative,"Game was way hyped for the graphics that came with it. It displays controller icons in the tutorial parts instead of keyboard buttons, seeing as I purchased for a PC it would make sense to show both,I can see why the game is hard, because the controls are so slow in response time, the clunkiest game I played in a while, I think ill just stick to Dragon Age. The first hour of this game was not impressive at all....I guess hype truly does drive some franchises. There was an Ice Lizard mini boss in the start, just a weird way to begin immersion...just throwing some random overly difficult enemy in the start.This probably would be ""meh"" with a controller to make it bearable, but im on PC and like my RPG with a keyboard, this game is so clunky it feels like it was designed for a ps2.The game started with the worst introduction, some old lady trying to be overly poetic, basically talking nonsense,not even properly getting you prepared for the lore of the game.No description of the burial gift you pick in the start, ended up using it by mistake and that was the end of that, refunded because id rather play immersive than play a hyped game where the difficulty is basically based on garbage controls.I highly recommend if you enjoy attacking and running away from large enemies constantly, would not recommend for people who enjoy playing on a keyboard, as possible as it may be, its clearly evident this was designed for analog sticks."
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 is by far one of the worst games that gets far to much undeserved praise, for essentially releasing the original Dark Souls. Its so close to first game; gamplay and story wise, and has the same problems.In terms of gameplay it still has many of the problems from the first game. Armor has very little use other than how it looks. It resitrices your stamina recovery speed depending on its weight. The only thing it offers as a positive is poise, which is used to absord a hit and not flinch, however as of writing this review, poise is not working properly and thus makes using high poise armor useless. In terms of weapons using a small weapon is good for the first playthrough. However a large weapon is far superior, and almost necessary for the second and beyond, because you'll need more damage to deal with the higher health and to the extra damage enemies deal to you.The story is almost a carbon copy of the first as a whole. A bell rings, someone says to collect four powerful souls to link the first flame. It also has far to much fanservice moments to count and they seem to serve no purpose other than say, ""Hey remember that one part of the first game, let's do it again and not explain why its here."" Also how it tells it story is still mediocre, it gives very little information on the world and when it does you need to make a theory on it. Because speculation is how to wright very little story and have the player make something up so there is no real world around the game, just fan theories."
Negative,This game is fun and all but %70 percent of the fucking game is actually a fucking chore. I dont want to spend half my fucking time getting invaded because i play with a fucking friend. There are some decent invaders who wait for you to deal with enemies around and if i'm with a friend i always go for 1 vs 1 since these are decent people. But then there are assholes who fucking chases you down in an are where you just entered and you dont even fucking know where you are or they run away while healing and shit. I can understand how hardcore players love it but at least let me fucking turn off some bs so i can have a bit fun. Spending time on learning a bosses patterns and attacks is good and all but ffs let me play the fucking game without watching guides and reading wikis and weapon tier lists.
Negative,"devs abandon multiplayer, don't waste your money."
Negative,"Feels incredibly jerky using both controller and keyboard, almost nauseating.  If I run or strafe in a straight line it's fine so I know it has nothing to do with graphics/rendering.  Go diagonal and free look and it feels like I'm in a paint shaker.  I should have played the earlier titles in the series I already own to see such issues with the engine.  For an A title like this I expect smooth gameplay, this plays like an early access sandbox game (or a bad port, which it may be).  I'm probably the first to request a $15 refund for this game, but I'd honestly rather make two regrettable trips to Taco Bell."
Negative,"We all know this is a very difficult game, and I can see how some may find the challenge of progressing in it to be a personally rewarding experience, but I think I will go start my own business or get a PhD instead. That has to be easier and less frustrating than playing this game.Main complaints:1. If I wanted to play with a controller, I wouldn't own a gaming PC. Interface made only for controllers is a turnoff.2. Not a particularly old game, but the graphics are a let down. 3. For the money, there are much better games out there.4. The experience isn't worth the effort for casual gaming."
Negative,"it's like clunkier DS1which was already clunkyso why fucking botherand when I say like clunkier dark souls 1 I mean it recycle so many things from dark souls 1 and demon souls and it does nothing to improve them (except for the obvious terrible second half of dark souls 1 not being present in this)demon souls and dark souls were just games that happened to be sort of difficultthen they got popular and it's like somebody stepped in and thought it being difficult was the important thingnot that this is significantly more difficult, it's just incredibly punishing (read:tedious) and the load times still aren't greatfor every step forward there's a step backwards it seemsDS1 is probably cheaper so yeahthis negative review is sort of facetious, I still think this is a mostly pretty decent game, but I can't say that enough is different from the first to make this worth any more money (this has fewer framerate issues I guess)also the hitboxes on things are utterly baffling to memaybe that's just a me problem (apparently it's not, altho it seems some people find them incredibly forgiving as opposed to incredibly punishing so who fucking knows at least it aint as bad as DS2)I don't mind a game where you have to learn enemy patterns. but it's so punishing in the most unfun way possible. if you want to learn which moves you can parry and how to parry get ready for 5 minutes of walking and loading screens and 30 seconds of gameplayyou sure kill a lot of kings in this gameit gets kind of dull"
Negative,"I Love Dark Souls 1 and 2. They are the essence of what made me the person I am today.But this one... I just hate it with every fiber of my body. It's absolutely horrendously designed, and has the worst balancing I have ever seen. Enemy designs are bland and boring, and the entire game is grey and uninspired looking, like an action rpg version of Modern Warfare 2. Even the lore is boring, uncreative (practically copy and paste from the first two games) and barely even existing.I'll give you an example:Yhorm. What happened to him? Never explained, but he knows Siegward for some reason.That's it. More is never mentioned or hinted at.Dark Souls 3 Feels like a horrible port of Dark Souls 1 assets to the Bloodbourne engine, and it plays and looks that exact same way. The speed of the Bloodborne gameplay with Dark Souls weapons and armor just don't work together. As a proof of that, they even had to remove poise.Yes, that's right. Dark Souls 3 has no poise. It has the STAT poise, as in, you can get points in poise, but they only affect VERY, VERY CERTAIN BUILDS, and only if you use a weapon that has hyper armor frames in it's attack pattern, extending said frames, and also giving you some kind of roll hyper armor (?) that is almost completely useless, due to rolling giving you invincibility to begin with. But no, poise does NOT affect your poise (Kind of ironic, isn't it?), and it hurts the game very, very badly, making heavy armor completely useless, due to the way this game calculates defense (you get your major amount of defense from simply wearing a piece of armor, not WHICH piece of armor). You'll know what I mean as soon as you try fighting against 5-8 enemies at once (who just so happen to HAVE poise and way too much of it too, a dinky small dagger wielding enemy sometimes has the poise of a Havelmonster back in DS 1 and 2) in this game without a weapon that gives you hyper armor. And this game LOVES to just enemy spam the sh*t out of you to compensate for how easy and boring it is. So yeah, have fun getting stunlocked in Havel armor by dagger wielding little sh*ts, while they barely flinch when you hit them with your Ultra-Greatsword. And even IF you stagger them, most of the time they just continue attacking MID STAGGER ANIMATION. That means they will most of the times completely ignore that they are staggered and cancel out the staggering and keep attacking. Like some chum in a fighting game doing a combo breaker, but these mobs can just spam it, while you don't have such a thing. Great, huh?Let's get to the bosses.Boss fights are the only fun thing in this game, and the Bosses themselves are the only interesting and worthwile about this game.There's only one problem.They are too easy. Compared to the mobs in this game (and the enemy spamming) the bosses are ridiculously easy. Some of them can even be stunlocked with fast weapons, because they have no poise either! This should not be the case. The bosses should be HARDER then fighting the common mobs around the boss area, but they are not. Whether this is a problem with the strength of the mobs or the weakness of the bosses, this should NOT be the case.As far as I can tell, It's like FromSoft tried to make a Bloodbourne 2, screwed it up, and then decided to throw Dark Souls assets into it at the last minute, figuring ""Eh, they'll buy it if it has Dark Souls written on it""Overall, this game does one thing and it does it very well:Remember me of the good old times of Dark Souls 1 and make me play that one again instead."
Negative,"Very buggy Xbox port so far.* Doesn't correctly support Steam Controller (requires disabling devices in Control Panel).* Doesn't correctly support Xbox Controller (requires disabling devices in Control Panel)* Doesn't recognize standard keyboard shortcuts.* Doesn't allow sliders to be clicked to move them -- you have to click the arrows at the edges.  Sometimes auto-repeat is supported, sometimes it is not.[Rewrote Below based on first 2 hour experience]First on the control issues -- unplugging everything USB might help (anything that reports a controller HID, at the least).  Also, disabling all the HID devices in Control Panel may help (leaving only the controller that you want to use enabled).  Microsoft, Unity, Unreal, Cryengine and Source all provide working code to work with USB controllers that handle this correctly.  The Steamworks SDK -- required to support some features on the Steam controller this title supports -- also has it correct in the samples.  And so the developers went out of their way to make the USB controllers have a problem.I really want to like this game -- I really do.I like Demon Souls, Dark Souls, and Dark Souls II.  I like Bloodborne.  I really want to like this game.However, the keybaord and mouse controls were created by someone who has never actually seen a keyboard before -- or someone who merely hates the players.  The keybinder doesn't support all the buttons commonly found on even non-gaming mice these days, such as tilt on the mouse wheel -- let alone a G series, Naga, etc. gaming mouse.Items are shown in the quick slot that have no business being in the quick slot, and generally, I'm fighting the controls more than I'm fighting the hordes -- which makes this feel completely unlike any previous game in the series, or Bloodborne.The graphics quality is generally a lot lower than I'd expect even on PS4 or Xbox One, and is nowhere even remotely close to where it should be on a PC.  The animations don't have enough keyframe, there's linear interpolation between the keys, and then there is random jumps between sequences, versus the smooth animations typical on a PC game.Maybe they're going for the early 90's vibe -- but its not working.Even in combos, often the next swing in the combo doesn't start where the previous one left off, and so there's a disjointed jump in the animations.  If you look at how smooth Assasin's Creed or Arkham is generally, that's what people are typically expecting from the animations -- when you deliver this obvious teleport, it really stands out when you compare it to other modern titles.  And not in a good way.The textures seem like they're much lower resolution than they should be, even after applying NVidia's recommended settings for a 980 TI.  I haven't tested it on the 290, but as I understand it the shader programs have issues on AMD hardware (typical of games NVidia's ""optimization"" team has touched), including crashes at save points.Anyway, I'll do a more thorough review when the controller issues are fixed.  I'm done even trying to play this beast with keyboard and mouse."
Negative,"After playing this game to completion up to and including both the Ringed City DLC and the Painting of Ariandel DLC I have to say this game is not worth the purchase price nor playing even if you get it on discount.This game suffers from one of the most toxic player base i have ever seen which is compounded by the fact that much of the games PvE content is primarily locked behind PvP content with the invasions as well as completely locked behind PvP when it comes to the Spears of the Church 'boss fight' in the Ringed City DLC which all in all encourages griefing to its utmost intolerable levels.In order for you to feasibly make it through the game at a somewhat nice pace, you would need to actually spend many hours out-of-game researching weapons, their 'weapon arts' as well as character builds before you even make a character (and in all faireness before you even purchase the game to begin with to save you time and money) as many of the pro-PvPers in the game have already done so and are waiting to give you hell with those very same builds through invasions.Previous game mechanics are now nothing but random and beyond infuriating, with or without in game mechanics such as miracles that allow your attacks to go through despite getting hit.  Parrying and Backstabs are like playing a slot machine and hoping that it pays off as even if you do what is required to parry or backstab an enemy to the letter, you still run a 1 in 5 chance of the game not registering it which most likely will result in your immediate death.Not only that but the story line is convuluted to all hell as well as having little to no actual in game 'lore' which exists either in previous games, YouTube videos saying as such (but never links their sources) or again the toxic player base that prattle on and on that 'its there, you just have to git gud' before proceeding to try and kill you regardless if they were summoned to help you or not as team killing through misdirection or using knock backs to throw you off ledges is a thing.All in all this game is perfect for only two groups of people: Masochists who get off on being made to suffer and sadists who take pleasure in the misery of others, especially if they are the ones causing it."
Negative,"I'm pretty neutral about the game. I think the problem is that I played Elden Ring first. Had I played DS3 then ER I'd probably like DS3 more. Mostly I hate not having a map. The controls are clunky too, especially having to hit R3 to jump but only while running. Ultimately I chose to refund it 90 minutes in."
Negative,"I bought the game because the game has so many fans and the reviews are all together looking like I want to experience the content of this game. So I was very enthusiatic as I discovered the deluxe version with the season pass in the steam store.But reality catched me back in relatively quickly. First of all. I own an asus 1080oga but I was just not able to get the massive screen tearing under control. Not with the options in game and not with the nvidia tools nor the settings of my monitor.After accepting the eye sore, I just wanted to play the game. However. After a quick cutscene as intro you just get thrown into the game and really only a minute later you´re facing the first enemy that takes you at least 50 tries until you know... this is a never ending story of dodging and emotional endurance. After two corners I got to the second enemy which is just so invincible, that you only want to give up. The heavy punch and shield block are laying on the lower analog shoulder buttons on the controller, so its sheer impossible to just press the button when you think its neccessary - you just need to relearn because now you need to include the delay of the button into your calculation. Together with the very inaccurate hit detection it just becomes a matter of luck. I´m really sure this game has its qualities somewhere and its fans and maybe its just not ""my"" game...  but while I was playing it, I was feeling one of the highest frustration levels that I ever felt in a computer game and since I cannot make it to review it in any neutral way because I just cant play/enjoy the content... I cannot recommend it to people who just want to have fun in their limited free time."
Negative,this game is bad too hard im stuck on the big knight guy >:(
Negative,"Bought the game for multiplayer with friends, password system is useless thusfar and I can't refund6/19/17 update -  Having beat the game, multiplayer is useless.  The game is dead and the netcode is worthless."
Negative,online is dead
Negative,"its a nice game, i\'m almost done with killing the first enemy.More than 4fps would be nice tho."
Negative,"Inconsistency ruins this games feeling of worthiness in accomplishing anything. Everything feels unfair and like bullshit. I honestly hate this game. Gorgeous atmosphere, lore, and level design. Sometimes bad boss design in my opinion, and the rolling system is garbage. Camera and targeting are janky and screws you over more than helping. More rage than ever a feeling of accomplishment. After beating it twice, I'm just unhappy with the overall experience. I want to like this game, but it's core philosophy and mechanics are terrible to me."
Negative,"The game just always assumes that you are using a controller:  Some of the default key/mouse bindings are barely usable.  The camera just moves sometimes, even if all settings which allow automatic camera movement are disabled.  the game only shows the controller bindings, even if only the keyboard/mouse is connected during the tutorial and when interactions are possible.    this is also confusing because for the controller some buttons have multiple meanings which can have different keybindings (the text on the interaction window is also different from the text in the binding-settings). Also when you press the run key you have to wait a 0,5 seconds before you run.I guess this is because there is only one action for run/dodge, but there is no setting to change the delay and 0,5 seconds is too much."
Negative,"The controls for PC are terrible to figure out at the beginning. I think this game would be only truly enjoyable with a steam controller. Until the day that they decide to optimize it for pc gaming, I will probably not play this game much."
Negative,"I got Dark Souls III as part of the Humble Bundle Monthly. In the past, I have played the original Dark Souls and I didn't care for it all that much, one of my biggest complaints about the game was how slippery the controls felt. I never played DSII.Anyways, the controls are much better now, the game looks much better, as far as games go, looking at it, it appears to be a stellar title. For me unfortunately, that isn't the case. While I like the look and general concept of Dark Souls III, the rewards in the game aren't enough to justify playing the game. A good RPG will allow you to play through a game proper, without having to worry too much about back tracking or grinding. Grinding for XP and leveling up should always be an optional task in a role playing game.with Dark Souls, you kind of need to be able to grind in order to improve your stats, or you'll have a super hard time with it. There are areas players refer to as ""tracks"", which is bascially a lap that goes through hoards of monsters and then ends up back at a bondfire so you can continue to grind. Unfortunately, with Dark Souls III, the amount of ""souls"" (the game's currency and exp) given per kill is just terrible. The cost to level up is also large and only continues to grow in size as you play the game. If I spend two hours grinding out souls to level up, I should be able to get more then a handful of levels, but I don't and that's incredibly frustrating.In a game that requires so much time grinding, with so little rewards, and then takes them away if you die, I just can't seem to find any justifiable reason to recommend this game to anyone."
Negative,You have to have a pretty disfunctional life in order to like this game.
Negative,game has horrible enemies and bosses design
Negative,over all the first 2 did it better
Negative,FIX THE BLINKING BLACK SCREEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Negative,I do not recommend this game to PC players! Warning: This game is not meant to be played with a keyboard!
Negative,"Purchased the season pass and Dark Souls 3 pack when it went on sale few months back, downloaded the Ringed City DLC on my incredibly slow internet to find I ""DO NOT OWN LICENSE TO THIS DLC"" and are no longer able to play dark souls 3 casual. Its really hard for people that have limited access to internet to keep downloading a update just to play the game I have paid for."
Negative,Inability to create save points so you have to save using an archaic console style saving mechanism that forces you to constantly repeat sections over and over again. Really do not recommend this title. Tried to get a refund but they wouldn't give it to me. Not impressed.
Negative,"There is inward and outward difficulty. The weakness and inability of the player character, and the difficulty of outside obstacles. Very few games have large amounts of both, and I think for good reason. It's not very fun to be a slow, weak piece of shit going against enemies that one shot you and aren't restricted by the same limitations as you."
Negative,Fuck multiple invaders.It ruins this game when you try to play with friends. Fuck what anyone says thats garbage.
Negative,"Wish I could play it, but I dont have an xbox controller, and the mouse and keybaord controlls are terrible."
Negative,You'd have to be dumber than dog crap to think this game is designed well. Definitively the worst souls game in the series. I held off until it was $15 and I still regret purchasing this fecal matter.
Negative,"C'mon man, all this time and success and you can't do an actual bonafide GD PC release? Second I saw the console controller commands and had to look up the instructions online (they arent in the game), I realized this is a console port, and I applied for a refund. That shit is just lazy, its a AAA title. Ubisoft can manage to do it with their titles for God's sake."
Negative,"Please note this is regarding the co-op aspect of this gameGreat game, but sadly the COOP can be a cancerous experience due to the Invasions especially for those starting off. Be warey of the time it takes to get enough souls to play with a friend, only to have someone with superior items and immense lag come in and shake things up.I'm all for PvP but I would at least like the choice to not have to have some pleb come in and have no way to counter the immense lag fest that follows.I'm not recommending this game for those that are looking to play this together and want an easy ride, when it works it can work great, when it doesn't it will make you question your faith in humanity. As a Solo game or for PvP it can be a great game, but if you are looking for a fun game to COOP with, then save your innocence and play something else. 10/10 get fisted again."
Negative,"Over-hyped for PC.The hotkey icons are xbox pictures and the interface is generally unintuitive. For example, the ""Exit game"" button is in the settings options. And when you're told to roll, you're told to push B. For being such a hyped about game this is a pretty shitty design flaw. (But imagine how confusing it gets when you're trying to roll and then block)I was really looking forward to playing this game and I was let down by it's combat system. Instead of being based on real physics (something like inverse kinematics) it's just a bunch of animation clips which makes the whole thing feel clunky.On top of that killing the enemies is easy when you ""camera lock"" and if you die, you know where they're going to pop up. It's predictable.In general the graphics are awesome but the overall feel is that it's just a shitty game which was never ready for PC."
Negative,This game isn't good and that would be sad if not for elden ring being there to play. Ds1 or bloodborne are better alternatives. This game is linear but empty with the rings being extremely weak in PvE for the sake of multiplayer which isn't good. The navigation is unfun. Rather than a hallway it will put you in an open field that has only one exit. Items are arbitrarily rare leading to the player fearing customization due to lack of resources. I have made multiple files just to try different weapons as a reset is faster than grinding. Terribly disappointed in this game and I'm mad I was tricked into getting this game.
Negative,"This game is quite frankly NOT a sequel to dark souls 1 or 2. Its a sequel to bloodborne.The art style and the combat style resemble bloodborne MUCH more than darksouls.The combat especially is total GARBAGE if you liked the slow, methodical, deliberate and defensive souls combat.This one is ALL about raw speed and reaction times. Gone is the tradtional slow enemies who unleash combos then have a 2-3 second pause allowing for a punish if you dodged the combo. Now the attacks are incredibly fast (some are almost impossible to dodge since they have no wind up or anything) and relentless with pauses of like 1 second max for retaliation. Further the enemies now aggressively chase the player, gone are the menacing but slow monsters that would walk up slowly allowing you do catch your breath or gather your thoughts mid fight. Now they will sprint upto you and never give you a second of respite just unleashing combo after combo. This also makes shields near useless since at anything but ultra late game you wont have the stamina or the shield stability to block these hits, your guard gets broken mid combo and you die.Gone is the ""balanced but fair"" souls combat style too, now monsters are much faster than the player and have limitless stamina allowing for chains of attacks even a max level player could never hope to achieve.Input mapping is also HEAVILY used and some enemies are totally immune to things like leap attacks because they will counter 100% of the time. I have seen enemies leap attack the ground in front of them when i was at right angles on a higher platform because the game read my inputs and knew i would jump down and thus be in the exact spot the leap attack will land by the time its animation is done.Im not saying its a terrible game but it sure as heck isnt dark souls and doesnt deserve to be called that. In the original souls games you felt like swordsman, it was all move and counter move, an elegant dance. Now you will feel like an angry chimp just rushing things and mauling them till they stop moving."
Negative,This game has the worst combat system I ever played.Making a game longer just because you stuck on a place for hours for one little mistake... ehrespect for everyone who has patience to play again and again on the same place just because making a little mistake means you diethis is the first game I wish I would not buy
Negative,"It ran perfectly fine on Win10, i7 5930K, and GTX980ti. The game play was not what I expected.  Built for a controller and with no difficulty setting, the poorly mapped keybord and mouse controls result in constant death at the hands of any creature not killed instantly.  This meant starting over, and over.  Live, Die, Repeat.  Tiresome, and for that I lost interest in trying to improve my experience.Cannot fully rate game on only 60 mins.  But I felt my time lacked any real excitement.The game may be enjoyable for others.  I submitted for a refund.Good luck."
Negative,"Community worse than CS:GO community, don't engage."
Negative,Bad console port with gamebreaking crashes even on recommended hardware. Not worth buying in its current state.
Negative,"call me trash, but its just boring and they put no effort into porting it over to pc. They even show console buttons in tutorial instead of actual keys. Overrated garbage. Not difficult, just shit,"
Negative,"incosistant, shit graphics same game as all the other ones for a quick cash grab zero stars"
Negative,hilarious poise system
Negative,"Games should be difficult because of the level/game design, not because of shit controls."
Negative,No sex firekeeper :(
Negative,"Dark Souls 1 has great level design and a good base of combat and weaponry.Dark Souls 2 has worse level design but better combat and weaponry.Dark Souls 3 has even worse level design and worse combat and weaponry.Quests, NPCs, bosses and ambushes all in the mixed bag, ranging from mediocre to below the abyss.Overall Dark Souls 3 failed on so many levels that you are left with a bitter taste that you have to finish it just because of triology and not out of immersion. Many may say that Dark Souls 2 is worse but for me that game is way ahead then this mess we have here."
Negative,Not to great for my fav seriesdoesn't work with my steam controller or any of my emulators everytime i get past character creation i get forced into the steam game overlay and if that isn't the worst i can't seem to set the resolution at all or(Windowed/Fullscreen)this was my most awaited game since last summer ... so please comment of having same issueor if you know anything that may help
Negative,"Absolutely a joke on PC. First of all how is there not even an option to change the default control icons to keyboard? Makes the tutorial outright confusing. Good luck trying to figure out on your own what the controls are. When you do finally crack the code to some of the controls, you begin to realize the default configuration makes little sense. Space bar to run, space bar to jump. Must be running to jump. Have fun timing that one. To remedy this, you will have to remap all the controls manually. Another nice little chore they give you. If you don't own a controller, don't even bother. This is the first game I've ever refunded on steam. It's just plain not fun."
Negative,Mid souls 3
Negative,"Terrible gameplay, I was expecting a RPG with some depth & field & not having to use an X-Box controller for a PC game.Refund given thanks Steam."
Negative,Clunky Controls make the game unplayable
Negative,"Wasted my money buying the game and controller- - cant say I'll ever buy one of these again, Maybe I'm just bad at it but $100 is a high prioce to pay to find that out."
Negative,"It was a great game for the 3.1 hours that I played it, actually a challenging game, but its really not meant to be played on PC. I think the Witcher spoiled me honestly"
Negative,"While the game itself is good, the port however IS FUCKING TERRIBLE.The controls are extremely clunky, menu controls are horrible, weird button layouts with no option to change them, there are still the green A and red B buttons from Xbox controller, which they didnt even bother to change, and yet they ask for 60 dollars. Big shame to you FromSoftware.  Your loyal fans are almost all PC gamers, and yet they treat you like trash. If they don't care, then why would I care?"
Negative,This is a console port and as such only gives command prompts as if you are using a gamepad (i.e. press button A to do a certain action). Also it does not tell you how to cycle back in menu's after you have selected something when you are using the  keyboard.
Negative,"The game is sold as a PC game, but they didn't bother to display PC commands; instead, it displays XBOX controller commands. If I wanted XBOX commands, I would have purchased the XBOX version. If I'm spending money on PC version, please bother to display Keyboard commands. This is ridiculous. Makes it very annoying to learn a new game this way. Sure, there aren't too many commands, and eventually I'd learn, but that's not the point. If you are charging money for a PC version, bother to support it correctly."
Negative,If you're a hipster then this game is great. You can parade it around as being difficult when it's really just a bunch of bugs and garbage mechanics that - were they in any other game - would be considered bad game design. People even consider the bugs part of the difficulty. I'll never understand.
Negative,"Great game but needs Steam Cloud saving as the devs thought it was ok to block you from restoring your backed up save. Retarded, so now I have to start all over which is 100% bullshit so on PC i can not recommend this game."
Negative,Pretty mid game tbh
Negative,I hate souls games.
Negative,Invading hacker with 3/4 attempts
Negative,checkpoints are too rare
Negative,missed the part where a controller is required
Negative,"What a bullshit game,deleted it after 5 minutesno chance to play straight, want my money back"
Negative,Dark Souls 3? More like Mid Souls 3! HA!
Negative,"A quarter of the people who get this game just have a black startup screen amazingly. Unless someone can tell me how to fix this, I do not recommend this game."
Negative,"First time complaint on a Steam game and I am not new to gaming (80's).  Frustrating game play! Think NES Strider if anyone has played. After a mouse double click you do 2 swings the same direction whilst being attacked from the ai (does have enthralling graphics). The direction of Toon changes in battle and sometimes spins uncontrollably with no ability to aim a swing. Settings - controls seem to do nothing. Auto target/ mouse sensitivity, keyboard layout...  All the commands were mads for a console. I tried 2 classes, the choose your own with club and shield that sucks and a warrior that still sucks but at least has a working shield. All tutorials are for console and this is a high end game on Steam - just to take away a few more points in my book. It is possible Dark Souls III gets better (I will never know) but for a game that is set at $60 & $15 sale I expected a game that works on a PC. Take it off Steam or fix it or make it free to play if you don't mind a console game made to play your phone quality.Thanks for reading"
Negative,Not really a fan.  The thrill after beating a boss is not worth the annoyance of the rest of the game.  Sekiro was definitely better.
Negative,I would love to give this game a fair reviewSadly the game crashes constantly This NO is for the horrible port Not for the amazing game.
Negative,"I thought, so many people rave about this game, there simply must be something I'm missing as a gamer.  I had tried one years ago, maybe the first one, I honestly do not know.  I do know, that it was certainly not my cup of tea and promptly returned it after hardly any time in it at all.  I couldn't see what I was getting out of it.  A mini game of stamina management....satisfaction of...dying?  Long and short of it, the challenge is one thing of it.  I don't need a god damn cerebral experience on a monsters attack pattern or my stamina management.  I have a real life for that, you know, leveling up in life.  I found this game to be different in the beginning, watched a LOT of videos for beginners.  I just didn't enjoy it, the game does a fairly shit job at explaining how to equip/use items (Oh cool, another firebomb I have no clue what to do with x50).  I would rather participate in the pain olympics, rather than sit through a playing of this game.  This game confirms to me, that Japanese culture is fairly odd as compared to other locales.  Game looks pretty good, just feel like it lacks something.  Maybe it's the larger than life monsters that show their ugly heads from time to time, taking up x amount of the screen, that just seemingly move about leaving you to roll aimlessly....to watch them???  Peruse their sordidly flurry of attacks to determine just when the best opportunity is to attack....nah, I'll stick to something less rage inducing and more satisfying as a whole."
Negative,poor game experience on pc end. Why not ask pc player buy a controller and play just like console gamers?
Negative,"stages and enemies aren't that fun, just annoying."
Negative,"Dark Souls, the very definition of two steps forward, one step back.Pros- Bosses and enemies are well designed, the boss battles in particular have some very stunning moments.- The game looks very pretty.- The controls are tight and responsive.Cons- Build variety is severely lacking, with a very poor meta. Many sets of unobtainable armour and lots of weapons are simply bad with only a few viable picks in each weapon type and even then only a few weapon types are actually viable.- PVP is somehow even worse and invasions are a nightmare with the invaders at the mercy of a seemingly infinite pool of summons and extra heals of the host.- Poor optimisation.- Areas seem to be rehashed for fan service purposes.- The story is just as bad as previous entries. The story telling devices (dialogue and item descriptions) are good at telling snippets of stories and giving the player some interesting lore, but that's all it's good for. It's just shallow and convoluted, which the community analyses to death.- Magic is dreadful, pure magic builds will get screwed over by the estus system because they will have less heals and still be squishy anyway.- The community has gone kaput, venture in at your own risk.Overall 6/10 the game has many strengths and deserves to be commended for them but it does so much wrong and does away with a lot of what made the previous two entries good/great. If you're new to the series play Dark Souls 1 (9/10)."
Negative,fuck this game and fuck whole japan
Negative,Doesn't save your data online so if you format or exchange PC it's all gone.So no thx unless hardcore AF player
Negative,"I am giving this game a negative review on the account that the Fromsoftware's programmers are below average people with good social skills evident by the fact that they were able to land this job.""Oh, this has nothing to do with the game. Make it a fair review, idiot!"" I hear you say to me.Alright, the game itself is below average, and anyone who buys Elden Ring while possessing the information on how the developers couldn't, cannot or won't fix the Dark souls 3 servers is a codependent male/female who lacks sufficient amount of courage. Happy now? I think this is a fairly decent and a fair review. What do you think? Please let me know in the comments below.The game still sucks dick and so do the servers and so does Bandai Namco and so does Fromshitware and so do everyone who plays this fucking abomination. You cannot even alt+tab in peace! F*** this game! Someone needs to teach these developers what the word ""any"" meansPress ANY key/button means that I can press any key/button on this ******* keyboard and the menu will load. ANY DOESN'T MEAN ""PRESS SPECIFIC KEY""!  How do you guys still have your jobs, I swear the world is full on injustice and you are at the top. Of my ****There’s only one question left to ask: Who won?and what was the fucking game anyway?To win,..first, you have to know whose side you’re on.In Dark Souls, that’s right up there with black holes or “To be or not to be”.You fight the good fight, then one day, you wake up and you realize that all you were was Patches’ little bitch.Ironic. The company will tell them there will be no more DLCs. But you and I, we both know that’s not true. The Gaming Industry is run on DLCs. Whoever has more DLC has power. And without it you’re just another fucking indie. So what have I learned after all this time? After all those boss rushes, lying to my fellow ashes, spouses, myself. Playing this crooked game in this crooked universe filled with Thralls and Mimics. I’ll tell you what I’ve learned. One thing and one thing only.P.S. This game is the easiest game I have ever played. In fact  anyone who used more than 1 limb to finish this game shouldn't be respected."
Negative,Best Game ever....especially the camera :P
Negative,"I didn't really play any of it because i had problems with creating a character, it had xbox controls and i didn't know how to fix that, i used youtube and google, but yeah i'll probably edit this review later :D"
Negative,probably the hardest game in history. I could probably find and ride a dragon mixed with a squirrel before I ever finish this game. Help me.
Negative,"Worth buying only if on a 75% off sale, otherwise, skip it. Old game (2015) and it shows."
Negative,"Rushed, truncated, and just so much emptier than its predecessors."
Negative,Game's alright till you get the kid that hasn't taken a shower in a year coming after you with his modded character.Game turns into trash afterwards. 1/10 would not play again.
Negative,"The worst in the Dark Souls trilogy. Would have been a blast had it been my first rodeo, but I've played this game before and for too long for this to feel fresh or interesting."
Negative,"Horrible PC game, it still thinks it is on xbox. I was really excited about playijng this game but it is unplayable with KBM because all prompts and instruction are for an Xbox controller. Remove this version from the steam store adn replace it with an actual PC port"
Negative,"First off, had to make a negative review due to it being a personal issue and it would stand out for anyone else in my situation.-- DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE A DUAL CORE APU --It won't work and there's no fix.However, most of my mates play it, they love it and it looks fun as farg."
Negative,"A very personal reviewSoundtracks are amazing. I really like soundtrack of Abyss watchers, and main menu theme.I like the dark atmosphere.I like the controls and responsiveness of my character using a controller.The interaction is good.The enemy variety is great.The physics are okay. The game works nicely on my system.That is it.Now the major reason for not recommending this game.I just cannot get into it. And one of the major reason is that I cannot switch between NG+ modes (which means it just gets harder and harder and harder upto NG+7 where even your characters high stats kind of do not matter). Why can't I go from NG+4 (which is of course harder than normal mode) to normal NG mode to have fun with my overpowered weapons,gear etc. I can understand the difficulty but I do not understand why developers did not think about letting the players change modes from new game plus to normal mode.This just breaks the game for me because it feels like I did not progress at all, I died from 2 or 3 hits in NG mode and I still die from 2 or 3 hits in NG+4.I kind of want my character to physically become powerful so that he/she can take a lot more hits from normal bosses. Of course I could have stayed in NG mode after killing all the bosses but after killing the bosses and getting to a high level actually slowed my character growth because where would you get a lot of souls after killing all the bosses and No I do not enjoy a lot of grinding. I had to go to NG+ for better souls and gear. And well meh....So you should only buy this game if you enjoy frustration and failure and that is it. Oh and I feel a little satisfaction after defeating a boss for 10 or 20 seconds then the satisfaction disappears after realizing that its just a game boss and it did not give me the item to become invincible or strong enough to destroy something in my way. So yeah I do not feel ""extreme satisfaction"" at all.  I am a result driven guy folks,if I defeat a giant creature after dying 10 or 20 times and do not get ingame physical rewards that are great or overpowered then it feels like I wasted my time."
Negative,This game is an absolute nightmare to play in cooperative.
Negative,Such graphics.  Much hard.  Very crash.  Such bluescreen.  Wow.
Negative,essa galera ta usando droga se acha que esse jogo está valendo o preço cobrado atualmente
Negative,"this is like, the boring one, like its not bad, it has very iconic moments that are great to experience, but this is the white bread of the souls"
Negative,it's been years since the game was released and it still plays like an alpha.
Negative,"Camera is bad. Controls are bad (especially on PC along with bugged UI that shows controls for controller). A game for people that are already in love with previous versions of the franchise, otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it."
Negative,Wanna play solo? Get invaded Wanna co-op? Get invadedAnything you fucking do will get your ass invaded by random motherfuckers wanting to waste there life just to set you back a few hours.3/10 Blonde Fire Keep Momma is the only reason to play
Negative,"Thought I'd Give this title a try as it was on offer.Control system is Game pad focused, all hints and tips info etc display game pad controls, well everything does. For me its unplayable, camera movement some target lock nonsense, movement.. character spinning 180, weapon selection is just super frustrating.  I spent most of my time trying to get a working layout, I got stuck in the settings menu for like 20 mins before i found I needed to ""Right Click"" on the setting cog for a drop down menu, duh... My personal opinion is, game pads are for consoles, that's where this garbage UI belongs and works. Steam wont refund  as I had played 3 hrs which is rather laughable and disappointing, more like 3 hours of frustration and menu lock.If you have a game pad I'm sure its fine."
Negative,"For me, dark souls has been one of the greatest games in my recent memory and I have finished the games of the saga on several systems... I have played and Demon Souls, Dark Souls 1, 2 and 3 and Bloodborne.With time, I think that From Software has gotten a bit repetitive, but their games are beautiful in their wicked way. So, to sum up, if you haven't played one of these games, you don't know what you are missing. I guess is like whenever there's a movie, book or piece of art that is too important to ignore it and for some reason you don't know anything about it, you are fine without knowing about it, but once your learn about it, there's no going back. Or better said, there's a before and an after Dark Souls and you will never want to go back.On a side note, I have a widescreen monitor and this game has no support to anything other than 16:9, so I'm just leaving a bad review because of that. Having spent several hundred hours and dollars on this franchise I feel is a lack of support and care for people than play on PCs. If FS does not want to add support for wider resolutions, I recommend to just go away from PC and stick to consoles."
Negative,"Would be good if it was genuinely challenging but the core gameplay is basically to just cuck yourself. The game is 90% cheap, all high level strats involve cheese and exploits, its unfair all the way through except on a handful of bosses. Roaming areas is good, I like exploring, finding new things, the good graphics, but at it's core, Dark Souls is just designed like utter trash. The only reason it is popular is because of streamers. It is not a test of skill it is a test of endurance. Anyone can complete it just by dying enough times. And that is all this game is really, dying, memorising things, dying, memorising things, but you don't have much of a chance ever first time on anything in this game. It is designed to be cheap, frustrating, and idiotic, in good faith that cuckolds will always play it because it's trendy right now and a funny meme.Completed the game multiple times, did I enjoy it overall? No. I didn't enjoy it. I don't get any enjoyment spending 3 hours on one cheesy boss that is unfair in the first place just for a feeling of ""I did it"". Plenty other things to spend my time on which is meaningful and worthwhile even if it is other video games or art which isn't basically like self-harm. I'd rather spend my time gitting gud at life than being proud of wasting my life on something that with enough effort even a monkey could do. Lots of things in life to do and enjoy so why would I want to cuckold myself for hours on end for one tiny bit of enjoyment just from saying ""I win""? It's sad af"
Negative,"too hard, no check point. stupid moving"
Negative,this game was meant for console and the controls were transferred to pc badly. i suggest you do not buy it if you only have keyboard
Negative,"A really sad review from a huge Dark Souls fan. I will be talking about the general feel of the game, gameplay, bosses, pvp and some stuff the game dies right. I refrence the other Souls games and Bloodborn a lot due to just how damn similar they try to be and the fact fact this is supposed to be the third installment in the Dark Souls series. Anyways, let's begin. (TLDR at bottom)This game is easily the worst of the 3 in the souls series.It just oozes unoriginality in its visual and enemy design as well as its attempts of ""throwbacks"" so to speak. ""Hey guys, you remember Bloodborn? Then head to the undead settlement where the enemies are carbon copies of enemies from Bloodborn."" ""Hey guys, you remeber Dark Souls? Well, we literally ripped an entire area from that so we didn't have to do it ourselves."" Also curiosly no ""throw backs"" to DS2 execpt a red invader, a slight easter egg of a dead npc and a horrible pvp clusterfck area no one asked for. Hmm i wonder if they are trying to say something.In terms of gameplay, I feel it really falls apart in this aspect. It feels like its trying to be Bloodborn, but it has the Dark Souls name so it has to be a little bit of that so it just ends up feeling like Bloodborn 1.5 instead of another Dark Souls game. A lot of the weapons in are next to useless due to unbalanced stats, so the acual selection of viable weapons feels very small. This is compounded by the fact that they decided to take out powerstancing for whatever reason, limiting player choice even more. The armour in this game are Bloodborn levels of worthless as well, with the ring of steel protection giving you more defence than most full armour sets. Also, the addition of the magic bar feels like a totally unnecessary mechinic to add. Sword arts for most weapons don't cost much mana so all it really does is hinder mage builds because suprise, suprise, they nuked any source of magical damage (sorcery, faith etc.) into the center of the earth in terms of damage, causing me to only use chaos fireball the entire game when I made a mage due to everything else not being worth the mana. Coming from the feeling of the game trying to be Bloodborn, some of the bosses come across as fairly unfair since they attack so damn fast. If this was Bloodborn this would be fine, since it has a mechanic in game that lets you recover hp from recent hits if you go on the offensive. In this game, they decided to just make estus take almost no time at all as well as make rolling cost next to no stamina, instead of making well designed bosses (with a few exceptions of course). What makes it worse is that the games poise stat is literally useless (intentionally so, as found out by some data miners), so every boss can stunlock, no matter what armour you wear.And now for the pvp. Oh boy. Let me preface this by saying I generally dislike pvp as a whole, especially DS pvp where an invaders sole purpose is to ruin your time. This game dials that annoyance factor up to 11. Hated when invaders healed in DS1 with humanity? Well invaders get estus now, because FromSoft hates you thats why. I see various posts on the community hub and such saying stuff along the lines of ""DS3 pvp is the most heavily favoured for the host in the series."" What an absolute load of crap. With the addition of invader estus, fights can absolutly drag on sometimes allowing for an invader to do some damage then roll infinitly untill they get behind some enemies and heal, rinse and repeat. Further, with the exclusion of poise as mentioned above, every single weapon is a stunlock tool, granting two free hits any time a weapon connects. Fun times!Granted, there are some good things the games does. They took out the awful soul memory mechanic from DS2 and reintroduced the level based summoning from DS1. On top of that, they also took out the need for the name ingraved ring instead just adding a password allowing you to summon friends of any level to you world, albeit with fairly extreme down scaling for higher level summons. The majority of armour sets in game look outstanting, with mixing and matching fairly easy and fun (since they are worthless anyway this can be done without worry).If you wanted an acual Dark Souls game, stick with the first two. If you wanted a really fast pace souls-like with an emphasis on offensive gameplay, just play Bloodborn (if you have a PS4). This game will satisfy neither itch and will leave you with a feeling that something is missing after playing it. Would I have liked it if it wasn't titled ""Dark Souls""? Eh, maybe but thats not the point here. It fails at being either game and comes out as a mess.TLDR: Dark Souls 3 tries to be something its not and suffers heavily. New additions and exclustions are an active detriment to the game.Get it on sale if you absolutely must have it. Not worth full price."
Negative,"Invasions happen too often, its not fun."
Negative,Nerfed everything but left in the spam tactics of Estoc. Terrible management on the devs part.
Negative,Can't beat first boss....
Negative,; _ ;
Negative,"By far, the worst in the series.I played the first and the second one with having trouble with two or three bosses. The third one makes every boss a chore. This is not enjoyable, it's just infuriating. Meh!If you are looking for a true Dark Souls experience grab Prepare to Die and Scholar of the First Sin.This one?Well...Grab in a sale or something."
Negative,"The price is insanely high even on sale. I just can't justify it for anyone. If you don't have friends, forget about playing online. Its either dead or plagued with cheaters. Ashes of Ariandel DLC is almost unjustified since it has very poor online activity and I believe everything you get in that DLC can just be passed on to you by a friend except for a single spell. Just watch a vid on youtube instead lol, It has a grand total of 2 bossfights.Ringed City is a different story though, if you are buying the game anyway then get that DLC since it has some very decent online activity, spells and a good handful of bosses."
Negative,My controller doesn't work on it for some reason and all the tutorial promps are for one. It took me longer to get through the menus than it did the first boss.
Negative,devs do a great job at making enemies that are not to fight! camera angles are also shit
Negative,"stupid hard, played like ten minutes , soooooo hard forget dumb game"
Negative,"piece of filthUPD: yeah, piece of filth"
Negative,Orma was right
Negative,"The controls are total trash - can't jump no matter what key I bind it to. This game is made for consoles, not PC. Extremely lazy port to PC. Don't support it."
Negative,Forces you to use inferior input - controller. This shouldnt even be sold as pc game
Negative,This game is kiddy trash.Play club penguin if you want to git gud.
Negative,"Perhaps the most overrated RPG I've ever played. Graphics and character customization that are horrendously ugly, an archaic checkpoint system that is more of a nuisance, and the worst and most unintuitive ""coop"" experience I've ever experienced are just the flaws I was able to discover in the first hour. Don't buy this junk!"
Negative,"Awful controls, feels like a ps2 game with shinier graphics"
Negative,Only bought this to fund the new Armored Core.
Negative,"0/10 horrible hit detection, every enemy in the game spams, repetitive gameplay, 60 fps cap, the ultimate game for those who have nothing in their lives!"
Negative,it's not fun
Negative,"Last boss was beaten by fists like a little bitch, very anti-climatic."
Negative,"2018 no fucking cloud save , go fuck yourselves From`s"
Negative,I have spoken.
Negative,"This game is unfortunally unplayable. After 3 min the game crashes, at the first bonfire or anywhere else, my connection to the monitor is lost and I have to restart the computer. Next time I start the game Ill get an irritating message that I didnt quit the game properly rather than the developers fix this game. Now, Ill try to get a refund from Steam."
Negative,"If you are a proud PC master race member, read this review. Despite how well rated the game is, despite how nice it looks, despite how challenging (in a good way) it can be... This is by far, and I mean FAR, one of the absolute WORST ports from a console to PC in recent years. The controls are absolutely horrible. So much so that I can't even ESC out of the main menu after changing basic settings. That being said, I couldn't even find basic graphical settings to change, which shows just how much of a terrible port this is. All of the button queues are shown wheter or not you have an Xbox controller plugged in (as in Y, B, X, A etc) and even if you have keyboard and mouse set as the main input, there is NO way to change this, so you have to go into keybiinds to learn what everything does. On top of that the camera and character movement is floaty and has absolutely NO weight to it. It is clear there was nearly no work put into making this a good PC experience, and for people who don't have a ctontroller, it is going to ruin the experience for them. If you LOVE these games, get a controller. Otherwise ,there is no way I can actually recommend this game to any self respecting PC player."
Negative,Cannot even get past the first boss in hours. No fun.
Negative,"half way through the boss... CONNECTION LOST... Well, screw you."
Negative,"A rushed mess full of recycled content, broken gameplay, and useless mechanics. RIP poise 4/10"
Negative,bad devs and wrongful punishments and poor invade system
Negative,"Got softbanned for no reason, deleted all my characters, messaged support. ""You will not play online on this account again""."
Negative,"Do not call this game ""Dark Souls"". It's a mistake which can lead potential gamer to a misunderstanding. Call it ""Butyrate-high disabled simulator"" - much better and much closer to reality. Yes, I'm not a good gamepad user but I've played Bayonetta, Witcher 3, Rampage Knights, Hollow Knight and many more gamepad-oriented games. This one is not hard, I dunno who call it so. This game is just not playable, that's is."
Negative,"You ever play a bad racing game? One where the ai cars aren't bound to the same laws of physics as you are and can fly around corners with nary a worry? Think that but in a 3rd person video game. Make the enemies difficult, sure. Make them smart, make them quick and all that...but don't make them cheap. Don't saddle me with weighty animation and stamina bars and not do the same to the enemy npc's. I understand that a claymore or a (insert other surfboard sized sword) is heavy but apparently someone forgot to tell some of the enemies because they're brandishing them like the Star Wars kid without pause. Even a katana takes my character forever to swing while everyone else was apparaently trained by Yoda.And before you ask, yes I did just rage quit. Sue me.And Serpent-men can kiss the fattest part of my @$$!"
Negative,"I tryed really hard to give this game a shot. This a bad port or just base bad desgin. I can see where all the good reveiws come from. At its core it has the components for a VERY good game. And i actually love the asthetic. there are a few very big BUTS tho.  Glitchy or on purpose input lag, Horrible physics(enimes can stab you through walls.)  and the camera controlls themselves  seem to work in concert with the AI to kill you. Right now i feel as if i should crack the game to have any real fun with it. I cant progress anywhere because this shit is broken for me and im past the 2 hour playtime for returns. PC buyer beware. Its not guarnteed to work correctly for you."
Negative,How on earth is this game successful? The combat is janky as hell and they throw in an incredibly difficult first boss in the first 5 minutes of the game - before you have time to get used to the controls. I feel ripped off even though I got this in the humble bundle for less than £8!
Negative,Game only shows XBOX keybinds during gameplay despite having no controller connected and having rebound the keys to Keyboard+Mouse setup.Extremely lazy by developer to not simply have the correct PC keybinds display properly instead of controller buttons when no controller is even plugged in.0/10 and refunded.
Negative,"Started it up seemed like it could be one of the best in the series, too bad i cant find out because its unplayable due to crashes."
Negative,"I've heard that it didn't matter which part of Dark Souls we play, since the story didn't really matter in this series anyway. This was a warning which I should have taken into account. I also watched 'let's play' videos (something I always do before acquiring a game) and those weren't too promising either. On the other hand - which was contradictory to what I've heard - I was told that the game contained much 'lore'. Totally confused and not knowing what to expect I started playing. Soon after, I realized this game wasn't what I had expected: it lacks plot, can hardly (or not) be called an RPG and definitely failed to convince me to try the other parts of the series.So what is Dark Souls 3 then? It's a third-person action game, focused on melee combat. It's not hack and slash, there are many forms to do combat, even though there are only 2 standard attack modes (light and charged/heavy). Although we can use a variety of ranged weapons and spells, the game pretty much punishes us for doing so as both the damage and the opportunities are meager when compared to melee, preferrably two-handed weapons.Our primary form of defending ourselves from enemy attacks is the rolling. While it looks comical - watching a knight in full plate armor rolling on the ground - it basically makes us invulnerable, as long as the rolling animation itself lasts. Yes, it is efficient even against area affecting damage and spells. We can (and we must - at least against boss enemies) also use shields to block their faster attacks. With basic shields we can perform a swiping blow (the game calls it parry) that leaves our enemy staggered and allows us to execute a coup de grace (critical hit as called here). For this we have to hit the enemy with our shield at the exact same moment as they begin to swing their weapon. Item descriptions can be particularly useful as they can share knowledge of effects and bonuses we wouldn't notice otherwise.In order to carry all these actions out, we need stamina - something just as important as our health bar - so having it maximized and properly managed (it regenerates quite fast as long as we don't attack, block or roll) in combat is our main priority to succeed.Our health is restored through magic potions which refill randomly after killing a powerful foe or by resting at a bonfire. These bonfires play a very important role in Dark Souls: we can use them to save our progress or as portals between different locations, after activating one. Whenever we rest by these bonfires, the enemies will respawn (except for bosses and unique enemies) and we are going to have to fight through them again. When we die, we are also teleported back to the last one we rested at. The hardness of Dark Souls lies in a simple fact: whenever we die, we lose all our experience points (souls) we haven't used (there's 1 opportunity to pick it up) to increase our level.There's also a hub called Firelink Shrine, where we can meet all the important characters who we befriended and purchase supplies.The story is a big pile of steamy nonsense (and sadly it apparently applies to the other parts as well): in an undead populated world everyone who isn't insane yet tries to kill the Lords of Cinder, powerful rulers and demigods (who are also undead for a change) who should save this strange world from collapse (which appears to have happened already, but nvm). The ones who can still speak and think, seem to be obsessed with fire and becoming kindled (thus become more powerful). As one of these undead, we have to kill the lords, place their heads on their thrones and link the First Flame.I did not use the spoiler tag on purpose, because I don't think that anyone would get mad at me for revealing such ""vital"" informations about the story of the game. In fact, if anyone has a more cohesive explanation of what the hell is going on in Dark Souls, feel free to tell me.About the mentioned lore, we can indeed find brief information regarding the characters and the previous parts. Worry not however, these snippets will not shed light on the main story itself or clarify the general obscurity. The scarce RPG elements the game offers come through these characters: there are some choices in the game which may effect the outcome and the reactions of a certain person towards us. They work very strangely though: I was pretty sure I managed to save a thief, who sells stuff for a reasonable price, but somehow he still got killed. On another occasion I was informed that someone's going to marry me (!), but in the end it turned out be a rather scary (I don't want to use improper language) ritual...None of the mentioned characters are memorable (with the exception of one in particular, who wears a ridiculous looking armor and is the only one in the game who doesn't talk mumbo-jumbo but provides useful information).The graphics are amazing: the environments look spectacular and the areas are huge. I found myself looking down into the abyss from the walls of a beautiful medieval looking castle or staring at the vast forest beneath me. Although mostly linear, the level design is great. I felt a certain amount of grief, as all this could have been used for a great RPG, for a game with true content, something this game lacks.The looks of the characters is another story: technically they look like as if they stepped out of a game from the '90s. They are very plain looking and devoid of any facial expressions. It was very surprising since some of the bosses look really detailed (and hideous as well, just like all the enemies) and are fun to do combat with. This is Dark Soul's another strength: the bossfights and discovering their weaknesses. The creators however sometimes overstepped the mark, not in difficulty, but in providing no clues. For example the character I mentioned died because of this: I had no idea how to use a sword's special power that was basically the only way of getting rid of a giant enemy (CTRL+SHIFT to charge it up). This guy would have died anyway (as most characters will do because of reasons unknown towards the end of the game), but I still felt irritated for failing that wasn't my fault.Many people mentioned the inept camera movement, I myself had no particular problems with it, but the constant locking onto targets was getting on my nerves. The game is easier to be played with a controller by the way. However if we play with mouse and keyboard the game will still mention the controller buttons (like 'press A')...The instrumental soundtrack of Dark Souls 3 is great as well, just like the perfect environmental sound effects. Unfortunately the music can get way too loud during boss fights where it is vital to hear certain sounds in order to avoid a particular(ly nasty) attack.The game can be played in co-op and there is PVP (player versus player) mode. In fact we can be 'invaded' by other players, which means others can attack us while we are fighting monsters. It can be particularly bad sometimes, so going offline at tough parts is advisable. There are also various covenants we can join (some are opposed to each other, but we can pretty much join all of them), for which we can acquire valuable rewards.Unfortunately very strange lags plague multiplayer gameplay, so be careful and keep calm.To cut it short, I do not recommend Dark Souls 3. The main reason is because it's too slow-paced for an action game, it's not an RPG and has basically no plot whatsoever. If you are looking for these values, avoid this game, just like I should have. If you like Japanese games that are focusing more on tone than on exposition then give it a try.PROS+ fantastic environment+ great, hectic bossfights+ plenty of equipments to choose from+ interesting multiplayer modesCONS- non-existent plot- not an RPG, only a handful of choices- not ideal controls, bad lock-on system- strange lags in pvpRATING5/10"
Negative,Drivers Glitched for me :(
Negative,"First, I played Demon's Souls, then Elden Ring, Bloodborne, DS1, and finally DS3. I enjoyed Demon's Souls, minus the less than stellar way you have to get the trophies. Elden Ring is a masterpiece. DS1 had a variety of QoL issues. DS3, though... it's worse than DS1. I actually got at least a ways into DS1. DS3 has lost me at the first area after Firelink. The lack of ability to increase the weapon strength, the fact that it's so linear... I just don't want to keep playing. I'll play Demon's Souls again at some point, but I'm not interested in completing the Dark Souls trilogy."
Negative,"One of the absolute worst control systems I've ever had to endure and I've played games both with and without a controller on PC.Every single attack has a specific sequence to work. I have never had a game where, on the controller, you're forced to go ""Right trigger = heavy attack"" or shift + right click is heavy attack. It's ALWAYS been 'hold down this button for a heavy attack and click for a light one'.In order to 'kick' you have to basically use two buttons at once, and you have to hit them at the -exact- same time or the game defaults to you dodging forwards. And trust me, 90% of the time you're going to 'dodge forwards' rather than kick because the game's systems do not understand how it works.The enemies will, periodically, completely ignore your dodges, parries and blocks as they 'phase through' the hitbox of the item you're attempting to use parries and blocks with.The customization options of this game are f***ing abysmal and if you zoom in on the eyes you can tell the developers honestly were completely inept and incompetent at designing anything outside of their monsters, as the pupils in the eyes are literally -stretched- up into the head which makes you look like you have frog or goat pupils rather than human ones. Holy jesus christ, I think even Mass Effect: Andromeda models have better crafted eyeballs.PC PORT COMPLAINT TIME!THE PC PORT, EVEN WITH FULL KEYBOARD AND MOUSE INPUTS THAT FEEL FLUID AND PROPER, LACKS ANY KIND OF TOOLTIPS FOR KEYBOARD INPUTS AT ALL. The developers were LAZY and did NOT bother to include tooltips whatsoever to tell you what the keyboard mouse and keyboard input keybinds are. You have to either spam the buttons to find the right combination, OR you have to look it up on google.This game gets a flat ""No"" from me on the controls alone.This game is, honestly, getting removed from my library because I simply do not want something with this bad of a control system on my computer. What an egregious waste of my money and time."
Negative,"I could come close to beating the first boss, i like games that make me fell rewarded for playing not games where u get hit 3 times and your dead. I wished liked this game, before I couldn't think of a game I bought and didn't like but thats how I forever remember dark souls a game to un-balanced to forget. thanks for the bad memory"
Negative,"I would never have bought this game without online multiplayer. The servers have been down for months. I will never buy from the these developers again, and neither should you. They sell you a game and then take away the best part of the game after they get your money. Disgusting!"
Negative,"I waited a while to buy this game, and what a mistake that was. At this point DS3 is a mess of overly twinked up PVP characters invading your game. If you like to play single player then it's fine, but if you enjoy co-op play then you'll find that there are hundreds of losers with endgame gear preying on your defenseless character. Play offline & alone, or get invaded every few minutes.It's an otherwise great game."
Negative,Which skill do you need to level up to be able to launch the game without it crashing?
Negative,too easyDS2 still the best game
Negative,"From Software is try harding now with their newly found cash stack,bring back: YOU DEFEATED"
Negative,dlc not on sale? reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Negative,"Not that bad as the DS2(the worst game ever), but bad"
Negative,"Cannot recommend due to M/KB menu navigation. Once you get the settings down, the game runs great.Combat feels good with with M/KB.However, since good part of the menu navigation does not work without controller makes the game just feel like a lazy port.However, it is a Dark Souls game, so people with give it a pass for no reason, demand you use a controller for no reason, and give this game a 10/10. Hoping that a small patch with fix this, because I was enjoying the game."
Negative,Requested a refund when I discovered this was a lazy PC ported game. They didn't even bother to convert the controller prompts from Xbox controller controls to Keyboard + Mouse controls. It's a PC GAME. This was unforgivable.
Negative,"By far the worst of the Dark Souls games. Most of what is good about it is just directly copied from Dark Souls 1, trading on nostalgia rather than offering anything new. What is new is a much more buggy game with a horrible interface. The camera does not let you redirect it reliably. Lock on randomly fails, leaving you rolling in the wrong direction. Enemies regularly kill you by just thrusting their weapon directly through a wall/floor/ceiling. Hit boxes are unreliable - sometimes arrows end up hitting and getting stuck floating in mid-air, other times they fly right through stone to hit you when you thought you were hiding behind something. Similar problems with other attacks that miss despite clearly intersecting the enemy, or attacks that count as hits despite not coming close.Result is a game decided as much by random error as by skill. It's not that this Dark Souls is harder than the others, it's just much more frustrating because when you die, it's much more often to be because of some glitch rather than something you did wrong. The sense of ""I could have killed him if I just did X instead of Y"" is gone; instead it's ""I could have killed him if random glitch Z hadn't happened, guess I'll try again and hope it doesn't happen this time""."
Negative,"Hi guys, just wanted to give this game a fair go. However, I was midway through the campaign Chapter 6: ""Going Deep"" when a feeling of immense dread washed over me. My vision grew blurry and my muscles became stiff with anger. This mission that I was playing was a 1:1 mirror image of Bohemia Interactives Best-Seller winner of PAX East 2013 BEST-HYBRID-MMO award the most gritty, authentic multiplayer sandbox zombie survival HIT CLASSIC OF THE AGES: [""DAYZ""] (2013) (Video Game title) (7/10 -Steam).Still I cannot bear to look at this game in my Steam library. I will never be able to mourn the loss of so much potential. This game had so much going for it, originality, creativity, action, up until the point where I realized the devs became so lazy as to copy another game. Absolutely pathetic. Do the world a favor and do not support this company. They  will use your money to make more sad little DayZ clones under the pseudonym ""Dark Souls"". More like Dark Sh!t"
Negative,"This game is a terrible co-op game. Only the host gets loot. If anyone dies you have to re-summon them. If the host dies, you have to re-ember before you can summon your friends again. And you constantly get invaded by high level players who will kill you easily if you are ever in danger of making any progress in the game. Not fun at all."
Negative,kinda trash no fortnite emotes or minecraft diamonds
Negative,GBA graphics under 4K resolution...
Negative,i Bought it after i finished Elden ring.Refunded 2 hours later.Personaly i didnt like it
Negative,"Clunky piece of shit, nearly unidentifiable from the first Dark Souls... complete waste of money, doesn't immerse you like a proper RPG should, just relies on the meme of ""you will die lots lol"""
Negative,Chackpoints are way too far for the difficulty. spend too long just to get a bit of progression. if you are a part time worker go ahead but if you got a full time job and a life skip this
Negative,"Game began crashing for me after the High Wall of Lothric, cannot recommend in its current state."
Negative,"This is the game everyone believes is the best one of the souls? This...? After 200 hours on Elden Ring I thought I'd give this a try, but oh boy does this game love to suck out of you every drop of fun you manage to find in it. Barely managed to force myself to finish it. How incredibly disappointing."
Negative,"im a big fan of the souls series and imo this is the most lazy part of it. dark souls 1 was a nice and fun game with lots of depth and build variety and dark souls 2 expanded upon that base (making it imo the technically best souls game). now dark souls 3 came along and in regards of gameplay depth it rather feels like dark souls 0.5 .  stats were removed, powerstancing got replaced by pre-set dual wield weapons with full on anime movesets and most of the bosses are boring mutated humanoids. the netcode sucks serious ass too. in ds 2 sotfs i could host pvp parties with 5 other players without any lag or delay and in ds3 i got a solid 0.5 second delay on hits in pvp with just 1 enemy player. and thats not just in some rare cases cause my opponent has a bad connection, thats the case in every fight. if you are looking for a casual arpg and dont care about the multiplayer its okayish, but for me as a fan of the souls series, it was a big let down. R.I.P. Dark Souls"
Negative,"Well, the game is fine, bosses are fun UNLESS you understand that it is just a slasher and almost NO rpg elements. All these levels and stuff leads you to the same characteristics everyone has, same rings and spell/weapon setup everyone uses. You end up with characteristics that give nothing and unable to level beyond pvp levels, which kinda kills all sense of new walkthroughs. Or you stick with lvling and boosting characteristics that give you miserable outcome. PvP is kinda fun, but you have to walkthrough all PvE content to do it, stupid, right. Oh, and you can get a multiplayer ban just for using legit items or dc-ing.Quests are shit, almost ipossible to discover through your natural progression, little clue is given and are not worth bothering. You need to go to wiki to do them, but then they lose all their charm, RPG  my ass. Lore is nice tho.Inventory managment is a disaster, controls are shit and you have to navigate in console keys, but I heard DS2 had much worse, suffer PC users.Verdict: nice views and boss battles, not worth its price and has no replay value."
Negative,"This game is absolute trash, honestly don't know how people find it enjoyable at all. The movement mechanics are uncomfortable, and the game is overall just not fun what so ever. Not even worth the 15 euros i paid for it when i got a discount, I'm gonna issue a refund and not think twice about it. Complete waste of time."
Negative,"I would really like my money back for this game. I actually would advise somoene to sue Miyazaki or the company FROMSOFT for false advertisement and causing me and many others emotional distress. There are plenty of petitions out there directed at FROMSOFT inabilty to properly balance the game and communicate with its audience. The pvp in this game doesn't take very much skill or thought grab a weapon with hyper armor and mash the r1 button. If you played the other souls title you can grasp the half ass work they put into the 3rd title compared too Dark souls 1and2. While playing this game get used to very cancerous people spamming you with poisoness and cancerous messages that will most assuredly and eventually cause you great anger.  The unbeleivable level of these hate filled messages will cause you much grief and distress to you and those around you. If you think you can counteract this type of behavior by reporting these people it's wasted effort, I've made countless harassment reports to these types but my efforts were futile. I dont abide by this type of behavior, just because its a video game doesn't mean people can freely act this way your still playing a video game in the real world. Whoever is in charge of regulating these types of companys I ask of them to please take them to court for theire apathetic attitude towards it's customers. I am extremely dissatisfied with  my purchase of this game and I dont mind sacrificing a few minutes of my time to bring to light all these inept practices this company continues to run by. I hope by writing this review i can prevent others from experiencing the harassment I've allready undergone."
Negative,"Poor quality render, lacks MSAA."
Negative,Dumbest multiplayer mechanics ever created
Negative,HOW TO SWORD 10+ TITANIUM LEVEL IM  LAVA IN GAME AND DYING DYING THIS GAME IS SO UNFAIR I JUST KEEP DYING WHEN I TOUCH THE SKINNY MEN WITH SWORDS
Negative,bad controller support
Negative,Played 52 hours of this game just for my save to get corrupted after a sudden crash.
Negative,"3 часть игры выходит на ПК, а нормального управления в менюшке для клаваутры нет. Игра при запуске мерцает белыми полосами свеху и снизу. Поменять настройки чтобы убрать дефект, а вот и нет, потому что нет нормально управление и где кнопки ок и отмена на клавиатуре только Фромам известны. 1 из 10 за такую оптимизацию."
Negative,"I come from Elden Ring, loving everything about the game. DS3 is very similar but very different in mechanics. The delayed input lag, the enemies have a few different delayed attack timing (which is insanely hated now days look at Wo Long), and the animations - a lack of - for charged attacks and lunges. All of these are just ruin the game for me. I understand so many love the game obviously but if you never played and played Elden Ring and Wo Long (and don't like Wo Long) you may not like this game as DS3 is mechanically different, not for the better."
Negative,"The dark souls games are not as good as the reviews they generally get. They are not as much hard as they are a game of memorization. Once you know where the enemies are and what their attack patterns are, it is relatively easy. Until then, you will die over and over in cheap ways because the game is intentionally designed to be annoying on your fist play-though.There have been so few changes to the core mechanics of the game since the original Dark Souls. It almost feels like a DLC for the original game that just added more content. There are so many game mechanics that could improve these games so they are not a chore to play through the first time, but multiple games in and they have yet to change anything, and fans of the franchise are so stubborn that they refuse to admit the franchise's shortcomings. Here are just a few ideas that would make the Dark Souls games infinitely better:    Speed up the process of restarting. Don't make me wait for slow animations like standing up from a bonfire. reduce the size of the maps so there is less walking. Make the menus quicker. Add an option to immediately respawn when you die rather than having to wait multiple seconds while it slowly shows ""you died."" It just all needs to be sped up a lot.    Add friendly fire for enemy attacks. then we could learn attack & hitbox timing while playing it safe and manipulating enemy positions    Add a time rewind mechanics (like Prince of Persia)    Add a ghost mode trigger-able from fire pits that lets you explore ahead to analyze the map without interacting with anything, and upon leaving ghost mode you would return to the fire pit you triggered it from    Add a meditation mode trigger-able from fire pits that lets you train against enemies so you can learn their attacks before facing them for real    Add a spell in the beginning of the game that reveals (wall hacks) all enemies for a period of time    Add a Libra spell obtainable in the beginning of the game (see Final Fantasy if unfamiliar with ""Libra"")    Add a ghost clone spell (similar to the clone ability in Halo Reach) that creates a ghost  clone of your character that runs forward and agro enemies so you can see the enemies and prepare    Add teleportation spells (similar to ""mark"" and ""recall"" in Elder Scrolls: Morrowind) that let you warp backwards to re-assess your situation if you are surprised by a new enemy    Add an icon that shows how many enemies are currently agro-ed to you (similar to most stealth games such as Shadow Of Mordor)    Add a spell, character upgrade, or game setting that adds a mini map that highlights enemy locations/directions    Add a way to find bonfires so you don't accidentally skip them    Add an item that will automatically trigger a dodge or perfect block before you would take damage but prevents you from attacking. This way you can learn the timing of the enemy hits and then unequipped the item when you are ready to go on the offensive.    Add circles around enemies to show their agro rangesAny/all of these mechanics would make the game less about memorization, and it would make death more justified as you would have an actual chance to avoid it your first play-though.The physics have always sucked in every dark souls game. Several of your deaths are bound to be due to the piss poor physics such as not being able to run over a 0.5ft obstacle on the ground. The real enemy in these games is the god damn furniture.The game also has numerous technical issues. The game has really bad screen tearing that require you to go into Nvidia Control Panel and force VSYNC to be enabled. The sound effects also often glitch out when multiple sound effects play at once. The game is also locked at 60 FPS and while it doesn't have very much slowdown, it shouldn't be locked to 60 FPS in the first place. This is a AAA game; it should have an unlocked framerate. There are mods out there to unlock it, so why have they not done so to the official release?One of the biggest complaints I have though is that the game does not support cloud saves. If you uninstall the game or move the installation you can lose your entire save data. You cannot play the same character on both your Steam Deck and your PC because there are no cloud saves."
Negative,"If you like dying over and over and over again and then getting ridiculed as a ""casual"", then you WILL LOVE THIS GAME. It has just the right combination of infuriating mechanics, hackers, a toxic community that rivals R6, and a development team that abandoned this BS game 3 years ago."
Negative,"Do not buy if you only have a keyboard and mouse. Nearly unplayble, the knight guys (lothric, sword and shield) are very incosistent in terms of killing even one of them. I dont know about controllers but often when fighting I end up just randomly kicking in the middle of attacking which gets me killed, you really cant spam w when attacking because it always happens. Rolls are very linear of course when using a keyboard which I havent seen much of a problem with but sometimes it really gets in the way. In addition to the tremendous combat downsides of using keyboard you also have to essentially look up the controls to keyboard and mouse as the game doesnt tell them to you. The bare essentials are told but most everything else you have to learn online. Hell even the instructions themselves aren't always helpful, to jump it says ""space + space"" what? You actually have to hold space to run and then quickly press space to jump, yeah thanks game. I don't know if im just really bad at the game or what but right now, to me I dont think anyone should buy the game without controllers unless you're going out to buy one or you want to suffer through hell.Im not going to refund it because I got it for 15$ and if I want to play it again im not forking out 45$ more but if you bought it for 60$ by all means refund it if you dont like it."
Negative,for still full price kinda eh
Negative,Do NOT buy this game if you don't own a controller. Not playable with keyboard and mouse.
Negative,"completed in one sitting, this game is too easy"
Negative,I absolutely hate it : UPDATE: I still do.
Negative,It's a souls game. they're all shit and over hyped.
Negative,"this game is not hard, it's just annoying af. Had such a miserable time playing it that I dropped it basically 3 bosses before the endgame. All of the bosses can be beaten with the same tactic: do 2-3 hits -> run away -> wait for boss to end the attack -> repeat.Defeated Dancer Of The Boreal Valley before pontiff, being undergeared, with a Bandit's Knife and that the only fight I really enjoyed. All of the other bosses are lame and annoying to fight against"
Negative,"This game is not even remotely optimized for PC. To be honest, I'd ask for my money back if it wasn't a gift. The in screen tips are all designed for Xbox, the movement is clunky with mouse and keyboard, and I find it to basically be unplayable in PC."
Negative,really wish i could say to people to buy this game but just dont it is soooooooo broken on pc its unbelievable ive tried everything to get it to work and it is just none stop crashes and freezes just as you start to get into the game. if you are going to play this game then get it on a console and save yourself alot of time and effort. i love the souls game or just games from from software in general they actually make hard games unlike most other games on the market
Negative,"I enjoyed this game a lot and i would've continued playing, but for the love of all, add a fucking cloud save. I've lost my character because in this time that we live in, a game doesn't have a fucking cloud save? are you serious?"
Negative,"It's an ""ok"" game.Unfortunately you can't just go and write off all these bugs, shitty hitboxes and overall just poor game design as difficulty.It's playable, but very mediocre.Edit: Actually the game is shit. Make sure to backup your save files, because FromSoft are too mongoloid to implement Steam Cloud in 2k16.Edit2: As an EU located player, PvP is unplayable, since you are being matched with US servers, otherwise the roughly a second delay before the game registers that you hit your opponent and updates his health, is otherwise not explicable when there is nothing else other than the game itself that is using internet traffic that could explain the lag."
Negative,"You expect me to go back to an area of the game I haven't been in in hours completely unprompted, run out to a specific spot, go out of my way to walk to the edge of the castle, behind a tower, and find my way onto the roof? It's like the level designers don't want me to finish the game. This is only the 4th time I've had to abuse a walkthrough to make mandatory progress. Twice I had to find holes in walls off in corners in huge dark areas. Once I had to find another hole in a wall in a huge area where it seems like that wall already had an entrance, but it just let to a different area than the one needed to progress. Is this really normal level design to FromSoft shills? The devs might as well break into my house and throw my controller in my back yard if they just want me to find essential parts in places I'd never expect.Right after I wrote this, I got to a boss fight that teleports you right into another boss fight, but if you lose the second one, they game doesn't let you know how to get back to it on your own."
Negative,"Trust me, the Souls franchise is my all time favorite, and they do tend to release games with loads of bugs, but this is pushing it. PVP is impossible due to massive lag spikes that stop the entire game, and even in offline PVE the game will stutter more than a drunk toddler with tourettes syndrome after a huge hit of LCD.  The first few areas run smooth as silk, but after an hour or two, you have to abandone all hope in trying to invade players and fight against stacked enemies, due to the massive boner-killing glitches. I'd say that they'll fix this soon, but knowing From Software, they'll be nerfing items in the game before they bother with the actual problems.  Seriously From Soft, Git Gud."
Negative,It's very dificult to operate on PC. Want my money back
Negative,Clearly not made for keyboard-and-mouse-people.
Negative,"Okay so lets start with the fact that I loved this game. The gameplay is not what im putting down for this. I  was unaware of a certain thing which mainly makes me not want to play ""again"". Just remember that this game does not save to a cloud. Which means if you ever sell your computer like i did and decide to come back to it, you need to take the character save file and back it up first. I lost about 500 hours of gameplay because i was unaware of this. I had almost every weapon and drop in the game that you can get and was only playing at that point for the pvp. I don't think i'm going to sit here and go through another 500 hours of gameplay just to play the pvp again so here i am just sort of bleh about the experience all together. YES i loved the game, almost every aspect of it and could run through this game pretty quickly with no armour on but having to redo everything just makes me wanna wait for a new Dark Souls to starts over which will be a long time if ever. VERY MUCH WORTH $60. Just tedious to go back through everything and replay it from lvl 20ish when you know everything about the game's mechanics and what to avoid/do on each mob. Great game but no reason there shouldnt be cloud saving like other AAA games out there. Didn't even think i had to do this because it doesnt really warn you about it either. My bad sure on not backing it up but also their bad for not making it more evident that I needed to. If you never get a different computer this probably wont be a problem but for me, it was and it stings. One of my favorite games im just not annoyed with. Blah, my fault but still blah."
Negative,"This is probably the worst game i've played in last time. Gameplay is boring and keeps being same, visuals are awful, controls are awful, content is incredibly limited, story is absent, but pretending to be ""great"" and ""deep"". But this game surprisingly costs more than good games with at least some content. It could be an honest indie game with an honest price, but for a low quality game built on a pure hype, the situation is very disappointing"
Negative,Why is everyone hacking this game...thought dks servers booted modders...guess from soft dosent care about their games after theyve made their money. what a waste of money this was...invincible players all day in pvp...real cool
Negative,Game is made for a controller. Keeps telling you to hit controller options but this is for PC. Extremly hard to use menus as it always defaults to controller functions. Really disapointed as had this on my wish list for a long time. If you make it for PC then don't have the game use controller buttons for all the menu promts and for in game.  Really short sighted on the devs.
Negative,Piece of shit game doesn't have cloud saves.
Negative,"Not as good as ds1, also, forced PvP after killing a boss is degenerate. I will alt+f4 over and over again"
Negative,"Honestly, fuck this game. Poorly designed pvp which is really all this game is once you finish the game once. There is is no replayability. The only reason you want to enter NG is to get stronger rings and get more respec's to change your stats, nothing changes except enemies have more HP and DMG. I liked the PvE bosses, they were good but thats where it ends. Now you're probably wondering why I'm saying poorly designed pvp right? So lets start with the armor, there is none basically. You have the same protection with robes as heavy armor but if you have slot empty lets say you're missing a headpiece you get a huge minus to your flat defence which I do not understand the logic behind, in other words  armor is completely useless just make sure you have something in every slot. Then we have invasions... if you've played this game and tried invading you already should know what I'm talking about. Unlimited phantoms, host has 30% more health, more than half your estus and there is no way to punish chugging estus. So invasions are pure cancer, you can only win if you use oneshot builds or parry. Then there is dueling, what all the skilled players do. I've found dueling to be the most fun since you can't heal and heal and heal over and over again and it actually takes skill to defeat your opponent rather than cheeky tactics. So PvP should be fine since there is dueling right? No. In a game where millimeters matter and every little step you take matters and there is lag, in otherwords phantom range. I'm sure you've heard of this if you've played PvP in Dark Souls. You're supposed to space your enemy in duels and attack smartly but how does one space another player that has dual swords that have the range of a spear because of latency and do more damage than a 20kg Greataxe? You don't. I only recommend this game if you live in Korea or Japan so your and the other players' pings are always under 20 because if you live in the northern part of earth you'll find this game depending on your luck of having a good or a bad connection.TL;DRPros- Good PvP when no latency- High skillcap combat- Fast action combat- Good bossesCons- Latency, there is always latency and that's what makes me unable to call this game's PvP competetive- Bad areas (My opinion but I'm sure you can relate in someways)- (DLC RINGED CITY) The bosses were fantastic but everything else was basically rushed and poorly designed. Most of the   enemies were copied.- Hackers, hackers can literally get you banned for playing the game, they can mess up your files and get you banned and there is nothing FromSoft will do to help you.- Too easy, carebear game compared to the last Dark Souls games- Invasions are so fucking bad"
Negative,"Dancer did not dance, would not play again"
Negative,A poor port with awful controller overlays. Seriously don't sell a game for PC unless you put in the minimalist amount  of effort to make it not look like a shitty port.
Negative,"This is not a review of the game.  Dark Souls 3 is one of the best games I've ever played.First it should be said that I'm playing on a very top end PC with an Xbox controller.The PC port is very unresponsive at times.  There's random bouts of input lag that seem to come out of nowhere.  I've tried many fixes, but I've yet to find a fix that works.  I've played this game on a PS4 and it's very smooth and responsive at all times.I highly recomend Dark Souls 3.  Just on PS or Xbox.  Don't bother with PC.  And saying that really pains me being a PC gamer.Edit:I found the solution to my problem. There was a USB conflict.  I moved the controller to another USB port and, when I play, I unplug other USB devices.  There's a good reason why hard core gamers like PS/2 ports.I'd still recommend console over PC for Dark Souls though.  I just might have to buy another console for Bloodborne.  The one I have just gets used for Netflix."
Negative,"Man, this game is not for me. Abandoned within just a couple of hours. I have since gone and finished Elden Ring on a modded increased difficulty and had a much better time there than I did here purely because this game and all others in the souls serious are just far too inaccessible. Souls fans cherish the difficulty of their games and that's great, but there is a difference between a game being difficult and a game being obtuse. This game was obtuse when I played it back in 2016 and it's beyond obtuse now."
Negative,I might have enjoyed the game if it wasn't such a lazy port.  They didn't even bother translating the button prompts when teaching how to play into the actual buttons that are used on the mouse and keyboard.  How much could they really care about the rest if they don't even bother with the basics like controls?
Negative,"This game's FPS constantly shifts from playable to slideshow whenever I play it. Whenever it's at least playable, I consider it to be a really fun game of ""how can I die now"", and I love it. No crashes, surprisingly, just terrible FPS.As it stands right now, don't buy it. Dark souls is a game based on reflexes, and ""seconds per frame"" FPS is just annoying to deal with. Wait for the issues to be resolved whenever that happens, because it seems like it'd be a very good game otherwise."
Negative,I never leave reviews. Played Dark Souls 1 and ended up rage quitting. Fast forward 2 years and I foolishly thought I would return for Dark Souls 3. Thankless - soulless - pointless - You play and try to ignore the continual ache of feeling like you are wasting your time.I ended up rage quitting again after dying for the 100th time on one of the bosses. I Hate this game and I hate this genre. Soul destroying and no fun at all!
Negative,Got it as part of a bundle and still feel ripped off.  Definitely not made for play on a PC.
Negative,"Why is it only showing gamepad controlls ? Half finished ass game, what the fuck"
Negative,worst souls ever (srsly)
Negative,"Game is unplayable due to crashes. Standard suggested fixes of playing knight class/reducing lighting quality to low do not help.  Waste of money until they fix it, rip off."
Negative,I deleted this game because it was to hard I hate the dancer so much please nerf and will buy again
Negative,"A waste of money. Complete and utter themepark cashgrab. DLC is utter garbage, and I am glad they arent continuing this franchise."
Negative,At current time of writing this text I feel absolutely glad and not angered at all about been theft of 15 euros on this game which wasnt labelled as only played with gaming controller and not with keyboard+ mouse as pc game.
Negative,"I think I've spent enough hours trying to like this game, too many flaws. I guess it was still a more exciting experience than DS2 which i got bored of quickly and never fininshed once but even so i like the gameplay of DS2 better.DS3 is too fast or more like you are just too slow with no real poise, just hyperarmor. So only certain large strength weapons can be used to trade blows, light weapons and casters can enjoy interrupts/staggers all day long. Blocking with shields is suicide against most enemies that never stop spamming zero wind up time attacks with their infinite stamina.Jacked up kids that rather rely on reflexes alone probably love the game as is, i have barely anything in common with edgy fanboys like that. Meaning the community is nice while you play ball and blindly love the game including every terribly broken buggy working as intended poor design bit of it.At least there are sufficient players for those mandatory boss fight summons assuming you're in the right level for the fight, otherwise you're stuck because the only people that can now reliably solo every boss are the ones who previously were doing crazy challenge runs.""Hard but fair"" is less true than ever with the 3rd game, cheap deaths all of the time.PvP has no chance of redeeming the mediocre gameplay either when network lag is so common.The only build i had some fun playing was Faith caster using talisman weapon art to kill most things in one or two hits with lightning or bleed and without stagger thanks to the hyperarmor. Sad thing is, it's useless in PvP with how slow and obvious the casting is. Respec costs consumable items obtained from invading players - I literally have to use a terrible build to invade and kill other players before i can respec to a generic PvP build. And by the time you finally have a decent number of good offensive miracles and equipment for this build the game is over anyway.The anti invader covenant is terrible by design having very little chance of ever being summoned.But above all else this game is just frustrating. There is no real relief or pleasure in getting past any difficult part of it like there was in DS1, more than ever it feels like any success is more because of luck than actual good performance based on experience. It's extremely unrewarding beyond completing the story which is completely unlike Dark Souls where story is secondary to the gameplay. The more you play the more you just hate the game and the developers for insulting you by wasting your time with tedious and unfair challenges. It adds to the stress of the player rather than being an outlet for stress perhaps for the first time justifying the nonsense idiotic armchair psychologists in the mass media keep spewing about video game caused violent behavior. For the first time the stupid ""git gud"" meme doesn't provoke you into proving to yourself and everyone else that you're a good player instead it just adds to the loathing of everything to do with the game and its community.I feel very tired and hollow. For older gamers fond of slower games it may be best just to watch some videos of this game for the lore. This game is for twitchy people that flinch more easily than the full havels armor character being bitten by a rat."
Negative,"And once again i don't know why i bought it....The game made me lose any faith in reviewers.I would rate this game good for a 1990 game (except for the graphic that is ok)======> Oh and don t get fooled with the fact they finally removed the undead thing!!!!!!!!!Once you die a couple times you are worst than the old undead and you can t do anything about it.If you like DS series, buy it after all its the new call of duty.... always more of the same but worse.And please dn t say its ""difficult"" its not its just the definition of cheesy...You have to learn to cheat the poor AI and the game design.Don t expect skill to matter anyway.When your opponent attacks are faster than yours all you have to do is learn patterns and play the rythm game.Only pro: 60 FPS, Wondeful settingCON: CHARACTER EDITOR is useless in game since once you die you get scars until after few death you are worse than a zombieBAD GAMEPLAY DESIGN ... enemies hits you through walls with no line of sight, but also from the floor and so on...collision detection is so bad that you won t find any worse since decades of VG and so on.TOTAL LACK OF BALANCE."
Negative,My friend keeps talking about this game and it kinda to much. he even went to shit talk DS1 even tho he never played it so as punshiment I thumbs down this game even tho it is pretty goated.
Negative,"This shit is laggy as fuck and no ""git gud"" is NOT an option , elden ring is way better imo"
Negative,Absolute let down. The first instalment was the best. The second although heavily criticised yet it still headed its own direction and tried to be unique. But this game I cannot recommend. The music is not memorable. Magic/spells/incantation/miracle fail to inovate. Heavy armour is useless against stager. Map and level design may be stunning but It feels not thought out as much as the 1st segment and is also more confusing. I feel that the combat was heavily improved from previous games. I see that the game tried to go heavy on the theme of nostaligia and in the end it was not bad but ultimately I feel dissapointed by this game. Also I have to mention that few bossfights in this game are trully breathtaking
Negative,"A overglorified death simulator made to give masochists and emos another reason to hate themselves, it's genuinly just brain numbing, would not reccomend even if gotten for free"
Negative,Why the hell keyboard bound keys A and D moves my camera and why can't I toggle it off?I'm fighting the camera more than mobs.This is the reason I stop playing this.
Negative,"You don't play it to destress. It's got greatgraphics and gameplay, its intuitive. But is it fun? lol"
Negative,"I beat this game multiple times ON STREAM just like GOD GAMER jerma985 and let me tell you, you don't gotta be good to rollcatch some degenerate INT-leveler who has no brain with a meta weapon you saw on youtube on your twink character."
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 is fast, its furious, then the novelity wears off to broken covenants, gankfests, grindfests, R1 spamfests.Dark Souls 3 includes the worst parts of Dark Souls 1, and leaves out the best parts of Dark Souls 2.I want to like this game, but leave disappointed instead."
Negative,"the most creatively bankrupt game miyazaki has ever directed. there's absolutely nothing new or original here, it's all rehashed ideas and themes from previous games with zero identity of it's own.it's probably the safest and most milquetoast sequel i have ever played in my life. it's sh­it."
Negative,"This is the first Dark Souls game I played as a friend recommended it to me. I had no idea what to expect except for pain and suffering.Overall I think that some of the game is good but I quickly started to dislike the game as all the boss fights are wait for them to attack with a move that you can punish and I have no patience.The DLCs aren't great as the bosses are either bullshit too fast (Ashes of Ariandel) or have wayyyyy to much health (Main 2 bosses of The Ringed City)Game was satisfying at times, but overall I didn't enjoy it."
Negative,"Sometimes it works, sometimes it immediately becomes unresponsive forever and ever. Glad I wasted my money :D Eat dick FROM."
Negative,Waste of money and time.
Negative,STOP POKING ME THROUGH WALLS GODDAMMIT
Negative,game has too many slavs in the community
Negative,"It's -Dark Souls-. If you hate grinding and terrible ports, this is not for you. If you like crashes, and having a stick shoved up your nethers, you'll enjoy this game."
Negative,This game is so great it made me lose interest in all other games. Do not play this game.
Negative,"Nothing fun about this game. At least elden ring inched you into dying 1000 times, where this pos does it at the start of the game. Funnest thing I did was uninstall it."
Negative,Worst gameplay and worst fighting system ever. Scenary is the only aspect i save. That's all.
Negative,"Graphics rock. Love the genre. Hate the bonfires during boss fights only. Every time I lose to a boss (like 10 + each attempt) there is this obnoxious jog from bonfire back to boss that costs minutes per attempt... not to mention just boring tedium.The only fix I recommend for this game is give a try again option at the boss, or just put a bonfire at his front door. No need for the stupid jog every attempt. The game already has enough hours of quality gameplay built in.Don't recommend. Save your time and spend it elsewhere instead of redo-redo-redo like this game will make you."
Negative,"I don't like it, it's not for me.I made sure I pass first boss before I leave the review, feels shallow, too hard for no reason, and it's not hard like mastering games like Dota 2 or Civilization series, it's hard to play on basic level. Controls and keybinds are awful for 60 euros PC game, you need a game pad to play this. It's spam 3-4 buttons game that is hard and I felt like I'm not progressing further then pressing 3 different buttons to kill things."
Negative,Why are there still no cloud saves in this 2016 game that takes multiple dozens of hours to beat
Negative,they called their company softcore i think they need to change it to hardcore
Negative,"I'm glad this was the last one, so I'd never have to play anything like it again. 10/10"
Negative,"This game was made by people who were bullied as children. It is the result of truly feeling you lack a complete  position of authority in your life. And it goes without saying that none of the devs have EVER felt the touch of a woman in their life, and inevitably, never will. (This is merely my psychoanalysis, interpret however you will)."
Negative,"this game is literally impossible for beginners , only at the boss in the tutorial you need 30 minutes to get over it,maybe if you play the whole franchise from dark souls 3 you will handle it.Just nopls noThe developers are crazy."
Negative,"It's a shame, that in this day and age and with such successful franchise, From Software is still unable to provide quality gameplay with a keyboard and a mouse! To begin with, the turning of the mouse / camera feels jittery as hell and I don't like to play with a controller. I have more than one, yes, but I just don't enjoy playing games on it, and I'm definitely not the only one. Why do they even release it for PC if its port is so half-butted? Although I had played the first DS with a controller, I really hoped for the third one to be perfectly playable with a keyboard and mouse. And what's with the character creation sliders? We can't position them as we want without falling asleep first, so many units and such a slow sideways scrolling... genius! Also To bind dash, jump, and roll functions all to one button is also a pretty insane thing to do. Honestly, despite everything good that I heard about this game, nothing in it impressed me so far, and I don't know if I'm going to play it any further."
Negative,"The game simply in an unplayable state even at the lowest settings.My rig isnt the newst but by no means considerd low spec, even the game detection systemadvised me to go with all setting on high. despite that game stutters even when everything is on low/off.I played the new witcher and fallout4 on med+, so it doesnt make any sense that this gamewont run smoothly even on low/off with lower res, untill it is fixed I give this game a negative review.and I DONT RECCOMNED BUYING THE GAME IN THIS STATE unless your righ is high end...EDIT: im runing with win 10 64 gtx 570  -- (This card have better preformence than the min req despite being older gen!)i5 6600k 3.5GHZ16GB RAMand with the newst updates both to game and driversEDIT2: There is a solution for 400 and 500 series' posted on reddit atm, changing the driver to 314.22 did the trick for me and the game is playable now.still thumbs down, until better optimization is available and not a workaround."
Negative,The game is SUCK. Programmer should go back to learn how to code. I lost my End game save by file corrupt. After restore backup from backup disk. Server ban my account.DON'T buy the game from this dev or BANdai I will stop buy the game from these people. Dragon Ball fighter Z is my last game from these company. Bye
Negative,"If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place. (review at the end maybe.)Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.Nope Read this one instead http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198259385548/recommended/374320/"
Negative,Not for the faint of heart
Negative,"The halfbaken port to PC with ever present Controller button indications even if no controller is present or used, is very annoying and led me to uninstall it."
Negative,unbelievably uncomfortable gameplay. how even can developers make it so dumb for pc
Negative,Holy cow I cannot figure out the controls. Everything is made like I'm playing on Xbox. I really wanted to play and love this game but it sucks.
Negative,very bad port did not enjoy controls are not crisp
Negative,"Massive framerate drops due and crashes on many GTX series.Began after update months ago and no fix has been implemented, widely known issue."
Negative,Dark souls has taken over my friend life plus this game require a controller if you want to be good or to enjoy it without it its so imprecise and you will miss numerous keys attack plus if you have a small screen like me dont buy just dont.
Negative,terrible piece of shit dogshit doodoo gameds2 is better
Negative,"I love this game and a decent challenge, but this is crazy.  Either my game didn't install correctly or this sh*t is vamped to the max because even in the tutorial I and getting one banged using the knight.  I do try to play this game every once in a while I get on but still the same outcome.  Run up try to get a swing, but the enemy teleports to me and kills me in one hit.  And when I do some how manage to pass the tutorial, the difficult enemy's attacks stun lock me so I just have to watch my character die and I can't do anything."
Negative,"I am a huge fan of Dark Souls the original due to its sound mechanics and deep, interesting plot for each and every character in the game. Dark Souls is like a huge canvas painting that has been pain-stakingly completed with a fine brush.Dark Souls 3 is that same canvas with paint loosely daubed across it, with the name ""Ariandel"" scrawled in the bottom corner.Where item placement and character developments were a well thought out puzzle in the first game, Dark Souls 3 has maps sprawling with seemingly randomly placed items and many characters fall by the wayside. Some npcs in this game are well developed to be fair.PvP.  Poise doesn't work, armour is useless (just equip any piece in a slot) and there are a few weapons which are just broken. This is especially true for DLC weapons. There is a definite hierarchy.  Invaders are really challenged, given that the host can summon 3 phantoms and a blue sentinel/blade of the dark moon. Very often, these power groups just gank you. I would argue black phantoms are a fun and integral part of the gameplay. Whenever a phantom invades, excitement and fear levels rise. It is wrong that they are so punished. Also, black phantoms invade for free but drop their souls when they die as a phantom. Just bizarre. People use estus in duels. I know there are lloyd's talismans which stop estus use but it is very annoying the way people just chug estus flasks all the time. Instead of a duel lasting a minute or so, it is a drawn out affair, with even phantoms healing while you duel. No honour.I am a massive fanboy of this series but Dark Souls 3 does just feel lazy in a lot of places. Artificial difficulty is implemented by simply making many enemies and bosses damage sponges. Hit boxes are also waaaaay off with some bosses. This was true of the original also (here's looking at you, Gaping Dragon tail swipe!) but they really should of improved it.The DLCs are both dissapointing. The stories introduced in both are weak and poorly set up. It all feels rushed.We all knew we were in for a rough time when poise was broken from the start and they are yet to fix it and yet we perservered with the hope of fixes. They are not coming.This game has B team written all over it. A real shame because the game could have been great! All sins could have been absolved if the mechanics weren't soon bad.Solaire is the true son of Gwyn."
Negative,"Whats the point in making such a dumb ass game. No cutscenes, interface is from console, difficulty is fuck, they think you have weeks to complete the same locations over and over again."
Negative,Overrated PVE that's very easy because its essentially just dodge and R1
Negative,"Maybe I didn't give it enough time, but I had heard good things, tried it for an hour and found the controls unintuitive and the game frustruating. Not a fan."
Negative,"*UPDATE* Please note the game has poise turned off for players, some modders have managed to turn it back on and it works normally but by default players do not have poise unless they are attacking with a heavy weapon.  Mod's keep locking discussion of it on both steam forums and reddit.  Here is some screen grabs of the threads.  http://tinypic.com/r/zqryd/9  https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/4gcp89/poise_stat_works/Why the response from mods and the dev team is to seemingly cover this up is suspicious as hell.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  From Soft is acting shady as hell and not supporting the PC version at all.  From Soft used to be my favorite dev(before dark souls 2) and while this game is markedly better than ds2 their treatement of the consumer base is disgusting.  They've lost my Business forever.  **Original Review**Currently the game is in a bad state with loads of crashes and no response from the developer.  I exceed the recomended spec's and get consistent crashes in specific spots every time now, its weird because these are places I was able to pass by earlier but got a random crash there and its like the game hardcodes the crash into the game so now its automatic every time I go to these places.  One such instance is now a boss fight which means I can not progress untill the issue is solved.  Get your shit together from soft.netcode is still garbage, roll the dice in pvp to see if you're going to be able to actually judge what the other person is doing or if they're going to suprise you with lag fuckery.twice i've had the game cheat me out of boss wins due to its terrible coding. First while fighting the Dancer I repeatedly attacked her and had my attacks bounce off her as if I were hitting a wall or something and doing no damage.  I got her down to almost nothing before dying, had the attacks I would have landed if not for this bug actually went through I would have killed her before then.  I had to then go on to fight her for like another hour before beating her finally.  Here's proof. https://www.twitch.tv/ultrakrampus/v/60612659Second while fighting Champion Gundyr when the boss was at critical health the bug that gets a random input stuck(so say you run in one direction without pressing the button and if you press another direction your character freezes in place) prevented me from moving as I was trying to move in the opposite direction, this got me killed.  GG fromsoft and by GG I mean GIT GUD.The story delivery and writing are also amateur as fuck.  Game assumes you're going to be doing all this shit.  ""Oh youll be needing to go here and do this and this.""  Why?  why would you assume I would even care?  They do no work to set up why you would have any motivation to do this the only motivation to play the game is becasue its a souls game and you want to murder things."
Negative,"Someone at Bamco had a stroke and thought DS3, which is a 7 years old game, has double the value as Elden Ring."
Negative,"So much bullshit in the game, too many twinks and irritating shit."
Negative,"Let's make this short:Never played a Souls game? 70% chance you will not like and/or finish it.You liked any of the other Souls games? You might like this one as well!You LOVED Demons' Souls or Dark Souls? Could work, but watch out for Bloodborne influences.You LOVED Demon's Souls AND Dark Souls but wished for more exploration but less bosses?Well, the first half kinda works in that respect, but goes downhill beyond that point. I so hoped for more intricate level paths, complicated maps and heres and theres with less tedious boss battles. But no, in DS3 they decided to focus on bosses and bosses and bosses and bosses and bosses. All over the place! In a way, even the weirdly structured DS2 worked better because you could atleast branch off to some other place and come back later.Sooo, yeah, I can't recommend this game at all since I feel very strongly about the overall focus of the game. There is some interesting Lore, however, and there are certainly level design peaks worthy of exploration. Could be fun if I hadn't already been sold the previous game's strong points. Oh and don't get me started over hardware requirements and quality settings. On both high and low end hardware you'll get frame drops in many major boss battles - blocking progression at random.I recommend trying Salt and Sanctuary instead. Excellent replacement if you don't mind the change of perspective."
Negative,"Fucking Hacker using cheat program too much. Weihgt hack, speed hack, hp hack...Ifi you want to play this, just buy PS4"
Negative,"I TRIED to like this game... I REALLY did, but I just can't do it.- The PVP is terrible (Greatsword meta and Hyper armor =/= Poise)- The bosses are on crack rushing around the boss room, can't even make sense of them- The only proper strategy is to rollspam through attacks (no sense in ACTUALLY dodging a boss' attack)- The ""new"" mechanics are just ripped from prior games (like FP meter from Demon Souls, or Hyper Armor from Bloodborne)- The lore on some parts is terrible (The Ringed City and The Nameless King for example)- The fanservice is so obvious that it hurts (like Soul of Cinder's second phase, or Anor Londo? REALLY?!?)- The colors give the game a very dull and depressing mood (can't see anything but gray everywhere) which fits Bloodborne, but not a Dark Souls game- They act like Dark Souls 2 never happened, but still take aspects from the game (some of which make no sense, like the armor sets or Laddersmith Gilligan)- The chugging meta in PVP is terrible and even NPC phantoms can chug estus (anyone who has fought Hawkwood the Deserter knows what I'm talking about)- They removed many good aspects that were in Dark Souls 2 (like the Cracked Blue Eye Orb or the Small White Soapstone)- The players are bullied into NG+ and NG+2 by placing +1 and +2 rings there- The covenant rewards are annoying to get, especially when you are trying to get all of the achievements (waited over two hours to get summoned for the Blade of the Darkmoon covenant, immediately got kicked out of session -.- )- Slaveknight Gael is a terrible ending boss battle to the souls- series, his cape has a hitbox? REALLY?!? (Manus was the real final boss battle in the souls- series for me, and even Nashandra was a better final boss than Gael)In my opinion Dark Souls 3 is game which started with a LOT of potential, but they ruined it by filling the game with fanservice and taking too much influence from Bloodborne. The fast combat of Bloodborne doesn't fit Dark Souls, and the rollspam strategy is a result of it. If you're going to double the speed of the enemies when comparing to prior games, you HAVE TO make the player move twice as fast too! The speed difference stands out really clearly. Even though Dark Souls 2 was a failure in many players' eyes, it still tried to be unique and use original ideas... I wish I could say the same about Dark Souls 3...If you're like me and you just HAVE TO get this game (just because it's a souls- game), I recommend playing it in offiline mode to get the best experience and not getting the DLCs (they aren't worth it). The first DLC (the Ashes of Trailer Spoilers) is a terrible excuse for a DLC, which plays on the nostalgia of players who went to the Painted World of Ariamis in the first game. The second DLC is just a sh*tstorm with maybe ONE good boss (I'll let you figure out which one of them that is). I know that my opinion is of the minority, but that's because I'm not going to hop on the bandwagon of Dark Souls 1 fanboys and praise Miyazaki for another great game. As a singular entity this game is great, and I would give it much praise, but when comparing it to prior games of the soulsborne- series, it really brings nothing new into the mix. It really is an unholy abomination stitched together from mechanics of prior souls- games and with a paint layer of Bloodborne. I hate to say this, but I don't think this game is worth buying.UPDATE (1):I asked people to give their own opinion instead of disliking my review just because they disagree with me. A day later I see my review spammed with dislikes, yet I see no responses. It really just shows how most of the Dark Souls 3 fanboys are just brainless guard dogs for Miyazaki, attacking anyone who would criticize him and his work.It really saddens me that if you are trying to argue with anyone on the internet nowadays, asking people for their own opinions, you only get the response ""You disagree with us, f*ck off!"" The common internet user really has no experience in debating...Again... I ask you to PLEASE give your own opinion. If you disagree with me, THATS FINE! But if you do, PLEASE let me know whyUPDATE (2):Still no constructive conversation. Seems that I was right about the fanbase...Also, the game is still worse than Dark Souls: Remastered"
Negative,"It's not a difficult game.It's the controls that are difficult. Graduate degrees can be taught about how absolutely awful and anti-user the clunky, obtuse, poorly-translated, awkward controls are. The camera literally orbits you, fighting against your mouselook while you're trying to fight things, which means your facing and attacks are swinging wildly around and missing just because you can't look where you're trying to aim. The camera will literally actually actively try to stop you from playing the game.There's input lag artificially introduced to all your controls, so no matter what you are trying to do, you have to wait about 1.5 seconds before the thing starts animating. Meanwhile, creatures ""telegraph"" attacks for a random duration, but the actual attack itself is instantaneous so theoretically you would have to memorize thousands and thousands of attack animations in order to defend yourself. The theory is that this is ""difficulty"". It's actually just a denial of the player's agency and an artificially introduced source of tedium and frustration - which is because, again, the player is denied any agency.Stumbling around through ugly, monotonous environments isn't ""spooky"". It's just boring. There isn't anything to do in the world but stare at the same few creatures you're hacking and slashing your way through. Endless. Sprawling. Grey and brown.Then there's the balance issues.Once again, a title comes out which falsely advertises players can choose a sorcerer style of gameplay. The reality is that if you waste any time trying to ""cast a spell"", anyone else could have killed the thing eight times over with a boring sword and moved on to the next creature. No, you don't benefit from range because you can't aim anything: the camera literally will not allow you to see where you're aiming since by attempting to do so your own character obscures 30% of your field of view -- directly covering anything you might have been trying to shoot at. This isn't ""difficulty"". It's bad design. It's the kind of bad design that was pointed out in textbooks twenty years ago and if any developer was known to have done it, they were blacklisted from ever working in the industry again.Repeating the same ten steps as you ""learn the boss"" for hours and hours is not fun. It's not ""difficult"". It's just repetitive as you wait to memorize by rote. It's not ""rewarding"" to pass a boss. It's just a bitter feeling of wondering if even wasting your time was worth it for a few numbers going up on your UI.And then there's the character creation system.Or rather, the character anti-creation system. I have literally never before in my life seen a slider bar that you cannot slide the slider on. You have to hold down a button and wait for literally dozens of seconds while the ticker moves gradually, laboriously over. To produce a minimally noticeable effect on your face. Faces which are, by the way, universally ugly. Not like gritty fantasy, edgy hero ugly. But ugly like the excrement of a freshman in high school rushing through his first 3D modeling project the night before the finals. Ugly like a complete moron poking two holes in the crusty sock under his bed and drawing a smile on it with lipstick. Ugly like hitting random on the character customization screen in Oblivion.And then there's the lack of video settings options. And the abject failure of the button mapping to update the HUD's tips and labels. So after you remap your keys you better remember what they are when you come back after a month because the game absolutely will not tell you. This is basic UI design issues and it's profoundly embarrassing to be seeing this in the 21st century.  Very seriously, whatever imbecile was responsible for the UI design here needs to be fired immediately and blacklisted from the game dev community permanently. And then there's the awkward translations which end up misdirecting you or even just flat-out lying to you about what things do. No, you actually can't just jump. You can only jump when you're sprinting off a cliff, and you have to press these buttons on your controller which you aren't using because you're using a keyboard and mouse because you're on a PC - which means you can't know what to press to jump off this cliff anyway. And you can't experiment safely to find out because you can only jump when you're falling off a cliff.No tooltips. Why? Because apparently the concept of tooltips is too ""easy"". Apparently being able to play the game is too easy and that would be bad because fun is bad and you're not a true gamer for wanting to have fun.This critique has been repeating a theme a lot, but it's fitting for this specific game. It's not actually a game. It's just a tedium simulator. It's not difficult, it's anti-designed. It's not dark and depressing, it's just boring and ugly.Is it the absolute worst I've ever played? No. But it's among the worst ten, in the last twenty five years of gaming.At least Barbie's Shopping Adventure had colors."
Negative,PIECE OF S H I T THE MOST IMBALANCE PVP OF THREE PART DARK SOULS !!!!!! 9.9/10
Negative,"This game sucks D*&%... If you need that, get a good woman instead..."
Negative,"Pros:- Good graphics- Great audio and soundtrack- Awesome cinematic camera use in in-game video- Addictive in gameplay and the game is challengingCons:- Hints are for gamepads even if you use a keyboard- No way to pause the game (Yes I know you can quit the game and it autosaves, but you have to find and click the quit button, which is cumbersome to do something like a pause, while Alt+F4 won't save the progress)I would really want to recommend this game, but I believe the issues I listed in ""Cons"" can be fixed just using a small cut from the budget you spent on trailer making and marketing, so I will change this review to positive when the ""cons"" being fixed."
Negative,"Very bad pc game .... The menu and conversation are made for the steam controller (Thx steam to use this method to force us to buy your products!) ... Always more money ... If You have a keyboard, the menu is a strange shape And badly designed for keyboards ... Good luck, this makes it much less ... And if you like being beaten and re-beaten again by man without clothes Without shoes, without armor, no shield while you are a hero, dressed as a wealthy middle-Age ... this game is for you! Also a lot of bug in the graphics of the game which force me to restart the game again and again (it looks like a bad game made by Bethesda) .... Have fun with Dark Souls III"
Negative,"I have tried tio play this game on the PC. No chance to get further than the first boss. The port from console is VERY BAD! Hands off - not playable with keyboard. I regret the purchase and want my money back. Thiis hurts really,,,Ich habe das Spiel in dem guten Glauben gekauft, dass es auf dem PC spielbar ist. Aber grundlegende Bewegungsfunktionen sind nicht von der Konsole portiert worden. Die größte Herausforderung für die erste Stunde war, die ganzen XABC und RB/LB  Erklärungen zu verstehen und selbst auf PC Tastatur zu übersetzen. Beim ersten Boss scheitert der ungeübte Spieler schon kläglich. Youtubevideos zeigen zwar wie ""einfach"" es ist, aber eben nur mit Controller.Fazit: Ungenügend ausgearbeitet.Hände weg!"
Negative,"I love Dark Souls, all of them, and all for different reasons. Dark Souls III is no exception. But still I can not recommend purchasing this game in its current state. It works, it's playable, it's done. These seem to be FROMSOFT's core development goals.Yes, the game works, but all it took to get the game in a working state for a lot of people was a patch.Agreed, the game is playable, but that doesn't mean it's done.For instance, the game suffers from frequent FPS drops that are unrelated to graphics performence. I've tested this on lowest settings and on highest, and they both suffer from the same problem. Solid 60 FPS most of the time, but during seemingly random moments, it'll tank to 45, stick there for a bit, and then climb back up to 60 in 5 frame intervals.Next, we have the annoying 'feature' of getting kicked back to menu every time your game loses connection to steam. As we all know, steam is a steaming pile of **** when it comes to staying connected, and because of this, you'll frequently get booted to menu. Even during bossfights, which'll undo all your progress on said boss. I've had this happen to me on the start of my Deprived run, in which I slapped the tutorial boss to a sliver of health, only to get booted to menu, and dumped outside the fog-gate when I loaded in again, and got to do it all over. Kind of a fun-breaking mechanic right there.And then we get to the meat of this game's problem. The invasion mechanic.From what I can tell due to experiencing it first hand, and from other people's remarks, it seems FROMSOFT really tried to murder invasions in this one. All phantoms will have less health, which means you'll be weakened simply by loading into the targets world.The invasion matchmaking system seems to prefer matching you to worlds with active phantoms, the more, the better. Essentially, FROMSOFT has taken the hated ganksquad idea, and made it into a gameplay feature, allowing you to 'enjoy' a ganksquad in 80% of your invasions. Technically, if you want to have a better chance at doing 1-on-1 fighting, use your red summon sign. This completely destroys the point of invading however, and kills 60% of what makes Dark Souls the franchise that it is.There are covenants that allow you to automatically get summoned to defend a certain area, like the forest in Dark Souls, and the Bell Towers in Dark Souls II, but since launch, i've been unable to get these covenants to actually summon me, making progression in said covenant incredibly tedious, as the only other way to get covenant advancement items is slaughtering things in the covenant's protected area. Counter-intuitive? Yeah, kinda.TL;DR: Game's fun, but not worth recommending in its current state. It should have the sub-title 'We put on the kiddie gloves for this one'."
Negative,"This game is absolutely amazing once you get into it.However the controls are clunky and there are many many frustrations for someone who is new to the Dark Souls series.I have to ""not recommend"" just to warn new people. If you have console, get Bloodborne first."
Negative,The game is too grindy. You have to fight the same guys over and over again until you get high enough level to go to the next area. Just play Elden Ring.
Negative,"I'm not sure games can get worse than this. I'm 100% behind a game that teaches you skills/mechanics and then cranks up the difficulty forcing you to use them. This game? doesn't even tell you basic controls or menu navigation. Menu navigation and basic mechanics should not be part of this make-you-own-definition-of-difficulty. A lack a clarity as to what does what or how to navigate this menu or that one, is just laziness.Gameplay- every boss has RNG mechanics. So basically 0 skill is involved. You guess correctly? You might get to punish the enemy. So when the enemy flinches you have to guess:Will it be a 1 hit with no follow upWill it be a 2 hit comboWill it be a 3 hit comboWill the parry & attack animation actually workWill the attack be an instant attack, a long attack, or a really long attack (also have to guess this for each combo chain C: )Will the attack be a jump/lunge attack where it covers a ton of distance.The parry/dodge mechanics are not reactable (unless the cpu does the 2 second long attack). Which leaves you to make a ""read"" on an opponent that has no patterns...because it's not a human player.Add in to this is the good ol' tried-and-true difficulty of ""1 shot = you're dead"", as well.Out of a rating of 10, this gets a 5."
Negative,"Made by shetty Japanese console devs that don't give a fucc about PC players. Designed to be played with a controller. Even at their 3rd PC port, Fromsoft still doesn't have the technology to add keyboard+mouse button prompts ¯\_(ツ)_/¯More Cons:- Hard capped at 60fps (no way to play at 120+fps)- G-sync bug that locks the game at a cinematic 24fps- No native ultrawide or multi monitor support- Modding can get you banned from playing online- Hackers can crash your game and get you banned while they can keep doing that undetected- Game itself crashes during loading screens- Texture quality is horrible for a 2016 game. Foliage and grass look like shyt. Crysis came out in 2007 and you can look up its foliage compared to DS3- Texture pop-in 24/7- Terrible servers and only 2 regions: Japan and non-JapanPros:+ Steam refunds so shetty devs don't get your moneySeriously though, if you don't care about the online Dark Souls experience (coop & invades), don't buy this game nor support these devs that clearly don't care about you. Try  The Witcher 3  if you are you are looking for a great single player game (objectively better story, mod support, and developers who care about consumers)."
Negative,It feels like a console game
Negative,"In addition to the money you pay for the game you also pay with your sanity ever single time you encounter something new, its just abusive and depressing"
Negative,A guy hit me and i died
Negative,"Trash game, not recommended, they just took everything from dark souls 1 and placed it here, expanding on it a little, and destroying any canon from first games, also, common enemies turn out harder than bosses, and some bosses are complete and utter hot garbage"
Negative,"You don't need to play more than one of the games in this series to 'get it'.  The aesthetics are forgettable after the first game, the combat design doesn't get any better, the engineering gets worse, and any semblence of AI, physics, or hitboxes can be described as random at best.You will struggle against invisible walls, a shit camera, negligent glitches, and number games more than you'll be challenged by anything that *works* in Dark Souls III."
Negative,"Playing this game, I've seen the ""You died!"" notification way too many times. It's made to be frustrating - this seems to be one of its core design principles. There is a system behind it all, but it isn't explained anywhere, and if you try to find explanations online, it's more likely than not that the only advice you're going to get is to ""Git gud!"". Even if you know the system, it might not be possible for you to learn it on a practical level, and if you don't, there's just no alternative. I've been playing as a pyromancer and learning the locations and routines of all enemies, but this is, first of all, boring, and second, it doesn't work against bosses.The only reason I've been able to play for so long and almost finish the game is that I've been playing it with friends since about the third boss battle (out of, seemingly, tens of boss battles), and my friends are the kind that has ""gotten good"" by either managing to learn the mechanics or grinding long enough, and they're willing to help me deal with most enemies, especially bosses. Even so, I'm almost completely out of Embers - the items that I *need* to be able to play with friends, and whose number, though very large, is limited. I am not sure that I will be able to finish the RInged City DLC.TL;DR This game is for you if at least one of the following is true:- you're naturally talented at martial arts, dancing or something of the sort, but don't mind a very laggy UX- you enjoy grinding- you are a masochist- you have friends who are one of these and willing to help you.Otherwise, I couldn't un-recommend this game low enough to you."
Negative,"Took an hour figure out why the Steam Controller wouldn't work with it, found out it was jsut as much fun with the Controller actually NOT working!"
Negative,"If you want to play the same game as all the foure other ""souls"" before it, but this time with quite regular multiplayer issues, well, you've been warned."
Negative,controls in game suck.game looks sweet but camera is on streriods move to fast can't get it to slow down am always missing target .
Negative,DARK SOULS™ III: Prepare To Stutter™
Negative,"trash, too hard"
Negative,Dark Souls 1 was so good. This is so boring and ridiculous.
Negative,pee poop shit fuck ass cum bitch pussy poop hell piss pee
Negative,"Game is shit on pc and doesnt teach you the controls. Camera moves on its own even with the setting turned off. Constant frame drops. Lives up to how hard its claimed to be, but I don't get the point in playing something that gives absolutely 0 reward for learning an increadibly hard to learn combat system. Scenery is cool tho. I think most people have been brainwashed or sum shit because this is not a very good game lol 3/10."
Negative,Absolutely loved Dark Souls. I feel they took everything I loved about the original and removed it and instead emphasised everything I didnt like about it.I've never bothered reviewing a game on steam before but after playing though this game and comparing it to the original I feel let down.
Negative,"Great game, but dont lose your data or you lose everything, very disappointing considering I just purchased the season pass in anticipation of the DLC and was forced to do a reinstall ( thanks windows 10). Shame on you Dark Souls III for not having a cloud save function, a function which games have had since 2005. Shame shame shame."
Negative,I'd rather chop off my own genitals than ever touch this clunky pile of dog shit ever again.
Negative,this game is ass
Negative,Literally the worst game ever created. I have 0 ability to comprehend how anyone can call this monstrosity fun.
Negative,worst of the darksouls series..5/10
Negative,"I make it easy and simple.. Do not buy this game unless you got an xbone controller. One of the worst ports ive seen in my life. All the tooltips are for xbone controllers, none for mouse/keyboard. game is poorly optimised for pc, and got lots of input lag. Not responsive at all imo. My biggest regret about buying this game, is that I didnt buy it on steam store, so i cant ask for a refund :/Edit: And dont even get me started on all the crashes.. I crashed probably more than I died the last 77 minutes"
Negative,"This game would be good if they fixxed the Multiplayer Experience and make it more worth playing. Me and two of my friends decided to play it and we got in to my mates world and instantly somone invaded our ""game"" and we could not beat him because he was to ""op"" for us to beat. So we allowed him to kill us and then went into a another world and got invaded again. Plz Stop invadeing and stop when you have to sign the floor in your world when you die. Just allow people to respawn in the world they are in with their Friends."
Negative,"This is the biggest garbage game ever created !!!My buddy and I were looking for a COOP game where we could play together and wanted to try DS3. But the alleged Coop is the biggest joke of all time!To be able to play together everyone has to have 2 items in the inventory that cost 3,000 souls.Only when both are activated can you join the world of another.The ridiculous thing, though, is that you get disconnected with EVERY DEATH and return to your own world. Because you  die in Dark Souls every 5 seconds !!! And then you have to spend so many souls again in the shop to reconnect. What the Hell?!?!And if you manage to live longer than two minutes, there are some Randoms in your Coop game that is NOT protected and PVP with you.Without a joke everyone can easily go into the game world of others without any problems and do PVP. You can NOT do anything about it. NOTHING!!!! Every time you just want to play in peace come professionals and kill you permanently. Thank you very much game....The developers thought come on let's create a game just to bully everyone!!!My friend and I just wanted to play a coop adventure. But Dark Souls is the biggest Bastard game of all time."
Negative,"Ever watch a youtube video on 0.5 speed? That is how this game runs. Wait until the framerate issues are fixed. I'm running it on a mid-tier computer on the lowest settings with all my drivers up to date. It keeps exiting me to the main menu because of frame rate issues. Also, everything is very confusing as it is all laid out in game like I am playing with an xbox controller... Wait for patches so the game is playable."
Negative,"Not that it's a bad game, but if you've played DS 1 or 2, this experience is largely redundant.  The formula feels pretty tired at this point, and there's nothing particularly new or inspired about DS 3's enemies or settings."
Negative,It SUCKS.  All tutorial messages are ONLY for the controller and not a real keybaord like PCs have.
Negative,"This game is so overhyped it's rediculous. Combat is boring and simple, story is meh, PvP sucks, and it's nowhere near as hard as people make it out to be. 2/10"
Negative,"Game crashed twice, and now softbanned for ten hours. 10/10 would wait ten hours to play"
Negative,"Stupidly difficult, for me it reduces the game to a repitition of content over and over and over... BORING... After 5 mins I remembered why I stopped playing DS1... bo ring... and the lazy port from console to keyboard... will leave a pc player wondering why they are being given playstation in game help... LAZY"
Negative,"TL;DR Don't buy this game it's awful. Play 1 and 2 over and over because they are actually good and worth your timeOh wow. So I finished the game based on DKS2 being a game I didn't enjoy until I did. Now that I beat this one, I can say that moment never came. This game was awful from start to finishThe soundtrack is horrible, the forced NPCs you need to interact with are awful (especially the one you literally can't kill for some reason). Everything about the level design is draining to play, ambushing is a fun little trick to pull every so often but it just gets tedious and irritating when basically every single item has an ambush, any corner you walk around... the fact I found more mimics that actual chests in the game says this more than I ever couldYou have no poise. Ever. Being knocked around by every single thing that hits you (except for when the game bugs out which is honestly hilarious) makes fast enemies a problem, and any other enemy not worth worrying about. Special shoutout to the hooded enemies the game reuses almost every other level that can stunlock you and are just as deadly as any of the armoured and equipped enemies, if not deadlierWeirdly the hitboxes are still broken but in favour of the player, unless walls are involved. Your weapon clinks on nearby walls and enemies not only ignore clink, but hit through walls completely. Balancing it out slightly,  later bossfights had a bunch of weird instances where an attack goes completely over your head for seemingly no reason. Which neatly moves on to the final nail in the coffin..This game is entirely RNG based in terms of which attacks the AI uses. Some can be manipulated into performing specific attacks, but otherwise which moves is randomThis is fine for some bosses, like Twin Princes where it hits hard but is somewhat learnable and avoidable due to it's similar attack timings with enough of a warning that a mixup is happening, and the P2 speedup is annoying but it's at least fairDancer of Boreal Valley, on the other hand... is winding up for an attack. You get a choice of rolling instantly, and dodging the quick slash (which is hard to do, also), or delaying the roll in order to avoid the uppercut slashes. If you guessed wrong, that's some damage you take. Add to that almost every hit is a multi hit combo, you'll probably lose your entire healthbar for a single slip up. This results in a lot of situations where you need to guess your way through a fight, given that if there are tells then maybe 40% of the time they are completely unreadable (I would have used Soul of Cinder as an example of a ton of mix ups and delayed rolls or death situations but it did seem to hold it's sword in slightly different ways before doing certain attacks so as long as you remembered which of it's million moves it was doing you could for the most part avoid it)So you might be thinking, ""Well this person beat the game, surely they figured out how to do it or they just cheated"". Well... no. Some victories I'm proud of, Abyss Watchers had a clutch parry in P2 and Twin Princes I think I did an ok job (although it weirdly doesn't deal much damage or punish Estus too hard so, idk. Not super proud of how much damage I took in it). Finishing at lvl78, I didn't stat block my way past the entire game (although for some reason I did stat block my way through Pontiff despite getting destroyed almost the entire fight it still didn't deal enough damage and I could kill the phantoms and deal heavy damage while they were being summoned, go figure). Didn't summon AI phantoms, played offline. So how did I do it? Luck.So I like to think I'm not a complete novice given I played a ton of 1 and 2 (which are vastly better games, go buy and play those instead the only is still mostly active especially on community days once the servers finally come back up (given these ones did it shouldn't be much longer now), but the only way I beat....Vordt, right at the start. Didn't do many close crush attacks, allowing sitting close to be viable and not massively punished. Maybe 10 tries or soCurse Rotted. Didn't perform many hand attacks if any. Took maybe 2 tries (this playthrough anyways, not knowing what to do was costly for my first character)Crystal Sage. Literally RNGs the position you need to run to (I think), but in the end didn't whip out the sword for too many attempts, because the sword was a hard knockdown and almost certain death if it RNGed into doing it. 3 TriesAbyss Watchers. One of the harder bosses for me as I have troubles dealing with multiple boss enemies. Harold helps out P1 and I mostly played ok in P2. Maybe 6-8 tries (but first playthrough took close to 30)Deacons, yeah. First try thankfully but did nearly die to curse because the game poorly explains what is going on. A real non event boss but I enjoyed that the fireball going through walls was supposed to be special when enemies had been hitting me through walls the entire timeWolnir. 2 tries, the first involved a lot of skeletons being summoned and swords showing up and vanishing and explosions. The second try RNGed into him doing none of those things, just swinging arms and dying fastDemon King. First try. Weirdly buggy hitboxes combined with plenty of healing for the occasional fireball attack that was hard to avoid meant staying inside it and hitting R1 over and over worked fine. Hollow victory given how bugged the fight seemingly wasPontiff. First try, but just statblocked to death, as mentioned early. Not even remotely satisfying given how badly I played the fightYhorm. Not a bossfight, a glorified QTE with a forced weapon (or an hour long fight that is incredibly boring, but given I spent maybe 5-10 minutes and got a 1/5th of it's health down before running out of healing supplies I just killed him with the stormruler. Two tries, one fun and the latter insanely boring and a free winAldrich. Two tries, I rolled a lot and didn't get punished. It was hard to tell what melee attack happens when but rolling when it felt right somehow got me through. Also it only did the arrow attack twice which definitely saved a lot on healing, given that it does as far as I can tell infinite damage if you end up in the centre of itDancer. First phase was chill, second was absurdly overpowered as mentioned early. RNGed into it not doing many uppercuts when I was in range of it. Maybe 12 triesDragonslayer Armour. Shield bash is faster, stronger, and so much more of a problem that the run where it didn't do many if any shield bashes was the one I got the kill on it. Wonder if there is a connection. Maybe 10 triesLothric, one of the only decent bosses. Although I failed one attempt because when the elder fell, the game glitched and teleported them both to the other side of the room meaning I couldn't hit the younger at all. WHile thematic, this isn't intentional. Maybe 8-12 tries, the runback for this fight was several minutes and incredibly tedious I lost track more than usualSoul of Cinder. The moveset it switches to is random, it has a spear set that instantly kills you, a pyromancy scimitar set that is challenging but fair, and a sorcery set that deals no damage, applies no pressure, and can last nearly the entirety of P1. Surprise surprise, my final attempt was one that swapped straight to sorcery and didn't even throw homing soulmass up during it feebly using arcane greatsword and it was so pathetic I traded hits with it, not even bothering to dodge them. Maybe 12 triesAll in all the game was just miserable. Bad level design made getting to bosses tiresome and dull, bad boss design made beating them empty and unfulfilling"
Negative,"This game is incomplete intentionally to make people struggle and give a fake sense of game length. no map to tell you where you are or have to go, no direction whatsoever. The game make you backtrack constantly to discover new part of the world you have to go but DOESN'T TELL YOU to backtrack... i have spend countless hours having to go watch video online and guide to figure out wtf im suppose to do after killing a boss as the game tell you nothing. I am struggling with this game not with the fight mechanic, not with boss, no just with figuring out WTF im suppose to go. game has glitch and bug never fixed, had twice my quick attack completely stop working, pressing the quick attack button did nothing until i reloaded the game. Other well known issue if you kill a boss the boss attack like spells or arrow cast before the boss died might kill you after you killed the boss, but than you get teleport somewhere and than back to where you were and than you die, going back to where you died all your souls are gone, cause the game decided to put your soul where you teleported to even if you have NO IDEA where that was since the game doesn't tell you. In the end its a frustrating piece of shit of a game, i played it yes, not sure yet if i manage to get through that were is waldo game to find where to go. O yeah other stupid thing about this game, dont bother picking any weapon or armour you find in the whole game as they are pointless, your starting gear might be the beat gear you will find until the end of the game, like seriously wtf, put cosmetic if thats what you guys had in mind...."
Negative,"Game is alright from what I've seen so far, but the port to PC is HORRIBLE!! Controls are trash. I am very glad that I picked this up on sale for less than 20 $ because I would never pay more than that for this kind of crappy port. I thought DS3 was made by a professional development team??"
Negative,"The dev's have no concept of what makes a game fun. The multiplayer is complete trash. What could have been a legitimately fun coop game, with a difficult curve, is instead reduced to only being fun on single player because of the amount of invades. The bony finger doesn't even work well, using it just give you a double invade with no extra allies. Dark Souls 1 was fun. I have tried, I have really tried to play this game. At no point have I had fun. I've been invaded nonstop by anencephalic mongoloids who's twisted idea of fun prevents them from seeing the light of day. Let me opt out of PVP for the love of God you trash devs."
Negative,"Game has been broken since April and developers refuse to fix it, instead continuing to release new content that is even more broken than old content. It is plagued by constant freezes, crashes, and FPS problems. You will die more often to the game freezing for 15 seconds than to a mistake of your own.*edit*These issues appear to be related to the Xbox One Controller driver. Dark Souls 3 doesn't appear to be very compatible with it. If I unplug the controller, the freezes stop./sigh"
Negative,"With the final game in the dark souls trilogy, does this game end with a bang or a whimper?  Neither, it ends with a massive middle finger to players of this beloved franchise.As a player for the last two Dark Souls, I was curious as to how this series would end and ready to get into the challenging difficulty that we all know and love.  Unfortunately, Dark Souls 3 (DS3), is a mess of poor game-play mechanics and a story that lacked the intrigued or urgency of the past games.Story:Players take the roll of the Ashen One during the end of days as the fire has burned out and the kings who were meant to keep the fire going have abandoned their post.  Now it is up to you to bring them back and determine the fate of the world.  My problem with this story is it boils down to a fetch-quest.  Essentially, all your employees called off sick or ""Ferris Bueller'ed"" the day off and you need to go get them.  While, the game still keeps its vague story telling I never took the time to read any of the item descriptions because the story was never engaging.  This is made even worst with a world design, (that while beautiful and haunting at the same time), was devoid of any life or anything exciting to keep me going.  I did not feel inspired to go on as the stakes or urgency is poorly established, that the carrot does not match the stick.Game-play:The game-play is hands down the biggest problem with this game and can be summed up in two words ""unplayable"" and ""unbalanced"".  The issue with the game-play is that there are two dichotomous styles that are completing with each other that make the experience a mess.  On one side of the coin, the game is faster with enemies being more aggressive, attacking in groups, and being frenetic.  On the other, the traditional Dark Souls experience of taking your time, watching the stamina bar and timing your attacks.    The problem this creates is poor balancing, were enemies can attack with impunity but you as the player are still confined to outdated mechanics that do not implement well with this new system.  If the game is designed to be faster and reflex orientated then the player needs to be part of the equation.  It's like playing resident evil 4, where enemies can run around and do what they do best, but you are confined to tank-controls.  IT DOES NOT WORK.Final Thoughts:I was really hoping that this game would be a memorable experience, but sadly, I am massively disappointed.  Bad game-play design and a story so devoid of life and interest, that I cannot recommend this game to anyone."
Negative,"I have never felt so angry after buying a game. The theme of the game is YOU DIED now try again. I hadn't played any Dark Souls before buying this.  I had read that the Dark Souls series were amazing games, if a bit tricky for beginners.  Dark Souls 3 was reviewed online as having the best 'onboarding' process for DS noobs like me. And despite all of this, the game still has unintuitive controls, there is no explanation of combos or targeting. I spent as much time reading up online about what was going on and how to control the character as I did playing the game. I still don't understand half of what was happening and  Bandai Namco (which is Japanese for 'Useless Developer') should have done a better job of explaining this.I just can't understand what other people enjoy about this game. It is not fun.  You eventually defeat the first guy after hours of playing and multiple deaths, but that's it. You go through the exact same process with the next boss who kills you in frustrating ways. That's it. That's 'the game.' In fact, the main game mechanic is a rolling simulator. When your character rolls around the map, they are temporarily invincible for a few frames. So you end up rolling around mobs, watching your stamina gauge to make sure you don't run out and inevitably dying a lot. If you save the game by resting at a campfire, you lose all the souls you collected.WHAT A WASTE OF EVERYONE'S TIME.I have never hated a game so much in all my life. The developers should be fired and blacklisted from ever working in the industry again.I got a  refund on this game and yet 24 hours later I am still INCANDESCENT WITH RAGE about the time I wasted with it. I hope Bandai Namco go bust."
Negative,"They are asking for $60 for a shitty port. Everything is still in the console language. If i pay for a PC game i expect a PC game, not a console game."
Negative,i played it for 76 hours i'm gonna keep playing it and it regret buying it
Negative,"good graphics, good atmosphere yeah. die die die die die alot, actually thats not a problem, you get used to it, but the game is just empty for me, is like i just go killing mobs and bosses, but i dont see anything else than that, actually is pretty repetitive, and the history is not being told you just have theories all over. The Stat system is PRETTY BAD, i mean when you read the stats and the description of every one of them, most of them doesnt make any sense, and you dont know why they are separated and you need both is pretty restricted and there is no def stat so is all about roll...was money wasted for me, maybe others would enjoy but, if you get what im saying and you expect same as me, you wouldnt want it"
Negative,"The game is really special. I play on pc, but the game is hardly relying to be played with controller.All menus refer to controller buttons and seems you can't switch the displayed buttons to mouse + keyboard equivalents.Okay.. so I switched to xbox controller to do this game a favor, because with keyboard it was really hard to play the game at all.What you may not expect.. if you clear a room of enemies and go back to heal yourself, the room is full of enemies again.I was told that's specific for this game. Okay.. not as I expected but okay..Until now I would say okay everything still cool.. This game is not for everyone.But what really grinds my gears:The tutorial tells you once the basics like block, attack and moving. But there is no hint so far about attributes.So you got a lot of options to adapt things, but have to google everything from the experts or you do something which you're not sure about what's the result.Better play a demo or be prepared to keep the refund time limit of 2h after buying if you're considering to buy this game."
Negative,30$ for game 7 year old at a discount 🗣 🗣 🗣
Negative,i bought dark souls as a way to try a harder based game what isnt stated is the port over from console to pc is a load of crap so bassically you spen £15 on a game that is half functioning for pc players. this game would be nice if it had a pre warning saying that controllers are a must but there is no such thing which has forced me to ake a refund as i dont have a controllerP.S pretty pissed off lmao
Negative,"My favorite DS game by far for the combat mechanics. Put a lot of hours in and even recommend it .But I can't recommend the game in the multiplayer state it's in. 50% of this game is PVP and 1 in 4 players are using hacks for invincibility or maxing stats and no clipping/super speed. There's just no point. It's they didn't even try, they're practically inviting it. Play offline or play a different game."
Negative,"NOT WORTH ITNot at all.This game may be good for consoles but has no use on the PC. Because of that it is 0/5 for me.All of the gaming experiance, all the fun I could get is RUINED BY THIS POINTLESS STEERING!!!Every 1 of 5 deaths in this game is due to the fact, that it is a difficult game but all the others happen because of this crappy steering.It shouldn't go out on PC - it should have stayed on the consoles."
Negative,"Hell, I'm sure this is a fantastic game, however I can play it for about 5 minutes before it crashes.Solutions like wearing a full helmet or playing as a knight not only don't work but are ridiculous. Turning lighting down to low also doesn't work.Absolute waste."
Negative,Just play 2 lol
Negative,(Comprehensive review in comments) Unpolished game rushed for release.
Negative,Parry king. U wot m8?
Negative,"Terrible port for the PC, and steep system demands. No advance is possible until you win a very difficult fight; be prepared to die over and over."
Negative,do you want this game because of pvp? do you want to win? well be as boring as you can because the game wants you to be as boring as you can´aka spam like fuck
Negative,"bought this game on launch under the assumtion that I could run it, as I can run DS2 on full with no slowdown.immediatly dropped to 0 FPS anytime I turned so it could load the 90 miles of map its draw distance tried to load. tried to see if I could reduce the draw distance. nope. waited for a patch to fix its issues. nope.you have lost my bussiness From Soft"
Negative,"I have heard a lot about this game, but honestly I don't see it. All that I have experienced is a difficult difficulty, I cant see any story, I think your character is just doing everything for the heck of it and if he isnt, then its just really really terribly explained. Honestly, there isnt anything in this game but difficulty and I wouldn't know why anyone would put themselves through this frustrating experience"
Negative,"Tried the PC version of this one out and found it really confusing to play. I would surmise this stems from it being primarily a console game that was ported over to a PC.Sadly this porting did not include properly labelling the controls so it is usable with the keyboard & mouse usually found in the PC world. I'm sure if you are using a consoile along with dedicated controlers this would be a fun and engaging game to play. But for PC players, you will need to figure out for yourselves how the controls are supposed to work.For my own part I found the game unplayable and returned it for refund after about an hour of trying to get the darned thing to work. If the game were dirt cheap, I could excuse this lack but not for what this game costs,Not revcommended for PC players unless you have large amounts of time trying to decypher the controls."
Negative,"Great game. Devs filled it with garbage traps to ruin your day. PVP is supposed to be this ""legit hardcore pro gamer shit"" yet most invaders play like lame p*ssies and have terrible internet. Even the ones with good internet get plenty of free hits from lag. Losing even a minute of my time to a loser with terrible internet is fucking stupid. Let alone losing god knows how many souls, embers, and my sanity. High ping players should not be able to fucking invade, you dumb devs. This is the most basic rule of matchmaking there is."
Negative,"so after further playthrough i have to make a new review...its the dark souls we know but just like fallout4 it was dumbed down for the masses. For instance we teleport and are to stupid to find mulitple paths and explore, its cookie cutter go here and there and oh you wanna explore ""GIT GUD"" very sad but about my decision but imo this is the weakest souls of them all...ya its dark souls but its not, hate to say it but i dont reccomend maybe im an elitist but its a no for me if you want to stay true to dark souls and lore/exploration. Wait for dark souks one remastered coming in march!!! Praise the fun for thtat not this sorry excuse for the souls we deserve."
Negative,"Don't buy if you don't have a controlleralright, so i'm sure I'll get lots of 'git gud' bullshit comments on this but who cares.this game is the worst Port I've ver played. I'm sure it's a great game once you actually get to play it but with mouse and keyboard you just can't do half the stuff you're supposed to simply cus the combinations don't work like they do with a controller.I got this game in a bundle for 12 bucks or so and even then I'd say it's too much for such a badly ported game.again, I'm sure it's a great game when played as it's intended to but  that aside, this game should've never been released on pc in its current state. if any other game was released in this state it would have drowned in the shitstorm that'd have washed over it by people calling it a 'useless f-ing port' or 'worst port in history'. the only thing that keeps this game from enduring such a shitstorm is the massive fanbase.so again, got a controller? go for it and buy it, you'll have loads of fun. don't have a controller? don't even bother, not worth the money."
Negative,Why is everything so ugly
Negative,metalgear rising is better
Negative,Just play the first game
Negative,"- FoV way too low.- 60 FPS lock.- Have to aim attacks or blocks with keyboard if not locked on target. Will they one day understand that the mouse is for aiming? Allow me to controls my character like it's target locked toward the direction of the camera.- Camera doesn't follow you around properly. It always lag and it turn by itself on walls, sometimes preventing you from looking behind you while running. I'm not talking about the wall recovery option.- Target lock drop too easily and sometimes it doesn't want to lock-on at all.- Monsters wiggle around way too much like it's a cartoon. It also cause your camera to wiggle around when locked on because it follow all their movements.- Monsters tend to spam too much attacks leaving little openings, all with insane speed and tracking. In the end, you have to cheese the bad AI with range or just run past them, it's like they weren't intended to be fought, it's like they were balanced for the power gamers that always find ways to cheese the AI so they made them without an intended way to be defeated.- Dodge roll feel less responsive than in DS1. In DS1, if you are locked on a target and you want to dodge left or right, it will happen as soon as you press down the button. In DS3, you have to fully depress the button always, so more delay. It's more spamable but it has too much delay, not only monsters are fast but you have to dodge roll 200-300ms in advance. On top of that the whole game abuse delayed windup attacks so good luck getting the timing on every monsters and each of their attacks. If they start an animation and you don't dodge right away, you get hit by a fast attack. If you dodge right away, they do a delayed attack and catch you at the end of your dodge roll. The fast attack is too fast so you don't have time to see if it's a slow or a fast one. So the game fucks you over and over and over.- Sometimes monsters fallback too far after getting hit so you can't properly combo them.- When locked-on target, the camera will be too low, too close to parallel to the ground, combined with the low FoV makes it hard to judge distances. - Can't run or dodge while controlling the camera with a controller. I think it would have been better to use R1 for dodge/run and circle for light attacks. I could always rebind it but maybe the devs should have thought the default controls better.- No cloud saves.- Parry is almost useless. Most attacks are too fast or not parryable, it's simply too risky and not worth it. It's only useful in a few instances.- NPC invaders: Pure cancer. I play offline, but I'd rather fight human players than these cheating fucks that have way more hp, infinite mana, sometimes auto parry, perfect aim, timing, distance judging. I know of ways to cheese them but not every characters can do that.Many problems are there in all DS games and they have learned nothing."
Negative,don't get it
Negative,it's not dark souls 2
Negative,"Do not buy this game until From Soft patch the RESOLUTION BUG!!! Absolutrely broken game stuck at 800x400 resolution so it's a tiny box in top left corner. Config File and ingame settings both at 1920x1080 and ""fullscreen"". Yea...right load of bull.I can't even play the f-ing game because of this. Ryzen 5 1600 @ 3.9GHz & GTX 1080ti + 16GB 3000MHz RAM. Game should run on max settings. Fix your damn game From Soft"
Negative,"If you like constantly getting invaded by a lot of hackers, this is the game for you!"
Negative,"I dislike it. Stupid, no way to choose some diffivulty, no map, no guidance for begginer. Another stupidity that game posibly came from play station as it still refers to controler"
Negative,"I would love to like the game, but it crashes constantly."
Negative,"Out of DS1/DS2/DS3/Bloodborne, I liked Dark Souls 3 the most. Still, I wouldn't recommend this game to most players, But the 3rd edition makes it barely enjoyable for regular people. Not Lords of the Fallen level enjoyable, but still.Pros:+ Level design - absolutely gorgeous+ Variety of bosses+ Weapons feel funCons:- Doesn't conclude the story in any way- Heavy armor is broken, adds something like 10% resistance on top of medium, with 200% weight- Final boss of the DLC is some random dude not related to anything"
Negative,"Well after a year or so of debate I finally decided (against my better judgement) to go ahead and give Dark Souls III a try. I sadly wish I hadn't. I know that the fan base for this game is super strong, and I am in no way downing anyone for enjoying this franshise... It's just not for me. No, it's not the so called ""super hard difficulty"" that Dark Souls supposedly has that gives me a bitter taste. Although the game is fairly difficult, it's not anything that would put me off. It's the whole tone of the game that putts me off. The enimies are dull and boring. The enviornment is super dull and boring. The voice overs are dull and boring. The whole game is duill and boring. The enviornment is nothing but gloomy browns, grays and the occasional washed out forrest green patch of grass (i think I saw a couple patches of grass). The saddnes of the enviornment is to much for me to habdle. Everything in the game looked the same to me. So much so that I didn't have the urge to even want to go exploring or take the occasional long look at my surroundings that I usually do when playing games. The voice overs made it even worse. The NPCs that I encountered all talked with a S-L-O-W lull that made me want to commit sucide. Every sentence and word is drawn out to give the impression of seriousness. I usually love NPC encounters because they add a good sense of immersion, but in this game I couldn't wait for them to shut up. As for the combat. It to is super boring. Thankfully I bought this game on sale so not being able to return it doesn't bother me. When it comes to reviews it all boils down to what each individual likes. Everyone is different so do not base your judgement of the game on my behalf. It's just not for me. Please do not judge me for basing my opinion on my 2 hours of game time. I actually knew I hated the game within the first 10 minutes of playing it, but I decided to give it a chance because of the high praise this game gets. Yes I can decide if I like a game or not withing the first 10 minutes of a game. I know I can because every time I have gone against my better judgement and played past the ten minute mark I have regretted it. This is the last time I will go against my feelings. If I don't like a game within the first 10 minutes I am gonna return it."
Negative,"This was my first playthrough of a souls game. I feel like I started this game completely unbiased. Everyone kept recommending it to me so I thought I would beat the game to fully experience the game. I had always heard dark souls III was the best of the souls games (with Elden Ring being a possible contender for that title).I'm fairly certain I had a pretty normal experience with the game. I started as a knight, died to Ludex Gundyr a couple of times, beat the rotted greatwood, got lost a ton, died to ambush, fought the optional demon on the wall, etc... It took me a while to realize the MASSIVE advantage of occasionally using archery and sorcery.The stray demon on the wall was my favorite boss, but Soul of Cinder was EPIC. Very, very cool boss fight. Pontiff and Dancer were pretty cool too.Pros:- Nice graphics- A couple of AMAZING boss fights- Challenging (sooo satisfying when you win a tough fight)Cons:- The story sucks (I googled it after beating the game. It could be cool, it's just way too vague. Not my style)- The game is buggy (encountered 3 MAJOR bugs on my first playthrough)- Music is meh...- Most of the boss fights are meh... (predictable combat and most bosses have some type of gimmick or cheese. Not full and satisfying like I would've hoped EXCEPT for the Soul of Cinder - that fight was EPIC!!)In short, the game is challenging, but it feels unpolished. Lots of potential that simply was not reached. I think most people post high reviews cause everyone else is doing the same thing.Don't get me wrong! I enjoyed my first (and only) playthrough. It just feels unpolished and overall meh...It's unlikely I will recommend this game to anyone. It's unlikely I'll play another souls game. It has a lot of potential that it simply didn't reach. I'm disappointed for sure."
Negative,"This is dog shit compared to Nioh. You don't feel the impact when you hit enemies in DS3. When you run it feels like he's still walking. It feels like i have no control over the character like hes walking on air. When you roll it feels like a wall is blocking the way. They need to polish this game. GOW is way better than this, they're pissing in DS3's mouth. Maybe back when DS3 first came out it was the shit but compared to Witcher 3, Nioh, GOW this is dog shit. I'm even ashamed to get a refund from steam."
Negative,annoying camera making it unplayable
Negative,its too hard plz make easy
Negative,"if you willingly want to get brain tumor, aids, covid, ebola, herpes and lose your will to live then this is the game for you. obviously if you are masochist then go ahead."
Negative,Bad for your health. Bad for your social relation. It's like smoking. Exactly. Like smoking.Dark Souls kills.BTW the easiest of the 3 souls. And the one with the less charisma and originality.
Negative,"They didn't make any changes this time around. Its a blend between all the souls games so far, but almost none of the improvements from Dark Souls II.I recommend this game to only die hard fans when it is on sale."
Negative,"Lousy console port in my humble (unpopular?) opinion - the game had great potential, but there are some things that ruin it for me, like the fact that I cannot fix my camera (its always moving, and not intuitively)I appreciate higher difficulty, but it were nice if it only came from the game being difficult."
Negative,"So, i loved the crap out of Hollow knight, and got really excited when people started telling me the dark souls series heavily inspired the gameplay of HK. I was even more interested to hear that Dark Souls itself was inspired significantly by Berserk, my all time favorite series for over 20 years. Sadly, i was pretty disappointed. Where hollow knight had a beautiful and mysterious world to explore, i felt like every inch of ground in DS3 took a rediculous amount of effort. while i got through the learning curve for the first boss within a reasonable amount of time, as i began my foray into the larger world the gameplay slowed to a crawl, with the entirety of the emphasis shifting to mastering difficult combat maneuvers rather than exploration with intervals of combat. as for thematic similarities to berserk? i didnt see any in my run.ultimately after 4 or so hours, i just got totally bored. there wasnt much of a storyline to connect to (not actually that different from hollow knight) but since there was so much combat and i really had nothing to fight for, i wasnt invested at all. after losing my carefully saved souls for the umteenth time to a surprise assault from yet another hidden enemy, i called it a night. Personally, i found the grind of RPGs to be the most boring part of the process, But!!! if you think that repeatedly killing the same enemies over and over again to power yourself up until you can kill another set of slightly more powerful enemies sounds really appealing, and you like your combat paced so fast that strategy rarely helps, give this a shot. for me, though, nah."
Negative,"Just like most games FromSoftware this game is just dark souls remastered but somehow worse in every way possible. main problems being trash story that makes no sense, clunky ass mechanics and some of the worst level design of any souls game i have ever played. i really had high hopes for this games considering how much of a masterpiece dark souls 2. 1/10 go spend your money somewhere else."
Negative,"Seems like a nice game, but the coop is a freakin bad joke, never experienced such a fuckin bloody terrible coop mode in any game. And this game is released in 2016? and is an AAA like title? Really? Coop is absolutely no fun, i just bought the game with a friend to play this game in coop mode, i dont want this game anymore now. thanks for nothing really bad information why does this shit receive a coop tag at all? disgusting. The game seems good other than that but i dont care about single player."
Negative,"Pros: This is the best looking game of the Dark Souls trilogy.Cons: They took the worst aspects from DS1 and DS2, combined them together, and then triple downed on all those aspects.DS1: Levels can be a bit confusing at times.  Progression can be unclear.  DS3: Whoever designed the DLC maps should be taken outside and shot.DS2: Having three enemies gank you out of nowhere all the time gets a bit repetitive and feels like artificial difficulty.  DS3:  Let's just have 5 to 10 enemies gank you instead.DS2: Certain bosses have a tendency to leap back way out of your range as soon as they finish a combo.  That's not dynamic or anything, it's just cheap difficulty where your punish window doesn't exist.  DS3: Let's just have EVERY ENEMY IN THE GAME DO THAT, BUT HAVE EVEN LONGER AND FASTER BURST COMBOS.The graphics of this game are the only good aspect of it.  Every other aspect of gameplay is outshined by DS1 and DS2.  It's pure artificial difficulty.  At least it's short for speedrunners, I guess?"
Negative,very much a one and done game if you have seen a full lets play than there is no point to buy the game. ;)
Negative,I bought this game for 1999 but realized that this game is a complete shit and now I can not return the money fuck need such games
Negative,"well, i have spent some time on this game and as it could be grate it is just a poor console port for a lot of money. even symbols displayed when action is required is from xbox. guys it is a shame."
Negative,"trahs game. easy game made ""hard"" through dogshti map design and disgustingly horrendous QoL. Don't."
Negative,This game fucking sucks
Negative,its hard only buy if you are olone with lots of time in ur hands
Negative,I was so excited when i bought the game but when i entered i could not do anything about the fact that i had a mouse and keyboard and the game thought i had a controller so i could not do anything about it i litterally can not play the game because of this i had enogh of it fuck this game
Negative,If the devs of the game are to lazy to change tutorials to apply to people using keyboard and mouse then im to lazy to play honestly having to open up the settings tab just to see the keybindings every single time is really bad. I wish i didnt waste my money on this game... not recommended
Negative,roblox is better lol
Negative,Lost my character and chant get it back...I just wanted to play the DLC not the entire game over again.

Negative,Shrine waifu doesn't kick her feet anymore. 0/10
Negative,"Community ruins the game.Play offline, or dont play at all"
Negative,"On the outside, Dark Souls 3 is an RPG about knights, sorcery and medieval fantasy, but it's really a Naruto ninja game about dodging, iframes and lighting fast enemies, regardless the size or strenght.And what's the problem with PVE coop these days? everywhere is just PVP arenas, even when you're at low level.Why did they remove small sign soapstone? Why no bonfire ascetics? and two-handed parry? So many drawbacks from DS2...That FP bar system is horribly implemented. At a first glance it looks cool to be able to refill your magic usage without itens, but then you realize the only way to do so is by alloting an Estus to FP, which makes the whole system more limited than the previous where you could buy and stock itens to replinish magic.It's a beautiful game, but far from flawless. I wish people could just look through the fanservice."
Negative,cant play with friends. dumb game and gets boring
Negative,"This garbage is unplayable due to insanely bad porting.  Horrible GUI + MK controls, disgusting camera handling and view angle; getting headache playing more than 1 hour.The PC port is a total money grab, no effort whatsoever went into it, I spit on the people involved in quite frankly destroying what's probably a great game somewhere."
Negative,"This game runs like total garbage. Dont purchase until they fix this. My rig is more than enough to run this, and it runs like total dick nuggets and both my cpu and gpu are colder than my ex's tits. This is a shitty port. Avert your eyes and spend money elsewhere young ones. Will refund if it doesnt get fixed in next patch, and wont purchase until on sale for <10 dollars."
Negative,"The controls are really wonky, for example you can't seem to navigate menus with a controller, just the mouse, and apparently none of the buttons on my controller would activate lockon. Dodging had a short delay between pressing the button and actually rolling, but that might be the lag. Also, it was so laggy that it's basically unplayable, i was getting like 20 FPS on the absolute lowest settings.And then there's the fact that apparently it's too hard for a million-dollar company to make the controls show up as anything other than the xbox ones, even when you don't have a controller. Seriously, the tutorial only has the default xbox controls in it so if you want to use keyboard and mouse you have to look those up manually.I literally had to use the mouse for some menu options, like selecting things, and the controller for other things, like going back. You can't even pause the game, bringing up the menu just keeps everything going which is a horrible design flaw, especially in a game like this.I haven't played much of it, but it looked really cool in the videos i watched. Hopefully i'll be able to find a way to get it to work without having to return it.my computer stuff:intel(r) core(tm) i5-4590S cpu 3.00GHZ8GB ram64bit operating system"
Negative,"Cheap game design. Bosses are invulrenable, they have wide area of attacks which you can't avoid. Camera movement is trash.Bad, bad game. Avoid like the plague."
Negative,"worthless game. unfair, too much farming. slow response bad key controlls. Enemy's too hard and gang upon you. you cannot flee and lose all souls everytime. The only good points are that Its addicting and the graphics are beautifull."
Negative,"I've and an hour and a half just trying to kill the first boss, I know im new to the series but do they have to make it so diffcult!?! Its pratcially impossible for newcomers to even pass the first level. It's impossible to figure out any type of skill naturally because either the enemies are just one hit kills or they gang up on you and kill you in less than two seconds. AND THEN THERES THE FIRST BOSS, how the heck am I suposed to figure out how to kill him if this is my first boss battle and he kills me in less than a min, I try to roll and use my shield but  he just spins around and one taps me to death wtf!"
Negative,"on its own, its a poor value game. Most who likes this style of gameplay are those who came prior from ds1 and 2 (such as me). If this is your very FIRST foray into the series, begin with DS 2. Only then will you know if ds3 fits you."
Negative,"Ok I need some help here, I start the game, my screen goes white, then black and then only the top corner of My screen has the game showing, I tried changing My screen ratio, it would pause then revert back to the way it was, I tried going from full screen to windowed mode and it would pause then revert back to ""full screen"" with only the top left corner of the screen showing. What is going on? I want to play this game I really do but it isn't working"
Negative,Can't recommend it as a co-op game since you will get invaded by multiple people for 75% of the game with a system that punishes the player doing co-op by halving his estus and leaves the invader with literally no punishment except deathAs a singleplayer experience it's probably the second best one thoughEDIT : I forgot to add that most invaders will be at least 30 levels above you since this game features no skill matchmaking system whatsoever
Negative,"Those with an ultra-wide panel look elsewhere. From Software doesn't care to implement 21:9 and the game is locked to 60 FPS. If you manage to get the unofficial fix working you risk being banned. I couldn't even get it to work (1080 Ti, 425.11).

Negative,jank disguised as difficulty
Negative,This game is really shitty 0/10
Negative,"terrible on pc, awful controls/hitboxes, movement highly inhibited by no joystick. either have a controller or skip this one"
Negative,On top of the 60 hz lock the gameplay is very sluggish. I cant believe I wasted money on this crappy port of a crappy game.
Negative,2 ez bby. Anyone who disagrees with me is not a god of video games like me
Negative,"Not fully optimized for pc especially in tutorials. You can only find commands that work for PS4 and need to figure out corresponding commands in PC.Further, the combat system is stupid. Fall back command cannot cancel attack command even if attack command hasn’t taken effect. This can be resolved by setting different command priority but obviously the vendor didn’t do that.Last is about camera. Different vertical angle would give different horizontal sensitivity, which is horrible especially when boss suddenly gets out of your sight."
Negative,"The game is a terrible PC port. Character faces random directions from time to time and the combat lock on sometimes causes more problems than it solves. Bonfires are in clusters and each cluster is 2km apart which means you have to run through more or less the whole level every time you die. Souls, the game's currency which you use to level up and purchase items is lost on death. This might often result in either having to grind, or watch as hours of work dissapear because you got distracted for a second."
Negative,"Terrible game. thats it.After beating Sekiro, which was my first soulslike ever, I Have decided to give a chance to other souls games. I was never conviced to souls games just by looking at some gameplays, cause it seemed to have wooden gameplay, wierd combats, stupid rolls etc. My fears were confirmed after trying DS3.Controlls are horror, i cannot understand how this game is rated so good with those controls. Everything feels delayed. Rolls are stupid as hell mechanic. If you press roll button 2 times (very fast), then seems like second roll is queued and it exctually executes LOL. Something is definitely wrong in this game if it comes to registering buttons.Not to mention camera but seems like its problem of every single fromsoftware game.And most stupid of all negative things that I have encountered is that roll is on button RELEASE. Who the hell projected this horror thing like that? Also no keyboard + mouse support (I can play with them, but I still see xbox controller buttons ...)Go play Sekiro instead where combat is actually responsive."
Negative,"bad bosses, terrible scaling, reused assets in an uncreative way. dont waste your money like i did"
Negative,No support for UltraWide monitors .. 21:9
Negative,Literally worst souls game in the franchise just play 2 instead its waaaay better
Negative,Worst one in the souls series
Negative,Pfft... Who needs optimisation?
Negative,"This game looks great, and has some interesting opening cinematics....however, the control scheme sucks and bad camera angles make this game unplayable for me."
Negative,"I thought this was decent up until Anor Londo. The silver knight archers were a bad reminder of the worst part of DS1, then I finally got to the most RNG dependent BS arrow spewing no fun turd that is Aldrich and uninstalled this POS."
Negative,"Bad PC PORT. Okay graphics. Im sure it would have been a great game but I just cant do it. I refuse to be disrespected in a way where I have to stress myself out to enjoy this game. I dont want to go on google, or steam forums. I want to hop in and play but IT FORCES YOU! To use controller almost.M+KB is my preferred way to play on ALL platforms other than fighting games. Have respect for my platform because it wasn't easy getting here."
Negative,"So... I dislike Dark Souls III on PC, let's just get that straight. Here's a a 15 second 4chan story to represent my distaste. >Haven't played since August>Decided to give it a try in November>Immediately goes to Invade as usual>Finds the Host and start fighting>Host heals and runs away from me>Two Darkmoons get summoned>One of 'em is an Invincible hacker>They swarm me>Kill me>Get pointed down on>U N I N S T A L L"
Negative,"Like so many others I had stayed away from the DS series, due to reports of impossible fights and milisecond timing required to win any even moderately tough fights.  I'd proven this to be true by picking up DS1 for like $5 on special and never getting past the first boss.After many reports that DS3 wasn't like the other DS games, and the purists actually heavily criticising it for being 'easy' I thought, why not when I saw it on special give it a go.  Well 3hrs in, I've tried 2 classes and got almost no where.  At least the first ice monster you find in what is practically the training area is optional, and the first boss isn't actually tooo bad, wiht a ranged class anyway.  but beyond that...  it's just learning timings and button presses.For my money, there are way better options but if you're a masochist and where that guy in the arcades who just had to put another quarter in to try that level one more time this could be the game for you.  For the rest of us... play something else."
Negative,"no mask of the father, shit game."
Negative,More like Mid Souls.
Negative,If anything they should make Dark Souls III More expensive so nobody ever has to play it.
Negative,I played enough to understand that this game is all about luck.I can't feel any pride from beating a boss cause I know there is no skills involved in this game.
Negative,This game blows.
Negative,"Beautiful, wonderful, groundbreaking. It doesn't work at all on steam, none of the DS games are worth buying on this platform please do yourself a favor and buy it on console. Unplayable due to performance issues, not a pc problem."
Negative,even if it was free id ask for a refund ab·so·lute·ly terrible and god awful just buy a ea game sense they at least put work into their games such as basketball 2000-2022 (not clones trust me) or better yet touch [ɡras]
Negative,"This game is just not fun. The biggest offense: the developers forgot games are about clear rules and feedback, which this game breaks all the time. Bad camera angles, boss fights that feel too zoomed in, boss attacks that have the same graphic but do different attacks preventing you from planning, and mobs that do delayed attacks: Dodge too soon and the delayed attack will hit you, don't dodge and wait to see if its a delayed attack, and you'll get hit by the fast almost instantaneous attack.Also, your character moves like the DS1 character, but pretty much all enemies are fast, spammy, rotate around themselves quickly, and the game forces you to often wait for them to do finish their spam animations before you get some hits in, unless you invest heavily in shield + a long range weapon, so you can be a little more offensive. Also, many enemies have grab attacks, forcing you to again, wait wait wait until the right situation to attack.Some enemies just strafe dodge so fast, your character often can't keep them in your sights while also fighting something else, and the often narrow corridors and fighting spots of the game will just create a mess of a situation where again, all feedback of what you are actually doing is lost.Finally, if you just want to grab a weapon and enjoy fighting an enemy, what DS should be about, intestead you'll be thrown at an ambush at every single time you were about to enjoy a fight.All in all, a mess of spammy attacks, lack of feedback and fights that boil down to patience, not skill.This game is a broken mess all around, gameplay wise and programming wise (you'll get enough situations where enemies kill you through walls)----------------------Update to the review a few months later :kinzo:I gave the game another shot, and have just beaten it. To everyone who was not having any fun like myself, to remedy that the answer is to try to be as spammy as the enemies. Pick the most spammy weapons in the game that work for you, and the fights become more interesting, without requiring you to wait before attacks.As for myself, I went with great combustion, a 100% physical shield. That alone is what saved the game for me, as it does very high damage and does not leave you lingering after attacks, allowing you to quickly approach an enemy through a good angle with your shield raised, dodge, block or evade the first attack, and then commence great combustion spamming him, and quickly dodging away if needed. I've also when not casting spells, used weapons such as the Corvian Greatknife (VERY spammy special attack that even hits through shields), tried also the spiked mace dropped by the fat witches. So to fight the annoying enemies I became an avatar of spam myself, even spammier than they were.So if you dislike how fast all enemies are while your character is slow and clunky, try to find the few weapons and skills that will let you just run up to stuff and kill them, no matter what it is, as long as you position yourself right at the beginning.Later, I decided to try PvP, which I have gotten a bit proficient at it and could win a good number of fights. I quickly learned ALL SPELLS SUCK FOR PVP, and you can pretty much only pvp reliably with your weapons - not only that, only with a few types of weapons that work for it. Straight swords for instance, which are spammy with long range (and can battle lag) are amongst the most used. Spells in pvp are mostly to force other characters to roll and move around, rather than to constantly damage them.But, much like PvE, to be a spam god is optimal for pvp. Weapons that slash fast and almost instantaneously, or that can combo quickly will be very helpful. But of course, for those that don't understand how the internet works (which may include from software), the spammier and faster things are, the more no coding is capable of making lag go away. There is something called PING, which is the time that takes from information to travel from your home to someone else, and then get sent back to you, and no amount of good internet can make that truly great, and the worst thing against ping are spammy, continuous combos of attacks, or weapons that attack too swiftly - which is what dark souls 3 is all about. The pvp suffers greatly from this, because weapon movement and combo is just faster than ping speeds usually, and you'll have to learn that pretty distant ghost hits must be always taken in account. Dodge even if you think it wouldn't hit, or you'll often get hit.And finally, after having played the game entirely, how atrociously bad the camera became more than evident. It has to be one of the worst cameras I have ever seen in a video game - for example, whenever you lock on someone and attack them, the camera starts looking down, rather than keep yourself straight, and all you can see is who you are fighting up close and the ground, and none of your surroundings. This makes it awful or play impossible sometimes for pve as well as pvp against multiple opponents. There are many, many other issues with the camera. Some fights like the old demon are infamous for how impossible it feels to fight it at close range, due to the camera. You can't even properly see the boss attacks as they come from off-camera, something that is a common theme around this game.Feedback as I was sensing from my first playthroughts of the game, is just terrible. The developers really forgot making games is primarily about making something with great feedback, otherwise players will always feel frustrated.Overall, because it is a dark souls formula, and you can try to adapt yourself through the variety of weapons against the things that annoy you in this game, it can be enjoyable, even the laggy pvp is very fun once you start getting used to it. It is worth playing alone for the environments, which are amazing in this game.Yet, given the budget DS3 had, given it is the 3rd installment of one of the most popular series  ever (which should mean polish levels were supposed to be really high by then), the amount of feedback and camera problems, as well as bad coding now and then (such as falling off a ledge where there should be collision, a feedback problem of its own as well), and general lack of life of quality features, make dark souls 3, in my opinion,  clearly the worst crafted game in history, given how much budget it had behind it, and the end result we've gotten .6.8 score in my opinionFun score can be high if you put a lot of time to figure out what works for you, but this feels like a game none of the developers played themselves (or maybe budget ran out), and why it was never well crafted. It is inconceivable that the camera we have was released in the final game, that alone points to a serious flaw in their design process.A final tale to make an example of why this game feels so unpolished, and broken with a spammy combbat system. I was fighting a special enemy that doesn't respawn. I was at his back, he was busy fighting some skeleton, he attacked the skeleton, and then entered a still frame. He was doing absolutely nothing, not chaining any attacks, and then I used the fastest attack of my weapon on him, from that safe position, only once, without triggering or queueing a second attack. He killed me. I had no chance to dodge nor recover. Not all weapons would be feasible against that spammy boss, certainly not slow ones. Only with spammy weapons through fast attack or fast chaining combo this game will feel playable."
Negative,Is so stupid it just loads then becomes a white screen and says dark souls 3 has stoped
Negative,"Started the game, beat the tutorial boss. Immediately get invaded and lose. No reason to start this game unless you want to invest a lot of time."
Negative,"Just another Dark Souls, same problems with limited Co-op and forced PvP."
Negative,"If you are a short fused person, NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER play this game. In 17h of play, died around 800x. So where's the fun?I've warned you."
Negative,bad servers sucks for multiplayer
Negative,"Didn't like it. Annoying that on PC it shows keybinds for controllers so I had to look up how to do almost everything or scroll through keybinds settings. Game basically has no story, it's just combat.. For me that was boring. I didn't like the mechanics of combat. Maybe I'd get used to them after a while but moving the camera around and so on didn't feel good. Stats for weapons seem unnecessarily confusing, not clear what stats mean, had to alt-tab to google things all the time.I don't mind that it's ""hard"" but actually going through the difficult encounters didn't even feel rewarding, just felt like a drag."
Negative,"Very shitty port.No proper controller supportNo proper PC settingsNo native ultrawide.No native super ultrawideRemote code exploitsMouse sensitivity for people with t rex arms.Game is to hard not cos its to hard but because its garbage port, devs also ignore feedback.remote code exploit was reported half year ago.I don't wanna move the camera 1000 times when i move my mouse only 1 inch"
Negative,"It appears I'm one of the few people on Steam that disliked this game.  I honestly believe that if it weren't for the difficulty (and the satisfaction of finally defeating a boss) and the cool character design, more people would hate it.Right off the bat, there was no story provided.  I had no idea what I was trying to accomplish or why.  There was no in-depth tutorial, so after getting a few basic instructions, I had to figure out the rest.  The regular battles felt too similar and tedious.  There wasn't much explaining where to go or what to do next.  It felt like the developers put almost all of their energy into the character design and boss battles, leaving the rest of the game uninteresting and frustrating.  I just couldn't get into it."
Negative,"While the PvE can be fun for the first couple of runs, the build variety is shrinked and the viable weapons are very few, with similar movesets. The PvP is utter shit, longsword R1 spam to stunlock everyone and estus healing clownfiesta, if you want to give it a go for the first run play it, but if you expect a long-lived and lasting game, sadly it's not what you are buying."
Negative,"I thought I would like this number 3,but the forced ""fake""(non-player) invader after 1st boss that you have to pass is just too powerful.In general I like the DS games, I just hate they had to have the invader system...that you can't disable in DS3 to my knowledge."
Negative,"Personally, I never got into the Souls/borne series until Bloodborne, and I love Bloodborne to death, as I consider it one of my favorite games ever. Souls on the other hand, given that its a much slower paced game about blocking and countering.The things that make the game infininitely frustrating and not fun compared to Bloodborne is the fact that your stamina in this game is pathetic and it takes an age and a half to do any kind of ""quick"" attack. your weapon bounces off of basically anything, and the controls are super delayed. if you input something, and you are in the middle of an animation of something else, it will start your commanded move when you finish the animation, it doesnt just reject the input, which is poor design. Bosses are just as aggressive as in Bloodborne, but your character feels like they have 50lb weights attached to every limb, and you have to wait an age for your stamina to regenerate, even if you take off all of your armor.also, they never ever explain how to parry, which I assume would make many fights easier, but they just say ""L2 for parry"", they never explain how it works, the timing or anything, so you sit there waving your shield like an idiot, eating damage, expecting it to be some kind of system to throw the enemy off their footing.Unfortunately, the combat just doesnt flow, its slow and clunky, all while the bosses and big enemies run circles around your pathetic character.I understand that many people love this game, but to me, its more frustration than fun, and in no way do I feel like I was skillful when I beat a boss or a hard enemy, it just feels like the RNG was on my side and that I found a way to cheese the system."
Negative,I just don't get Souls games. Even tried Sekiro. I still don't get what is so cool about them.
Negative,you can literally roll 10 times in a row.
Negative,I pressed post review button about a week ago and it's just done the input now.Basically Dark Souls 3 control scheme in a nutshell.
Negative,"Overall the character creation was solid. The rest of the game? I can't even say. In the starter area you can attack, but can't deal damage or be hit. Hit boxes don't exist. You can't even make it past the tutorial boss because well, you can't hit him. The game ran fine though. I had no lag issues. Bonfire works fine. In the end I had to refund after 15 minutes of playing because it is pointless to waste 60 dollars on a broken game. I'm sorry to those who have wasted the time, money, and bandwidth for nothing. Wouldn't even download again if it were free."
Negative,"Glad to see Dark Souls continuing with the tradition of having unexplained (or poorly explained) and unusable controls. I couldn't even figure out how to get into the menu to check if the controls could be changed because apparently the menu button wasn't escape and I didn't feel like systematically pressing every button to figure it out. I bet it also doesn't let you modify the controls either like in dark souls 2, which I also gave up on quickly after getting tired of having no idea how to control my character.This is definitely a game you need a controller for."
Negative,I haven't played it for long ... but JESUS CHRIST who had this idea to go in other people's games and kill them there ? This is just ridiculous and holymoly they are always like 3-hitting me and i am dead ... except the immense fun-robbing feature it is pretty challenging and cool like all other reviews say. Got killed 3 times now in 3h play time ...
Negative,* Might change this at a later point but after roughly 1.5 hours of gameplay I really can not recomend thisPro:+ Fun mechanics & gameplay+ not too hard but punishing (people keep mixing these up)+ good artstyleCons:- Terrible PC Port- Input delay (especially on dodge)- Didn't even bother to show you Keyboard shortcuts ingame even though you're not using a controller- Could not exit the settings in the main menu without plugging in a controller because the button didn't work- same for every ingame menu that isn't the ESC-menu- enemies hitting through walls- enemies turning around 90° mid-dodge to hit you
Negative,If your looking at reviews to decide if you want to spend 60 bucks on this game wondering if its too hard for you it most likely is I have played The Witcher 3 Skyrim Dragons Dogma and other rpgs and I thought this would be similar but it really was not all I have only put 3 hours into this game and I can already tell its not gonna be enjoyable at all
Negative,"In a perfect world,  this game would have been made exclusively for PC, would have some sort of control system akin to any number of tried-tested-and-true standards, and would literally be the best game of all time;In the world we live in,  this game was developed exclusively on a console, a terrible control system was invented from scratch, and the whole thing was disrespectfully spewed onto the steam network like throwing a renaissance painting into the gutter.I have no idea what this game is like on a console, because consoles have been pointless and woefully obsolete since the 90's, but the PC port of this game is a pure insult.For starters, there is no ""borderless"" mode... so tabbing to another program takes a full 14 seconds for the graphics card to sort itself out from the state change.  Hard to say if it's laziness, cheapness, or incompetance,  but the game has already established itself as second-rate before even starting.Underneath a gleaming, beautiful graphical display, wonderful lore, chilling sounds and visuals,  is a crippllingly terrible set of controls.  Even after 60 hours of gameplay,  not one thing about the inventory system or targetting system is intuitive, efficient, or satisfying.  In 30 years of gaming, I've never seen devised a worse inventory system than that implemented.  I'm truly at a loss to describe how bad it is. The difficulty of Dark Souls is legendary, but 75% of the difficulty is from the legendarily bad interface design.It's appartent that this game was not programmed with a mouse and keyboard in mind, as the responsiveness on said medium is markedly sluggish, and the key bindings are truly absurd.  There's nothing else in the gaming world that compares to it, and that's the only thing in this review that I'm thankful for.  What's sold as a finished product should never have gotten past alpha stages of testing.  Once again, it appears that Dark Souls 3 was developed exclusively with consoles in mind, and then hastily railroaded to market for a quick and easy profit.  The targetting system is the killing blow to Dark Souls 3.  There is no feedback, the targetting is inconsistent, erratic, and beyond infuriating.  Sometimes it is impossible to see anything at all except that your character died somwehere in the frenetic mess of jarring camera pivots - as if the game itself were having an epileptic seizure.  The vast majority of player deaths caused not by the brilliantly programmed enemies, but from the erratic, incomprehensible camera as the player desparately tries to face, and target the right enemy, while trying to figure out if their character is in ""targetted"" or ""untargetted"" mode. Though incredibly sluggish, there's a certain charm to the combat, (although the lack of responsiveness makes it seem more like a weak interactive movie rather than a game)  but there is absolutely nothing charming about the way this game plays on a PC.  I cannot believe that game testers did not complain vociferously at the poor interaction, as there are dozens, if not hundreds of other games, that pull it a seamlessly immersive control experience.  The wheel was reinvented as a triangle with this release.  I can see why Steam didn't dare charge more than $20 for it.I'm especially disappointed on behalf of the people that did such good work for this game... the artists, the AI programmers, the sound designers... to let the interface and controls department turn their work into nothing more than a polished turd is nothing short of a travesty.This game should never have been made for a console, in the first place...  but for the game that was made to be insultingly, and unprofessionally ported to PC lies somewhere between idiocy and fraud, and those involved deserve to be called out and shamed.I LOVE hard games... but i have no tolerance for bad programming when i'm paying for it...  The combat controls are bad, but logical, and can be mastered; however, this game is utterly handicapped by the inventory and targetting system.  I'd say ""try it out for yourself"", but that would imply buying it, and it's not even worth pirating.  I'd pay double the purchase price to get my wasted life backThe door is WIDE OPEN for someone to do this game well.   To do it the justice it deserves, with a proper, logical inventory and targetting system with a set of intuitive keybinds, designed with PC in mind,  but this infuriatingly bad PC-release is NOT worth indulging even as a fancy. It's best to look at screenshots of the beautiful potential, and dream of what it should have been."
Negative,"JUst horrible controls, and  a bad port, everything even tutorial is for Controlers only, pres RT to block or something, sure my mouse has RT! yay.. No thank you!"
Negative,"Poise?  Turned off,  still shows stats on armor but 100% disabledPhysical Defense on armor?  Only blocks slug damage! hahaDefenses?  Completely screwed up,  thats why I'm putting a no vote"
Negative,vai banir sua mãe
Negative,"Dodge doesn't register for me. If i'm in an attack, I can't dodge Which leaves zero opportunities to even hit the first boss."
Negative,like the other games this bad too
Negative,Unplayable crashes every 5 minutes
Negative,Screw literally everything about this game.
Negative,"Its a nice game but for me just too straight forward and if you dont have a high end PC you cant play the game cause you PC is nearly crashing every 2s. In some areas i have like 0,5 FPS and never over 25 FPS.Realy need to say that i was hoping for a beter PC port.Ohh and i forgot but you never get the weird controlls expleined you need to look it all up in our settings."
Negative,"To start off you have to understand that I waited to play this game for three months and have loved the souls game since I first played dark souls. When I finally waited all day yesterday after finishing the download and two exams; I finally came home to play this game that was promised by those who got it early as an ""amazing game"" and something that you definetly must buy, the game I got is definetly not amazing. Sure it COULD be amazing, but the FPS drops and crashes is just embarressing. No one minds waiting longer for a game to be polished and completed, everyone minds having a game that runs poorly until the devellopers cover their asses with a new patch. I can run the witcher 3 on max settings with very little drops in fps; this is a game that took the extra time to polish itself out and ensure that the audience were getting the best expirence from the the start. Do I recommend this game? No. Is it a good game? I wouldnt know. Will I give it a second chance? Not when my expectations have been wrecked like this. Wait until a massive patch comes out and makes this game playable, in its current state its not worth it."
Negative,I hate this game. Poorly optimized. Keeps showing console and not PC controls for interactions. Story is lacking directive in gameplay is lacking. Random AI hits out of range and through solid walls. This entire series is overrated. Sure as hell wont purchase Elden Ring. FromSoftware is dogshit
Negative,"no, just no."
Negative,multiplayer is jankygot banned for moving my game to a different drive
Negative,fucccccccccck this game
Negative,after 5 hours i still cant beat the first boss in the game. worst purchase i have made on steam and this game can rot for all i care
Negative,"built for console controllers and the difficulty is in the controls not the game, sucks. refund requested"
Negative,ds2 better not ragebait
Negative,"Either I have shitty computers or this game demands more, I tried to fix its issues on both my laptop and Desktop.I  have friends who LOVEEEEEEEEE the game but I only have been able to take 3 steps before saying some bs. Low memory on my desktop and low FPS on my laptop.I tried to fix both but it was a long 4 hours and sadly I looked up how to fix it, nothing helps. First game I can't run properly."
Negative,"It's way too difficult. I fail at the very first boss already after pulling the sword out of his shoulder. No easy mode or story mode or anything like that, you get thrown into the deep water, swim or die. The tutorial consists of like a bunch of easy opponents and then you walk your way down a map and suddenly stand in front of the most difficult boss you can imagine. Some of the tutorial stuff was really hard to get tbh. The opponents died when I attacked them in panic and I couldn't try out the techniques properly.Also the standard controls aren't very intuitive for people who played older gamepad games before. In former times X and A have been shield and attack, now it is left top/bottom for shield and right top/bottom for attack. Makes somehow sense for left hand and right hand stuff, but if you are used to older games there were no such buttons. I often used the flask instead of shielding and then I was missing flask charges and got hit badly. Also the Y-button toggle to two handed weaponry isn't visible enough, I thought I had my shield equipped, but I hadn't. It has to be more visible to the player which mode the player is in right now.This is definitely not newbie friendly."
Negative,"Highly overrated.I 100%ed the first 2 installments, so it's not because I didn't ""GiT gUd"", it's just worse than the first 2 games.This is the bad stuff you can expect from the game:     Sprinkles of DS1 nostalgia (Literally some reused characters just with different names)     Armor doesn't matter at all. If you want to go for a tanky/blocky build, you're fucked. I use heavy armor and even the weakest mobs do massive damage per hit.     Also, seemingly poise doesn't exist anymore. No matter what hits you, you'll be staggered. So if you have multiple enemies around you and you get hit once, you're mostly just done.     Some enemies take AGES to prepare a hit before they finally strike. But don't you think that makes it easy to dodge roll, because they basically have auto aim. So even if you roll behind them while they're going for the blow, they will still hit you. Other enemies strike very fast and very often. So much that it becomes nearly impossible to dodge/block every hit because you'll run out of staminaMaybe this might change later, but after everything, some of that still pisses me off and it's simply not as fun anymore. I have an urge that I would rather play DS1 again. And that's not a good sign"
Negative,"i played through this entire game on stream after playing elden ring. this game was breathtaking, beautiful environment, and had fun and creative bossfights. i enjoyed every last bit of it3/10, didn't have enough attractive men"
Negative,"This game is pain, not fun, people who like this are some freaky mfs"
Negative,Not my type of game
Negative,"From the 189 hours the last 100 hours was spent killing Yhorm the giant in my 3 playthroughs. He's a bit too tanky in my opinion and in each new game plus it even gets tankier (who thought that's a good idea?). The damage reduction on the mf and the amount of HP it has is ridiculous. For this reason and this reason alone i can't recommend this game to anyone, the rest of the game is fun and good (it still has some a few flaws) but just this boss ruins the whole game for me. Even the hardest boss in the main game (according to people), Nameless King, is easier than him wtf? why isn't Yhorm the giant the hardest boss I can't seem to fathom.Anyways thanks for reading my review and make sure to check out my other reviews ""UwU"""
Negative,"The boss fights are alright but when you die you have to run back to the boss room through waves of bullshit. You only kill enemies outside of boss fights to progress to get to the next bonfire (and ultimately to the next boss), you don't really have to kill enemies to farm souls because the bosses give you enough souls anyways. You can't just skip to the boss fights which are the only interesting part of the game, you have to slog through it.Co-op doesn't rescue this game because the co-op system is bad. Just the act of joining another player's game is tedious because you both have to be at the same location. One player has to scribble on the ground with chalk and the other player has to find their scribbles. Sometimes they take a few minutes to appear, in keeping with the theme of not letting you have fun right away. Once you and your friend finally start playing and you kill a boss together, you have to do it again on the other guy's save because you can't progress together on one game.The story isn't captivating enough for me to care to learn what's going on but people tell me it's good, I doubt them though because the people that tell you the story is good are the same people who think the game is good."
Negative,"I don't understand how people can say this is a game of skill. It's nothing but unfair warping god-mode enemies. AND IT'S THE FIRST THING YOU FIGHT.You'd think it'd be enough for the ""tutorial"" to roll/dodge the enemy's telegraphed attacks, but it isn't. You'll take damage no matter what. Did you roll out of the way before the attack executed? Nope. Enemy boss warps to your location taking half your health bar away. Why even have a health bar if I'm dead in two hits?If you haven't purchased this game by now, don't. It's cheap and unfair. Only anti-social virgins whose STEAM friends are their only friends jerk each other off to putting up with the cheating AI and call it ""skill"" then brag to anyone whose not a girl because if a girl heard them bragging about beating the first boss in Dark Souls III they'd immediately say ""eww"" and go talk to a boy who has seen sunlight in the last few weeks.This game sucks. Great intro movie though. Too bad this game couldn't just be that."
Negative,This game sucks ass.
Negative,"I dont recommend buy it...................Without the DLCsobviously u should give ur money to this game, Its DS3, while u have a copy of ur save on the cloud everything will be fine. pdt: pray the sun."
Negative,"From my brief playing time, the following:Positives:-Good graphics-Decent customizationNegatives:  -Combat is clunky, -Poorly ported, definitely intended only for console (they didn't even edit the hints and tutorial for PC, they're all meant for console)-super-steep learning curve, difficulty ratchets up immediately and very markedly.  Boss battles give you zero margin for error (which is even tougher when the controls are so clunky)-There's no separation of co-op and competitive (a headache if you and a buddy are trying to team up to figure things out and a someone 10x your level gate crashes your game)Get only if you play on the console, and you're a masochist.  This plays like a hasty port, and they didn't do it well, nor followed up."
Negative,"The worst. I played manny games, but this, this is frustrating. 9 hours and i am nowhere yet. Friend told mi ""git gud"" He played 60 hours just to learn how to play! I dont want that. I want to play like other games. Witcher 3? no problem. God of War? No problem! Red dead redemption 2? No problem! Shadow of war, mordor? no problem! But this? so you want to hit someone, ok but he will strike you 3 times becouse you didnt move in milisecond! Using sword and shild, ok but no rolling becouse you are to heavy! W H A T? This is a game, not f...ing simulation of hell! Using shield deploy stamina!! What? You us a shield but fire crossbow will f. u up! No quick save, no map no nothing! I dont even know where i'm going or where i am. Fat lady with big axe roaming around so you thing she will be slow? no dude, shi will chop you like onions... I am no qiuter, but also i have family and they liked how games relaxed me, and cheerd me up. This devils spit from hell is just frustrating. I played and played, but im still in basemant with two dogs, two axe man and two hellebard dudes. I need a key, but all i get is dude with axe in my head. Sorry for bad english."
Negative,how am i supposed to beat a dragon with the starter sword
Negative,"You fight a tough enemy, shoot 50 bolts on him, f. e. a dragon, and before he dies you get summond to a covenant fight. You return, the boss has full health again, and you ve not enough bolts left to kill him. SHIT FUCK SUCKS. Enemies can hit you with Halberd through TWO WALLS... Enemies can even spread fire through thick walls. WTF. You use ""intensive sweat"" against fire damage, but enemy can instant kill you with a single fire blow. - even with sweat, full health bar and medium high level. Just ridiculous.Enemies can even hit you with a 10 m chain through walls, columns n all survaces. There´s a difference between DIFFICULT and UNFAIR / IDIOTIC."
Negative,"VERY POOR AND BAD GAME ..... CONTROLS ARE LIKE ON ATARI , BANDAI SHOULD KNOW BETTER"
Negative,Played Demon's Soul and Dark Souls 2 on PS3 with 0 issues. This PC port is quite bad though. Input delay in particular makes it unplayable for me. Buy the console version if u can.
Negative,A bad console port. Kinda the opposite of fun.
Negative,I expected exciting combat scenes rather than shmup
Negative,"For players hoping to play this game with a pc keyboard and mouse are going to be very dissapointed. I purchased the game only to find out that my keyboard couldn't do many of the functions, I looked in the key selection menu found out what buttons to press but nothing happened. Also wasn't able to customize my character due to the fact that I coudn't leave the customization options if I wanted to save progress. I'm sure many people love this game but for those without a controller not recomended."
Negative,"Disclaimer: This is the first Dark Souls game I have played.I don't understand the appeal for this type of game. I love difficult games, I do everything I can to make hard games even harder whether that's through the use of mods or minimizing the HUD elements to help draw me in to the environment as much as possible.I walked into this knowing that I was going to die a lot and I did! That didn't necessarily deter me from continuing on nor did it detract too much from my experience although there were a few moments that I was getting tired of being defeated by the same enemy over and over...The tutorial does very little to explain much of the game. I had Google how to equip the fire bombs to my tool belt. After dying a few times to the beginning enemies and finally figuring out these strange controls (on an Xbox controller) I finally encountered the boss!I became excited at seeing a game that pits us against behemoths and I was even more impressed when he morphed into an even larger creature. I died about 20-30 times in that fight alone and that's when I began to get discouraged. So I went to YouTube for some tips. I was a bit disappointed in myself for having to do that but I really don't see how or why this first boss was so difficult. Even after I defeated him I still didn't understand why I struggled so much!I expected to find a town to rest in afterwards where I expected to see NPC's that would provide quests, equipment, lore, and a place to relax. I was met with another segment to fight through which wasn't difficult until I made it to the next area. I came upon Hawkwood the Deserter and didn't understand that this was the ""town"" of the game since it looked more like a boss arena. I attacked him and he became hostile...I went through several deaths before I Googled this guy and found that I didn't have to fight him at all which frustrated me. I didn't want to fight an NPC in the first place! I assumed he was an enemy because the game didn't prompt me in any way to convey that I was in ""town"" and he looked like a fully geared soldier. He looked like a threat that I had the drop on. I ended up discovering that he can't exit the town area and eventually defeated him.Fast forward to the next area and I see all of these inscriptions on the ground and I realize that that is the multiplayer... I became worried as I bought this game for me and a friend as we want to play together (without the co-op aspect I wouldn't have ever entertained the idea of playing this game) so I Googled how multiplayer/co-op works.Note: No gamer should have to Google how to utilize a game mechanic! That's poor development and it doesn't matter if it was explained in any of the other titles as there will obviously be newcomers that haven't played the previous titles and therefore this information should always be conveyed clearly in-game!I discovered that I have to purchase an Ember and become ""Kindled"" which in my eyes just buffs the player and serves no other justifiable function. Then you have to purchase a soapstone and carve some symbols in the ground and hope your friend can find it in order to join your game. That in itself is a terrible system as it invites unwanted players into your game unless you password protect your inscription in which case I don't see why we can't just invite our friends directly into our game.I also discovered that if the host dies then the multiplayer session is over and you have to repurchase these materials, use them again, find your friend(s), and try again. Couple that with a game that results in around 50 deaths in my 3.5 hours played and this just isn't a feasible option.If you like single-player games then this game is for you. If you want a co-op experience I strongly suggest looking elsewhere."
Negative,"I usually like games with good graphics and are harder than average, but this just wasn't for me. I played for over 2 hours and couldn't even get past the first boss. I'm sure this game is perfect for some, but not for me. I just felt it was a grind and not at all fun. I decided to get a refund. It's the only game I've ever asked for a refund for on steam."
Negative,garbage gameplay on pc
Negative,They force you to read to scroll extremely slowly through the entire service agreement. Was very annoying and deserves a bad review just for that.
Negative,dont get it if you dont play with a controller
Negative,Controls are horrible
Negative,so damn hard!Bull Shit!
Negative,"No pc controls acessable , horrible port but good game on ps4"
Negative,"Too difficult. Boss required about 30+ good hits and if you get hit twice you're dead. Pots don't help. Can't get past the first area.Haven't been able to loot anything other than souls.Bonfire system sucks.. stillBarely any settings can be adjusted. Console users have more abilities & moves with LB/RB. No option to hotkey a lot of attacks/features/abilities on keyboard.No chat system, No group/clan system. Nothing."
Negative,"Played this game when it came out and dropped it after 2 days because i couldn't stomach how boring it is.I beat it years later as part of dark souls marathon and I still maintain that it is a dry nothing burger of a souls game. You can really feel how this game was contractually obligated and no one actually wanted to make it.Mechanically the game has nerfed all mechanics outside of a single playstyle, and following said playstyle makes the game contemptuously easy. Tools like armour, shields, magic, weapons with unique moves, and the entire MP system all becomes mechanics not worth engaging with. And worse still a detrament to the player should they choose to invest levels into them.Story wise the game feels in the realm of bad Dark souls 1 fanfiction.Not only do you have to fight the game to even find the story, unlike the other games, it only really establishes bad retcons for the sake of making the fan service DS1 references make sense.The only thing the hollow ""remember DS1"" references invoked in me was wishing i was playing DS1 instead.The map structure has good technical presentation but the problems with the story delivery bleeds over and causes areas to feel pointless due to the game not giving you any reason to care about the environment aside from ""rememberer how cool this area was in DS1"".On top of this the map structure and atmosphere building is rather weak and i cannot remember a single encounter or boss that impressed me with its design outside of the first DLC."
Negative,"Only had this game for an hour and got booted 3 times for ""connection issues"". I don't want to play in offline mode and I pay good money for my internet to keep it a decent speed. I played the other 2 of this series for a hundred hours each with no problem. Very disappointed."
Negative,"Cant even recommend this crash ridden infested POS, dont buy till later or get on another platform."
Negative,Compared to the first two this one is really a lack luster experience and feels like a slog to get through where the first two games felt more like a difficult yet rewarding experience.
Negative,Worst. Port. Ever.
Negative,"DS I had stunning PVE, but PVP was pretty bad. It costs around 6$.DS II had amazing PVP, but PVE was pretty bad. It costs around 10$ (SoFS)DS III has NOTHING. PVE is ruined by corridor game design and has absolutly nothing but DS I fanservice. PVP is ruined by Team A balancing, where there is only 3-5 meta weapons. And don't forget AN AMAZING POISE SYSTEM!!! (Spoiler: THIS GAME HAS NO POISE! GREAT! F**** GREAT, THAT'S WHAT I LOVE! WHO THE HELL NEEDS POISE WHEN YOU CAN BE STAGGERED BY A GODDAMN HOLLOW WITH A STICK! And, no, hyperarmor s***fest is NOT comparable to poise in previous games.)Like an iceing on cake, this game costs around 20$. Great, fromsoft, you've ruined an amazing series."
Negative,"This game is hard, but it's filled with poor design.  it has no story (plenty of lore, but not story) npc's that only speak in cryptic verse.  the lore is hidden in items, and a whole lot of the game is simply left up to your interpretation or what every you want it to be.Some of the best parts of this game was getting enemies to hit and hurt each other, but the do away with this fun feature in  their DLC, wolves jumping around, who's hit boxes don't include their head so they have greater reach then a claymore.I was left feeling like what could have been a good game lacked some real thorough testing, and simply devolved into nothing but a pvp hive.  the Co-op in the game was literally just excuse to let red souls invade rather than allowing you to try and have some fun with friends.  Tried doing it at first but we eventually gave up partying, having to deal with red souls that would invade our game and then run away and hide among the other enemies of the game because it was 2v1  wasn't what we where looking for, yeah for forced PvP just to play with friends.Camera Angles are a problem with any game where the monster is 10x the size of the player but Bloodbourne has less of an issue with those then this game does, so they obviously could have done better."
Negative,does not provide proper support for pc users
Negative,"bought on pc and literally all it kept showing was controller moves, waste of my money. Games trash too"
Negative,No no no.
Negative,Dog shit fucking game. cant even connect a controller to it without issues. for a game made in 2016 fucking horse shit
Negative,"does not work, dissapointed"
Negative,Fix your fucking elevators!!
Negative,"This game was so dissapointing compare to the first Dark Souls. Dark Souls has always been about being tough, dying all the time, and resisting the urge to launch a controller across the room when necessary. Not Dark Souls 3, this game is a laughing stock compared to the first one, where you had to work to get what you want. Everything is just handed to you and theres no balance to the game. Sure it's a very beautiful game and I can stare at it's artwork all day, but that doesn't make a game. Nor does overpowered weapons and gear that makes this game unfair to a point.The PVP is just awful. The invincibility frames during each roll is ridiculous. The frames that I CAN be hit, are about the same frames in Dark Souls 1 where I can't. It just makes for a nonstop rolling frenzy for endless swinging and no results. There's no strategy involved, just crazed swinging."
Negative,"I hate this game. Pro:Amazing visuals, nice music, nice atmosphere. Performance is okay, i had some minor crashes when alt tabbing too much. Contra:Gameplay: Trash mobs have unlimited stamina and attack nonstop. They come in packs. If you do not pull one after another out of a group you will die. The hitbox of their attacks has great range, even dodging seems impossible. If you try to block attacks with your shield, your stamina deplets fast, when its zero you can not do anything. The enemies do not seem to have a recovery time between their attacks. When one attack is over it loops directly into another attack combo. It is like fighting against Ruy in Street fighter, who does nothing but Dragon punches.In DS 1 or DS2 enemies recovered between attack combos, you could dodge their attacks to hit them, this is not possible in ds3. Their attack animations are too fast to parry and many attacks can't be parried at all.The bosses come in two categories. Cheap and very difficult and rediculous easy falling over without resistance. Both types are not fun to battle. Vordt the second boss is easy like Wolnir and other bosses. The abyss watcher is cheap and difficult. He has fast and long attack combos looping directly in another attack combo without recovering. It is just cheap and unfair. You have no chance to place attacks, only luck and rng makes you win the fight, not learning the attack patterns. Winning against bosses does not give me the feeling of accomplishment. Only frustration. Oh i was lucky enough to finally win against this cheap crap.You can not access all levels from the start like in DS 1 & 2 or demon souls. You have to play linear through each level to progress. The exception is path of sacrifices, you can choose to go the cathedral of the deep or farron keep there. Linear level design with two or three branches, looping into the beginning or a bon fire.Good equipment for many classes is only available in the later stages of the game. equipment upgrades are unexiting, jeah i do 10 more damage for an upgrade. Fantastic. Fully upgraded my weapon does 100 damage more. Wow.Game balance between classes:It is absolutely off. Most bosses require a melee approach,  so as caster you are basically screwed. You are forced to play a hybrid melee caster build, and cannot play pure caster ranged. I am not talking about a fully upgraded NG++++ veteran player with a super powerfull sorcerer. I know that you can potentially onehit bosses with magic. But that is not possible as beginner mage nor should it be. I am talking about all boss fights build around melee concepts, like Rotten great wood, you can not target his weakspots or diacones, where adds are shielding the target, so you have to rush in and hit it with melee. I had no access to viable aoe spells to bomb the whole bunch as sorcerer. Spell great sword was to slow to be reliably used in most fights. The only viable spell was Farrons fast sword, and that is a melee spell.Dext melee or strength builds seem to be the way to solve the game without too much trouble. Pure Mage is hell mode.No meaningfull exploration, no npcs with story or real sidequests in the levels. I do not count the onion knight fight a side quest. It is like 2 minutes long. most items found are crap or obligatory for shops, scrolls to learn new spells at your teacher. Find bones of for the thief, find scrolls for the mage. Wow so fantastic. Never did such quests before. Boring. No towns, no npcs with their own little stories no interaction with the enviroment no crafting no roleplaying. The world does not change through your actions and does not react to your actions in a meaningfull way. Beside some npcs at the flame shrine that babble some nonsense about you.Story: there is no story at all beside the intro cinematic. The main story seems nonsense. forwhatever reason you are the kindled one. You wake up at a cemetary and you are send to fight the 4 lords of cinder to rekindle the flame or whatever. Not realistic not epic not fun. I do not understand my motivation to do anything for the people i meet in the game. Fight monsters? Search dungeons for gold and treasure? Why, everyone is dead in this world, just roll over and die.Combat, roll around until enemy stops attacking, get 2 hits in, start rolling again. Or try to block some hits with your shields draining all your stamina.PVP is shit. Invaders getting ganked by ember hosts and friends. Forced pvp for pve interested people. Roll around combat, jeah so fun. Ultimate great swords with 10 meter attack ranges. Unblockable, undodgable. No poise for heavy armor, any hit staggers you. hyper armor during attack animations. The whole gameplay is just a messy pile of excrement. Spells that are easy to dodge, the only way to reliable hit anyone is to shoot at your feet.Level progression is really boring. Get a point to invest in stats per level. To feel a real difference in gameplay you have to invest like 20 levels. Some stats are borderline useless like Poise. Rpg mechanics are a joke. Nothing reacts to your high intelligence or high strength, not even a breakable wall or a heavy boulder.I liked dark souls 1 and 2 more. This game does not feel like a souls game anymore. Too fast attack animations of enemies, too cheap gimmicky bossfights, annoying gank pvp and many other things make it an unpleasant experience for me. I do not recommend this game to anyone. Just another forgettable action game without any depth or soul.Have a nice day."
Negative,"Katana guy outside firelink shrine fucks me harder than my father used too and for that reason and that reason alone i recommend this game for all filthy gamers out there. 10/10 - IGN, väry härd"
Negative,Frustrating and dull-looking.
Negative,No Ultrawide 2560x1080 support
Negative,"Can not recommend this game as it sucks badly. I heard all this great stuff about this series and this is just a terrible port of a console game. If you want a terrible port of a console game then this is for you. Poorly written with terrible controls designed by handless monkeys that can't see. Imagine if you can a world where poor game design is the norm and poor game designers are idolized like mold on a wet piece of wood, thats what this game is, mold."
Negative,"I have no idea if previous versions of this game have this issue but I was badly disappointed by the game. The developers seem to have assumed all players have a controller in their pocket and made the game for the mouse-keyboard combo simply useless.If you don't have a controller, you're going to have a really hard time and less fun than getting kicked in your genitals."
Negative,"It's such a weird case of a game, but ultimatly I can't recommend it. There are so many minute things that many will call deliberate game design, or that I have to ""git gud"", but level with me here for a second:The camera has always been somewhat of a problem in Dark Souls, but this time around it is to the point of beeing nonsensicly stupid. Even the first tutorialboss has a body which  constantly blocks huge parts of the screen while you fight him(in fact, many of the new enemys are gigantic, which looked really cool in trailers, but is a nightmare to deal with in terms of actual gameplay. and there are MANY big enemys, Mudcraps, black wormbeasts from princess mononoke, giants, giant rats, giant crabs, giant goatwitches, you name it, it's probably there and gigantic. and even if the enemys are not gigantic, especially in the swamp, there are many other ""problematic"" ones, like the ones that block your camera with a flurry of feathers, or the one that jump so high that your camera goes apeshit during lock-on.Other than that, there are the usual problems every DS game ever had, like the unnecessarily long runs to bosses(it doesn't make the fight harder that I have to run the same path for a few minutes to get to the boss EVERY time after I die, it just makes it annoying. If anyone wants to tell me that this is supposed to be difficulty, NO it is not, is is just annoying, nothing on the way to the boss comes even close to a threat, every other game would get shit on if it did something that stupid and I am sick and tired of DS getting a freepass on everything because ""It's supposed to be hard"".As always, early game loot mostly consists of trash and is really unstatisfying to get, the ""Jump"" function is pretty useless, there are tons of ever so slight ledges that even an unfit guy like me could pull himself up to IRL, because they are only half a meter high, but the MC of this game somewhat lacks the ability to...I already know that this review will get shittons of hate, since I dare to critice a DS game, and hey, if you love the game, more power to you, wish I could be you, but it doesn't elevate the game over critice, and there is a lot to critice about it."
Negative,Worst Dark Souls game by far.
Negative,this is the dark souls of games I dont enjoy playing
Negative,Where is the jump button??
Negative,"I didn't realise that I was paying for a game that would make me spend the entire time in the game failing at the Tutorial Boss. Tilted and pissed off.EDIT - I also didn't realise that paying for one of the most highly reviewed best games of the year for the PC, would actually mean all of the controls are for XBOX Controllers and you can't default it to KeyBoard and Mouse, and unless you spend time youtubing guides and looking into Mods, it kinda ruins the whole aspect of the game, at least for me personally."
Negative,"Controller doesn't work unless it's been plugged in continuously from before the game starts. Battery run out wirelessly? No more controller for you. Cable come lose wired? No more controller for you.Online servers are gone, and you have to wait for the game to fail to connect to them before you can play."
Negative,"I just can't get into these games. It's just frustrating to run at a boss over and over again, it never feels fair, and when I eventually beat the thing I don't feel accomplished, I feel releived that I don't have to keep bashing my head against a wall.That being said, the combat does feel good, I just wish they would use it in a game that's actually fun to play."
Negative,"I heard a lot of hype about this game, and being a huge RPG fan i thought i'd give it a try.... but thsi game is just bad... the controls are not natural and the game far to difficult to become accustomed to the play style. Dying millions of times becomes extremely frustrating and i evenutally lost interest.... graphics looks amazing tho, but if i actually played some demo of this before i would never have purchased it"
Negative,Matchmaking is total crap. All invaders are soooo overpowered. Impossible to play with online
Negative,this game lowkey ass people act like shits hard as fuck but i beat this shit in like 11 hours first try fuck outta here
Negative,"I mean, now that Elden Ring is a thing that exists, all the other souls games are objectively worsenot a bad game, but Elden Ring is superior is literally every single possible way"
Negative,"This game is a jittery unoptimized mess on PC. I dont feel like spending 50 hours just to get used to this game, sorry dark soul stans."
Negative,"The worst of the trilogy. Bad game design is all over the place. Covenants are grindy PVP garbage. You'd think after 3 games they'd have figured some of this out. But nope. Most of the bosses lack any sense of identity or memorability, trading design for hitboxes that don't work and an unending lack of cohesion.Oh, and after writing this the game crashed twice in two different places. NG+ Catacombs, and NG++ Cathedral of the Deep. It's like it heard me. I still stand by it.Also Nameless King is a trash boss, don't even try to convince me."
Negative,"Truly terrible controls for PC. DO NOT BOTHER unless you like using a controller, all prompts show controller(and I hate them). First boss  is 1 minute into the game, and it takes hours to learn the controls enough to beat him, so retry again and again. Not fun. No help in the game so I hope your Google-Fu is strong. Its a badly done console port."
Negative,"The pve is great. If you want to play for the pve then this dark souls is for you! It's great in many ways although a little bit easy in my opinion. On the other hand, the pvp is completely broken. Overpowered weapons, gankers, broken game mechanics etc. Until FROM fixes this shit this review will not change because the game needs a change. PS: Don't go saying ""git gud"" or some other generic garbage in the comments. I have fun playing pvp against players that fight genuinely. But the rest is unbearable."
Negative,"as a fan of dark souls games and demon souls i have enjoyed all of them but this one . if you are looking to play and expect any leniency as a new player to this type of game then i wouldnt waste my money on this game. this was by far the worst game of the souls series when it comes to enjoyment , fun and replay . i had more enjoyment and fun playing DS1 and DS2 ."
Negative,"I absolutely do not recommend playing this game on PC, The start of the game was the most confusing shit ever. The devs were too dam lazy to port the controls to PC, the movement feels clunky and tutorial does not teach players anything but dying. There is nothing engaging about this game and literally no story. (Your just a guy with a sword killing things for fun).The fastest game I have ever refunded"
Negative,Everyone always said what a geat game this is and how challenging it is. But all I found was a terrible console port with horrendous controls and cameras angles.  Not even remotely enjoyable.
Negative,it's not like ape escape and therefore not a good buy
Negative,No 21:9 SupportNO CloudsaveNo proper keyboard & mouse support
Negative,-Glitched hitboxes=broken game-No fix for problem in 2 patches during the duration of almost a month.-There is no game support -Can't get refund bc its been too long-0/10 Fromsoftware is a greedy douchebag
Negative,Doesn't even run on Windows 11.
Negative,Fix the mulitplayer.
Negative,"Spend 2 days trying to figure out how to configure my controller. Didn't work - Game responds only to moving the left stick,meanwhile controller works properly everywhere else. And this problem is present in ALL Dark Souls games. AND you can't change hints to Keyboard/Mouse. Don't buy any of Dark Souls Games unless you have a PS4 or an Xbox."
Negative,"Why you should buy this game:Good graphicsGood battle systemWhy you shouldn't buy this game if you are a pc user:There is no hit detection beyond enemies initial spawn point, meaning you are invicable and unabled to be killed.People are being banned for no reason.Non-boss enemies sometimes don't even move at all and you can walk through them.The shrug' gesture is no longer in the game"
Negative,"dark souls 3....where do I even start....as an avid fan of the first and second entrys into the series I went in with an open mind, was immediatly greeted with some kind of menu....very bad ui....gamer interference caused me terminal de-controlerisiation with my micro key-ports and mouse setup. A is for input command 'yes'?? not likely, these idiot developer chads have made this UNREALISTIC pile of trash making light of JR's fantasy debut the lord of the rings and have rendered it fairly unrecognisable with hobbit sambo being replaced by some kind of lantern goblin from the cutscene....IDIOTSmy friend mar-cel reccomended this game and as far as Im concerned the NEET isn't my friend no longer...FUCK YOU MARK, FUCK YOU MARCELLIm getting my refund while the going is good."
Negative,"If you have a fetish for feet, ladyboys, and ankle-deep water, then this game is for you. Otherwise, spend your money elsewhere. As someone who's invested 370 hours into this shit heap of a sequel, I can honestly say that this game is a fucking shitsterpiece. The beginning of the game is honestly fun up until you get to a ""optional"" boss where you have to smack this fucking tree's nutsacks. From there, it all goes downhill. The game proceeds to throw two of the worst areas at you. One is a obnoxiously large shitheap of a swamp filled with a bunch of hyperaggressive goatfuckers that chuck poison at you, and the other is an obnoxiously huge church WITH THE SAME FUCKING SWAMP INSIDE OF IT. LIKE WHO THE FUCK DOES THAT!?The rest of the base game is a downhill spiral until you unlock an optional area where you get to fight a dragonfucker. It is honestly a pretty good area and fun fight. I liked it a lot.The DLC is alright. The first one, Painted World of Rehash, has pretty obnoxious enemies. The developers thought it'd be fun to throw a bunch of fucking dogs at you which tbh are the worst mobs in the Souls game. Then they throw a bunch of aborted chicken nugget fuckers at you that all screech in unholy unison at you to rupture your fucking eardrums. Luckily, the bossfights make up for it. I mean, Champion Cocktender is an asshole. But Sister Friede and Oatmeal man is pretty cool. Me and my friend liked it a lot.The second DLC however. WHOO. Let me tell you that shit is good. You've got some of the BEST boss fights hands down in the Souls series. I mean, the Demon Princes are kinda shit, but there's a blind dragon later on that remains my favorite fight to this day. At first youll think hes a broken, poorly designed asshole. But after like 75 attempts you finally figure out to position in front of his head and everything clicks. And THEN you realize ""holy shit this is a masterpiece of a fight"". Skyrim TAKE NOTES. This is how you do a dragon fight. The final boss of the DLC is aight. He's a a literal nobody Slav that yokes out on manlet blood because hes tryna build a better world for his niece. I won't spoil the entire lore, but he does connect with the first DLC. And you do in a way to get to know his character as you progress. It made me honestly a little sad knowing I'd have to kill him as he chimped out like an ape and beat my ass down like 50 times. Finally beating him was honestly a cathartic experience and great way to end the Souls series.All in all though, this game is honestly shit. The DLC and second half is the only saving grace of the game. The only reason I had any kind of fun was because I played it with my friend. I really miss him."
Negative,"Really anti-new player friendly me and my friend got it and it was a struggle to even play co-op, if you want to play with friends don't buy it."
Negative,Way harder than the other 3-4 games in the series and its harder to a point of not even being fun.
Negative,Bad game have 10 fingers can only wear 4 rings
Negative,"The game has jitter stutter issues when moving around/scenery. happens during combat, tested on low and high settings 1080p or 900p (60fps drops to 57fps) with slight stutter, even cap fps limit to 50fps still drops to 47fps) with slight stutter. normally when games drop frame rate it shouldn't stutter just slows down smoothness (for example playing Witcher 3 fps can drop from 60 to 55 without stutter just slows down still feels smooth and very playable)"
Negative,"I just don't get the hype, clearly it must be me. The graphics are nice, the story is not horrible. The problem for me is the combat. It is absolutely boring. Dodge-roll and slash. Dodge-roll & slash. *Yawn!* Nothing else? Maybe block or cast a spell is you're a specific class. But really, that's it. Dodge-roll & slash. The base enemies are one shot kills leading up to a skill-check insta-hard boss where.. you guessed it  - dodge-roll & slash. This game is 'challenging' only in that you are a glass cannon, not in the variation among how to fight enemies or tactics. The UI is also lacking in that it does not recognize when you are using a keyboard and mouse. Menu screens all still list controller buttons, even if you're not using a controller. This would not have been a hard thing to fix in a AAA title. Lazy programming, lazy combat. Ended up returning it either way, if I'm bored before even getting to that 2 hour mark, I'm not playing for hours and hours.But hey, it has a 90% rating so, again, maybe it's me. Maybe I expect too much from a $60 game."
Negative,"First things first. i LOVE this game. it's great when it doesn't crash. The crashes are so frequent that most of my runs end not because I quit the game, but because it crashes and I have to reset my computer. Once this is fixed, this will be a solid 9.5/10"
Negative,"The game has amazing world building and beautiful art direction going for it (Definitely worth experiencing if you have absolutely nothing better to do with your money). Sadly that's about it. The mechanics are some of the clunkiest you'll experience. Controls are unresponsive, camera is wonky and a lot of gameplay is designed to be frustrating at all cost rather than challenging but fair. A great potential but fell flat. 6+/10"
Negative,"Just to start out, this game is good, it's probably the best out of all the Dark/Demon souls series I'd say. Has many good improvements like being able to summon phantoms for boss fights it you need to, larger variety of spells, it seems easier to grind out levels for the most part.The problem I have with this game though is it hasn't improved on the areas of the game series I never liked, so more of personal opinon a bit here I guess. Stat grinding is still a major constant annoyance, and when you level up a stat it doesn't feel like much of an visible improvement because they've set it up with the idea you'll go to 40/60 levels over multiple playthroughs. Especially in this game it has felt like gaining stats doesn't really improve much I've found. The whole NG++ thing bothers me too. I don't want to have to replay the same game over and over to consider it complete, it was maybe fine for the first game but not sure why it's stuck. Just feels like a lame way to increase game time and this game doesn't need that as it's already long. The story is just so weird and inane that you won't remember it while your playing it or after. It was kind of fun initially for the series how oddball it was but can be a bit of a problem now. Like you have weapon/spell/item vendors at the fire keeper shrine that come and go based on the story, you have phantoms that can help you based on the story, but it's hard to know what the story is. I grinded up to level 70 and don't know who, why, or what's going on. I gave a pass on the first games but with this game especially it's affects what you have access to and can force you down path that might not be the best, its a large problem I think. The main issue I have with this game is it's just so tedious for me now and maybe since I work I just don't have time for it.The breaking point for me was Pontiff Sulvayn, like I can beat him technically now, but theres a few things holding me back. I would have to throw myself at him 20-30 times till I got lucky, grind up more levels, or figure out why I can't summon the phantoms for this boss. I haven't had to summon phantoms for a boss all game but for this I was finally going to give in, then noticed for some reason they aren't there for me. So I would have to figure out the story and what I need to do for it to get the npcs to want to be summoned. Normally for these games I would dig through the wiki lore to figure out how to get the things I want or need, but I just don't care anymore. I would recommend if you like these type of grindy hard time consuming rpg games, or if you want to try out one game in the dark/demon souls series this might be the best. Otherwise I can't recommend cause it's just the same thing over and over again and it's just way too time consuming a game for what it is. The gameplay is fun and addictive at times but mostly it's tedious grinding which I just don't have time for personally anymore. Basically they make the same game over and over again, and these games themselves are setup for you to play them over and over again, and you'll be playing certain sections over and over again while grinding. So yeah, repetive and at some point people just get off the carousel for the boredom and I guess it's my time to get off this ride of a series."
Negative,"This review will be updated when appropriate:Cons:Game was released in a buggy state.Crashing near bonfire was running rampart. (fixed)Literally, bonfire was the hardest boss in the game.Optimization is absolute worst. (not fixed)Then FromSoft started banning legit players, just because. who knows. (not fixed)Some of the Covenants like Farron and Blue Sentinels don't work, they simply don't summon you. (not fixed)Poise is broken and doesn't work. (not fixed)PVP balance is absolute worst. First souls game where 5vs1 is acceptable and no amount of ""getting good"" will save this. (not fixed)Longswords and rapiers are absolutely broken and OP. (not fixed)Many amazing gameplay elements that Dark Souls 2 introduced are gone:No small white/red stones. If you kill boss - co-op and pvp(forceful invade) in that area is gone for good until NG+.No more indicator what maps are popular for pvp.Slow, methodical and tactical approach of Dark Souls is gone in favor of fast pacing Bloodborn, were enemies hit like characters from Mortal Kombat or Tekken.Less spells, less pyromancies, less miracles.Pyromancy depends on sorcery and faith this time, which abolishes whole purpose of this school.Faith spells are absolutely worthless.Sorcery is legit, but struggles unlike DS1/2.Pros:Amazing, atmospheric, bleak world in best Souls traditions. Good, but somewhat incoherent and hard to follow story.Interesting NPC's with their unique questlines.No more Havel-Mages from DS2. Original Bosses.Probably the hardest Souls game.Good music.True successor of Dark Souls 1 which brings nostalgia like tears from onion.TL:DR: Whether you should buy this title mostly depends on do you prefer technical aspect or lore/core/world aspect. Personally, I think game has too much of Bloodborn in it. Even some assets are straightforward copy-paste job from Bloodborn. Still, i'd wait until all issues are fixed and PVP is balanced, and buy only then."
Negative,"The character customization is difficult and confusing, the tutorials are all only in xbox controller buttons, and the progression is just slow and boring. It's not even necessarily difficult, it just takes so long to go anywhere or get some real excitement."
Negative,"Game is filled with sweaty tryhards, or trash alt-f4 players. Enjoy the waste of investment at your own risk."
Negative,"i walked through Bloodborne 3 times, but this is the worst game i've ever seen"
Negative,"People who say its hard are wrong, the fighting mechanics are just bad and the 3rd person helps alot to make it that bad. The voice acting is as usual as if sume people on drugs performed it and the gigantic logic fails are verywhere. So yeah as usual overhyped okay game with the strongest point being the artwork."
Negative,"I bought the game to play it with a friend of mine. then found out you needed to use an item every time you join their world and you get returned to your own world if you die after which you need to use the item again which isn't dirt cheap. unlike coop the singleplayer is just what i expected. I would've played it a lot if the coop didn't suck ass, the worst part is that i can't even refund it since i bought it in the summer sale"
Negative,"The worst console port to PC. WOW. Seriously, they didn't even bother to change the ""controller"" keys in-game. Press (A), Press (B), Press (R1) Press (L2); wth i am on a computer. Fine i'll go to see the keybinds and spend half an hour there to remember what's what because the game will keep telling you to press the controller keys. Ok i've just configured my keybinds, now let's play. . . Oh guess what, they keybinds randomly just reseted. Oh it must be a bug let's bind the keys again. Oh they reseted again. FML. Okay time to create a character, humm i like the details, humm okay i'll change some stuff; OH! GUESS WHAT! The portrait that shows your character has FROZEN! Now you can't see what the hell you are doing to your character. Hmm okay i guess i'll go back and enter the game again. Okay now the character is done after 3 tries. Let's play; OH! look i can kill the monsters in 1-2 hit and they done wuuhoo, (2 minutes later); OHHH A giant f###er is killing me, is he a boss?, let's try again! (2-3 hit kills me) OHH!! let's try again!. (1 hour later) Are you ####ing kidding me?! I can't kill that giant a##? I've just created my character!Besides all the bugs, glitch, dumb AI and OP bosses, this game has only presented me with pain with every aspect of this game.I can see this game being a lot better on console, but it's not adapted for PC, at all. And the bugs, glitches and bans, please give me a break. These guys have even tried to play their own game?, do they listen to the users feedback? Why are there no fixes to known issues?. Meh, lazy a## company.#WouldNOTplayAgain."
Negative,"Possibly one of the hardest games i have ever played. There were 2 types of baddies, One you can kill without any difficulty whats so ever, Two, ones that will kill you time and time and time again. 10 minutes into the game and i ran into the first boss which took me 6 attempts to kill. There is no such thing as a tutorial in this game either, i was picking things up which i had no idea what they were or if i could use them. When i killed stuff i got points which i didn't know what they were or if i could use them for anything. It was only after opening a ""Status"" window that i realised i was lvl 7 but didn't know if i got anything as a result of leveling up....It also is obviously a port from console so all the ""Helper"" prompts you get point towards console controls which is about as helpful as a talking dog.I may revisit this game at some point because it visually looks great and there may be a difficulty setting somewhere i am missing but i wish i hadn't have waited so long to play it after buying it as i would have gotten a refund."
Negative,"Take NoteThe game did not work for me, crashes after the character creation. Make sure you download and test it immediately after purchasing the game online, otherwise you may not be able to return the game and get your money back."
Negative,"worst game in the series, really disappointing in like every way, miyacucki should have let those saints that made ds2 make the rest of the game, get this clunker on sale in a few years when its $4"
Negative,play hollow knight instead
Negative,getting invaded by higher level players when you just started. The perfect game for virgin neck beards that having nothing better to do.
Negative,Unplayable without STEAM controller.
Negative,"Who cares if the game is any good? If the port is so shoddy that you can't even play it, then it doesn't matter. What kind of studio can't implement working controller support? Even tiny indie games can manage that.Seriously, garbage. An hour of my time, wasted, just trying to get the fucking thing to run. I'll never buy another game from FROM."
Negative,"I don't think this game requires a full review. If you like frustrating/clunky controls, this is the game for you. If you love yourself even a little bit, this isn't the game for you.There is plenty of fun to be had here but there are also a lot of issues I had with the game. Aside from crashing on start up originally, the game doesn't do well at guiding new players. I've never played any Dark Souls game before so my understanding of the universe and game rules is limited. I really did have to force myself to keep playing this game all the way through (I did it for the two friends I played through it with), I don't think games should require you to force yourself to enjoy them.Perhaps this is a great game and I just don't see that part of it. I think the game is beautiful in some ways but I just can't recommend it to anyone, not for more than $20."
Negative,"dont buy this game if you own windows 10. You'd think a xbox one controller would plug in and work np. nope 2 pc's testing both a xbox 1 and ps4 controllers, the buttons worked but the sticks wouldnt.  whats funny is demon souls 2 doesnt have this issue.  anyways i did everything from uninstall updates, disable hid stuff, roll back drivers. begged for help on a lot of forums. no one had a solution. found some deep microsoft community threads that microsoft busted the drivers in the latested updates  and is why for a lot of people cant play a lot of older games that use xinput. anyways im going to go in for a refund. really wanted to play this game but all my hype for it is now gone. just spent too much time just tryi ng to get a basic thing like a controller to work."
Negative,"They still have cheaters infesting the multiplayer everywhere. Don't buy for the PVP, you will be disappointed.BANDAI, GET VAC YA CHEAP BASTARDS!"
Negative,"TLDR: Buy if on sale only.Wish steam wasn't so black and white and I could rate ""meh"" instead of ""yes"" or ""no""...I like this game and it is addicting as hell, and I will definitely keep playing, but it is also overhyped and I feel like you should know these before buying:First of all, the game refuses to address mouse and keyboard... every single tooltip in the game is made for controllers... you need to waste lots of time and energy to figure out the keyboard controls.I've tried the controller controls after playing on keyboard for a day and seems like the tutorial even lies to controller users at least once... (on parry message)The game gives you basic tutorial on controls then you are left for yourself... ""browse the wiki and forums or get lost kid...""The camera is a pain in the back. I move the camera so the enemy is in the middle of the screen while my character is running towards the camera (away from the enemy) and press the camera lock key that is supposed to lock the camera on the enemy so it is always in the middle.What happens is: My character isn't facing the enemy so I can't lock on it. As if this wasn't enough, the lock key turns the camera to look where my character is looking... and I'm pressing the backwards button so while my camera is doing a 180 degrees roll, my charater also does that and dies. ""Oh you would get mutilated if you let them close the distance by a matter of milimeters? Your problem biatch, we are too lazy to program proper controls, git gud instead!""Camera locks also doesn't work medium to long ranges. It's extremely low ranged.You can't strafe. You have multiple enemy archers in front of you and want to close in on them with your shield up while trying to walk around obstacles? HAHA GOOD LUCK KID! Your character is either facing the archers or walking around obstacles. Won't do both!The game is also riddled with bugs... like a giant crab hitting you VERTICALLY while there is a hugeass tree between you. It just hits you over the damn tree.I feel like the developers are using this ""git gudery"" they have spread about the game to be able to ignore bugs like this and other bugs like the crazy and sometimes even random hitboxes. I can record the damn game and still fail to see on slow motion how on earth something hits me while another thing goes straight through my face and nothing happens.Speaking of going through my face... the very first boss' 2nd form is a joke. It's a walking mass of visual bugs. It almost always clips through the terrain and you. It feels like they have made it so you can't properly see the 2 important parts: the weapon and the mutated hand... everything else is just taking up huge space and causing a glitchy mess without having any importance combat mechanics wise...The multiplayer is plain ridiculous: ""You want to coop? Oh well, you must also PvP then! Oh and you'll love PvP because we don't give a flying crap if you are matched with people from the other side of the freaking planet. Enjoy the lagfest, loser!""It's so funny when the guy hits the air 3 meters next to me and I get hit. (No, it's not funny)I have the best B2C internet in my country (1 Gb/s) and still feel like PvP is unenjoyable.Well if you know the guy you want to coop with (instead of random people) then you can use passwords but I'm not sure if that keeps the PvPers out of your world.First non-tutorial boss is placed very close to some (if not the) last boss. The first boss' area is even turned to a spawning point after you kill it so the high level people will spawn there and run towards the other boss and summon you on the way, even if you have placed your summoning mark in front of the lower boss' entrance. They don't give a crap. The only way you can stop them is by blocking all communication to them on steam. I find that a bit harsh, but some of them spam summoning on you even if you gesture to them to get lost and unsummon yourself... Also if you are farming a lot on the first world this happens more and more often as the game is trying to put you with people closer to you in levels... So around level 30 you only get these ship for brains speedrunners and you can forget ever seeing the low level boss ever again. The most annoying part is that when the speedrunners summon you, then you must place your mark on the ground again. So you can't place mark and farm the level because you must be near the boss entrance if you don't want to waste your time running back there from wherever you would be farming. Amazing...Another annoying part: The game has multiple things that you must know in advance in order to be successful. While this is somewhat acceptable with monsters, because if you die then you just go back and try again (as long as you can recollect your dropped souls before dying again - which is another reason the game's difficulty is overhyped... death is rarely an issue)it is absolutely not acceptable for items: I already have 2 items I'm missing and can't retrieve until I finish the game and start a new one and I'm just 2 non-tutorial bosses into the game. The first one can be acquired by keeping the first boss' soul until you kill the 2nd boss and if you don't know this and sell or eat the first soul you are in bad luck..The other one is a trinket that allows you to be a neutral evil kind of entity in other players' games... you can't get it if you started your 2nd bossfight. Unfortunately after the first boss (which I have killed alone because lack of knowledge of how coop worked at the time) I found a coop mark on the ground and used it and I got a speedrunner that rushed me through the next map all the way to the boss. Crap...I fail to get how a skill based game can have stunlocks. You can stunlock non-boss opponents pretty easily, though you have stamina which can run out faster than their health which balances it a bit.The enemy however can also stunlock you and doesn't seem to have stamina, mana or cooldowns... and also outnumbers you occasionally. Two mobs with daggers can pretty much kill you if you are making a single mistake without giving you a second chance.Also beware of mobs with polearms. Those are crazy. A guy with a 2 meters long pointy stick can destroy you on any range (with or without stunlock) because apparently you do not only need to fear the pointy end, but the whole damn stick. I find this dumb and frustrating... especially in swamps where they are massed and sometimes have to 1v2 on narrow path or 1v3 on open area...I got this game for 12$ on humble bundle and I'm glad I didn't pay 75€, the game is definitely not worth that much. But easily worth 12$. Buy if on sale."
Negative,Just nostalgia bait garbage thru the whole. This game fuckin sucks big black balls
Negative,"Bad game, not hard, not fun."
Negative,"Going from Elden Ring to Dark Souls III, realize how piss poor the controls are and how the game would not even be difficult if not for the arbitrary poor input lag and poor way the character moves. This game shows how far FromSoft has come, but if you are buying this expecting an Elden Ring level polish you will be greatly disappointed. Plays like a PS1 game, its really bad.The graphics are also awful. I dont know why people keep saying how great they are. It looks like an early PS2 game, there is nothing special about it. The bosses are really lame, its nothing more than DDR style combat of move memorization."
Negative,"I don't understand why this game has no pause. Sorry, I cannot answer the phone I'm in the middle of a fight. I don't understand why there is no quick save before a boss fight. It is an artificial difficulty that forces you the tedious task to kill the same grunts again and again until you are BORED before to be killed by the boss, Repeat a dozen of times.Boss fights are very straight forward. Jump around like a frog to dodge its attacks with the usual hit and run tactic. Repeat 30 or 40 times grinding the life or kills you with one or two hits because the camera FOV is so close and the boss so big that you have no idea whats going on."
Negative,"Let me first start off by saying I have never played a Dark Souls game, ever. Dark Souls 3 is my first foray into the Dark Souls franchise. Let me list a few pros/cons and then we can dig deeper..Pros- Beautiful graphics, plays well on pc- Challenging but doableCons- Terrible port to PC- If you are a mouse/keyboard user then your treated like a minority- Umm no exit to desktop option? really?I am a hardcore mouse/keyboard user. I do all of my gaming on PC and feel like a drunken maid with a controller. Immediately starting I had no clue what keys did what. All of the menus are coded to tell you what controller button to push. Is it really that hard to let someone set the keyboard as their default? I had to initally cross reference what buttons on the controller are on the keyboard. After this you then realize the default keyboard mappings are horrible. It really irks me that they couldnt spend a little more time and polish it better for PC users. This would have went a long way to making this game awesome.All this being said I keep coming back. The game is perfectly challenging to make you feel accomplished once you get past a boss or area. I just unfortunatley cannot recommend to my pc brothers until they make it more user friendly to us."
Negative,Players recommending this game are masochistic
Negative,"Overly difficult, with plenty of questionable design decisions. Rolling is ridiculous. Running past and avoiding dozens of enemies again and again when you die is not fun or well designed. It's a very pretty and intriguing world, though. Just wish the game wasn't so insistent on not letting the player experience it more."
Negative,"After finishing the soul of cinder, I feel this game is more like ""Dodge Soul 3"". You basically learn nothing from beating a boss, and have to keep dodging until you dead. You don't have even a second option to kill the boss, except for dodges. Dodge, dodge, and dodge; Keep dodging, dodging, and dodging. No matter how high your level is, your enemies always can take away 40% of your stamina by every hit. In that case, you have no choice but keep dodging and dodging again. Sounds boring? Yes, that is what I feel when playing this game.  If you love a game requiring all brawn, then this game is for you; otherwise, go away for something else. There are lots of meaningful games out there!"
Negative,"This is NOT a keyboard game.  Learning the game in a controller format is stupid.   I'm not wasting time rebinding everything - still feels clunky.  Way to suck, Dark Souls III"
Negative,"Will you please, for f***s sake fix the f***ed up keyboard+mouse controls?!?!?!"
Negative,Piece of shit
Negative,too hard 0/10
Negative,"Bad camera, ugly art style, maybe good act but boring for me"
Negative,"Beware, gives cancer."
Negative,A no at the moment because when my game starts up my screen flashes violently white and I feel like I'm genna get epilepsy or something. No idea how to fix but if you come accross this review and have experience and fixed yourself message me what works for you. Thanks!
Negative,"The game simply crashes on its own. Yeah, like that ""lol I don't wanna work at all fk yourself"" and then crashes in a black screen, almost requiring me to restart my computer. I run a lot of games heavier than this with no problem at all. How can I reccommend a game that you can't play? That would be insane. I regret so much buying this game because after I discovered it doesn't work as a software in any way then steam also refused to refound me (I just got ime to try this useless software after 2 weeks from my purchase becaue of work). Now I have a useless garbage taking room in my library. I could have used that crazy amount of money I spent ot it (seeing the fact that it is extremely expensive) to do something more usefull, like cleaning my a_ss after shiting or maybe burning it to make a bonfire, dunno.Please, stay away from it until they fix that problem. I also know that a lot o people have the same issue after a quick look into forums. It seems to be a poor port or something."
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 is one of the most pointless, tedious, frustrating and forgettable gaming experiences you will ever have. Everything of value from this game and its DLCs can be had just by watching a lore Youtube video. Watching paint dry is more interesting than the act of actually playing it, and more enjoyable. This game is vampiric in nature, sucking all pleasure from the series until you stop caring about Dark Souls altogether.Just go play Dark Souls 1 again. I know you remember every second of it because there's barely a thing in that game that doesn't burn itself your memory forever but hey, maybe you'll notice a little detail you never have befoe. There you go, you're one up on having replayed it instead of this dreary pile of misery."
Negative,"So this is the first review I ever write.Let me start by saying, DS is my favorite series. As youn can see I've put in near 200hrsBut I tried to contact support cause an achivment wouldnt unlock. F^&*ing rings. and so I dropped them all down on the ground to pick them back up in an attempt to jar the game into unlocking my achivment. (Yes I checked and I had every single one. I checked over 5 times) when I picked them up almost all of them were gone, then the damn game saved. So bye bye rings. Thanks alot. I'm so pissed. I really hope someone sees this to help me. And yes I reccomend the game. But support sucks, it's non existant."
Negative,"Every design choice made in this game is inferior to every game prior. If you haven't had the chance to play and of the games from Demon Souls to Bloodborne, please do so immediately, they are all way more worth your time compared to this.Weapon infusion and buffing, estus spamming on invasions, 90% of weapons, spells, and weapon skills being GARBAGE, along with every dragon form item being garbage, pvp being complete fucking trash, poise being removed, and the addition of many rapid attacking enemies who will stun lock you because guess what? Poise was removed.And many, MANY, M A N Y, more changes for the worse.Without a single doubt in my mind and I'm sure others, this is the worst game in the entire series. Demon Souls tends to be a pretty polarizing game in the community, and its definetly not my favorite, but it fucking blows Dark Souls 3 away.And yet, I have 283 hours (and counting) in this game.As fucking garbage it is compared to other souls games, its STILL a souls game, which means its good on some level.Just... fuck you Miyazaki."
Negative,I want to die
Negative,game stutters all the time same as sekiro please learn to make a game that runs smoothy
Negative,Tunnel pathed complete crap... they didnt even try to spend the effort to give the PC players a tutorial that shows PC buttons. AFTER you spend the 30 mins to figure out how not to move like you are some kind of retarded fullgrown baby who dont know how the fully adult brain controls the body its given you get to realise the following... Over all a good working game with polished moves but a very dated idea of yeah you get things as you go trough this prepathed crap fest of same crap over and over and over again... lacks imagination. Griefing players is another craptastic reality.
Negative,Horrible control system - Played for the first time the Dark Souls and wasn't able to even activate the signs written to the ground at first in order to read the clues how to play the game. Like some reviewers already have mentioned a quick port from console version to the PC and I totally agree.
Negative,I really want to reccomend this game because its a lot of fun but the main reason I bought it was to play Co-op with my friend but everytime we group up some high level guy comes in and kills us in 2 or 3 swings which means we have to farm up the 2k souls (2500 souls for my friend since he didn't unlock the cheaper npc yet) and after 10 wipes a night just from people it makes it not worth even trying anymore...If they ever decide to do a co-op where you won't get invaded by random assclowns then I will gladly pick this back up because it is fun to play and my friend and I have had a blast slaughtering things together but till then I doubt I'll play anymore.
Negative,"I've just bitten Soul of cinder and I'm not going to play DLCs. Decent fight mechanics - that's all this game has to offer.  Lazy, lazy storytelling. More like none at all. I played Elden ring first and thought that FromSoftware have became lazy but it seems they have been from the very beginning. No way to feel for the mute idiot who is supposed to be the protagonisr.I didn't give a sh@t which of all meaningless endings I'll get so I didn't even bother to save Anri for example. No quests per se - all there is is linear and repetitive. Just some pseudo-dark completely boring lore without proper story. Killing for souls over and over again till you're fit to fit bosses.You want a good game with actual story? Look elsewhere."
Negative,"I just wish I could turn back time and never get this game. I knew that was hard, but it is hard to the point where you have no fun. Wasted 4 hour of my life. I wish Steam could refund it."
Negative,"im confused, im using a pc but when i need to do something ingame a controller symbol showed not my keys"
Negative,RIP ONLINEgimme mah money back...
Negative,"POISE COMPLETELY TURNED OFFSTILLS MAKES THE STAT VISIBLE IN GAME BUT HAS NO EFFECT WHATSOEVERBANDAI NAMCO SAYS IT'S WORKING AS INTENDED.PVP IS BROKEN FILLED WITH ESTOC/DARK SWORD SPAMMERSGOOD PVE,SHITTY PVP,GOING BACK TO DS1 FOR PVP"
Negative,"Coming from beating DS1, avoiding 2 for obvious reasons, I've tried forcing myself to play 3 over and over and every time the design pushes me away. This game is clearly bloodborne's enemy design shoved into a souls game, you rarely if ever get the meaty back and fourth combat that 1 was famous for, the multitude of strategies and ways of approaching enemies, none of that. With passive poise removed everything insta stuns you, with many follow up attacks to make sure you die. Most if not all enemies have weird delays on their attacks, rotate on a dime to hit you through rolls, completely discouraging any lengthy fights. The game is 1 shot or be 1 shot, and that isn't what souls is as far as I'm concerned. Play 1 with the age of sunlight mod, you won't be disapointed."
Negative,"This game has no depth; zones are too small, and it ends when it feels like it should be halfway through. There is no enjoyment to be found in bosses because they are all glass cannons, and there is no sense to leveling or finding better gear because the player is also always a glass cannon. Boss fights literally last less than a minute. I'd say i benefited from playing elden ring first, but the truth is, is that this game revealed to me just how much entirely the idiotic ai coding was directly ported from ds3 enemies into the enemies of elden ring. Its about as long as the first zone in elden ring, minus the stark empty void of fromsofts ""open world"""
Negative,"First things first, this game as an awful port. How the hell do you release a game for a platform and have the wrong user interface buttons? Why the hell do I have to alt tab and google how to simply navigate the damn menu? How stupid can a developer be to charge near full price for a game on a platform they f*ked up so royally?"
Negative,Just not a very fun game
Negative,if you don't have a controller - do not buy this!
Negative,"Would LOVE to write a review IF it were possible to get past the first Boss. What is it with RPG game makers that feel it is their duty to make it all but IMPOSSIBLE to actually get to a point where you start PLAYING the game they CREATED??? Who has time for that crap??? Also the game is buggy, first patch fixed a few of the bugs but last I checked some still remained. If you have other games DON'T BUY THIS ONE, wait a few months until the cheats and walkthroughs come out and the game stable. Tired of buying into other peoples frustrations in meeting unrealistic deadlines and making games that are hard to enjoy. One Major plus is the Charecter generator to can totally customize your charecter and I mean TOTALLY, but alais even that part has bugs you will have to wait for patches to fix before you can totally explore and enjoy it... C+ Grade."
Negative,"This seems like it could have been a great game if they'd gone about its mechanics in a more sane fashion.From the outset, it was intense frustration. I've never seen such an obnoxious level of difficutly on a beginning-stage boss. If it was that difficult (I never was able to beat him), I could only imagine what it would be like as the game progressed.Then there's the utterly ridiculous co-op system that requires you to jump through unreasonable hoops just to get a friend to be able to play with you. There is no good reason for it to be like that. And that's where my friend and I gave up. It just wasn't worth the trouble we were having, and the game gave us no compelling reason to want to continue past the frustration."
Negative,"people say this game is the best game of all souls like ? fuck off it is its a shitty lazy story with no actual pace , midsouls 3 is a pisstake.jedi survivor is much better than this crap that game was a 10/10"
Negative,"Dark souls 3 is the worst souls game that fromsoft has ever released. It's not a bad game but it's lacking what makes souls games unique. The world design is at its worst. Bosses are no longer strategy based, they are reaction based. The lore goes bananas and forgets about dark souls 2. A handful of enjoyable bosses and the worst dlc in fromsoft history. But its a souls game so its still better than most games, I just wish it was given more time in the oven because its disappointing in the grand scheme of the series."
Negative,Do not buy the game. It has a really poor interface. You cannot save at your desire . You cannot adjust  game play level. The bosses are incredibly  overpowered . No story line. I am not sure how it get such a high score on the reviews it must have been with cash.
Negative,"(Don't let my hours fool you, I'm a souls Veteran and have roughly 1K hours in DS3 on Xbox  alone)I hope you like strength builds because nothing esle is viable in PvP. Have fun pressing R1 to win because its that F##king easy. If you're looking to buy this game for strictly PvP then dont bother, this game is the worst of the seires and has the worst weapon balancing that i have ever seen! This abomanation makes CoD(for ex,) or anyother crap you can think of look balanced in comparison. To top off those problems Dark Souls 3 has terrible servers that will ensure you're enemy will hit you 30 feet away while they're chugging enough estus to fill a river. I frames on roles are way to damn high, its almost impossible to roll punish unless the gods controling the servers deem you worthy enough to get ghost range on a swing. I'm also completly sure at this point that this game has zero anti-cheat. If you have ever played PUBG(may you're weary soul rest in peace) and noticed the abysmal amount of blatant cheaters running wild then dont bother buying this S##t. Especially since its on sale cheaters are everywhere ruining the already garbage PvP.I'm adding this bit in hear so it doesnt seem like im just ranting about PvP so lets talk about the DLC's. Both DLC's are very short and incredibly small in comparison to the DLC's from DS1 and 2. There isnt much else to say about them except the Ringed City in what i would call copy and paste and nothing original about it. Both DLCs are lack luster and leave you wanting more. The only reason to get them is if you want aboslutely broken weapons. In short dont buy this abomanation disguised as a Dark Souls. F##k you Miyazaki."
Negative,"THE GAME IS GREATI don't recommend it since fromsoftware and bandai do such a crappy job balancing, fixing bugs, and they BAN PEOPLE WITHOUT ANY PROOF OF CHEATINGI have never cheated, they banned me and said ""Erase the game (i had a lot of hours on that) and after i did that, they said ""wait for the automatic detection service to see that you no longer have the file"" it's been a month since, and i still see the message saying ""you have been penalized"""
Negative,Controls like shit
Negative,gejm 2 ezz fak u all
Negative,If people were cool in this game it would be coolhowever no one in this game is cool except for meDark Souls 2 is still betterphantom range alert
Negative,if you know how to roll then attack this game is for you... its very simple not much to it.
Negative,"would never recommend this series to anyone, it's a poorly made lazy dogshit series of games"
Negative,"First off, I am a longtime Dark Souls fan. I completed DS1 and DS2 on the Playstation 3, including all DLC.Which is exactly why I don't recommend this game.For starters though, if you're just looking for more Dark Souls, get it. It does that, at least.But it has little to no improvement compared to its predecessors.The multiplayer co-op is still funThe PvP is godawful, and actually worse than DS2. The meta is to put bleed or poison on your weapon because the servers are so bad that the lag causes you to build up bleed and poison even if you weren't hit.That's right, people can still damage and kill you WHEN THEY HAVEN'T HIT YOU A SINGLE TIME.Worst still is that Fromsoft is never going to remedy this. Ever.I could go on, but instead I'll just say this:Dark Souls has always been and will always be the best Dark Souls. Go play that instead...Except now you have to pay double price just for some improved lighting.WHY, FROMSOFT, WHY?!?!?!"
Negative,"I don't understand. I'm trying to sound as undramatic as I can but I am seriously really confused on how this game and previous games have gotten so popular. In my opion this is one of the worst games I have ever played. Once you play a game like Witcher 3 that has a great story, great graphics, fun game mechanics and exploration, this game looks ridiculous. I got the same feeling like when I go to a friends house and catch the very tail end of a movie they were watching and have no idea what it was about. Put that feeling in the beginning of this game and let you just start slashing stuff. I couldn't even play more then a couple hours before I stopped."
Negative,"shit game, hit mid roll all the time. dont buy, absolute shitass"
Negative,Not as good as The Witcher 3: Wild HuntPlay The The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt
Negative,"Bamco's anti-cheat flagged my save with ""Invalid data"" and banned me from online play despite having never cheated. The fact that I see cheaters constantly online tells me that Bamco's anit-cheat only targets innocent players while allowing the cheaters to roam freely."
Negative,"Never played Dark Souls franchise before, but understood that game is notoriously difficult. As a PC gamer, I understand that a learning curve and differential exists between concole game. However, the Tutorial written in the wrong language: console and the game does not seem to allow for changes in teaching the game play method to learn. After 1/2 hour of trying to figure out commands, I realized that I was not havng fun and the game was more like work than play. Not worth the time at the moment, and I probably won't purchase the game again, even if the tutorial is fixed. A huge disappointment for a first time entrant into the series."
Negative,"Get this game in about three months when they've maybe fixed problems that shouldn't exist. When joining another persons game, either invading or helping, you'll find that a lot of enemies and the players themselves wont actually move. You don't see them swing their weapons, raise their shields, or anything, making invading nearly impossible to do effectivly and will provide no visual help when fighting bosses. When I fought the Rotted Greatwood with others, I thought it was just a really dull bossfight where the tree didn't do anything. It was weird and not at all like a souls boss. Then I fought it myself and it grew another arm and failed arround. I was literally fighting a completly different boss and it made no sense.In addition the game has a serious frame rate issue. You can be disconected for it, which makes sense, but the fact that there is a frame issue does not. No other game that I have with comperable graphics has this issue. And I have have a 50/50 mb/s  connection so its not my internet.The game is poorly optimized and has a serious problem with its online play. Considering that Demons Souls came out in 2009 and didn't have these problems, this is pretty much inexcusable. 7 years and 4 games later and the online play has never been as good as demons souls, which is bullshit. How did this happen?"
Negative,"As someone who has played Dark Souls 3 for exactly 67 minutes, I can consider myself a subject mater expert. That being said, meh"
Negative,6 year old game for 60$its good tho
Negative,"Wow good luck playing this game if you use keyboard and mouse, whoever ported this to PC put absolutely zero effort into it."
Negative,high level 100 are able to invade your start game. I have spent 18 hours. i am still on the first part of game. Worst darksouls game ever
Negative,"1-hour in, I think it's awful.Dizzying. Controls not natural for PC."
Negative,Dark Souls 3: Prepare to Crash edition with bonus DLC Hitching everytime the game autosaves.
Negative,"Well if i could play it more then 5 mins then i would recommend it. Since the latest pach i get BSOD every 5 min. Would not reccomend this game to anyoone.Its way past release date, and its still isnt working...When it works its a great game, but it is a bit buggy with nvidia updates. So besides occational BSOD its a great game. But until it is fixed i would not recommend it at full price."
Negative,"absolutely disgusting, there is no consistency, enemies have spontaneous infinite damage, there is no skill only trial an error and you cant outrun or dodge any homing attacks. Needs a total overhaul to be even worthy of being called a game"
Negative,i havent played it
Negative,"THE MOST STUPID , FRUSTRATING ,  UNEXPLAINED GAME IVE EVER PLAYED, WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!"
Negative,Worst in the trilogy
Negative,"I think this one really misses the mark that dark souls 1 left, the enemies are way faster then you, always hit way harder then you, and you wont really get anywhere unless your running a meta build."
Negative,"this game is not to be played after elden ring... unless you played it before, and are willing to deal with insane boss walkbacks, and googling where to go. elden ring has kinda made all of this a bit dated feeling, it doesnt feel right in comparison."
Negative,"One of the most buggy, poorly made games I have ever played. Its mostly recycled content, and was very clearly rushed. Do not pay more that $5 for this game. Crashes constantly. The same enemies over and over again. Every boss is the same... a guy with a sword. great. Just avoid, find a better game... most are better. Avoid. (FYI I've beaten it) The game is just... boring."
Negative,"I don't want any maps, any tutorials, any other help... Just fun. This game is not fun in any form or fashion, it's just a repetitive middle finger to the player. To die a million times is not fun, it's just a waste of time. Screw this game and its developers for wasting my time and money."
Negative,piece of shit
Negative,"""Red B"" means Q and other such nonsense, controls are such a disaster that I can't even navigate the menu to change the controls. 0/10"
Negative,Poor game play.
Negative,dont buy this for pc far to many ppl need to hack or break the game its lacking a great deal in players who want to use skill. such a shame really
Negative,"I've played dark souls 1-3, Just save your money and buy Sekiro."
Negative,"60fps lock, 60hz lock, no borderless window, have to walk 10 nautical miles back, no map, camera will drift to the side for no reason."
Negative,If you play it legitimately you'll get banned so you may aswell just download hacks...
Negative,"They're coming to take me away, ha-haThey're coming to take me awayHo-ho, hee-hee, ha-ha, to the funny farmWhere life is beautiful all the timeAnd I'll be happy to see those nice young men in their clean white coatsAnd they're coming to take me away, ha-ha!!!!!!!"
Negative,"I waited to play Dark Souls because of all the horror stories I heard concerning the games difficulty. I am here to say, its true. I am a hardcore gamer, however I play games for enjoyment. I will set most games on the difficulty just above normal to increase my enjoyment. DW3 is however a purely masochistic enterprise. Its difficulty is born of how weak your character is and how easily overwhelmed you can become. If you prefer, you can play a ranged class and snipe 80% of the enemies from such distance the game becomes an exercise in stupid ease, but it is not fun. If you were like me and you stayed away from the series because of concerns over its difficulty robbing enjoyment from the experience, then save the money, and don't buy this game. Go play RE7 or another horror title that challenges, but rewards. The rumors are true, DW3 is just too hard. If this is a concern of yours, its not a good game."
Negative,"It is 2022 and this game is still $60. The worst Souls game, streamlined with its 70% equip burden fast-paced rolls for the casual audience who can't dodge with fat rolls, bosses that are tuned to this singular playstyle in mind with zero consideration for the fact it's an RPG with different options available to people, sterilized with a pasty, ashy, monotonous environment, rehashed characters, uninteresting and often outright bad equipment, awful magic, generic Two Steps from Hell tier soundtrack, and the most painful levels in the series. Sixty smackeroos. No.Most Souls games have an experience that can be one way or another defined as ""sucks."" But it's a good kind of suck. In Demon's Souls, I like the way the Valley of Defilement sucks. I am terrified of genuinely exploring Tomb of the Giants in Dark Souls to this day. Having to switch weapons because your current one is about to break in Dark Souls 2 and using multiple weapons against different kinds of enemies is a slog that is made better by playing better. Absolutely nothing about Farron Swamp is ever worth your precious time upon this Earth, even if you were to quickstep through it all. It is not a good suck. It is not even that hard. Not even the cool weapon you get for killing the boss there is worth the effort of having gone through that awful place, because it's ultimately painfully mediocre in most situations, not even amazing in the situations where you'd want to use it, and you're better off with your Longsword. Even what others think to be ""better"" levels like Cathedral of the Deep are filled with gotchas and overstay its welcome. And of course, being the most linear game in the series since Demon's Souls, you can't just not go there or do a quest to find a way to skip the worst parts. Every character, every playthrough, every build, every NG+, you must do every single mediocre level you'd rather not do because unless it's a dead-end, it's mandatory.It might feel alright on your first playthrough with nostalgia of the series, but has proven to be an awful game to replay because very few things in this game feel good. Unless, of course, the only fun part of difficulty for you is the little ribbon you get for winning, and absolutely everything else along the way doesn't matter to you. I have not beaten all the bosses in this game; I have not even attempted Midir. Why would I want to? The experience will be just watching the boss do all the cool stuff while I just watch and wait to hit him twice, like every other ""hard"" boss in the game, or dare I say, franchise. If you wanted to play Souls games because you heard they were hard, congrats, you found the rotting, festering corpse. Grab a stick, two hand it, and press R1 twice before rolling away.If I want a good Souls game, I play Dark Souls. If I want an action game that is actually hard, I play Monster Hunter. Unfortunately, if I want to play modded Souls games, I have to deal with Dark Souls 3 because modders use it as the platform of choice for most big projects. That's the one bone I will throw this awful game, until people get to work on Elden Ring."
Negative,Too difficult. Keep going back to starting point. Extremely frustrated.
Negative,"Its a good game, but taking into account that From Software pretty much copy-pasted all of Dark Souls into Elden Ring, you might as well just buy Elden Ring. It's the same price after all and its an over all better game."
Negative,Gears of War without guns or a story
Negative,Dark Souls? More like Jank Souls *smh*
Negative,"I can't recommend a broken game. I can't hit enemies, and they cant hit me. I did some research online, and this problem is now 2 years old."
Negative,TOO HARD REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Negative,This game is not fun.Graphics are ancient.
Negative,"Quite possibly the worst game I've ever played. Finding it hard? Just go online and watch how the mechanics of the game work. People can complete this without any armour or weapons, it's not about how skilled you are,  it's about having a good enough memory to remember a few buttons and boss timings. Otherwise you just spend hours, literally hours just trying to beat a boss and learn the timings yourself and half the time you can just beat them by exploiting them or doing something stupid."
Negative,"Got banned for absolutely zero reason. I don't mod, I don't cheat, I don't even grief. I have loved dark souls 3 up until this point; I honestly feel betrayed. Getting randomly banned, plus no steam cloud saves, just skip on to elden ring. :("
Negative,this is a downgrade in almost every way from the previous threeit's not a bad game but it's definitely the most mediocrealso this game runs really badly my fps kept dropping despite far exceeding the requirements
Negative,get band after playing offlie -_-
Negative,"I know it is not really supposed to be a Multiplayer Game But if you have the feature in the game why is it always terrible, am trying to play with Friends and can never see One of my Friends summon sigh"
Negative,"I could give a good review if they simply put more than 5 minutes of effort into PC controls. I'm on a PC because I don't want to play with a controller, if I wanted to use a controller I would be on my XBox. Fix your game Bandai Namco."
Negative,"runs like shit, can't even stream it or change to fullscreen windowed without third party program. typical fromsoftware, they lack the tehcnical aspects of a development company... same issues they had with the original DS1 carried over several generations.EDIT: and no cloud saving... abhorrent."
Negative,"After beating Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. I decided give another one of ""From Software's"" games a go. Sekiro kept my adrenaline pumping and I could not wait to get back in on the action.   I feel playing Sekiro first, ruined my expectations of 'From Software's' previous games. Dark Souls 3 does not keep my adrenaline pumping, it's both bland and boring.The one HUGE gripe I had about Sekiro was the camera, absolutely the worst camera/targeting system I've ever played until I met Dark Souls 3....absolute garbage   I wish I would have played Dark Souls 3 before I played Sekiro. Huge improvements made to combat system between the two and Sekiro looks beautiful with Reshade. Sekiro = Git GudDark Souls = Grindfest"
Negative,"What a horrible PC port. They didn't bother changing the buttons on ANY of the UI. For example, the first menu you encounter in the game has options for ""A for OK, B to Cancel."" Yet, this doesn't mean ""A"" or ""B"" on the keyboard. No, it means ""A"" or ""B"" on a controller. What buttons on my keyboard mean OK and Cancel then? Who knows. Let's try Escape. Nope, that doesn't work. Let's try Enter. Nope. Let's try Space Bar. Nope.And that's how my very first experience in Dark Souls 3 was spending 5 minutes trying to get out of the system settings menu, because the developers were too f$*@ing lazy to change the UI for PC. And they charged $59.99 for that."
Negative,"Every single game studio can make a video game stupidly difficult. So what's the point of this, I don't get it. Also, the game itself is cheating all the time - enemies can hit you through the wall; they don't need to maintain LOS to inflict ranged damage; etc... However, the exploration was fun - after I edited my save file to have an unlimited amount of souls. But still, towards the endgame the enemies are so overpowered that I lost any remaining interest to play this crap... This game is an overrated crap..."
Negative,"Poise, it's gone. No it doesn't make the game more skillful. You could roll in DS1 but you couldn't roll and have 70% equip load like you can in this game. Less options, less variety. It's fun, it's better than DS2, but that's not hard. But do not BUY!"
Negative,"mid game, clunky controls, awful camera, bare minimum story, not difficult unless you handicap yourselffor those that want to have sandbox game"
Negative,Im so fucking livid right now. Just found out that dark souls doesnt support cloud saves so when i reset my pc i lost ALL of my fucking progress. Fuck this fucking game.
Negative,"better than remastered,but still suck"
Negative,An overrated dumb game.
Negative,"Best Game ever. Great Gameplay, Great Level DesignBut:-No Support for 21:9 or multi-monitor systems-60 FPS Lock-anti aliasing looks quite bad"
Negative,"Honestly my only problem with this game is the fact that there is almost no controller support. maybe if your luky it will work but even thats a stretch and its not just me, a couple of my mates got it on ps4 for this exact reason"
Negative,I am very dissappointed in this gameI played alot of ds 1 and ds 2 and it was enjoyable because i had character controlds3 game play is awful - the controls / I shouldnt have to claw grip or use an elite control to move the camera and run- the camera angle blindsided- enemies hitting through walls- input delay- fps drops- r1 spam and stun lock to beat most mobs/ I want to parry / I want to backstab / I want to roll dodge and use weapon arts I love this series the lore the visuals but this game play is literally unplayable
Negative,Total fucking garbage. Have played for 90 minutes and can not beat the tutorial boss. Who writes shit like this?Who wants to play shit like this?90 minutes of getting smashed by a giant monster? Fuck that. Fuck this game.
Negative,"With my first steps into this game I have become increasingly frustrated with the lack of information on controls. The controls are only given to you as controller inputs and not keyboard/mouse inputs. You can go into the settings to see what the buttons are suppose to do, but this is also confusing. Like some others have said, this seems like a lazy port over to PC. The graphics are nice and the story seems well developed, but the controls make this game very offputting. I would recommend this for fans of the franchise, but for those who are just curious, I would say to avoid this title."
Negative,"Framerate below 20 on a 2 gig graphics card (gtx 960m), i7 processor, 16 gigs ram and LOWEST settings. utterly disgusted. DS2 ran like  a dream, i guess they were just chasing profit on this one...I WANT A REFUND but it's too late now. I should keep that in mind next time I spend a week trying to fix the framerate.Such a terrible loss since the game is so fun and so beautiful.. WHY RUIN IT LIKE THIS?"
Negative,Lag Souls 3Brazil Souls 3Hackers again Souls 3
Negative,"Though I love everything else about this game the PvP aspect really tears this game down for me.I realise that this is a very weaksauce reason to give this game a thumbs down, but being invaded 6 times in an hour's time of being in the very first area has left a bitter taste for this game. I want to love it and recommend it, there's so much I adore about this game.But including a cooperative feature then in turn punishing players with invaders that are supposedly low level who kill you with empowered weapons and dance around you with terrible latency is bad design.If you plan on playing this game by yourself and/or offline then I would definitely recommend this game.But if you want to play with friends you're better off playing Dark Souls 2 or Bloodborne on PS4."
Negative,"More than 20 unsuccessful attempts to beat the first enemy of the game (Iudex Gundyr). I tried a refund (first time in my life) but steam refused because it was too late. This game is seriously broken. You got a small tutorial were you learn several game mechanics, but most of them are useless (block, parry, flask) against the first enemy. I really don't get the point of this game : maybe the developpers just want to humiliate the players and see you crying under your desk.Also the lightings are flat, the graphisms are a bit uninspired. The game controls feels slow or uncomfortable (a lot of useless frames at the end of each animations) and I had to play with the keyboard because my controller was not recognized. You think you'll experience an epic chivalrous adventure and you get a japanese sauce game with a dude rolling on the floor and black tentacles... DONT BUY IT! (if I could give my license to you for free, I would do it)."
Negative,"It looks like it could be fun. But half of the actions aren't bound for keyboard/mouse play. I don't want to be forced to use a gamepad. So, take this bad review and suck it."
Negative,it kinda sucks.
Negative,Effin console port.  Wish I knew that before buying.  Total PoS for PC.
Negative,Way too expensive for the superior entry of a bad series of games that's now over six years old.
Negative,CANT EVEN FUCKING FINISH THE First fucking BOSS THE CAMERA ANGEL IS FUCK POOR 0/10  MARIO<3
Negative,"I love this game series and this game , just too fucking bad that it's broken beyond use. FPS crashes constantly . I've tried everything and nothing works for more than a couple minutes. Very poor port from a console . Fix your goddamn shit."
Negative,"Silly bosses make for an easy game, get elder rings; a much more difficult game with more fun mechanics."
Negative,"This game sucks ass, you get invaded constantly, super troll hitboxes, and extrememly unfair boss fights. Would never recommend this game to anyone."
Negative,"Just hard for the sake of being hard. Basically running to the bosses and level up simulator. Some areas almost impossible to navigate, pretty bad game design with f you style RNG on mobs and bosses."
Negative,"I love dark souls, but they just failed too miserably this time with the technical part. Completely unplayable on too many hardware setups."
Negative,"These games are all quite boring, you just walk around fighting random shit. Combat is not fun, you just dodge and roll and backstab and hit. That's literally it. The games graphics are okay, except for everything is so fucking dark and grey. Even the whites end up grey after going through such a filter. Absolutely zero story, only lore. Movement doesn't feel good, either."
Negative,"Still can't beat the first boss... over 10 tries. Considering it's the start of the game, and I can't experience any of the so-called incredible content, though I imagine it yields more frustration, there's no good recommendation I can give./ragequitAnd don't tell me to get good."
Negative,"Dark Souls 3 is a  redundant game. The entire game simply tries to ride the coattails of the original Dark Souls instead of doing anything interesting on its own. ""Hey, remember Anor Londo? How about Lost Izalith? Firelink Shrine? We're too lazy to design new areas so we're  going  to put them in  this game for no real  reason.  Pretend it's because time is convoluted or something. You Dark Souls  fans have made  up excuses for pretty  much every other aspect of this series' illogical lore so  I'm sure you'll find some  way to justify this too."" ""Haha, remember Siegmeyer? Andre? Gwyndolin? Gwyn? Lol remember that  time when we made a good game five years ago?""The weapon arts introduced  in this game sound extremely cool on  paper. They make it sound like you'll be able to do cool attacks like Kirito from Sword Art Online. Unfortunately, they are extremely bland in practice. They're advertised as if each weapon has its own cool and unique attack, but in reality there are about 5 different types of weapon arts that each weapon falls into (and none of them are worth using).The bottom line is that Dark Souls 3 is a forgery of the original Dark Souls. You'd be better off with just playing the original since this is just a more expensive and less interesting version of it."
Negative,First bonfire crashes game.Randomly dropping framerate is hardest boss ever.Game sometimes disconnects keyboard from system.Enemy weapons pierce textures.Camera lock is more fragile than your character.Loss of internet connection quits the game instantly.Summoned allies can't enter boss fights half of the time.Most of the phantoms just phase through the level without any animations.Git gud game.
Negative,"So... not that the game itself is terrible, Im sure it was great on console. But on PC.... I dont recall ever seeing such a lazy port from console from a big company. The game play mechanics are awful on keyboard and mouse, the menus are even worse. The prompts show controller buttons even if youre not using controller which makes navigating the menus a pain! If youre using controller then yeah get the game. If youre a keyboard and mouse user avoid it!"
Negative,"Pretentious.For some reason tutorial/tips/whole of menu is optimised for an XBOX controller. Want to use an item? It's X. That is, if you use a controller, it's actually R if you use a keyboard. But the tips that appear are ONLY for Xbox. Want to interact with something? It's A. Or E, if you use a keyboard. This crap gets really old really fast, ruins ANY immersion, having to look up keybingings in the menu / on the interenet all the time."
Negative,DARK SOULS 1 É MELHOR

Negative,Literally the worst game i played on steam (which is becoming unreliable) as it doesn't even start when i launch it plus it won't rell me whats wrong with it.
Negative,"So, I hear this game is really good. Guess I will never know, as all the buttons, starting from main menu and going into the tutorial, are for a controller. And from the few minutes I played, it really feels like it was meant to be played with one. The camera (and movement) is all over the place unless you lock-on to enemies, which makes you loose track of everyone else.I didn´t take imediate liking to the game, and thanks to the contols (or lack thereof), I won´t be giving it a second chance any time soon. It can be a great game, but it just isn´t for everyone."
Negative,"DS3 is great aesthetically like the other games in the series, and the lore is always enjoyable. I don't understand how the game has been out since 2016 and still isn't finished though. There are a lot of bugs still present and the hitboxes for most enemies are crisp but once in a while you get hit by something completely non-existent.Also FromSoftware didn't heed the communities advice and remove one-shot mechanics or stunlock. So it's statistically impossible to ace playthroughs when blind as there are certain mechanics that you have to see and die to in order to comprehend, which is just lazy design. DS1PTD is still the best in the series, DS3 was somewhat underwhelming but I got it on sale so still worth it. The DLCs for DS3 are definitely worth getting. They don't suffer from the issues the main game does as much and FromSoft really polished up the last few bosses except for one. I am right on the verge of being able to recommend this game but too many bosses suffer from unintelligent design and lazy mechanics being mistaken for increases in difficulty, shame, maybe they'll get it right in Elden Ring!"
Negative,"Edit: I've now beaten it and I can safely say this franchise is utter fucking dogshit.I had never played a Souls game before this one, but I played Nioh not too long ago and really liked that game, and so I thought I would finally give this franchise a shot. Well... let's just say my impression was less than positive. I thought Nioh was enjoyable. It was challenging, but never unfair and gave the player tools to overcome the enemies and bosses it threw at you. But this? Honestly, for the life of me I cannot understand the appeal of these games. People laud them as ""hardcore"" and ""challenging"", but the only ""skills"" necessary to beat these games is patience and memory. Maybe I'm naive, but it's my understanding that a skill based game should reward mastery of the games systems. The skillfull application of such tools and so forth. As an example, Nioh gave you a system to keep your stamina high during fights, called Ki pulses. If you were good at that system, you could avoid downtime and remain on the offensive, which gave you an edge against enemies. Nioh rewarded you for learning how to use that system. But the primary thing that Dark Souls 3 (and I assume the other Souls games) rewards you for, is being a sentient lifeform with the ability to memorize patterns. Most of it is designed to ensure death. And the only way to avoid such death is to memorize attack patterns, enemy and trap locations, and boss behaviors. That's something that virutally anyone could do if they wanted to. It's not hard. Just tedious and time consuming. And this game puts a majority of the emphasis on that more than anything else. Rote memorization.Coupled with that the incessent dying hurts any immersion the game might create. I'm VERY AWARE I'm playing a video game while playing this. It's painfully obvious, etched into every wall, enemy, and spell. This game reeks of artificiality to me. It's all an excuse to steadily figure out the proper way through a series of puzzles that present themselves as levels. A commenter I saw somewhere said it best ""this is a franchise of puzzle games masquerading as action rpgs"". Very true. Whether the puzzles are attack animations or enemy placement, all it is is figuring out all the pieces so that you can progress to the next ""puzzle"".The combat is also clunky and relatively unsatisfying. The lore is uninspired and once more, a part of the excuse to justify the whole process of puzzle solving. The combat and world is just... not that interesting.I guess most people who like these games are already dug into their trench about it. So they know where they already stand. If you are here on this page reading this, you are probably one such person. But if for some reason you were like me and had not looked into these games until now, keep my words in mind. If you want an elaborate puzzle game, cloaked as an action rpg, that is all about slowly memorizing every attack animation, enemy location, boss behavior and so forth, then you will like this game. But if you want something more dynamic, immersive, and legitimately skill based, you should consider looking elsewhere.Edit: I tried to like this but I can't fucking do it. This game is just utterly unenjoyable. How do people derive any sense of satisfaction from this? Even after beating a boss I just feel tired, miserable, and disgusted. There's no sense of satisfaction overcoming any of the shit, because none of it feels difficult to do. Only time consuming. This whole game is a chore to play. If you aren't already a drooling fan for this shit, then save yourself the stroke risk and go elsewhere."
Negative,"Unomptimized piece of trash game. A game all about timing of rolls and hits where you're running single-digit FPS every other second is fucking inexcusable, especially since there's no way to change graphics settings in the game because lolconsoles. Of course, FROM is just a rag-tag band of poor, starving millionaire indie devs, so naturally they don't have the budget to ship a finished game. This is the last FROM game I'll be buying."
Negative,"Better have a controller if  you want to play this game. Very frustrating/difficult playing with a keyboard and mouse. I tried setting the default messages to keyboard bindings, but it doesn't allow you that option. I've tried playing on and off and I just can't seem to enjoy the game with how incompatible the controls are. It's like the game was meant for console/controller only and not for PC. Wish I could return this game."
Negative,27min of play time and its one of the worst games ive ever played in my life.
Negative,gAmE hArD vErY gUd gAm
Negative,No ease of acces for PC's blehhhhhh
Negative,"6/10In a vacuum, I did not enjoy this game. It felt like a massive drag to get through the map to reach the boss. I understand the exploration is a big part of the game, but with the annoying run backs and bad design, exploration felt ""risky"" and not worth the effort. You die to mobs way more often then you do with bosses, why would i risk the souls i have by exploring and genuinely put them in jeopardy. Unlike Elden Ring, exploration isn't too life risking and there is not enough bonfires for me to comfortable. So the rational thing i felt like i had to do was run past the mobs and go straight to the bosses since that's the only time i had fun. To keep up with levels, i just found a farming spot and did that for awhile, bosses gave me enough souls to level up as well and i never really put my souls in jeopardy since i avoid that mobs that i would normally die to. I also dislike all the cheap jump scares in the games, they are extremely predictable and repetitive and annoying, like why do they have chests that attacks you when you open it, that alone can kill you and cost you thousands of souls, the simple act of opening a chest. Every corner there will be an enemy that will jump scare you, picking up loot in a building a risky because 80% of the time something will attack you from above or is hiding, waiting for you to get the item. It all felt cheap and is another reason why i did not find exploration fun. I also want to note that for its time, the graphics were actually pretty bad, the background is literally just a 480p PNG.Overall, the mob density, jump scares, annoying run backs, strong mobs, and bad graphics are the cons to this game. The combat and the flow of battle with the bosses are really good, better than Elden Ring in many regards with how predictable and smooth the attacks look while still being difficult. Not much cheap gimmicks with the bosses such as input attacks. I know this is apart of the game, but i think it could have been implemented better, using Elden Ring as an example with how Stormveil Castle is designed.1/11 STORY🔲 Bad Story🔲 Average✅ Good🔲 Great 🔲 FANTASTIC2/11 GAMEPLAY🔲 Lifeless/static🔲 Poor🔲 Average✅ Good🔲 Excellent3/11 DIFFICULTY🔲 Brain off🔲 Relaxing🔲 Easy to learn / Hard to master🔲 Difficult✅ Sekiro4/111 GRIND🔲 Nothing to grind🔲 Isn't necessary to progress🔲 Average grind level✅ A lot of grind🔲 Too much grind5/11 GAME TIME / REPLAYABILITY🔲 Short✅ Average🔲 Long🔲 Near infinite6/11 FIDELITY✅ Low🔲 Average🔲 Good🔲 Very Detailed🔲 Near reality7/11 ART STYLE🔲 Terrible🔲 Good✅ Beautiful🔲 Cinematic8/11 AUDIO/SOUNDTRACK🔲 Earrape🔲 Bad🔲 Not too bad✅ Good🔲 Peak9/11 PC REQUIREMENTS🔲 Potato✅ Low end🔲 Medium end🔲 High End🔲 NASA10/11 PRICE🔲 Free✅ Wait for sale🔲 Worth the price🔲 Best investment ever done11/11 BUGS / CRASHES✅ None that I can recount🔲 Minor bugs/few crashes🔲 Noticeable amount of bugs/Infrequent crashes🔲 Filled with bugs/Frequent crashes🔲 Complete mess"
Negative,this game sucks!!!  please remove dying and losing suols and i will reconsider this review.... yuo have been warned.....
Negative,"Was a great game at launch, now just getting griefed early game by pro's with best gear. Unplayable except offline, and then difficult because you can't summon aid. No fun anymore with the unbalanced invasions."
Negative,A warning.  This is NOT a keyboard/mouse game.  It's designed for a controller on PC as all the in game prompts and commands are set only for controller buttons.   I just wasted $30.00.  What a let down.
Negative,"So this game sucks unless you're using a controller.  That is ridiculous and needs to be fixed before i will recommend this game to anyone.  game seems fine,  needs actual keyboard support.  Basically reading the same thing everytime i look it up online.  if i search ""why does 'xyz' happen""  it's usually because there is a problem with the mouse and keyboard.  the fact that you cannot even properly navigate menus properly is disgusting.   playing this game has made me sick to my stomach,  your camera swings in random directions IF YOU ARE USING KEYBOARD."
Negative,"A polished, and somewhat beautiful waste of time.Dark Souls games in a nutshell:Everything and everyone wants to kill you, even the geography Minimal RPG elements. No story, no quests, no adventure. Just little scraps of imagery and speculationNo meaningful or memorable NPCs, everyone is the same exact glorified madman/vending machineBoring, repetitive, insane amount of backtracking You feel worthless, insignificant and unimportant all the timeBare bones, monotonous lore that will leave you even more disappointed if you decide to look into itSome enemies, especially bosses are interesting at first, challenging. But lose all their appeal after 5 retries.The online element is interesting, but boring. And you feel dirty if you let people fight your battles for you. Very toxic too if you are new to the game and don't know any veterans yetAnimations, music, sounds and engine are fine, alwaysAwful labyrinthian map designs that split into 100 different paths. You feel both lost and in the wrong place at all times. Never knowing if you're heading out, or deeper in. And in the late parts of the game, the corridors just kept splitting and splitting. Severe lack of linearityExploits, illusory walls, weird quests that you didn't even know about, a million secrets that no one really notices without some help - all make you feel like a loser for not discovering them. The game is full of nonsense like that.and much more..TLDR: Fighing bosses is the only fun thing in this game, but once you beat them it's back to the nonsensical world of boring travel and insane copy-pasted NPCsMajor waste of time, avoid if you can"
Negative,"rusty, dusty, musty, scrappy, stinky, retardy piece of junk. i wouldve refunded if i could. this game is the video game version of my earwax"
Negative,the game is shit. Thought I would like it since I enjoyed elden ring but no. This game feels like the kmart edition of elden ring. Super clunky and the opposite of fun.
Negative,"This game was simply a money grab. The name had fans going crazy, yet the game mechanics are the same. Maybe even worse than before. Hate it."
Negative,"DS3 reminded me why I don't play japanese games.They just can't make a decent camera, controls or PC port to save their bloody lives."
Negative,"Anime soulsGanker souls Estus soulsLadder game soulsNo poise soulsEverything, but not DARK SOULS....thanks Myazaki!"
Negative,bought this to play with Ray. Never played with me.
Negative,Invading is the worst feature on that planet. Ruined the entire game.
Negative,"Maybe this game would be ok with a controller. For me, it feels like a shitty console to PC port, plays like a shitty console to PC port and was total crap on keyboard and mouse. I played for about an hour and hated every minute. Uninstalled and requested a refund via Steam. Again - probably plays fine with a controller on PC, but its not for me."
Negative,Whats wrong with DS3?well...Loading screen takes ages(5+mins)You can invade people almost from the start and fuck up their game1.st boss is not supposed to make ppl ragequit...Takes 60 Euro for this game? bought it for 12 Euro on g.2.a xD plz steam...
Negative,"WORSE GAME I EVER PLAYED. Do not buy! And I played thousands. Graphics very bad (with all maxed out). Controls on PC suck hard, game/camera spins in place while you atack monters, making it imposible to focus ur atacks or dodge if u want too. The training mode is plain stupid, you get tips on how to play on Xbox Console while you play this on PC (u get sugestion on what buttons to press on a Xbox Controller). If u rest to replenish hp all mombs respawn. Blocking an atack makes you take dmg. There is no story so far. Mana does not regenerate on his own like all the other games out there. Audio is very poor. Over all score: 2/10. I don't know who they bribed to get those scores they are advertising. By the scores they are advertising should be close as the Witcher III, yet is close to Supaplex. Very dissapointed."
Negative,"How do you people like this game? It isn't just that it is difficult - it is difficult because the controls are completely wonky. The camera angle makes combat nearly impossible. How can there be so much lag on a local game? An attack takes you through the enemy, then you get stuck on the other side, unable to turn around. Seriously? This is supposed to be fun? I've played games that need timing and blocks, dodges, etc. that were implemented so much better than this, like Darksiders II. Even MMO combat that required timing rather than autotargeting can be much better, like Tera, with less lag. If you like it, great, but if you're on the fence, stay there."
Negative,"Not only is this game a clone of Dark Souls 1, and by saying a clone I mean it, it has no features imported from Dark Souls 2 at all. So if you are departing from Dark Souls 2 do not expect all the goodies be included in DS3(yeah no malrond assassin style npcs, mirror knight style bosses and so on) Second  to play this and have an experience promised you need to have A BLAZING LIGHT SPEED FAST internet!(I have best internet plan right before fiber, so if you are on fiber you are ok) Otherwise be prepared to face bosses alone, as your phantoms will not get through the fog gate leaving you 1v1 with the boss and invincible invaders (only your fellow phantoms will be able to spank their ****, while your almighty strikes drown in lag). So here is a summary:*Pros*•DS1 experience nostalgia you craved all these years•Stylish few new armours •Stylish few new weapons•An interesting lore you have never seen before (as elaborate as this rhyme I just inserted)•A difficulty level with so much grinding, that your teeth will turn into powder• New poise system which will blow your mind*Cons*•Phantoms are so helpful, they aren’t needed in the boss rooms•NetCode is so good it will make you invincible, quite literally•Too much of the reused content (did you even read my review?!!!)"
Negative,pretty bad game just like all the souls games x3
Negative,60 FUCKING DOLLARS!!?
Negative,I really tried to like this game but elden ring is better in ever fucking way
Negative,Do not Buy is you plan to play with PC using keyboard and mouse!this is not a PC game like 99% others!ASK MONEY BACK!
Negative,one of the worst games ever !!! kappa
Negative,"had to google how to find a doll to get to the next area of the game cause the game doesn't tell you anything, and holy shiiiit, there was no way I was going to figure that out by myself, honestly, I get that it doesn't want to hold your hand, but I don't got time to just go through each level of the game looking for a doll. it takes too much time to kill a boss. Shouldn't have to go to youtube to save me 8 hours of searching, game should at least give you a hint."
Negative,"This series has a reputation for being hard.  But the hard comes from totally bad controls, camera, UI, and design.  Holy cow I can't say enough bad things about this game.  The fact that you need a guide just to figure out how to make co-op work is mind boggling."
Negative,too hard add easier difculteez
Negative,"Can't say I'd recommend it, pvp is shit and the game has no replayability because the map is too linear. Dark souls 1&2 were much better."
Negative,Not working. 0/10.
Negative,the first boss is op and needs a nerf
Negative,Has a weird bug where the input gets stuck after you release a key. Happens with both Mouse+KB and Xbox360 controller. Gets worse as the game progresses.
Negative,"Graphics: meh..Plot: I don't knowControlling: It's okayDifficulty: This game is easy af, choose Deprived and kill every bosses with only one hitTotally Feeling: Not badI just want to DISLIKE this game for no reason"
Negative,"The keyboard and mouse controls are ridiculous, tooltips and tutorials ALL refer to the controller buttons and not to the keyboard/mouse even when you don't have one present, plus that can't be changed, wich I find unacceptable making the game extremely confusing until you get absolutelly used to the default keys.Even for a port, it's a triple A on it's 3rd title--you'd expect that the developers would have this fundamental feature 'ajusted' if they are really going to release a PC version, at very least. Full not-sale price doesn't help the cause either, it's not just a thrown in port bargain, it's rather pricey, and it doesn't deliver.I didn't had time to check the rest of the game, the very first hour was just figuring out controls, combat moves, and to wich keyboard key a given controller tooltip refers to... annoying enough for a refund."
Negative,"Worst souls game. It's not markedly more difficult than DS1(although it is), don't believe the rumors about Pontiff/NK/etc being hard because they were not. It doesn't have a very good world either and I struggle to find a single theme in it that wasn't satisfactorily covered in DS1. It's just redundancy to a game that didn't need redundancy. DS3 is a decent game, I guess, but I'm not recommending it because Elden Ring is a game that plays like it gameplay wise but has much better bosses, story, and world. Buy that instead"
Negative,"Great game, although lots of client issues. I get tons of frame drops all the tame and I've had a few random crashes although not that many.Worst experience was that the client froze for 30-60 seconds and when I came back I was back at the bonfire so I somehow died while frozen. The lag/freezing/crashing is more frustarting than the bosses (lol) so I would not currently recommend until this is fixed."
Negative,"Doesn't support actual 3440/1440 resolution. Weird problems with Xbox 360 controller(s). Crashes constantly. Regret buying. This is after 100+ hours on each demons souls, dark souls, dark souls 2. This game is a money grab; big disappointment.Update: tried again; still controller issues. Player constantly (evey 5 seconds or so) moves to the left despite no input on keyboard or controller. Again, apparently a known issue/bug. Tried to unbind the keyboard, still moves to the left. I understand a lot of people are big fans of this game....but it is a technical mess and a big step away from the quality of previous entries in the series. It is clear that this was a very poor port."
Negative,"Fuck everything about this game and the DLC especially. They ruined poise, they ruined armor actually blocking damage. This game is more gank than genuine challenge. Every build video you find or item find guide shows you running past everything, because the game was never designed to actually be played. When a single combo from an enemy can completely drain your health bar (35 vigor btw, before someone gets smart.) and it comes in too fast to be able to react to it unless you snipe them from way in the back. Every inch of progress I've made has been purely out of spite, it isn't even enjoyable to play. Do yourself a favor and just play Dark Souls Remastered."
Negative,Needs an easy difficulty to be playable. Thank God for steam refunds
Negative,"Everyone is bad except me and like 12 others, really boring and unoriginal."
Negative,skyrim copy over all boring game total snore fest
Negative,Its not for me; I don't like a game that makes you exploit the roll mechanic on the tutorial bossPlay monster hunter instead
Negative,"Controls are shit, no idea whats happening, die tons of time, waste of money"
Negative,"Keep in mind. Dark Souls is not a good game. It has to be one of the buggiest games I've ever come across. There's no consistant logic in PvE, PvP is a joke designed unfailrly against anyone wanting to PvE with others, the mechanics are downright idiotic, it's just an all-around poorly built and horrible game and that's how it keeps you trying and trying again! It's so stupid, you'd be too embarresed to actually say you gave up on trying to beat such a crappy, poorly built game. Good luck if you want to play it."
Negative,"I played Elden Ring right before this, and I guess this was a mistakes since my expectations for DS3 were fairly high - but it didn't quite meet them. Keyboard & mouse controls are not as smooth as I'd want them to be and the graphics/ambiance leave much to be desired. I tried to fix these with mods but it often caused crashing and other strange bugs. Small chance I'll try to get into this game again in the future but for now I can't bring myself to enjoy it."
Negative,this game sucks ass. its so fucking unfair. i am f dodging and he still hits me. besides that in twin princes boss battle the boss run is so god damn frustrating and is so bad made. i have to run 2 minutes to go to the boss battle and suddenly he kills me in 10 sec. and that repeats like 4 times in a row. i am so fucking done with this game
Negative,Locked to 60fps
Negative,Games is for people who write with their whole fist
Negative,Not recommend can't play as Spice Girls
Negative,Look up my Dark Souls 2 review the same applies to this game.
Negative,WHY ARE THE SERVERS DOWN?
Negative,"Hard, sometimes spidry thing go like ahgggg but i go aghhhh harder so it kinda scary not goonna lie. Anyway you can do like ember or whatver co-op bascially. Also fucking reatdr can like raid shadows something you idk and you have like thge yellow team which is good and red team which is BAD. also boss fight the frist minute in game nice retared tekken 7 fucking debil kokot."
Negative,"If you are new to the game, and want to co-op with your friend DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! IT WILL SCREW YOU OVER SO MANY WAYS I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU ALL OF THEM!First, the game cannot really be played in Co-Op, after the 1st tutorial boss, you can buy a beacon like thing for in game currency, which you can put down in order to allow your friend to join you. Sounds good? Well, not that fast, your friend won't see your beacon unless he or she is empowered by an item called Ember, which will cost you around 2500 souls (the currency) and will vanish upon use and once you die, you will lose the buff and will need another in order to join your friend again. The shopkeeper only has 3, then you're done, she might restock them, I don't know, but if she's out, you need to grind them in the world.When you successfully have all these items and summoned each other, only one of you will make actual progress in the game, the other just comes around to help and the only thing he or she gets is souls, the currency. NO SAVE OF PROGRESS, NO ITEMS, NO LOOT, NOTHING. Just the currency. The game, of course is incredibly difficult, so you will die a lot.AND IF THE CHALLANGE of mobs and NPCs is not enough, the game decides to throw some high level, high geared PLAYERS at you when you expect them the least, in a middle of a mob fight with several tough mobs that can 2 hit you.These players are highly interested in killing you for rewards, and they can easily 1-2 hit you and you will not stand a chance as a new player. They have way better gear and weapons.Also, if you happen to attack the NPCs in the hub, especially the ""Deserter"" guy, he will 2-3 hit you to death and even after you respawn, he will hunt you to eternity. I don't know if he's killable, I never managed, but he heals himself everytime I brought him below 30%. ...but even if he's killable, you will miss him for the rest of the game and I don't know if he's needed for anything or not. Awesome design.This game could have been an awesome co-op experience, but instead you get the above. I spent the last 3 hours figuring this out with my friend and I hate the whole thing already. Wish I never made the purchase.Very good job devs, awful game to play in Co-Op.  Shame."
Negative,"It was OK when it came out; is very dated and clunky when compared with ER and Sekiro, of course.  Nowadays, it's probably not worth playing unless you're out of options.  But, come on, full price 7 years later?  No wonder so many of us are suing Steam.  At this rate, just buy ER."
Negative,"You're basically given shit controller controls, shit camera control (it's all over the fucking place), and given a hit box bigger than your mom. Honestly this is basically a game you play to flaunt/grow your E-Cock because your real life one is 1inch erect."
Negative,"After finally diving back into the game, I had to discover that there's no cloud saves. Save game gone, my runs never happened. Thanks, Bandai. The EA of the new age. Saving on everything, and diving into one drama after another. People, who follow their doings, know. Thanks for nothing."
Negative,"Terrible control bindings make the game practically unplayable with a keyboard. Who's great idea was it to make roll, backstep, AND run bound to the same damn key? I'll give it another shot when I find my ds3 controller."
Negative,"Extremely dissapointing, waste of time and money to say the least."
Negative,don't play this game if you enjoy being happy or having a will to live.
Negative,stupid game. garbage. waste my rm170. better i buy a dog
Negative,DS2 is better
Negative,"I really tried to like this game after so many positive reviews from streamers and some of my friends. That said, when I finally bought it, the first thing I noticed were annoying tips for consoles.It's really not so easy to find a proper button to click, whent the game informs you about RT, LT, B+X or some other absurd combinations.I'm sorry but if you can't make a proper port for PC, I have no reason to play this game. The lack of tips for mouse and keyboard is just lazy and insulting. If I wanted to play with pad to have a properly working game, I would play on console."
Negative,Can't get online at all. Look up tips on helping this issue and find out its been going on since launch of game. Realize the devs have had about a year to fix these issues and have done nothing about it. Definitely thinking of getting a refund if it doesn't work by tomorrow because feel like wasted my money on a game that isn't giving me all the features.
Negative,If this is suppose to be the best Dark Souls game; the other two must be awful. A few good bosses don't make up for the rest of the absolute bullshit that is this game. Go play Elden Ring. Or Lies of P if you want to play a good Souls-Like.
Negative,"No, I had never played a Dark Souls game before, but after hearing of the enormous difficulty and learning curve, I had to try it. I uninstalled this game shortly thereafter. Apparently, Diablo has spoiled me. Elder Scrolls has spoiled me.  Yes, Dark Souls 3 is a graphically gorgeous game. They got the atmosphere, the Gothic castles and environments PERFECT. But an RPG game is more than just how pretty it looks. It's all about gameplay, the feel of combat, the missions, the quests, the engrossment... I couldn't even get my pyromancer to hit things when I threw a fireball. This game lives up to it's difficulty rumors. I think I died 15 times (or more) before I beat the Heir of Fire. Which brings me to my reason for uninstalling the game. To me it's not fun. First of all, I like quests. I like missions. This game didn't have any. Second of all, it was clearly ported from the console. Not that big of a deal, but I despised it, personally. Third and most major, it just wasn't fun. Now, some of you LOVE the challenge. For me, it wasn't so much of the challenge as it just wasn't fun. It wasn't enjoyable. No missions, the boss fights are ridiculously hard (to the point of NOT being fun), the game play and miss/hit mechanics are screwed up, combat isn't fluid, the leveling system is weird... I went in hoping for a Diablo / Elder scrolls crossover, and instead what I got was a gorgeous, yet decidedly very unfun expierence. I think the positive reviews are of sadists that enjoy punishing themselves! I'm sure they are saying, ""you suck, it wasn't fun because you lack the willpower to keep pushing forward."" Meh. After playing for just a few hours, my response is, ""I got better things to do with my time then die and fight the same boss 1000 times before I win and move on."" I think this game sucks."
Negative,should be called dodge souls instead of dark souls because thats basicaly all you do in the game
Negative,Just one of those games that makes you hate everything. This game is cancer.
Negative,Obviously designed for a console. Impossible to play without a controller. Obnoxious.
Negative,If You are thinking about getting this for Co op. Don't get it. Horrible system of playing with friend. The game itself id good. The Multiplayer Co op is terrible.
Negative,Your world is being invaded...
Negative,I would rather buy WinRAR at this point
Negative,"Horse shit. Everyone says ""OH PUNISHING"" but it isnt punishing it is boring. It punishes you by being boring."
Negative,"Not sure how people even like this game. It's fucking boring. All the message prompts are consoles and not keyboard. Yea I heard people talking about how good DS3 is but now that I've tried it, it's not good. The game doesn't have any map, I was fucking lost the whole entire time. What's the story line? Something about a king something. ...Yea moving onto other games."
Negative,"negative for the community, not for the game.Nothing but hackers, cheaters, gankers,  no honour, worthless, trash players.The lot of them.If you play, go offline, there is no fun of any kind to be had online"
Negative,"It's not worth it especially for PC. The control using keyboard is sucks to the max. The camera angle also sucks to the max. Play for a few hour but no fun, its not the monster but the difficulty using the control by keyboard. Better play The Witcher, superb control,camera angle,everything."
Negative,"Extremely overrated game. I can see its merits, and even understanding its not the game for me, I don't understand how this is the greatest gift from god. To be clear, I can see how this can/will be a classic for those who like it, but I dont see it being an 11/10.The combat seems clunky and without any sense of flow. There is basically 0 mobility; you cannot climb waist-high barriers for instance. The maps seem somewhat empty in a gameplay sense, being cluttered with random enemies and little sense of loot. PvP is pretty dumb to watch and participate in, but my only experience is being attacked by level 100's 5 times who just rolled through all the damage and spam healed whatever damage we managed to inflict. For a game big on combat, stunlocking seemed the way to win. When I tried to using finesse, there was little feedback on what I was doing wrong. Did I not parry that attack? Or is it just unparriable? Guess im stunlocked to death. The lesson to be learned from that is to forget finesse, and spam the attack button and stunlock them to death. On a somewhat sore loser note, as a person who wants to main archery (in a friend coop group), invaders just roll through my arrows. Even if they roll straight towards me, and my arrows have 0 way of missing, they'd go through him unscathingly. I also dont understand why they have this dumb ""level up"" system. To do so, you need to go to a checkpoint, load the ""main town"" map, and then talk to an NPC. Then you have to go back to a checkpoint to return to where you were. Why not just have it at the checkpoint in the first place, without the need to swap maps back and forth? It seems pointlessly tedious, atleast in the beginning where you level up fast.On a positive side, I find the ambiance and world unique and interesting enough, if a bit too plot convenient. I also like the fact that it forces you to defeat a segment with a limited amount of health, with you noticing your improvement as you get a bit further with every attempt. Reminds me of the good old days of arcade beat-em-ups like Golden Axe."
Negative,The servers are pathetic.... pvp does not wrok at all
Negative,"Meh, too easy, only died 100 times."
Negative,Waste of my time and money.
Negative,"I figured out within the first minute that you absolutely have to have a controller to play this game, after getting stuck in the system menus to set up graphics.   Had to actually kill the process to stop the game. This type of game is far better with a mouse and keyboard.  They should probably put a warning that controller is required.  While i have some controllers, I'd actually prefer not to play this type of game if i have to use one."
Negative,"I'm going to be completely honest. If you are getting this game because you finished and loved DS1/Remastered, DON'T GET IT UNLESS ON SALE. This is the worst spending of 60 dollars i've done in a while. The combat has completely removed the careful balance between all classes that was present in DS1 and 2. Shields suck now save for the shortened parry window. Poise is completely broken now, thus invalidating almost all heavy weapons from use. Heavy armor is really bad now because enemy damage has been drastically increased. The game is now a rolling simulator, and if you don't light roll you're most likely screwed. Please don't buy this game."
Negative,"This game brings out the anger in me. Bad control port, bad game-play and everything is slow, doesn't tell you anything so you have to figure everything thing out yourself. In my opinion and how I feel about playing this game and that it is my first time playing the series. My overall first impressions of the bad sluggish gameplay, terrible map design and annoying mechanics behind this game make me want to put this into cold storage and never come back to it again."
Negative,"I loved the game series, but From Software really shit the bed with this. I've tried my hardest to get my money's worth out of it because I've loved all of their games, including Bloodborne, but making the game artificially difficult to cater to the LOL SO HARD streamers is an awful decision that really screws over the long time fans. Stay away until they make strength builds more viable at least.Edit: it's still not fun, guys"
Negative,"WorthlessGame is absolute trash, it's dark souls 0.9Bringing back all the problems of DS1 and MORE, removing items from ds1 AND 2 aswell as a tonne of magic and making the whole system just a crappy fighting system.This game is worthless, mizaki is a hack, he he shoulda stayed away and let the people who made his game actually good in DS2 make it.I mean seriously, DS2 has no lag, ds3 has loads, how does that work? just get the same provider u did for DS2, if it ain't broke then don't break it!"
Negative,I wanted to like this game I really did. I just couldn't find where to go at too many places in the start and found that the combat felt pretty unresponsive (with animations freezing for a second to give that effect) in terms of dificulty the game is hard as obvious in a dark souls title but you can easily beat bosses once you learn their attack patterns.
Negative,controls and design not that good.. so much time waste if we play without cheats :D
Negative,What a load of shit only buy this game if youre the type that gets excited by watching their character roll alot....refunding not even worth the 75% off sale
Negative,"This game is terrible, loaded into the first boss and could not defeat it even when trying all of the strategies online.  Do not buy if you are a casual gamer because you will not have enough time to defeat any bosses. Waste of 80 dollars for the deluxe edition."
Negative,"Game super easy, finished it with mosue and keyboard. Get ready to roll like a maniac, slash boss, roll like a maniac and rinse and repeat. You like that armor? Well fuck that shit, armor is meaningless, cool move set weapons you say... well enjoy not using them as most are too slow to hit bosses without them eating your healthbar.  The difficulty of this game comes from clunky controls, you wanna roll ? Character rolls after 2-5 seconds sometimes. You wanna attack? Lemme attack that wall or ground over there ... you are gonna say, why don't you use lock-on... well I would use it if it didn't glitch and fuck with my camera.A big plus for me at least is how the levels/maps are built and scenery. It's pretty damn nice. All in all, if you are bored i'd suggest playing it, but do not expect something hard unless your previous game experience is limited to tetris.P.S For extra easy mode, use controller."
Negative,"Two weeks into this game and I am very unlikely to play it more. The good:- One of the most beautiful video games out there. The bad:- The much vaunted challenge of this game is that you cannot save before challening places. The best speedrunners and the like get around this by copying the save file away manually and replacing it over and over again.- Leveling trumps almost all the challenge of this game. This is typical of any and all level based games.- Animation is KLUNKY. As pretty as the Souls world is, characters turn in jerky instantaneous shifts, and rotating the left joystick while doing anything results in an almost trademark ridiculous spin in place like a chess piece being twirled around. This is obscenely amateurish animation for 2016- The PvP, which is what will make or break this game in terms of longevity, is broken beyond all repair for me personally. The roll mechanic is THE defensive aspect of this game, with a handful of folks mastering parries that can be rendered useless with many of the most powerful weapons when wieled with both hands. There's simply no way to make the PvP in this game interesting. The moment the player base dies back down to pre-hype levels, this game sits in your Steam collection gathering virtual dust. Bottom Line: Ignore the Hype. Unless the artwork is enough for you (and if very nearly was for me. I had to think long and hard about whether I was going to bother reviewing this game or not because I LOVE the art work) there is no real sense buying this game."
Negative,"Is it fun? SortveHow are weapons? half are literaly useless due to bloodborns speed enemiesHow is magic? mostly useless do to insanely low dammage and bloodborne speed enemiesHow is armor? Spretty awesome actualy no uprading so its really ballanced outHow is the difficulty? Stunlock is the name of the game ALMOST ALL boss's can be stun locked now so eat a green herb throw on a grass crest shield, gras crest ring and keep smaking because EVEN THE END GAME BOSS'S CANT DEFEND AGAINST STUN LOCKINGRating: 5/10Was clearly released unfinished and most weapons/armor/spells are unusable due to complete lack of dammage or lack of speed resulting in you being stunlocked to deathHere are 10 things you should wanna know"
Negative,"most unoriginal game i have ever played, unpolished levels and ai worse than the first one, the great boss encounters everyone mentions are the last 4 bosses in the game and the rest is gimmicky trashplay if you dont have brain"
Negative,"I love Dark Souls, I was really exited to play with my friends and have fun but I started to run into problems right away. My computer should have the power to run DS3 on high settings but I still have problems just opening the doors after the first boss at the bonfire, which crashes my game everytime. I just hope that there will be a patch to iron out all the problems so I can actualy enjoy another wonderful Dark Souls game. This pains me to give a thumbs down but I can't even get past the starting zone."
Negative,"Horrible porting!  Keybindings are available but the controls are still rubbish.  There is a delay when you press a button to the time it actually executes the command.  I'm running a high end gaming PC.  Last time I purchase a console game ported to PC, they have not bothered to make this game playable using keyboard and mouse."
Negative,-1.... I am dead over 15 times. I dont wanna play this game anymore. TY FOR  ALL TORTURES
Negative,Designed for console.  PC is poor afterthought. Tutorial shows hints PC gamers can't use.  Total waste of time and money.
Negative,Not good. Overhyped.
Negative,imagine dark souls but if it wasnt fun
Negative,this game sucks
Negative,"I haven't been this disappointed since Dark Souls II.Only buy if you're interested in playing Bloodborne on PC, not if you're interested in a Dark Souls sequel."
Negative,"Terrible console port, you need to memorize the controllers because it still has the xbox button prompts. Wait until they fix, if they ever do."
Negative,"Not worth the price, the devs are absolute garbage. Beat the game a few times, including the DLC, it's just plain and not fun at all, just repetitive."
Negative,"Super long load time on boot...   Scroll scroll scroll scroll scroll scroll for EULA that NO ONE EFFING READS ANYWAY...Toon creation using presets... more time wasted...Then run into requirement for a controller... boom!  Uninstalled!.............. update:..............I came back to this game a couple months later and played using the keyboard.  I find it incomprehensibly daft for a PC game to require, or to be played optimally, on a controller.  I find it asinine that the game will let you use a keyboard but still flashes controller directives in-play.  I play PC games because I am NOT a button masher.Controls in this game, using the keyboard, are a hot sweaty mess.  Look, develop for, and release to consoles, that's fine.  But if you're going to develop for PCs, then go all-in and develop for PCs.  Not some half-assed hybrid that plays like a jank-fest looking for a train wreck.  This game is probably amazeballs on a console, the platform it was designed for.  On a PC, it's about as much fun your average trip to the dentist."
Negative,"*Enemies have infinite stamina and not bound by the same rules as player character is*All the button prompts are for xbox controller even though i dont own one*Ambient sounds keep cutting off randomly and restarting*2016 and they still dont know how to make a PC port that doesnt suck*blocking is useless, enemies will damage you even if you block and can apply poison/bleed when you blockive only played hour or 2 and i already regret buying into the hype train, game hasnt innovated at all since demons souls"
Negative,"Let me start by saying: there is nothing wrong with the gameplay. I'm sure that for console players, this game would be worth 60 bucks. For the PC however, this game is barely worth 20. All the keyprompts are for controllers. (for those wondering, you have to navigate the menu's using e (A) and q (B)).Also, multiple actions are bound to the same button. Who in their right mind makes 1 button for rolling, dodging, sprinting and jumping? Because of this, you don't start dodging when you press the button, but when you release it. That just adds a delay to your dodges.Btw, the devs have stated that they DO NOT plan on fixing this.The performance is also horribble. In my 2 hours i've had constant frame drops from 50 fps to 10-15 fps. This wasn't bound to 1 area, it was in the tutorial area, during the 1st boss, in the hub area, just at random. So if you don't feel like wasting another 50-60 bucks on a controller, don't buy it for PC."
Negative,"Where to start...  everything is bad, honestly...what is this...15 min trying to understand the backpack, inventory etc...thenwhile you're playing all the messages are for the ""default controller buttons"" instead of the one you have chosen... Then two unbeatable bosses right at the beginning, then i haven't found how to quit the game... lol i had to alt-f4...  a real joke...Hey, i have been playing games for over 20 years now... but this is about the same as constantly hitting your head on a wall... menus, tutorial, configuration, inventory, everything is a mess... Anything else is better (Ass.Creed, Batman, Mad max, Star wars, Tomb raider, name it, etc etc)...complete waste of money... oh i forgot, graphics are ok..."
Negative,"It's a Souls game. If you've played one, you've played them all."
Negative,Not as good as two
Negative,"I wish I could give this a thumbs up and a thumbs down...This game is not a traditional RPG if that's what you are looking for. There are some elements... but they matter VERY LITTLE.  The only thing that really matters is button mashing and flipping around mobs to avoid getting hit... because if you do get hit a few times... you're dead. You will die... again, and again, and again. There are fires that you can respawn at as checkpoints.What is this game imo? This game is a console game for kids with ADD. You know the ones... the ones that give great RPGs really bad reviews because they are too easy and to short...because they try to run through the entire game without reading any dialouge or doing any side quests. Then they bitch about how the game took 20 hours instead of the 60 as advertised. This game is for them. Why? The game cheats. It makes sure you die over and over and over. Impossible mechanics to survive your first time at a boss. It doesn't matter how well you know the character or it's limitations... unless you get very very lucky... you will die. That is what this game is about in a nutshell. I wondered how the hell people put 9,000 hours in this game... guess no further... so many restarts it's absurd... and some people think this is fun... to each their own I guess. There is no relaxing moment to enjoy the scenery (which isn't bad) and after playing for 5 or 6 hours your shoulders will feel like rocks from playing this stressful game.Yes, the world is a great concept. Yes, the mobs are pretty cool. The basic idea is great. The one difficulty level makes it absurd... not impossible... but not enjoyable if you want a good challenge but not one that makes you want to rip your hair out after a while.The story...pff there is no real story that I have noticed... if you're expecting some detailed cool story... forget about it."
Negative,"I suck at this game, i get stuck on the fist bosses, it makes me miserable, no matter how hard i try i keep dying and loosing all of my souls, i get hit by attacks that arent telegraphed. i hate this game, it isnt worth it"
Negative,"well, if you 12 y o and got million hours to kill and you hate yourself this one is for you!"
Negative,"The Dark Souls games have got such good reviews that I thought I might enjoy this one.  I'm okay at combat in Assassins Creed Origins and Odyssey, and the Batman games.  It's easy to kill the minions but I got no where with the bossess.  Deeply frustrating."
Negative,"Even though i barely stand for the minimum requirements, it seems this port isnt optimized for the PC... classic fromsoftware i guess.Still a gorgeous game and im looking foward to the fix so i can play it fluidly."
Negative,"I have never played a game that has been so poorly optimized for playing on the PC as Dark Souls III. The controls are rubbish, ranged anything is rubbish, and I end up being more frustrated with clunky and awkward controls rather than the actual gameplay.For example, sprint, dodge, and jump are all the same button because the devs apparently couldn't be bothered to make an actual PC set up and just copy-pasted from console."
Negative,I should have seen the signs...
Negative,cheat engine and twitch have changed my opinion of dark souls 3 !
Negative,"I started to play DS III after Elden Ring, unfortunately. The things I love Elden Ring for are absent in DS3, namely:- An Open World: technically every zone is a dungeon- Connected places: you just teleport from one area to another- Very few graces / bonlite fires: you will literally go run through mobs millions of times to reach the boss that killed you, behind hit in the process, being forced to take lifts down, up, jump from walls, take ladders, etc just to reach the last place you were at.- Absence of jump- Absence of a horse- Forcing you to come back to the ""base"" to level up? Are you kidding me?The only thing that I liked more in DS3 than in Elden Ring is that you see co-op players, so you can summon them without using a furled finger. However, it triggers much more often invasions, which also ruins the experience. Armour, weapons, lore, etc - ok.Overall, 4/10"
Negative,"Would rather play Dark Souls 2. This game is literally a dead end simulator. Half the game was cut and it clearly shows in EVERY SINGLE LEVEL. Roads and paths leading to absolute nowhere and very little to no shortcuts with only 1 main path. Every time you are attacked you are staggered, regardless of enemy type, rendering your character useless. Enemy's follow you FOREVER. I can literally take a whole group of mobs from one bonfire to the next. Its like they didn't implement a maximum roaming range on the enemys. Game feels half-assed because it is. So much scrapped content and lazy reusing assets. Wtf. Lazy design of former glory."
Negative,"This game really hates me, it really likes to make me waste time. In this game you have to grind A LOT, you have to kill dead people so you can steal their souls (why does dead people have souls? i dont know) so you can upgrade your own undead souls. But if you die you lose all the souls that you have gathered so you have to recover your body with all the souls that you have gathered. All the mobs reapear. So you have start again, if you die again before you recover the souls that you have lost to the previews death you end up losing thouse souls FOR EVER AND EVER. So you have start again after you have already started again. You can not simply use the souls for yourself and level up, you have to teleport to another area than level up than return to the previews area and START AGAIN, all mobs reapear, all progress lost, all hope lost. If you have used all the healing potions or the mana potions (yea, classic healing-mana-stamina combat system) you have to return to a waypoint so you can ""rest"". That will reset the progress so you have to START AGAIN, grind again, waste time again. And guess what, you have to be connected to a server at all time...This is a total waste of time, try doing this as a sorcerer, a total pain in the ass, you die a lot, you start over and over again and, after a few hours, you end up with 0 progress. Using the spells is almost impossible, you have to target the enemy to be able to aim at it, to target a enemy you have to be VERY close, you can not kill it from a distance, if you do not target the ememy the spell will miss. There is not a easy way to target a enemy, you have to press a button that has multiple purposes, most of the time the enemy will not be targeted from the first try and you will end up with the undesired action. So you press the button, the camera goes to hell and back, you get closer to the emeny, the camera goes to hell and back again, you get even closer, it is not working again because there is a chair in the way, you move right a bit and that's it, the enemy is finally targeted... but you are too close now and you have been spotted so you cant use spells anymore, you have to use daggers... WTF. There are some emenies that can not be targeted, you simply can not hit them with spells... why? there are some enemies hidden behind some boxes and chairs or some other shit, you can not destroy the boxes with spells, you can NOT target the enemies behind the boxes, you have to use a dagger... why there are so many situations when my class is totally useless?I do not know why this game is popular, I cant recommend it, this game was not made to be hard, was made to be dumb, you have to grind the same areas until your character is strong enough to go further. Buy it only if you have a lot of time to waste and you like to do repetitive things over and over again or you simply have no life.+The graphics-Gameplay-Combat. Just a general ""hit the buttons - consume the mana and stamina"" console crap combat-UI, all the tooltips were made for a xbox controller, no UI for keyboard, bad port"
Negative,"Amazing game and I do recommend it to everybody, but they still haven't ported bloodborne so I really can't give this game a positive review."
Negative,The difficulty level is such that the game isn't even fun anymore.  It's an exercise in patience.  Not enjoyable at all.  It's a shame the game isn't more balanced because it had a lot going for it.
Negative,"Terrible game and game design. I played Dark Souls 2 and could forgive that game some of its faults , because it's an old game. This isn't it, this is a relatively modern title.Majority of the difficulty comes from Level design Poor camera control general clunkiness, rather than innovative fights and challanges.Most of the fighting comes down to observing the enemy and rolling , which means this game in essence is a rythym game and it isn't hard if you understand rythyms.Moreover the game gets significantly EASIER as soon as you get down parry , backstabbing and get your build off the ground , in essence meaning about 2-3 hours of the gameplay are relatively challenging you get your preffered build/weapon and everything becomes relatively easy. To prove the point that it's clumsy by design, take parry window on relatively poor parry shields. It does not trigger instantly , you need to parry ahead of time. As someone who did H E M A for at least half of my life this boggles the mind. Rolling has invincibility frames, to compensate for that the hitboxes can be ridiculous.Without ridiculous hitboxes Or giving enemies insane speed , player would never get hit.Moreover the game then will use the fact that camera control/movement is shit, to ambush the player, in most ridiculous ways.I don't appreciate that.You fight Enemies who don't need to manage stamina, in general do not follow the same rules you do, you can easily get stunlocked. Healing is sparse and as you play you get more healing and stronger healing. In essence the difficulty of the game is frontloaded.Other than that rolling on the floor like a ... Hollywood actor... looks comical and I really can't take it seriously, when the game takes itself so seriously.Also one of the most toxic communities in gaming."
Negative,its a shame you neglect your old gems by leaving them without multiplayer for months its also a shame you release pc games with xbox buttons on the screen you lazy bastards
Negative,Crash crash crash. Non stop crashes.
Negative,yeah it aight
Negative,Its way to hard even on easy i cant get passed the FIRST LEVEL
Negative,"From the makers of armored core. -Pros:*Good gameplay*Fun boss fights*Challenging*Hilarious blood spots showing ""mini cutscenes""*Good Lore and story*Graphics are decent-Cons:*PC customer support seems almost nonexistant*Horrific PC port as with the other dark souls games*Same issues as previous versions due to a bad pc port (expect dark souls 4 to have the same issues)*Store page does not match the actual game in certain areas (keyboard/mouse support? xbox controls lol)*Depending on your pc you may experience a wide variety of issues ranging from gamma to crashes *Multiplayer in its current state is laughable for various reasons including unwarranted bans and/or hackers. *Fanboys harassing anyone that dares post about this game, good or bad (toxic community).-Solution: Buy a xbox controller and cross your fingers the other issues do not rise up. -Personal thoughts: They make a great game they just shouldn't hire such a cheap company to do their ports everytime. Refunded for misleading store page."
Negative,Same slop as the other 50 dark souls game dont play this garbage
Negative,"Do not play without a controller. The keybinding and control options are some of the worst I've witnessed. Sucks, because it looks like a great game."
Negative,Controlling without a controller (so with keyboard and mouse) is horrible.Not going to waste my time on this crap.
Negative,this game is dookie
Negative,the absolute WORST keyboard support i have ever seen or is it meant as a challenge to pc players?
Negative,"If you're gonna make a game for PC at least bother to change the prompts. Like me, if you are a newcomer to the Dark Soules games, you will immedietly learn that this game does not hold your hand for you and porting it without proper PC prompts really does mess with you. However the story and about everything else is excellent but the port really reaaally lets it down. :("
Negative,A total rehash of previous souls concepts now with more and faster enemies. Pure suffering.
Negative,The most buggiest and most shitty game every played. Can't even refund it
Negative,"I'm not really a fan of this genre but I have to say, I don't really like this game and I don't really understand what the appeal is. It's got great production value but there are some things about it that seriously undermine the enjoyment to be had here.Most of the challenge seems to come from the clumsy controls and terrible FOV. You'll get attacked out of nowhere from places that you should be able to see quite easily in real life but you simply can't here because your FOV is so narrow. It took me about half an hour to figure out how to leave Firelink Shrine the first time because the activate prompt around the bonfire only works in 30 degrees out of 360 for some reason and I couldn't find it. I just thought I'd done something wrong, like I'd missed a story prompt or caused a soft lock.The auto-aim function has an extremely short range and doesn't really give you the option to target enemies from afar. Kicking, in particular, is implemented terribly and seems to spitefully oppose your whims - it won't work when you want to knock a blocking enemy off guard but it will activate at random in the middle of a fight precisely when you don't need your stamina to be used up. Backstabs are so tight that you'll only pull them off about 1 time out of 20, the other 19 you'll just alert the enemy and you'll be worse off than if you slashed at them from behind.The combat is pretty awkward. Enemies don't have any stamina bar like you do so they're always at an immediate advantage, right from the start. The animation for enemy attacks leaves a lot to be desired; their movements feel unnatural and difficult to gauge with many having little to no windup. You'll find yourself relying on muscle memory because of this so combat turns into an unsatisfying game of Whack-a-Mole. There are also other enemies that are just writhing masses of tentacles who don't make any sense physiologically (to the point where it's difficult to discern each individual appendage) so I have no idea how anyone is supposed to engage them in combat apart from exploiting i-frames during dodges - once again, not exactly satisfying.I was expecting the game to be difficult but this feels downright disrespectful in the way that it deliberately tries to be 'unfair'. It's like the developers were trying so hard to subvert your expectations that they forget to ask whether it's actually fun to play. Maybe some people enjoy being frustrated by artificial difficulty but it's a hard pass from me."
Negative,"meh, not worth the money."
Negative,"Honestly, I don't see the appeal of this game."
Negative,"I decided to try this game after hearing about good reviews about it and how hard this game is supposedly. It is definitely a hard game. I usually complete all my games at medium/hard difficulty first, followed by hardest. However, this game definitely needs lot of dedication and patience to complete in the absence of a easier difficulty level.I downvote this game for following reasons:1. Tutorials for this game are almost lacking. Those which are present, explain how to play this game with a controller as opposed to keyboard/mouse. Summoning other players/NPC is something you have to first realize that it is an option! and then search on internet to figure out how.2. The difficulty was little overwhelming for me but the real issue was concept of people invading your world when you are trying hard to defeat a boss. You would want to focus on iterating the fights, figure out a strategy on how to defeat it. Suddenly, an invader shows up and you have to survive it first. 2a. Firstly, it is an unwanted distraction. You suddenly have your plate full with too much challenge and cannot focus on a specific thing. 2b. Sometimes, this invasion happens when you are trying to figure non-combat elements of the game, but the game itself doesn't allow ""pause"". For e.g. I wa figuring out how to create a message ""Need Help!"" using the in-game templates. While I was perusing the options, an invader shows up and backstabs me to death and my message screen disappears!Overall, this game is somwhat unwelcoming to new players. Game can be extremely challenging yet fun if players are allowed to focus on a challenge. Sadly this game lacks in that aspect and hence, it is a game I have decided to stop playing after 50 hours into the game already."
Negative,"SO , the game might be for you but statisticaly, its more likely you will really really not enjoy it. Your gamble!For me tho , here are my two cents :NEVER , I say NEVER let you friends convince you to play this crap if you were not interested in the first place, Whatever the argument they give you, keep in mind that the game is intended for a very specific kinda of players. If you are not one of them, you will rage quit like everyone else.The DS series is believed to have a really big player base and popularity. Its just really well known because of good marketing and a vibrant community. But if you go look at numbers, you will realise, they made less sells than many ""huge flops"" meaning it was for a very niche market. AGAIN dont let anyone convince you to try it.Fans will have arguments over arguments and will completly ignore your tastes in gaming trying to convince you to play it and they will continue to deny real facts and stat about the game.Personnaly, I would add that I feel it to be a really butched product hidden under good visuals and marketing.The movements, the collisions, the button mapping, the lack of explanations, the unforgiving ""learning"" ""curve"". All of these are the main reasons I would never recommand this game to anyone. Then the frustrations of death over and over and loosing all your souls just adds another level of WhyTF would I ever play this again.I play videogames for entertainements. Positive exitement or relaxing..not to get mad cause I was a milimiters off on my joystick and it resulted on me loosing everything  gained  in the past hour..."
Negative,mouse and keyboard controls suck
Negative,"I have tried all of the Souls Games but i could never really get into them. They are not to difficult to play but to troublesome. It`s like you blindfold and then try to read a book. Woah this so hardcore ! Nah, thank you ! It starts with the console ported interface (all of the series have it) and ends with the very clumsy controls. Cmon, i have to ""Lock a target"" first so i can strafe around it ? Thats like Tomb Raider 1 in 1996 ... to be honest, the Atmosphere is very good but that alone wont suffice for me to play it."
Negative,"There is a really good air of Dark Souls 1 in this game but for me there's too much of Dark Souls II in parts that count. Cheap add bosses, enemies with infinite stamina, enemies that stun lock you, enemies with long 6 hit combos that deal high damage, enemies with infinite poise and an entire area where every single room has an ambush. There's also plenty of areas again where you need to bait enemies to attack you one by one cause they decided to add mobs consisting of tough enemies. The hard but fair attitude of the first game seems to just be a memory.160h Edit: I honestly hate everything about this game and I'm glad it's finally over."
Negative,I despise this game with a burning passion.
Negative,I have a PC not a console
Negative,THIS GAME IS FUCKING RETARTED
Negative,"If you enjoy playing games with your friends and NOT dealing with the pathetic friendless losers of society, avoid this waste of time."
Negative,"pvp is fukkin stupid. pw protected, offline, restricted sign and STILL invaded. its broken ad fuck and ruins any experience trying to experience the story/game. only ones to defend this shit system are griefers. legit only thing worse is gta5 online. game is great, but unfortunately is ruined by terrible mechanics"
Negative,"Mostly writing this review for my recommendation algorithm.This game requires an enormous amount of patience to get through literally every single stage of the game including exploring the map, which would probably be fine if I found the game fun in any capacity. Second try at the game; I simply don't have it in me. Game should have a difficulty setting.Narrative: -/10 - Not enough experience.Visuals: 6.5/10 - Pretty, the dark fantasy vibe is appealing; backgrounds mostly look static which took away from the expansive feel of the game visuals.Audio: 6/10 - Perhaps I didn't advance enough to experience the breadth of the score but nothing particularly special that I experienced. Weapon and attack sounds were satisfying.Gameplay: 1.5/10 - Truly not my thing. Agree with other complaints about animations unable to be cancelled while enemies can cancel theirs.Character Design: -/10 - Not enough experience.Environment and Level Design: 7/10 From what I saw, interesting maps to explore, epic boss arenas.Overall Engagement: 2/10 - Extremely difficult combat and lack of progression.Technical: 8/10 - Some stuttering.Replay value: -/10 - Not enough experience.Overall: DNF (1.5/10)Game ran fine on my Steam Deck, but experienced some stuttering on my PC.I ran this game on my Steam Deck and on my PC (i7-6700K; GeForce RTX 3060-Ti 8 GB; 32 GB RAM)."
Negative,"Controls are really bad...REALLY bad.  Because the boss fights are also challenging, it is even more important that controls work well.  I'd say 90% of my deaths are from poor controls.I've heard the idiots say ""don't button mash"" but that is not what is happening.  There is a Reddit thread about this for Elden Ring and the same issue is in Dark Souls III.  The game stacks up your inputs and applies them after your character finishes his current animation.  No other game does this.  It's a developer oversight or, if intentional, they are just anti-consumer.If you want to relearn how to use a game controller, or do some meditation to calm your nerves, you can still challenge yourself with this game.  I did it.  I finished it...but it took a lot of effort on the effort of the player when the devs could've just made the game use normal controls like 99% of games.I recommend Sekiro though.  That game seems to have much better controls than Elden Ring or Dark Souls 3..."
Negative,"I hate this game....... I was told if i complete this game they would buy me tarkov, I played ds for a little and then rage quit cus there is NO SUPPORT FOR KEYBOARD, i had to guess everything. We didnt play for 9 months and would refuse to play with me, most stubborn man alive. The last couple days I completed it. I. Hate . this . game"
Negative,"Don't buy for PC. You need game pad to play and most PC gamers use keyboard and mouse, is why this game sucks.Its not WASD, its WA, S= run away with your back facing the boss, D keyboard controls, and other dyslexic key fucntions like accept/use and exit. Yes, the space bar is jump back, really? What other PC game has this keybind? And you get to make your own keybinds with these dyslexic funstions, so what. Rather play Doom with no y-axis mouse look then this.I'll never buy another game from FROMSOFTWARE/BANDAI. Terrible control port to PC. Worst I have ever experienced.Why does your attack move you forward? So you can pass the enemy to get hit in the back. Crap, crap, and crap.Let that be a lesson PC gamers, don't buy ported console games for PC play, ever.Developers just doing a cash grab and don't care if the game is playable for PC, so screw you too.frothingmaniac"
Negative,Not as good as Dark Souls 2. It's a bad linear Dark Souls game that is trying to be Bloodborne and not Dark Souls.
Negative,this game is bad don't bother lol
Negative,"Not a love for traditional RPG player. It is too difficult, weak story lineup. Don't even know what is there, why killing boss by boss. When you feel not so good just quit it, since the refund time limit is just 2 hours."
Negative,"Nerfed boss's in Elden ring, you go and play this garbage game with BOT bosses."
Negative,The game is littered with people who cheat. Thanks FromSoft.
Negative,"the game is unprihandeplly hard from the controlls prospective.i cant use a controller only mouse and keyboard. and it feels so bad! i struggle so much just to control it properly. YOU CAN'T CHANGE IT, ALL THE EXPLANATIONS AND UI ARE VIEW BY A CONTROLLER BUTTON VIEW."
Negative,"I feel the most challenging thing about this game are its shitty controls.Want to lock on? Too bad not working at the moment.Want to remove the lock on? Too bad youre still locked on.Want to kick? Too bad heres an attack.Want to attack? Too bad heres a kick.etc,,,"
Negative,"Successfully refunded.My best friend was trying to put me in this game for a very long time, he is a big fan of the series, and always described it as one of the best RPGs I can find. It's on sale now, and he pitched that we can play in coop. I saw him playing it several times on XBOX, and even at that time it looked bad to me. But I tried. And was really disappointed. For several reasons.1) Graphics. It looks just horrible. I can't believe this game released in 2016. Everything looks very bad even at max settings. I literally found dozens of topics where community (quite toxic btw) was claiming this graphics is something gorgeous. It not even close to screenshots. I'm using GeForce RTX 2080 Super Gaming X, other components are within the same level, so it has nothing to do with my PC. First off, it's because DS3 isn't optimized for ultrawide monitors. My friend was claiming graphics are good but then I simply take him to look at my monitor. There is a guide how to fix it:  - BUT it's a shame I need to betake such actions with a game that has Overwhelmingly positive reviews. Moreover, I have Witcher 3, released in 2015 (year before DS3) - it has normal UW support + it looks really gorgeous even without any mods. I guess there's no need to explain how it looks like.And, maybe I don't understand something, maybe it's some gothic design, but even arts, items, menu look like a bad joke. Fire bombs look like potatos, swords in inventory on stands looks like toothpicks. It looks and feels like a tablet game. 2. Controls. I do have gamepad. Still, controls are so bad that even simple jump require B+direction+Left Stick. The game claims to be difficult. Indeed, but it's difficult because every dash, jump, or roll is actually a gamble.When I played it, I couldn't get rid of the feeling that I'm playing old PS action game like Lara Croft in 2001. This is how it feels. I mean, nothing bad about Lara, but honestly controls could be waaaaay better in 2016. And one of the reasons for that - I realized it a bit later - is because DS3 control settings doesn't have difference in battle and exploration ""stances"". Compared to the same Witcher 3: when you're in fight mode, some exploration features like Witcher Senses aren't available while new ones are. This gives much more freedom in key bindings. Suddenly, you can assign simple jump to one key in exploration, and roll to the same key in battle. DS3 devs probably surprised now.3. Story & Hype. I killed first boss, and haven't seen anything similar to story: any NPC or book, even intro movie tells nothing. I don't understand where I came from, why I released that sword, what is this huge dark red-eyed reptile-ghost inside those knight. Something is definitely ahead, but I don't want to play further.""Players will be immersed into a world of epic atmosphere and darkness through faster gameplay and amplified combat intensity. Fans and newcomers alike will get lost in the game hallmark rewarding gameplay and immersive graphics.""I don't get the hype.Dark Souls 3 looks like an upscaled PS2 game where attacking more than once = bad & punished, spamming the roll button = ""amplified combat intensity"" and vaguely explained lore = ""epic""4. Enemies. Initial enemies (zombies or something like that) look hilarious. Skeletons in Morrowind look and move better. Oh, and by the way: archers with some fire arrows. This arrows look like firebolts in Doom 1"

I want to love this game more than anything, I'm even tempted to UN-refund and buy it again to just give it one more shot and see if I can fix (and tinker) with this game to make it into what so many have said this game already is.. but Dark Souls III *AS A PIECE OF SOFTWARE* currently is not the game everyone seems to rave so highly about.  I cannot recommend the PC version of Dark Souls III to PC Gamers at this time unless they have a controller at the very least. If you look online, you’ll see that the majority of Dark Souls III owners recommend--NO, ADVISE using a controller for this game: Because developers decided to just copy and paste the console version to PC with ZERO attention to detail for mouse & keyboard users. From every PC video of DS3, all of the game’s hints, actions, and menu options are still geared towards a controller. DS3 still has the “press A” to perform an action. When I was playing, all of the “tips” say to press this controller button and that controller button. ""FromSoftware"" (The developers) showed a clear disregard for PC Gamers here. Since when is it industry standard to use a PC with a controller? I seriously do not understand why the developers couldn’t just add keyboard and mouse options/hints.  There are several MEGA THREADS online (and on Reddit) that were created to post solutions to FIX glaring issues on the PC release.

STILL the case AFTER. 3. WHOLE. YEARS. ""FromSoftware"" (The developers) showed a clear disregard for PC Gamers here.  Broken Antialiasing - Seemed to not be doing anything since I saw a ton of jaggies that surrounded almost every loaded texture.   Low Texture Quality - Setting this at MAXIMUM only appears to be mediocre quality. Not at all like you would expect from Ultra or High settings in other such games.   LOW + Locked Field Of View(FOV) - Locked at a pretty low setting (the 40's). It doesn't help that my monitor is a native 21:9 Ultrawide, but it's an issue even with standard 16:9 monitors.I even went to Nexus Mods and downloaded mods (like the basically mandatory mod ""Souls Unsqueezed"") -- to fix the shitshow FOV & unsupported 21:9 settings.

Negative,"I have barely played it, but I will get to it soon. And I know my friends love it, so I'm sure it won't disappoint.But just for the fact that every menu and button prompts are displayed as CONSOLE buttons instead of PC keys -- I'm downvoting. Because this is absolutely time consuming when you have to 1) not get mad after being stuck in a menu for hours without knowing how to get out, 2) finally discovering how it works by fucking GOOGLING it, 3) having to check all key bindings and MEMORIZING them so you don't mess up in future gameplay.Uncool, bro. Un. Cool."
Negative,runs likeshitfreezes computerfuck this go pirate itupdated 4/10/20 - banned from online for using widescreen upscaler because game does not support widescreen natively
Negative,"Garbage.  If I would have known to buy this on something else other than a computer, I would have.  So this game is useless.  Period.  My seven year old behind me is mirroring my thoughts."
Negative,play elden ring instead
Negative,"5 fps, multitudes of crashes. Until the next patch (1.1) comes out, DO NOT PURCHASE, there is a 70% chance you will have some problem with the game."
Negative,"A game about nearly uninterruptible giant zombie men telegraphing their moves for 13 seconds before hitting every cubic inch in a football-stadium-sized area, this game's multiplayer was apparently permanently disabled earlier this year. Despite this fact and the game now being 6 (!!!) years old, it still costs $60 on Steam. Needless to say, fuck this game."
Negative,"If I could, I would select mixed review.Overall, game could be easily 10/10, but it's riddled with terrible game design choices.Combat is good, visuals are still stunning, message system is great for shipposting and being useful at the same time, enemy and boss designs are amazing, but as always, nothing can be perfect.Many areas after Pontiff are spammed with hard enemies with no balance - most of the time you are just running away.Most of the bosses have at least one bullcrap attack or even entire phase and there is no quick way to retry them - if attacks are bullcrap, at least allow me to quickly retry the fight or just fix the root of this problem.Parry mechanic in DS3 feels really inconsistent both in terms of parrying itself and which attack and enemy you can parry in the first place. Sometimes game forces you to use it (namely in Champion Gundyr fight), other time you can't parry any attack at all (for example Soul of Cinder).For some ungodly reason you can't cancel drinking Estus Flask.TL;DR - Spamming hard enemies without any balance, bullcrap boss phases/attacks, no quick way to retry bosses and weird parry mechanic are annoying af.All in all, I both love and hate this game. I love the story, visuals, combat and music, but these idiotic design choices really kill any enjoyment I have with this game.At least character creator is f-ing amazing and you can create beautiful abominations like Skibidi Rizzler (he is a mage, and his name is crucial to victory, trust me bro)"
Negative,"The combat is hard, but you can deal with that easy enough. Dodge x4 + light hit x1, repeat. But it's aimless. Where am I going? Why? How? Dark Souls 3 is the incarnation of ""kick in door, kill orc, take loot, repeat"". Boring and tedious. You play as generic goon number whatever. You don't matter. You're just meat. Story is non-existent, RPG elements are seriously lightweight, game mechanics are rudimentary and unimaginative. At least it worked with a controller this time, even if the camera and controls are terrible (par for the console port course)."
Negative,"After just a couple of hours I can tell how bad this game is... The controls don't make sense. Combat is bland. The terrain is hard to navigate. You can't tell where you've been, or where you're headed for. The first boss 2-3 hits you by lunging across the arena. The rewards that I did receive from fighting were either taken from me on death, or were so ineffective on gameplay that they seemed useless. This game is garbage. 0/10, Namco. WTH?"
Negative,"Don't  buy this game save yourself the trouble. Beat this game out of spite to my cousin's & lost some sanity while playing. Though one fun aspect of the game was creating a fight arena out those glowing stone for invaders, otherwise the invaders ruined any fun I had with this game!"
Negative,"trash game, but it's the only one with active pvp."
Negative,the game just loads nothing but black with the games cursor
Negative,Best part of the game is getting the refund.
Negative,"You can't roll 10 times in real life, well, atleast the majority of this fanbase can't."
Negative,Mid. Hollow knight better.
Negative,This has to be the worst game ever for keyboard and mouse. No other game I can think of that has such bad control for pc than this. PC players paying £40 for a console controller game is beyond a joke. I got this game for £20 I think that is still to much for this game for PC.
Negative,"Abyssal Watcher boss is the most gayest shit to exist, idfc what nobody gotta say my nigga this shit is retarded shit hit boxes, i hit him then he just tanks it n hits me back, every fucking time i get a opening he has a fucking six sense that lets hit get outta my fucking back stab. elden ring better then this retarded shit."
Negative,it is because that i have not played a souls game before but this game is trash whoever recomended this to me i hope you burn in hell and feel every second of it oh yeah the cost 60$? its a 2016 game its a 8 year old game im not allowing comments on this because im really sorry for saying this but the dark souls community combined has the same iq as a 1 second old baby anyway i dont know why people recommended the oh i dont know THE HARDEST GAME IN THE ENTIRE SERIES 60$ gone 60$
Negative,"roll, hit, roll, hit, roll, hit, roll, hit, roll, hit, Zzzzz"
Negative,"This is basically a death simulator, maybe I'm bad but I cant beath the second boss."
Negative,"This is my first proper attempt at a souls like game and it is my last.  I'm sure with persistence I could get through this game.  But I would feel no joy.  I really don't like the movement.  And when you die to the first boss sends you a bit back, redoing a section to retry the boss.  Hate that shit.  Why can't retry the the boss immediately?  I don't understand the hype for this stuff."
Negative,"Not worth the price and I got it for free.Game's too much like hollow knight so much so that it could be a rip off of said game.I miss 2017 when these devs made good games, like ark.Edit: after 100% the game, this game is harder than dark souls"
Negative,"Short: If you don't feel atracted by the gameplay style, the Play station 2 era game UI, or the scarse lore, then you should pass on this game, don't listen to your friend talking about how it is the best game and how many awards it got.Large: The worst game i ever played, from the 26 hours i have on it, i had not even one hour of fun, don't let the ""git gud"" gang scam you, this isn't a hard to master game, this is a boring game, if you ain't having fun while playing then the game is not good for you, i have played much harder games losing again and again while having fun, losing should be about not having enough skill, and, on a good game, it should push you to get better WHILE HAVING FUN at it, thats what this game lacks, the only fun part are invasions cause other players play by the same rules as you, unlike the poorly designed mobs. And even that can't compare to playing a real pvp focused game, god i even prefer to play ""For Honor"" trash than this one."
Negative,"What I'm going to type is factual. It's not up for debate.Poise which pissed off a lot of people which was removed in DKS2, is still not in.Vysnc has to be manually turned off through your GPU, because there is input lag, this has been documented not up for debate.You cannot upgrade armor, so armor late game is essentially useless, they give you a ring (you have 4 ring slots) that gives you more armor overall then entire sets.Strength is even less viable then 2. Enemies are insanely fast, armor doesn't work for shit, they have a ton of hyper armor attacks, and you will probably be fighting 5-10 of them at any given time.Weapon arts are 90% useless with the 10% being ridicolously OP.PvP is a toss up, it's fun but it runs the risk of losing all your progress or being banned by From's anti-cheat because of hackers."
Negative,"Why do you show me gamepad button layout while I play on pc without gamepad? Why do I have to search it on google? Also, I firstly chose deprieved class because I thought I will earn weapon, shield and armor by progressing. After 4 hours of being beaten on first boss, I look up youtube to see if there is any trick. Then I see people one shot the boss with Knight class because they have more HP? Then I start again and see the classes have different starting levels why? If so why isn't there any indication?"
Negative,"I cannot even pass tutorial, hell game, game should have never been made if it is fonking impossible goodbye.Edit as I tried to come back and play it, yeah still shit. If you are contemplating this game and you are a keyboard and mouse player, don't waste your hard earned money it is completely scuffed as fuck, game doesn't listen to keybinds and forces you to use random keys even if you set your controls. Maybe don't fuck up porting the game next time and it might be enjoyable for the majority of players who use keyboard and mouse instead."
Negative,"this game doesnt feel smooth the recovery phases takes for ever, lack of check points, buggy hit boxes, no objects or tutorials, mechanics of the game does not work synchronizingly together they feel so buggy and inconsistent, no wonder why this game is so hard to beat after experiencing the inharmonious fighting mechanics in it."
Negative,"I want so much to love this game. But 1) enemies have infinite stamina and constantly attack, 2) you always are fighting multiple enemies (even in many late game boss fights) all of whom have infinite stamina, 3) instead of a poise system that allows for thoughtful combat decision making, enemies randomly seem to acquire hyper armor and poise through your stuns, 5) armor doesn't seem to actually change the damage you take from attacks (physical/elemental doesn't seem to change much), the list goes on. Still one of my favorite series but FromSoft was more concerned about making difficult combat, vs rewarding combat."
Negative,"I been playing pc games for more than 25 years, this the most difficult and worthless game i ever seen, i see no point in making the game such difficult to play, there is no point at all, i want my money back !!! haha"
Negative,"WASTE OF MONEY, Blood borne is so good.How come this game is so bad, feel like this game is just a money-digger"
Negative,Servers should've stayed dead
Negative,I wish there was a difficulty setting because the game is too hard :/
Negative,The game is to hard and unforgiving. There is there is no easy mode and way to make it less harsh on a player. I will not recommended this game for casual gamers.
Negative,"Very low Reward, lot of headache. addicting as hell when able to play co op with friends. needs to take a note from a better copycat game ""remnant from the ashes"" about co op opportunities in story based games."
Negative,"one of the worst games I played. super overrated. graphics are a pain in the as, and IA is awfull as hell. very irritating is dying with two hits giving no reaction to control presskeys. also is nonsense for me trying all the time from zero once and another time again."
Negative,"Advertised as an RPG when really it's a first person shooter type game with a bizarre 3rd person view controlled by artfully manipulating 2 joysticks and numerous buttons simultaneously.  The PC-Keyboard Mouse support is so horrendous it’s virtually unplayable (Badly ported console game?) and the controller interface (I went and bought a dualshock4 just for this game) seems designed to be useable only by people with exceptional hand eye coordination. I have well below average hand eye coordination so I play classic RPG titles like Skyrim and the AD&D games.  They're too easy so I bought this one thinking it was a harder RPG. Big mistake.  Couldn't return it because I had given it 10 hours in the tutorial area just so I was confident I could never play it.Issues:Belligerently designed control setup to separate the exceptionally coordinated from normal people.  (Who won’t be able to play.) (RPGs use the characters dexterity, not the players.) Reminds me of that crane game you try to get a prize by trying to use a joystick to pick things up but the movement is somewhat hinky.No first person view.Not really playable with Keyboard and Mouse, Need a controller.Controller interface is flakey. Buttons randomly drop out, joystick axis reverts to default, etc. only fixed by restarting DS3.  Audio also comes and goes with the controller hooked up.Steam’s controller configuration is poor.  Lot’s of things I’d never use and missing things that could be useful. (no deadzone for the gyro which causes the screen to jitter but do have it for the joystick.)  Spent a whole day to get the controller working “reasonably” because I had to exit and restart DS3 with each change to be able to test it.Conclusion:Would be a fun game if it had a reasonable interface and, perhaps, a first person view."
Negative,"Cant thumb it up till they fix the summoning glitch.For noobs that means you can summon other players to help you in boss fights but 90% of the time the players cannot follow you into the fight hence you get destroyed without there help...happens over and over and ruins the experience even if you have taken the time to ""get gud"" ...what a fucking waste of a good game...and thats after 95 hrs of play. Great game in general but im Done.Maybe they could incorporate the fight skills of this into Elder Scrolls, that would be more interesting as this has the story depth of a puddle crying for rain to fill it."
Negative,"Do not bother with this game, just skip it and head directly to Sekiro/Elden Ring or Bloodborne if you have a console. Quite literally a soulless copy of DS1 with atrocious gameplay, design and balancing. Watered down as it gets. Literally has nothing going for it outside of visuals.I have tried my best to give this game as many chances as I could to find any kind of long-term enjoyment in it, but after sinking 500h into DS 2, having this be the next game in the series is a genuine insult. For as much bad reputation DS 2 has for it's scuffed experimental features and overall unpolished state, they managed to make this game somehow worse. What a sham(e)..."
Negative,what in the world did i just download? lol horrible graphics and battles
Negative,"I can´t beat the first Bossmonster. I wish, I could move smooth like in the Witcher 3. Dark Souls 3 is like your character has a stick in his Ritze."
Negative,"5/10A little more refined than dark souls 2, but still a dying simulatorCamera is still crap"
Negative,"game sucks, hopping havel is meta. do not buy, ignore my total hours..."
Negative,Absolute trash can of a game. Dark Souls?.... More like Dark Trash XDXDXDXDXDXDXDXDXDXDXDXDXDXDXDDont buy it. Save Your Money
Negative,"I had to stop playing, getting called Ashen one repeatedly was just too cringey."
Negative,"A controller is a must for this game because it's another awful console port.  If I wanted to play console games, I'd buy a console.If I wanted inferior graphics, I'd buy a console.  If I wanted inferior controls, I'd buy a console.  I don't want either of those two things so I'm getting a refund.  Even at $14.99 I won't ever play this game."
Negative,"I refunded this game.A few years back, I attempted to get into the DS games but the first game was such a horrible PC-port that I literally couldn't play it. The tooltips didn't recognise that I didn't have a controlled plugged in and everything was unresponsive and clunky.Hoping that the third game in this series would do better, I bought it to try and found that it's exactly as bad as the first one. Unless you plan on playing this thing with a controller, don't even bother. This game isn't ported to PC, it was throw to PC without a single f'ck given.Very dissapointing."
Negative,"If you're a ""Controller purist"" like me, and hate using a mouse to ""point and click"" your way through shooters and other ""first person"" games; don't buy this one,.Not if you rely on a 360 microsoft controller. I've seen some say the ""Steam Controllers"" work fine; but I'm not spending another $100.00 just to play this game, when I've never had a problem with my set-up for any other game.Complaints aren't addressed by the company, and I don't think they have any plans to address this issue. I hate this game was a gift, I would've like to return it."
Negative,"press O to dodge at the right time, if not you die. no strategy, just timing. Some opponents artificially hold their attack just so they can punish you dodging at what is normally the right time"
Negative,"Extremely poor port, control prompts stuck to the controller."
Negative,Not enough natural progression in the game to actually want to go back and fight the same enemy 100 times just to get to the lvl needed to fight within the next area.
Negative,online is back
Negative,coop isn't a thing makes me sad
Negative,"Good game but it's not worth the full price as half of the game doesn't function (Multiplayer) so buy it when it's at half price. The only reason this gets a thumbs down is because the multiplayer servers have been deliberately turned off, if not then it would get a thumbs up."
Negative,"Not the best of the series by a long shot, for neither PvE nor PvP. Basically, it's the stiffness of Dark Souls 1 and gimmicky garbage from Dark Souls 2 blended together, adding a mana meter for magic and weapon specials. Only play for coop butt-buddying.Immersion is completely boneless, you fast travel to get to zones from the get-go instead of traversing the world as one continuous zone. Lore is still a crackfic as expected, good luck getting the gear for finishing ""quests"" without a guide, wherein NPCs will literally teleport out in front of you after mumbling nonsense for a bit.Enjoy heavy armor? Well poise is a gimmick, wearing big armor does very little, both in feel and effect, unless you are aware of the concept of Hyper Armor from fighting games. Upgrading armor no longer exists, so if you enjoy a piece of armor for how it looks, you eventually may be replacing it for a ugly piece carpet later that does way more for you due to RPG reasons.Instead of Undead-Curse-Human concept from DkS 1 & 2, they went with ""Embering"", whatever that may be. So on this one your character never turns into a zombie, or something wicked, if you die, you just stop producing sparkles from your nipples which turns off multiplayer. Again, very dripless direction as the routine for moisturizing your hollowed out, decomposing skin in the previous games was an important morning ritual to maintain your health, fashion, and Multiplayer availability. Defeating a boss automatically embers you so enjoy being forced into rollspam invasion/SWAT phantom masquerade ball in the follow up area even if you only feel like doing PvE for a bit. Speaking of which:It's mostly tuned to coop with strangers at the moment. If you're stuck somewhere, instead of looking up a guide, you can usually have a dude who left the summon sign show you the ropes or place your own to get ember for helping people. This is a core aspect of Souls games and I think they nailed it. It is what it is.In counterpart, the PvP is horrid. You can get an infinite invasion orb item now at least, but invading is a gank fest every time, by design, as there is a ludicrous amount of player slots (6 players with usually 2 of em being the invaders). Everybody got their healing Estus ready to go which can be drank very quickly, everybody is fast rolling across the map with an endurance meter the size of their hollow husband's greatsword. Items that could stop this are largely ineffective or found deep late into the game. Big sleep unless you find a dedicated fight club.""Matchmaking"" for PvP is done taking Soul Level and Weapon Upgrades into account, so by upgrading or picking up upgraded stuff you start getting filtered into the higher echelons of sweat lords without knowing about it.Miracles are still generally garbage. Longsword types are extremely good, insanely versatile weapons for no reason, heavily outclassing clubs and large weapons (because poise barely matters unless you plan on trading hits). Some may say ""balanced"", I think it's just boring to the bone and unimaginative. This goes for PvE too, spamming Light attack with a sharpened yardstick to stun lock a fully plated Knight early into the game is a prime example of how the game is gonna be from there on.Nope, this game has no cloud saves. You too will lose your 60 hour playthrough if you change computers without backing up like I haven't. Yes I'm salty. No, the review is not changing. Call the Blue Sentinels, you little crystal lizard.Boring, bland, and ugly, it's just the tendency of the Souls-like games nowadays. Just play the older ones if you haven't. Only come back to this one if you really, really are still itching to sunbro for people. You can still find new players trying to make it through the game if coop is your thing.The sad part of this advice is that you cannot really play the older games as they were. Dark Souls 1 Prepare To Die Edition was sunsetted on Steam (though honestly it was an extremely undercooked port with Microsoft's meme Games For Windows Live, people only played it because it was a beloved title). You can no longer buy it, and for now only Dark Souls Remastered, which possesses similar Multiplayer memes and strange matchmaking systems to DkS3. I liked this one for PvE the best, but also had fun with PvP even if it's a bit more ruthless (this 10 years ago, I imagine people got even more cracked since).Although Dark Souls 2 32bit is still on the store, with separate DLC purchases, the playerbase was split into that one and Dark Souls 2: SoTF which is an even stranger game overall that feels like a weird mod to the original. I liked this one for PvP the best, but good luck finding people who aren't absolute sweats on it. Might as well play Tekken or something."
Negative,"Not recommended, at least not on PC. Despite the fact that I loved DS2 to the point where I played it multiple times to NG several +, I found DS3 too frustrating and quit it three bosses before the end. I had very few ""oh wow"" moments and the rest was just mild-to-overwhelming irritation (I think masochists would love this game to no end). It is not just that is a difficult (DS2 was similar), it is the unfair bugs and glitches that finally did me. I got killed multiple times by: (1) spells and weapons hitting me throught the walls; (2) losing view of the fight or of the giant sword coming at me because of camera's weird auto rotation (sometimes it starts spinning to no end until you re-center it; (3) enemies sometimes just take that one step away to cancel your lock-on target and your giant heavy-super-bigga-ultra-soul pole of doom spell hits the ground in front of you rather than maintaining the same direction (again, usually due to camera issues); (4) killed several times because the 'kick' combo on PC is retarded and triggers at the worst possible moments while you are trying to hit your enemy one last time and you give them a mild kick instead (and can't be changed unless you install third party software)....and, FromSoftware...is it really that hard to optimize your menus for PC so we do not have to go through that PS controller BS?A great game if you are working on yur anger management though! :)"
Negative,"I don't get it. Bad controls, meh graphics, no climbing even over  knee-high obstacles, and a gameplay loop which forces you to repeat sections over and over and over again. In coop it could be fun if not for the constant attacks from griefing invaders. Apparently many people like this, but it's definitely not for me. The lore is almost interesting, though. 5.5/10"
Negative,reufned abd game not monster hutner monsterh uenter betere
Negative,It's too hard also matterrac32 likes so it is infected with SOuth African flu
Negative,Terrible game... not even half as good as Dark soul 2...
Negative,"They managed to make invasions even more garbage than DaS2, And patch after patch it seems 3v1 ganks and forcing meta builds on you to even have a chance are here to stay."
Negative,It keeps annoying me with some 🐄💩 online agreement every time I start the game. Cannot skip it. Cannot reject this nonsense neither; it will just pop up next time.
Negative,"I have a PC, not a console. I don't have a controller at all, in fact. But this game still wants me to press the non-existent buttons on the controller that I don't have, or it won't work. I could not get it to work with just a keyboard and mouse. Talk about a bad port!"
Negative,"This game to me does not seem good thier is a diffrence bewtween having good gameplay and just being ganged or posined or just having YOUR HELATH BAR TAKEN AWAY, and the ai spaming the attacks so that if you block your gaurd will be broken no matter whati love the dark souls games but this one is the worst i like 1 and 2 over this one it does not even work right i think they had to have a day 1 patch AFTER THE BEATA TESTING i would not recomend this game at all get 1 or 2 not 3"
Negative,"The game has great atmosphere, much like its predecessors, but also baffling technical and (possibly) conceptual issues. Press reception may be stellar but allow me this opinion: Dark Souls III is, gameplay-wise, the hybrid child of Souls and Bloodborne, failing to reach the previous standards of the series, enforcing specific playstyles at the expense of variety and versatility. I personally like the game but cannot recommend it.I am absolutely a fan of Souls games, having played Demon's Souls, Dark Souls and Bloodborne for countless hours (about 1300-1400 combined now? wasted life). I barely touched Dark Souls II, though, so I have to exclude it from the review references.First, the game looks and sounds and... feels hauntingly beautiful. Beyond the graphics and the sound, it is the atmosphere of a harrowing, deteriorated world, decadence without remedy. Ambient and enemy design blend perfectly together resulting in a great experience.But there come the technical issues and gameplay mechanics.As for the technical issues, it is sufficient to mention multiplayer/connectivity problems and the crashes, fps drop, stuttering et cetera. Patch 1.04.1 tried to fix multiplayer but broke (steady) framerate with timed freezing, so much that From had to roll back the changes. Still waiting for a working solution.The gameplay mechanics, on the other side, are assumingly the result of specific choices. Dark Souls takes quite a bit from the approach of Bloodborne, shifting to a more dynamic, fast combat system where mobility is the key. Unfortunately, the cost is high - namely, diversity in combat styles is totally lost. Armor means even less now than before, except for fashion (welcome back, FashionSouls) and encumbrance. Damage reduction is negligible compared to the benefits of less weight=higher mobility, so there is really no reason to wear anything but the lighter sets. Besides, armor cannot be enhanced. This same system worked perfectly in Bloodborne, since the only penality for (hidden) weight stat was possibly stamina regen, but in Dark Souls it makes no(t great) sense. Tied to the previous point, POISE is simply ignored. What is the point of an ignored stat? There are countless discussions about poise, hyper armor, et cetera going on, but at the moment the game is a stagger/stunlock fest which is frankly not really fun. Let alone PvP, even in PvE the weakest enemy with the weakest dagger staggers you even in full Havel's or similar. As result, tank/strength builds are simply not viable. Another effect of the Souls/Bloodborne hybridisation, stamina consumption is heavily skewed towards mobility. Rolling/dodging is extremely more efficient than parrying or blocking. To further emphasize this paragon shift towards mobility, enemies do have poise, seemingly unlimited stamina, and plenty of block breaking skills. Oddly enough, bosses are possibly the easiest in the whole Souls series, taking away much frustration but also much elation. With the exception of spoilers Dancer and Lothric, who come with unreasonably quick instakills (telegraph window is too short).In conclusion, I cannot really recommend the game, even if I do like it. In my opinion it is a failed attempt at fusing two different approaches and philosophies. Even if the result is acceptable at worst, and actually appealing to many players at best, it is very much flawed."
Negative,"This game is good enough but with Elden Ring being out and this game being, in my opinion, the worst of the 3 original dark souls - there arent too many reasons to play it unless you are huge DS fan and can power through the BS. This game still has a somewhat alive PvP scene and it is better than 1 and 2 in that respect but...Just buy elden ring"
Negative,"Clumsy fight mechanics does not equal a challenging game...This game is over-hyped.Any ranting or attempt to ""educate"" me is unwanted...So save it for someone else."
Negative,"Do you want to commit suicide? No? Well, you will after playing this."
Negative,"Sorry but everybody, who wrote positive reviews, are just liars. No anticheat system. no small white soap stone, you lose all ember to dumb cheaters in FIRST 15 MINUTES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Negative,dont buy this game
Negative,Hello am 48 year old man from somalia. Sorry for my bed england. I selled my wife for internet connection for play “dark sols” and i want to become the goodest player like you I play with 400 ping on brazil server and I am rank 3 darkmon. pls no copy pasterino my story..
Negative,its a console port and a lazy one. for a game that came out in 2016 to not have ultrawide monitor support is extremly rare but this game duesn't. all the controls listed on screen are for a console controller as well. its way to fucking hard. I beat the witcher 3 on deathmarch difficalty and only died a hand full of times mostly fighting Dettlaff. This game is so hard I couldent finish the tutorial. like dude wtf
Negative,no reason to use any other weapon than sellsword twinblades due to the way the combat plays. uninteresting world and level design. every time i try to play the game current day i dread playing 90% of the areas just to play some of the redeeming areas of this game. go play dark souls 2 or elden ring instead.
Negative,"I've been stuck at the first Lothric Knight for over a month now. The game was a breeze until I reached the first Lothric Knight and now I can barely land a few hits before he 1-shots me, even after grinding for souls and upgrading gear in earlier areas... I enjoyed the other Dark Souls but this one is apparently far too difficult for me. It sucks too, I really like Dark Souls but I'm finally hanging up the hat and calling it quits. It just isn't fun anymore and I can't see myself feeling fulfilled by continuing, even if I do overcome this part eventually.I don't want the game to be any easier but could you make the next one just a little more flexible to varying playstyles? Don't make parrying the only option for killing an enemy, it makes the game boring."
Negative,"Was looking forward to this for a long time, what a huge disappointment. Says supports 5120, but after put to settings correctly goes to 1080. Anyhow, the graphics are a huge dsiappointment, the controls are really janky and the story seemed pretty cliche anyhow."
