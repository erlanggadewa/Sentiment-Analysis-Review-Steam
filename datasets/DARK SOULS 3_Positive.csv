Positive,yall are some hoes for not putting the souls games on sale during the winter sale
Positive,the tutorial is a boss fight
Positive,we need Bloodborne on PC
Positive,Bring Bloodborne to PC
Positive,Fantastic game but please put in on sale. I'd can't easily recommend this game to friends because the price is the same as it was seven years ago.
Positive,It's like all those anime with overpowered protagonists.Except you're not the protagonist.
Positive,"Great game ahead,Therefore try buying"
Positive,"I mean, what's there to say. It's Dark Souls. It's hard, but not as godawfully hard as the internet likes to proclaim it as. if you die, just get back up try again. Use your head. Be smarter than them. You've got infinite lives. Bosses don't have that. It's just a matter of time till you beat em. So keep your sword ready, pride in check, and head held high. It's a long journey friend, but it's not impossible. Praise the sun."
Positive,Step 1: Buy Dark Souls III never having played a Dark Souls game before.Step 2: Hate the game for the first 4 or 5 hours bc you don't know what you're doing.Step 3: Learn to get good.Step 4: Dark Souls Obsession.
Positive,"I summoned a mad phantom with the intention of dueling him, but instead he sat down and offered to toast with me. We continued on throughout Undead Settlement together despite my wariness of him and he helped me take out all the mobs in the surrounding area. After a while, I became accustomed to fighting alongside my newfound friend and started turning my back to him knowing full well that he would protect me to his last, dying breath.We were a team. The best of friends, and nothing could stand in our way. He may not have been a Warrior of Sunlight, but Solaire's legacy thrived on within him. Jolly co-operation resumed until we neared the Curse-Rotted Greatwood...  And it was then that I decided to take yet another chance and summon a second Mound-Maker to see if we could rally him to our side.The plan seemed successful at first. But it wasn't long before I noticed some suspicious patterns in the phantom's movement, and his interest in my backside became a significant concern. My anxiety was proven justified when the phantom took a swing at me with his greatsword and missed.My loyal protector raised both his hand and his middle finger at the attacker, before charging forward with fury the likes of which none in Lothric had seen. He made it his personal duty to end the traitorous life of the one who would dare attempt to strike at me, and before long the violent fool was fleeing from our jolly wrath. He rushed up a ladder and leaped across rooftops before finally dropping a harmful distance to the ground, giving us an opening to attack. My companion launched himself from the rafters and his flowing cape waved majestically in the air as he readied his sword and plunged towards the infidel who would dare spit on the tenets of co-operation and sunlight.The valiant protector lunged his sword deep through the attacker's back before he could escape, the weapon grinding through bone and flesh and rendering him a lifeless husk. I dropped down following this, and we waved and spun our capes at one another in excitement and victorious glee.But this was the end of our time together. We gave each other one final wave before my friend's body started to fade away as he was whisked back to his own dimension. It hit me I'd never see him again."
Positive,dark souls is an educational game in which the skill you learn is how to play dark souls
Positive,Tough but fair. Rewards slow and methodical gameplay. And the boss battles are fantastic.
Positive,Elden Ring waiting lobby.
Positive,"Finally beat the first boss, seams like a pretty cool game so far"
Positive,"I was in a very dark place in my life, full of depression and anxiety. Then i downloaded and started playing Dark Souls 3.  My life totally changed and I'm in a much darker place now."
Positive,"After putting these many hours, I must say that this is one of the best, if not THE best RPG. Period.It's hard, yes. It has a steep learning curve, also yes. But this game is a rare gem among the simplified, straight-forward, linear games that are currently in trend. Rare indeed for a game that actually rewards you for patience and restraint and encourages players to slow down and observe the surroundings and the enemies. Of course, the same can be said about Dark Souls 1 and 2. But Dark Souls 3 is really much more refined than those in a good way. Relatively faster paced combat not only feels more fresh but I think is a necessary step forward in making the gameplay more interesting. Also, the enemies are much more aggressive to compensate for this faster paced combat. Though the lore does not appear to be on par with the one in Dark Souls 1, which I personally believe to be the best in the Souls series. But it is still well above Dark Souls 2, which I personally didn't like all that well.I could go on and on about this game, but for brevity I must say: Everyone must try this at least once."
Positive,this game wouldn't exist without Kentaro Miura. Rest in peace sensei
Positive,Pretty good game. I've played it a few times
Positive,port bloodborne to pc
Positive,Give us Demon Souls Remastered and Bloodborne PC
Positive,This is never going to go on sale.
Positive,This game is so addictive that it makes you buy itself on another platforms.
Positive,"You don't lose when you die, you lose if you give up."
Positive,hardest thing so far was holding back the tears after realizing you bought the game one day before a 75% sale
Positive,Best dating simulator ever.
Positive,"There isnt any game that will make me feel as connected to my character as much as the Soulsborne Series has. But specifically, Dark souls 1-3.Now dont let my play time decieve you, ive easily played this 3-4x more than the playtime suggests (I also own it on PS4)As such is has a special place in my heart, it might not be the best game the bosses not as hard as some but i made a character and that character i have never had a better representation of my self in any game and ill explain why.In August 2012 i bought a copy of Dark Souls ""Prepare to die"" Edition. i was going through a hump and honestly retreated further back into video games than i did previously, I remember putting the game on my PC and dealing with the buggy Microsoft Windows Platform but i kept going, I made my character look like me like i always do after the back tingling sensation the opening cut scene gave me. The witches of izalith with thier chaotic flame, Gwyn smiting the dragons, Nito moving with his wrathful stance.And the Pygmy, With his Dark Soul. Sharing it with others. Humanity.From that moment i knew i was in for a hell of a good time. I was wrong obviously dark souls stomped me into the ground but eventually i got the hang of it, Buggy controls or not i had fun, Not just playing the game but reading desciptions of items trying to scrounge up what the lore ment and filling in the gaps that i missed. I wanted more and more, the story was great even if it wasnt offered up straight to you and you had to look for it, and i think thats probably why it was great.Miyazaki once said in an interview that he made dark souls in a similar way to what he experienced as a child, Growing up he had a lot of time alone and he spent it reading, He loved it but his favorite books were those about the knight who goes on daring quests to save a princess or slay a dragon and find treasure, However these books were in english and so he didnt understand them completely, a lot of the information was missing and he filled in the blanks with his day dreams of how HE wanted the story to go. imagining the hardships the knight must have gone through to get to where he was, and he couldnt have done it in a better way than what he did with dark souls, He made a community of people who feverishly try to fill in the blanks of the story even so complex that it makes your head spin.Then there was Dark Souls 2. I continued the fantasy and made my character look like me again, Making it a continuation of my characters story -SPOILERSIn dark souls 1 i chose to not light the flame and walked out to start the age of men, its my favorite ending and if i have the option its the one i always take so to me the story of drangleic was someone else managed to get through and continue the age of fire while i went off and disappeared for an undisclosed amount of time with a dope hat and a ton of soulsTo be fair Dark souls 2's story was lacking more than everyone expected but it was still a great game, the controls were more optimized so the game itself didnt seem as hard and the opening cutscene was great, i got goosebumps when the old firekeeper said ""And like a moth to the flame your wings will burn in anguish, Time and Time again"" and that was very true to the game we kept going for more even though you would get that angry sensation to just put it down and not pick it up. but you always do.Then theres Dark Souls 3. To me the true Dark Souls 2 is the third, a perfect continuation of the story from the first, probably due to Miyazaki having more influence on this game and not being distracted with a different project (Bloodborne if i recall) and it continued the story for me perfectly, from beginning to end Dark Souls 3 has made me feel like a bad ass, I always ALWAYS start Deprived (recommend it to everyone even if you're just starting) because i enjoy the feeling of starting from scratch and tearing my way through challenges to distract me from my challenges in life, i enjoy the struggle and Dark souls 3 Gave me a good fight but like every challenge its there to be completed. and with the release of The Ringed City and Dark Souls 3 : The Fire Fades  Edition the series will sadly be put to rest and to me it will go down in my history as the game that pulled me through depression because even though its hard when i felt like i couldnt accomplish anything in my life the Dark Souls franchise showed me that if i kept trying eventually i could pull through.SPOILERSAs im writing this im sitting in the Ariandel Chapel, I just finished collecting everything from The Ringed City, I killed Dark Eater Midir After a struggle and i gave the Blood of the Dark Soul to the Painting Girl. She is naming the Painted world after me in this burning chapel of forlorn souls. the final road in my journey through Dark souls. I have slain Demons and Dragons and Men. I Conquered Gods and Giants. And ive arisen from the ashes to Usurp the flame a final time. And now it all burns away. The age of Fire might fade. But the age of men begins in a cold dark and gentle place.Thank you Miyazaki And FromSoftware as a whole. For this trilogy, For the DLC. For the adventures and the times i spent jolly co-operating. For helping me pull through. For the Fantasy of Struggle. Thank you.Thank you for the attention this review has gotten, i also editted it a bit so the Spoilers wouldnt be visible unless you hovered over them im sorry to the people who read them before i decided to use my brain and format it properly."
Positive,"Some people say, that Midir is the hardest boss, but the naked guy who invaded and killed me 20 times in a row thinks otherwise"
Positive,"Born too late to explore the earth,Born too early to explore the universe, Born exactly the right time to play this masterpiece.. 10/10"
Positive,"It finally clicked. Now I get why the Dark Souls series has such an active, enthusiastic, and borderline obsessed community. Although I was hesitant to start Dark Souls 3, I can now say that it is one of the greatest gaming experiences I have had.  Absolutely gorgeous. It was clear that a lot of thought and effort was put into designing Dark Souls 3. Each area uniquely beautiful and expertly put together; the attention to detail creates a truly immersive experience. I especially enjoyed how spectacular the scenery and menacing the bosses are. The developers did a great job at incorporating shortcuts. Since the areas are quite large, you often get disoriented as you progress (especially during the first playthrough). At a certain point, you come across unlockable door(s) or elevator(s) that connects to a previous area and acts as a shortcut. The sudden realization that you went around in one big circle or that you’re directly above/below a previous area always left me baffled. I really wonder how much time was put into the level design. Amazing combat. Honestly, I’ve barely skimmed the surface when it comes to combat but it is enough for me to recognize how incredible it is. There are so many weapons, movesets, spells, infusions, and more. Plus the combinations you can put together are only limited by your imagination (for the most part). There is a reason why several people spend hours putting together the perfect PVP character(s).Exploration is greatly rewarded. Seriously, there are items, NPCs, and interesting rooms hidden everywhere. It’s gotten so bad that I feel paranoid when I reach a pointless dead end and find nothing - “there HAS to be something here”. Finding a secret felt like finding candy on a scavenger hunt and was thrilling from beginning to end. Keep a look out for fake walls, suspicious ledges, potential jumps, and chests. Beware of mimics though.I really liked the decision to grant the ability to teleport between lit bonfires almost immediately, and to include a safe hub (Firelink Shrine), where most of the important NPCs/vendors can be found. This made Dark Souls 3 more user-friendly (especially for beginners) than Dark Souls 1. Although this made Dark Souls 3 more linnear, I found the clarity of knowing more or less what to do and where to go (also being able to teleport back in case you went the “wrong” way) more enjoyable than the uncertainty I felt when playing the first Dark Souls. For those who don’t know, inter-player interactions play a large role in the Dark Souls series. You can leave notes (to either help or trick others), you can summon other players for a co-op experience, and you can invade other people’s worlds for PVP. I think this is another reason why the Dark Souls community holds strong - despite being portrayed as a single player game, you are rarely alone. I found that the online features (co-op and PVP) worked very well most of the time. Naturally, there are some instances of lag or disconnection, but it is very easy to set up again. Initially I hated being invaded, but I’ve learned to love it for two reasons: The excitement/fear you get from being invaded is intense. It is like a sudden emergence of a mini-boss whose only purpose is to hunt you down. While the defeats are definitely sour, victories are so damn sweet. All the pain you receive from getting invaded can be repaid by invading other people. It’s a sort of S&M relationship, I know, but it adds near-infinite extra hours of excitement and replayability to Dark Souls 3. I’m kind of torn about this following point. On one hand, I still find that Dark Souls 3 is not very beginner friendly. More specifically, I had to look up some basic guides before starting the game to understand which stats do what, and what sort of build I should go for. A lot of information, for example stat soft-caps, is not particularly clear to begin with. I find that this steep learning curve, in addition to Dark Souls’ notoriety for being difficult, pushes a lot of beginners away. On the other hand, the Dark Souls series has come a long way, 3 being the most user-friendly and clear game in my experience. After playing it, I realized that I could have easily learned how to build my character through a little trial and error. Granted, my character would not be perfect, but like many veterans say: “no point in Vigor is wasted”. Dark Souls is the kind of game that expects you to pour countless hours in to before you “git gud”, such that a veteran with awful equipment will almost always beat a beginner with God-tier equipment. It should be emphasized that YOU ARE EXPECTED TO MAKE MISTAKES; the complexity of Dark Souls 3 is exactly what makes it so spectacular. I was honestly hesitant to begin playing Dark Souls 3, but it has quickly become one of the greatest gaming experiences I’ve ever had. If you are on the fence, I urge you to give Dark Souls 3 a try. Be patient, learn from your mistakes, and don’t give up - only then will you prosper and praise the sun. NOTE: I’m not complaining about combat/mechanics difficulty - while challenging, I honestly believe that the death/learn-from-your-mistakes system is the number one selling point of the whole series. Would die again."

Positive,After this game I hit chests in every other game
Positive,"You'll try. You won't know what's going on. You'll think dying is bad. Your friends will explain things to you, using words like, ""Estus shard"" and ""Praise the sun"" and it won't make sense. You'll give up after dying repeatedly on the tutorial boss only to finally kill it and then die to a dog that scares you into falling off of a cliff. Three months later, your friends will convince you to play again. You try it out, only to fail yet again. This time though, you understand that's part of the process, just as your friends had reassured you. You'll roll. You'll roll again, then again. You've done it! The dog that once scared you into jumping off a cliff is dead and you've miraculously taken no damage. Renewed vigor fills you and you continue on. This time you ignore your friends, resorting to the wiki to answer your questions and your own curiosity to guide you to treasure. Suddenly things begin to make sense. You go to bed.You wake up with this incessent urge to play again, oddly intrigued by the story even though you're ""not that type of gamer"". ""Why do I enjoy this?"" You'll ask yourself. Soon, you're rolling in real life, to dodge your responsibilities solely to play this game.Didn't think it'd happen to me. It did. Buy it while it's on sale so the first three months of you not really playing it don't feel like, ""Such a waste of money."" It's not a waste, even at full price. Amazing game and story. So damned confusing at first but it's worth it. I promise you."

Positive,try finger but hole
Positive,It's kind of like Bloodborne except I can play it on my PC
Positive,"Dark Souls III, The one game i managed to get over 1500 hours on.Where to start with this...Short VersionThe Pros- Engaging gameplay- Beautiful scenery and soundtrack- Tons of replayability- Varied PVP With both strangers and friends.- Co-op with strangers and friends, to get past those pesky dogs- Memes that may or may not give conniptionsCons- Connectivity may sometimes be an issue when fighting strangers- Requires patience and determination, not for the easily angered.- Difficulty may be a turnoff for people who enjoy more casually toned games- Those people who use a greatshield with great magic weapon in pvp(Skip to bottom for roundup)Long VersionAs someone who has enjoyed the Dark Souls series thoroughly, I feel that Dark Souls 3 has fixed many control issues apparent in previous installments. The combat feels active, rewarding proper timing and enemy management, whilst punishing rushing into battle without a plan and carelessly swinging your blade around. Enemies are placed strategically across the levels, neatly tieing in with their surroundings and backstories. It feels like all of them have a reason to be where they are. Surroundings are interesting, and tell their own little part of the story.The bosses are their own kind of combat. Whilst in the levels themself the challenge is in enemy management, and level exploration. The bosses give you a one on one (usually) death battle, where careful dodging and reading your enemy's movement is key to surviving the encounter. They are larger, stronger and faster then any other enemy in the game, and are not to be taken lightly. Defeating these formidable foes is quite the challenge, and also very satisfying. About the story: you will have to look for it. Although DS3 doesnt hide its story as much as the previous titles, Item descriptions, surroundings and NPC dialogue are essential to finding out what exactly is going on in lothric. Finding all these tidbits of lore makes it exciting to find new weapons and/or items, aside from their obvious use. The singleplayer aspect is fun enough on its own, but the multiplayer aspect makes it whole. being able to summon both strangers and friends to aid you in your journey makes each journey different. Naturally, recieving more aid makes the enemies tougher, along with other risks, like multiple invaders. the arena is always full with people at almost any level, providing unlimited entertainment as players duke it out 1 on 1, or in teams.All in all, its a experience that changes from person to person. with bountiful amounts of weapons to choose from, and more armor than one sane person could collect. theres endless combinations of character builds at your disposal. knights, mages,  pyromancers and clerics, and combinations in all forms. Ive ran through the entire game over 60 times at this point, finding new secrets and tidbits of story still. and with PVP being one of the most entertaining things i have ever come across. The enemies, story, soundtrack and scenery are a joy to return to whenever i launch this game.(continue here for roundup)Basically, if youve played the first two games, youll find a familliar yet refreshing style of gameplay before your eyesIf DS3 is your first dark souls, Youll find a easy to learn, difficult to master game that will keep you busy for quite some time.Overall, I think this is my favorite game in my entire library."

Positive,Mentally deranged man finds comically oversized sword and makes it everyone's problem
Positive,"I play it often, always choose knight, level it up to 1 or 2, run some drills around the castle.  Very re-playable for an autist like me,"
Positive,Dont play this game!Why?You will never find a game as good and after you have played through it 20 times it gets boring and you will feel empty and suicidal for about 4 months.
Positive,every soul has its dark-john dark souls
Positive,How is this game not on sale? fuck you! Good game tho.
Positive,great game to play if you are looking for a relaxing past time
Positive,"This game thought me, no matter how hard life is, there will be moments of peace.Life can be hard and dire, until you reach a Bonfire."
Positive,finally beat the character creation screenwonder what comes next
Positive,"My favorite part was when the final boss said ""It's Soulin' Time"" and souled all over you but you kill him anyway because you're the main character."
Positive,this game is sex.
Positive,Died over 80 times to tutorial boss. Then I died over 70 times to a dude with a katana. Then I died 55 times to a huge monster. But it's okay because i have a cool sword.
Positive,Dark Souls is one of the games ever made.
Positive,"This is my first souls game.I bought this game on a Wednesday night after work when it was on sale. I ran through the cemetery hacking and slashing undead with ease. With the utmost confidence, I took the sword out of the kneeling titan and was promptly returned to reality. Several times. So many times that I returned the game that night saying it ""wasn't my cup of tea""But a little voice lived in my head. It called me a quitter. Quitters never win.Long story short I bought the game again in the same night and played until I beat him. Feeling victory in this game is exhilarating. The messages on the ground are not the tutorial. Iudex Gundyr is the tutorial and he will teach you patience and persistence. The rest is up to you"
Positive,I was there to fight Lord Gywn I was there to fight King Vendrick I was there to fight The Soul of Cinder I was there to fight to the end.

Positive,"At first, it seems like the first boss is just bullshit and impossible, and then hundreds of hours later you're playing ultrahardcore mod NG + 7 just to feel alive again. Incredible game 11/10."
Positive,fire keeper a baddie
Positive,love getting blasted by javelins and fighting a giant tree whose weak spot is his balls
Positive,"the more you fight, the more you die, the more you die, the more you learn, the more you learn, the more you live.  Dark souls will grind you to dust and reform you a dozen times, and thats all before the first boss fight.  If you've never played dark souls before, and you get stuck on the first fight, dont rage quit, after all, dying 40 times in a row is just a nice introduction to the game.  good luck.  youll need it."
Positive,"It's hard to capture what makes this game so special to me and many other people.  How something so bleak and frustrating can be so therapeutic and comforting.  A contradiction?  Of course not - we're human beings.I will tell you a tale of my first experience with this game.  I played for a total of about 10 minutes before quitting and deeming it a waste of my time.  I'd not played anything like it before, and I'd much rather be spoon fed easy hits of dopamine in my downtime.  Wasn't life already stressful enough?A few years later, seemingly out of nowhere, I acquired an inclination to play it again.  I'm not sure why.  It was the beginning of Fall, the season of transformation between the omnipotent oppression of summer heat and the still nothingness of Winter.  I can't help but see Fall as a parallel evolution of us.I gave it another chance, and I'd never been so engrossed in a game until that point.Each time you die, you are given a chance to further refine your skills and strategy as your character journeys through a satisfyingly varied and strange fantasy world.  Often times there are stark contrasts between the areas you encounter, most notable being the transition from the dark, brown, cavernous catacombs to the blue galaxy-like sky overlooking the gothic architectural city of Irithyll.Things are eerily quiet when navigating the environments.  It's just you, your thoughts, and if it's your first playthrough, the simultaneous hesitancy and curiosity of seeing a new and grotesque creature with an unknown moveset that will most likely destroy you fairly quickly if you can't stand back and first observe the patterns.And then you get to the end of this level, this mini-world of creative genius, and enter the fog gates.  The previous silence and stillness transforms into some of the most beautiful orchestral music you've heard as you encounter a terrifying entity whose health bar fills the entire width of your computer monitor.  Your heart rate increases and you fight for your life.  And you most likely die a glorious death, perhaps several times.  But you awaken, and you have the chance to do it again and again until you beat the boss, or you let the boss beat you.You have several starting classes to choose from, as well as a diverse set of weapons, armor, rings, items, magical spells, and elemental infusions.  How you mix and match all of this creates your own unique build that you will hone for the rest of your journey, using the souls of those you slay to increase your own attributes.  This alone is one of the funnest aspects of the game for me.  Your first build will probably be less than ideal, but with each subsequent playthrough, you get to start again.  Whether you choose to bring your character into an ever increasing NG+ cycle or start anew with a fire wielding pyromancer of great intelligence instead of a greatsword carrying warrior with the power of strength is up to you.  Immense replayability in a world that begs to be explored and mastered.And by the way, you can always summon a few more ashen ones to help you in your struggles.So now that you know DS3 is a magnificent game, in my opinion at least, I wanted to touch on a great lesson that this game imparts, and that serves as yet another reason to pick it up.Something about the Soulsborne series serves as a therapeutic outlet for people.  You can read dozens and dozens of stories online about how playing these games helped people in some facet of their life while they were going through a difficult time, often struggling with mental illness and apathy.  Some will outright say that playing a souls game changed their life.  Perhaps this sounds silly - after all, isn't it just a video game?In our modern world, most of us are used to comfort.  We welcome the immediate gratification of a scroll through Instagram, and many are hesitant about pushing themselves and putting in the work to solve problems and make painful changes.  I'd argue that DS3, and other souls games, teach you the lessons of grit, persistence, and endurance that you can take with you and apply to any other endeavor that you choose to undergo.Getting satisfyingly good at something usually takes hard work.  When you see someone flawlessly play a piece of classical music on the piano, you are seeing the result of this.  What you're not seeing is the journey.  The struggle of beginning from nothing with no skills or prior knowledge and having to potentially deal with setbacks and self doubt each session of practice.  But to get to the end and achieve your goal, you have to deal with these challenges.  Embrace them even, seeing them as a necessary component for the end that needs to be reached.This journey of being brought into existence - weak and with nothing other than our own ""starting stats"" - as we progressively strengthen ourselves and undergo trials and tribulations to defeat the final boss and link the flame: this is an abstract parallel to our own mortal life in many ways, and is the thing that makes DS3 so beautiful and captivating to me.If you've gotten to the end of this melodramatic wall of text, thank you for reading, and I hope I've convinced you to give this game a try."
Positive,"Dark Souls is - and always has been - acquired taste. Out of all my friends on Steam, most of whom I know personally and share interests with, I can count those who play Dark Souls 3 on a single hand.When I first heard of Dark Souls, I would have never believed I would spend hundreds of hours on one of the series' games. I was intimidated by the difficulty and attempts to complete the first title resulted in frustration and anger. I felt inadequate, because the setting appealed greatly to me, but I wasn't very proficient at the combat mechanics, which force you to critically analyse your surroundings, memorise attack patterns and generally be cautious. And that's where that ended back then.Then, Bloodborne came out and immediately grabbed my attention and renewed my interest in games of the Soulsborne franchise. It was actually the first of the games I completed.Here's the deal: These games reflect upon your ability to deal with a variety of situations. They reflect whether you are able to handle loss, whether you can keep a cool head in a tight situation. So maybe, you are very impulsive, make decisions on the fly and maybe everything turns out okay every once in a while. But are you able to bear the guilt of your failures, the fact that you have made a mistake? If not, you will rage, you will become frustrated or even doubt yourself. You'll throw controllers and shout at the screen, just as much as you might feel the frustration pulse through you in any situation in life. But can you improve? That is a clear yes. It's definitely possible, but you have to be willing. And overcoming a seemingly unsurmountable obstacle through great effort, training, and self-reflection is a wonderful feeling.Giving you control of a character that seems to be so severely underpowered in a world of giant beasts and magnitudinous god-creatures is intimidating. But along the way you will find that any God may have its weakness and a character that seems weak at first may have unforeseen strengths. The only thing you can rely on is yourself and your willingness to learn and persist, or you may lose your sanity. Everything in this world is supposed to make you feel small, weak and endangered, but you have it in your hand to change the perception you have of yourself.Will you like this game? That depends on you. Are you willing to give yourself a chance?"
Positive,"Yes, indeed...Like every journey eventually leads to home, this great series eventually came to a close. Paying respect to its predecessors, tying up loose ends and building the last scene of greatness. The final hymn to the flame.Dark Souls has always been a story about a dying world filled with collapsing creatures and the feeling of despair. We are wandering through crumbling buildings and decaying lands. We are finding shards of past glory and witnessing heartbreaking stories of men. We are trying to fit them all into a single picture, sometimes imagining our own stake. But this time we also find things that are familiar to us, thanks to the previous games. This time we become a part of that story, which is long past. The heartwarming allusions to the things we already know and love, that are the reason to smile in this somber world.Should it be your first Souls game, then your journey will be enhanced by a different thing. Unexpected discoveries, facing the consequences of your actions, feeling lost in a cruel world with no explicit directions. Failures and misperceptions, and, eventually, glorious victories await you. Don't ruin it and go in blind. This is the once in a lifetime experience that only a Soulsborne game can give you. The experience that is yours only, unique and personal.But for me it became my final step on my Souls journey. Once again I came to a mysterious world to witness its monumental architecture and stunning landscapes, to uncover its secrets. Once again I was charmed by the beauty having purpose. Once again I was a feeble creature, struggling its way forward. The learning process in these games is subtle, yet powerful. It showed me how hope replaces despair and how cold-blooded patience prevails rage. The fire will fade. But our memories will remain. My journey is over, but I know that I will return again and again. Ever since I played the first one of these games, I was doomed: they became my all time favorites. And DS3 lived up my expectations to the fullest. I don't think that any other (non-FromSoft) game can surpass or even achieve that for me. I might be a lost soul now, but to be honest I don't mind this fate. I think that the theme of this game also conveys another idea: everything should end so something new may be born. FromSoft wanted to show us that Dark Souls is over and we should look forward to their new creations. Therefore here I am, eager to see what they will show us next. I doubt you could even imagine it. Because I certainly can not."
Positive,"Before I played dark souls 3, i had a small wee wee, no friends, no girlfriend, depression and absolutely no will to live. None of these things have changed, but the game is pretty good."

Positive,"When people talk about the Souls games they always say they are hard. But unlike the arcade horrors from the last century they are not only hard, but also fun. There is something to it to walk into the boss room knowing that you are the underdog. But there is also a fantastic and beautiful world. A variety of different cool weapons and spells. And the best part is that you can summon a friend or random people and npcs to help you on your journey when it's getting too frustrating. The harder the battle the sweeter the victory. Or how we say it: Praise the sun!"
Positive,"Recently I was asked by a friend who is new to the souls series what i thought of this game, so I thought I'd put what i wrote him here.This game is a masterpiece.I'd recommend it, but I will say its hard, like it can be discouraging at times.However, there are few feelings that come close to the sensation of defeating a boss or enemy you've been stuck on for hours.TL:DR= Beautiful game, challenging but rewarding fighting system and a non intrusive but intriguing narrative to boot. 9/10Ill keep the review brief so you can skim through it, because, honestly, you've got to experience the game for yourself to fully comprehend what this game is about.Story= Vague (left to interpretation sorta' thing) but intriguing. You're character seems to be the only one out of the loop and it really helps cement the idea that youre not ready for the grand task you've been given. You'd expect alot of satisfaction from the end of the game, however the real story chunks are tucked away in item descriptions and in the connotations of NPC's.Visuals= F***ing fantastic. Graphics are great even on low settings and this mystical middle age setting looks so fucking incredible. The world is detailed and reinforces the main story with hints of the impennding doom that a dark age will induce. Oh, and fashion souls is real, and trust me you're going to spend a lot of time making your character look badass.Gameplay= Toughest part. Easy to learn, hard to master. The levelling system require stat placement which means various builds can be created with various intended functions: from melee builds to caster builds to healing builds. Some styles are more forgiving than others and others require late game items/bonuses/spells to properly flourish. There are, of course, Meta builds that perform pretty well but everyone will also be trying to perfect there own build.Online= Fantastic. Community is still pretty big for PvE and PvP but, the game is getting getting old now. Co-op is great and can be used through most of game (minus something like 3 transitory areas that dont really have anything important in them). Invasions are what made dark souls work: getting invaded and winning a duel makes you feel powerful if its a 1v1. Invading can be unforgiving because of gank squads (2+ players who corner single invaders) but it can be so rewarding when you pull of a whole squad kill and you get to do the infamous 'point down' gesture. PvP has its own arena if invading gets tiresome, so thats a plus. But high wait times if your not around the meta level in arena (Soul level 120 is the recommended meta range). General PvP can be alot more frustrating than other games but alot more rewarding. Mistakes can be unforgiving and there is a big issue with the lag in fights. However, for a guy who I know likes to feel the flurry of a good fight, this s*** delivers. Highly tactical gameplay that rewards smart decisions and good spacing. Dont get me wrong, the arena is useful for easy matchmaking but theres a whole pvp system called fight clubs where players gather in a non dlc area to do 1v1s (fair warning: there are no real rule enforcement in fight clubs so you just gotta' act honorable and hope your fighting compatriots do too and not gank you).Thanks for reading, this has been my first review on steam so I hope its clear and legible :)I look forward to invading you, and may the flames guide thee!"

Positive,"If you didn't enjoy the quality of Dark Souls II and are wondering about the enjoyment of Dark Souls III and the fact that it may be overhyped, worry no longer.Dark Souls III is the true successor to Dark Souls.The third entry in a game series renowned for its outstanding unique storytelling and its sinister difficulty, FromSoftware has brought us again another game worthy of praise. Taking place in the land of Lothric, you will encounter grotesque beasts of the unknown, epic bosses, the most beautiful environments and a lore deeper than any ocean. If you are tired of hand-holding games where the game seems to shove tutorials in your face even to end-game than this is the game for you. One of the reason that I hold Dark Souls in such high regard is not because of the difficulty but rather the fact that it doesn't treat the player as if they're a child. The game will punish you but know that it doesn't mean the end, rather every death you face is nothing more than a stepping stone to a greater success, a hard earned success is honestly the greatest feeling ever. You will learn new skills and eventually adapt, the game knows you aren't stupid and will treat you like you are; a human, something a lot of games these days are sorely missing.Again, Dark Souls III feels more like a sequel to Dark Souls I than II ever did. Borrowing things from all their previous games you will see happy changes to the overall game. Fans of Demon Souls will be happy to know that the hub world shares an uncanny resemblance to the Nexus as well as the Maiden. Extremely well designed bosses inspired from the creatures of Bloodborne and its engine as well as Dark Souls II's accessibility to the series.    CAMEOS! Returning characters will make appearances.    Extremely well optimized.    Keyboard and Mouse controls aren't that bad.    There is now no permanent health loss when dying.    Amazing soundtrack that will soothe your ears.    Extremely well designed boss fights.    Full of amazing locations to explore.     Great level design.    Rewarding difficulty.    Playing CO-OP with a specific player is very easy now.    Stances. Combat has been reworked for the better.    No more Soul Memory.    Interesting NPCs, to encounter and converse with.    PVP is better than it ever was.    Classes don't lock you into anything, you can make your build into anything you want, e.g. magic user.    World fits together nicely in a way that makes sense.    Open world, areas are massive.    Approachable systems, deep and very easy to learn and master.    Mage builds are rethinked, they aren't as broken and overpowered like in Dark Souls II.    Matchmaking is a breeze.    This is NOT the final Souls game.    BACKSTABS ARE BACK! At the very least better executed than in Dark Souls II.    You can easily switch between OFFLINE mode & ONLINE mode now.    Though rarely, at the moment there is a few framerate hiccups but other than that PC version is very well done.    Somewhat noticeable pop-ins.    The world isn't inter-connected like in Dark Souls I which may upset some.    CAMEOS! Though I've written it as a plus, some may dislike it as some may think of it as lazy where From could've very well created new and interesting characters.    Not necessarily a negative but having an unstable connection while online will bring you back to the main menu.  Yes, very much so! Though I am biased, this is truly an amazing game. It doesn't matter if you are a veteran, new or old, Dark Souls III takes the best part of all of From's previous games and makes it even better. It surpassed my expectations, even more it completely destroyed what I should expect from a game. All upcoming games, Triple A especially take note, this is how you make a game. This is a true game.Thank you kindly, Alex for giving me the chance to play this wonderful game."

Positive,This game has destroyed my life. I am doing no hit runs now and I can't escape it anymore. I am trapped forever in this game. 10/10.
Positive,"I believe Dark Souls series are more attractive to people who are depressed or recovering from traumatic experiences.In a world without fire or light, a powerless man who does not have any strength, fails over and over. Yet, with relentlessness and determination, he becomes strong enough to overcome the mountains that seemed unsurpassable before. All these efforts are only to keep the fire lasting for just a little while longer. Do any of these sound familiar to you?I would not dare to say it could cure depression or other mental illnesses. But I do know that I gain some courage from this game. Thank you, Hidetaka Miyazaki."

Positive,"This game (and perhaps DS1) has ruined every other game for me. Since I've started playing the Souls series, I have not been able to fully get into any other game. I'll start playing something else, but am always thinking about yet another way to play this game. Building yet another character (why oh why can I only have 10) using a different weapon and style of play. People ask me whether I get bored playing it again and again. For me it is no longer about level design but rather about discovering new ways to play and challenge myself. For me I feel there will never be another game like this."

Positive,the game which began with Demon Souls and evolved with Bloodborne has achieved its ultimate glory.Dark Souls III has the best ending for the Age of Dark Souls.It's hard for me to say...But now these souls need a long rest...

Dark souls 3 is a game where you will soon learn you aren't as strong as that big scary creature over there, but you can sure kick its' ass if you try hard enough.For those who have played and enjoyed any previous games within the Souls franchise except for Dark Souls 3, I can easily recommend this game and you'll know exactly what you're in for.For those who haven't played any Souls games before, well, let us begin shall we?-Not for the faint of heart, because you will die, A LOT. Just get back up and try again!-You will even die when you do things correctly, because Dark Souls don't give a f*ck.-Your veins and brain will be filled with adrenaline and dopamine upon a successful boss kill after dying as many times as you have.-You'll get invaded (a form of PvP within Dark Souls) and rekt accordingly, increasing your urge to win next time, or exact revenge by invading someone yourself.-You'll die some more, but you'll learn new concepts and mechanics along the way. Ensuring you kick that much more ass the next time around.On a more serious note, DS3 offers:-Gorgeous visuals-A much more balanced PvP system than the previous two Souls games-Very difficult enemy and boss encounters-A some what complex ""fill in the blanks"" lore/story-telling which is fairly compelling under the surface9/10 - I simply love all the Souls games and would recommend them to anyone who is looking for a difficult RPG to play."
Positive,"Dark souls III : Door does not open from this side, is a fantastic casual RPG about trying to open doors, realising they do not open from this side, and then trying to find the right side to open the door.There's also a fun mini game about trying to become the lord of cinder10/10"

The story does not take a larger presence beyond the start of the game but rather slowly feeds you information through the environment, items you acquire, and characters you meet through your journey. I've found that this organic method of player involved lore building is the best way to present apocalyptic settings where the ashes of a once mighty empire are all that remain.The combat strikes a great balance in that it is fast paced and varied enough to allow for multiple avenues of counter play. There will be the occasional death trap or room full of enemies but with enough practice and repetition these hurdles can be leaped over with ease. Each difficult fight in the game can easily be won by figuring out an enemy's attack patterns or weakness. The same concept also applies to the PvP which has so much depth to it that it is still played to this day. Compared to the PvP in the previous two titles this one stands out as being the most polished souls experience for PvP.I do highly recommend this game as it has a massive amount of replay value and is one masterpiece that I often times see myself revisiting to claim souls in PvP or re-learn each memorable boss fight."
Positive,"I'm not the type of person who plays these kinds of games. Until now, my taste has mostly been MMOs, Space sims, and games like Stardew Valley. Action oriented games that involve reacting fast, dodging, memorizing attack patterns (besides scripted raid bosses), this is all totally outside my element. I wanted to preface with this so you can see where I'm coming from. This review is aimed toward people like me. Where once I was a carebear even in MMOs, I now even dabble in invasions and PVP here. I even killed an invader once! Me! Where once I played video games purely to relax, I now have a taste for gaming experiences that make my heart pound. Where once I would uninstall a game I couldn't beat because I ""clearly wasn't good enough"", I now understand I have the potential to GET good enough, and that the process of realizing this potential is something core to my desired gaming experience. Where once I would dismiss a game outside of my comfort zone, I now eagerly approach a fresh challenge. This is all thanks to Dark Souls III, and its punishing-yet-fair gameplay. Every challenge you encounter is surmountable. Even if you're me. The distances between bonfires where you rest are perfectly placed. Just when you think you can't possibly make it much further, right around the corner you'll reliably find that sweet sweet bonfire. Dark Souls III rightfully believes in your ability to make it to the next one. And it's never wrong.The boss fights are an extension of this. Everybody can beat these bosses. The game cultivates your skills by presenting you with enemies with varying strengths and weaknesses, and by the time you reach a boss, you will have been hardened by the road leading up to it. You just have to try, and try, and learn. I can do it, you can do it. Trust. (Admittedly I haven't fully completed it, but I'm confident I will. As of writing I'm at Prince Lothric. Give me a few more tries!)This sense of growth and progress permeates throughout every aspect of the game. You'll improve both in strength and skill. Those red-caped Lothric Knight bastards that I used to be terrified of fighting? They're now something I casually farm with comfort and ease when I need some embers, effortlessly dodging and 3-shot-killing from behind. Those long corridors full of deadly traps and deadlier enemies, where I'd trudge through sweating at 0.001 mph? I effortlessly sprint through and past all the enemies, making a beeline to a now familiar destination. The game presents you with beautiful vistas that tower over the landscape that you've just fought through. It's often an emotional experience to see how far you've come, in so many ways.It seems silly to say that a video game can change who you are as a person, but this one did that for me. My attitude has changed. I can take on any challenge if I truly set my mind to it, and I will be happy to do so. I now know the glorious taste of a hard-earned victory, sweating buckets through my palms, filled with pride and joy in conquering a terrifying foe. That's what Dark Souls III is all about to me. It's a terrific game, but an even more terrific experience. You will come out the other side of this game as a different type of gamer if you have a casual carebear background like mine. If you're nervous about games like this, that's the exact reason you should play Dark Souls III. It can change you and open you up to a new world of experiences. Isn't that what life is all about?"
Positive,It's like Dark Souls 1 except 3.
Positive,"The Fire Keeper__________________________________________To cut a long story short: ""Dark Souls III“ is a great game and also a perfect start for anyone that has not played a 'Souls' game to date. From Software came up with interesting ideas to make weapons more diversified, the world and most of the levels are interesting and full of secrets and as usual there’s a lot of hidden lore for people that are interested in story and motives. However from my point of view the game has also lost a bit of the atmosphere and 'essence‘ of the early 'Souls' games. Especially the feeling of hopelessness and solitude is even rarer than in 'Dark Souls II' and the difficulty of the journey changes a lot between challenging and cakewalk.According to director Miyazaki From Software will now focus on new projects and ""Dark Souls III"" will be the last 'Souls' game for the next years. On the one hand this is a sad message but on the other hand I’m glad that the quality does not decrease with yearly new instances without many changes. __________________________________________The overall story is - as usual in a 'Souls' game - based around the cycle of Fire and Dark:Fire is fading and you have to return the five Lords of Cinder to their rightful thrones in order to link the fire once more.This time you are neither an Undead nor a Bearer of the Curse but an 'Unkindled One‘, born from the ashes of an Undead Warrior that failed on his mission. Everything is as ominous as ever and leads the protagonist into a long and dangerous journey through the kingdom of Lothric. There are lots of areas, items and names that link back to the precursors and there are some really atmospheric levels with great design and architecture and lots of hidden secrets and loot (I’d like to mention 'Archdragon Peak‘, 'Lothric Castle‘ and the 'Grand Archives‘ here). By the way: the game looks gorgeous. From Software was finally able to spice the game up with some beautiful graphics in addition to the fantastic style.Here is a screenshot to give you a better impression:Sure, all 'Souls‘ games looked good due to their unique style but the amount of muddy textures was simply too damn high in the earlier titles.__________________________________________Aside from the fact that the whole game feels a lot faster and agressive than the precursors there are some changes to spells and dual wielding in general and the new 'Weapon Arts‘.'From Software' brought the MP system from 'Demon’s Souls' back and went away from the fixed amount of casts. 'Ashen Estus Flasks' are used to recover the so called FP (Focus Points) and the 'Attunement‘ stat now gives more FP in addition to attunement slots.  Moreover they changed the dual wielding system: Not every weapon can be used for dual wielding styles anymore, instead there are some specific 'Dual Wield Weapons‘ like e.g. the 'Brigand Twindaggers‘. Every Weapon has also a 'Weapon Art‘, a powerful special attack like a mighty blow or a useuful skill like e.g. a quickstep. Some of them are defined by the Weapon Class (e.g. the Weapon Art of most Straight Swords or Shields is the same) but some are truly unique. This gives some extra spice to several weapons and finally makes many of them feel more diversified aside from raw stats. __________________________________________From Software has finally included a password function for easier access to e.g. co-op games or fight clubs. Aside there’s the usual stuff: several convenants with different goals, the summoning for bosses and areas and interesting/frustrating PVP that is always a difficult topic in the 'Souls‘ games. You can definitely rant hours and hours about it, especially about balancing and viable options. However I have to admit: When you get a 'good‘ opponent that plays a fair duel things can be a lot of fun despite the typical 'Git Gud‘-massacre. Unfortunately From Software dropped interesting convenant ideas like e.g. the Rat Convenant (you made others invade your world to lure them into a madhouse full of traps and enemies).__________________________________________One thing that bothers me a lot in this game is how it handles NG+. It's a massive step backwards compared to 'Dark Souls II' which did something amazing here: it changed stuff. In NG+ there were not only new drops to many bosses but also you were able to encounter a lot of new Phantoms in the areas, there were changes in some boss fights (e.g. the two Pyromancers during the Lost Sinner fight) and even stuff that surprised you completely like e.g. the two Pursuers in the Throne Room or the 'surprise attack‘ of 'Duke’s Dear Freja' on your way to Brightstone Cave Tseldora. This brought some variaton to the game, which was really needed in NG+ from my point of view. Unfortunately they left this out of 'Dark Souls III': Aside from upgraded rings that you can only find in NG+ and NG++, NG+ is exactly the same.It’s a pity, those were fantastic ideas and a great start to a more 'diversified/changed‘ NG+.Moreover I have to say: The game feels pretty easy from time to time. Sure some bosses give you a nice challenge when you fight them for the first time but afterwards I rarely had a problem. The feeling of winning after trying over and over was so rewarding and I kind of miss this for most parts of the game. Maybe that’s the point - I already spent a lot of time in the 'Souls' games and earned a lot of experience. I guess for everyone that plays the series for the first time it’s still pure madness. A shame that there’s no 'Champion Convenant' this time though.__________________________________________'Dark Souls III' shows me once more why I love the series. Design, architecture and style of the world are fantastic, the gameplay is fluid and responsive and exploring the areas feels worthwhile. Moreover the lore is amazing and I love reading all the little hints and listen to the mysterious dialogues. There are some challenging areas and you are always happy when you find an interesting weapon or level up your character. Sure, aside from all the good facts I also mentioned many points that are - from my point of view - 'weaker‘ than in the earlier titles. Not all changes are great, but that does neither mean that 'Dark Souls III‘ is a bad game on its own nor that it is a bad 'Souls' games. Those are simply aspects where I think that they are weaker than before, but maybe I am a bit nostalgic here – as we all know there were always flaws in the 'Souls' series and stuff like balancing was always a difficult topic (e.g. the 'Scrapping Spear‘ from Demon’s Souls). However 'Dark Souls III‘ has its own style and atmosphere and that makes up for a lot. And moreover it’s way more accessible for new players and a great start for anyone to the whole 'Souls' series – you can respec your character, many of the bosses and enemies are more forgiving for mistakes and in PVE there's less ganking and less ambushes that simply frustrate you.I’d rate it 9 out of 10 points on its own and maybe 8 out of 10 points as a 'Souls' game. Damn, maybe I have finally turned into one of those infamous Undeads that praises the first game(s) and hates on the successors.May the sun have mercy upon me.Praise the sun! \[T]/This endorsement approved by The Reviewers' Union,providing better standards for reviews and reviewers."
Positive,"DISCLAIMER: Be aware of long reviewAfter playing this game for 300 hours and doing all achievements, I wouldn't be honest with myself and wouldn't be making this game justice by not making a review of it and telling people why you should at least give it a try.I don't know exactly what went through Miyazaki's(the creator of the series) mind when he conceived the primor idea which have brought us Demon's Souls and then Dark Souls 1, 2 and 3, some might call him crazy and some might call him a genius, but I thank God he came out with that idea.This game is unique, even though there's a lot of games out there that tries to follow the same primor idea conceived by Miyazaki, this is a souls-like at it's finest.There is an old discussion in the souls community about which of the games is the best, but that's nothing more than just an opinion.The game is set in a post-apocalyptic medieval environment, ruled by those who either have linked the fire or have extinguished it and you, the ashen-one, are only one among the thousands of lone travelers that have struggled to link the fire, steal it for themselves or to let it fade away.The beginning of the game won't be that much of a struggle if you have played the previous games, but it's going to be a really big challenge for newcomers.The game has it's pros and cons, and I'll point out some of them here, starting with the cons.CONS: PVP. It's just unfair what some of the veterans do with newcomers, creating low-level characters and using Cheat Engine to spawn itens such as high-level spells, estus flask and undead bone shards just to bully newcomers with 1shot miracles, and lots of full-hp healings. ""hur dur but it's always at least a 2v1 against the invaders gitgud hur dur"" doesn't matter. Still unfair with you 1shot everyone with your sunlight spear. Piece of advice: In your first playthrough, play it offline or at least skip playing online in High Wall of Lothric, Undead Settlement and Road of Sacrifices. CONTROLS. The game was designed for controlers(lazy FromSoftware), so if you only have keyboard your struggle with the game will be a little bit intensified by something that shouldn't make it harder.PROS: The entire game is a piece of art. From the soundtrack to the environment design, the lore, boss fights, voice acting, it's all built to make you feel like you're in a world that once was a mighty empire and now it is really close to it's ending and there's no hope to a bright and happy future. Every new place you get to is a painting. Every boss fight intro makes you feel like you're so small and meaningless compared to everything that surrounds you(honorable mention to Darkeater Midir, Nameless King, Abyss Watchers and Dancer Of The Boreal Valley). Every soundtrack gives you the feeling that what you are facing right now once was mighty and glorious and now it finds itself in complete misery. Feels sad, but honorable and glorious.The lore is rich in a way that words are little to describe, but it is told in a subjective way, what some might find it bad and some might find it really good, it's up to perspective. It has a rich lore for those who wants some lore to read and interpret and you don't need to go through long cutscenes and dialoges for those who just wants a really good and challenging gameplay. Talking about it, the gameplay is another really good PRO in this game. It is an evolution of all the past soulsborne games, it's fluid and the hitbox works Ancient Dragon bossfight in Dark Souls II cries in the shower. It is challenging and takes time to master and once you've mastered it, the PVP finally becomes interesting and exciting.Despite what a lot of people say, the game is difficult and challenging, but it isn't unfair. It's all about learning from your mistakes. When a veteran say it is easy, it's because he's a veteran. He played the previous games e he knows how to approach the challenges of this game.So, my final word about this game in this review is that if didn't play it before because it's too hard and you get mad easly and stuff like that... Maybe this game is here to teach you something, maybe it is not that hard, is just you that need to figure out a better way to approach obstacles, maybe you need to let yourself make some mistakes and learn something from them... I don't know, but this I know is that you should let yourself have a deep dive into this game, it will be a great experience after all.Thanks for reading and Praise the Sun \o/ <3"
Positive,"chill and relaxing game, giving players opportunities to sit back after an exhausting week and have some fun by exploring the many possibilities provided by fromsoft, like exploring lovely friendly forest filled with beautiful lakes, befriending an onion, experiencing nostalgic feelings of chopping down trees like in minecraft, beating up cripples and old ladies, helping a young lady succeed in her career as a painter, getting fucked by a stripper, having numerous brain aneurysms and hemorrhages, touching cups and balls or even getting to meet a nun with very lovely feet. a true masterpiece and something every single person can enjoy and delight in"

Positive,"Before playing Dark Souls 3, I had a full head of hair, a healthy sleeping schedule, and a sense of personal accomplishment. After many long nights filled with the sounds of my own screams echoing through my home, all of these things have vanished.In Dark Souls 3, your role is simple: you play as a masochist. The game consists entirely of dying in new and interesting ways, learning from your mistakes, then proceeding to die in the exact same ways at least a dozen more times. The variety of weapons are amazing, though I find the most effective one is a sturdy controller to smash over my own head.The lore and world are rich, deep, and utterly incomprehensible. The story seems complex but requires decoding ancient runes and a degree in philosophy to understand, so I just skipped all that and went straight to dying. 10/10 experience, would recommend to anyone who hates themselves or values their sanity"

Positive,I want sister friede to sit on me.
Positive,Best Hidetaka Miyazaki Game! I recommend this to all casual gamers. This game is pure relaxation.
Positive,"Beforehand, I'm running Dark Souls 3 on a GTX 980, an i7 4790K and 8GB of RAM (everything maxed at 2560x1440. Solid 60fps in all areas.) and the game has not crashed, bugged, glitched, trashed my frame-rate, cut my audio or done anything else that is being stated by some users (I'm not claiming that it's not happening, though).With that being saidDark Souls 3 is probably my favorite Souls so far when it comes to gameplay. Combat is fast (not as Bloodborne, but just enough to make things more interesting), fluid and thrilling. Enemies are faster, more aggressive and smarter, too. This time, you have Weapon Arts, which are different skills and movesets for several weapons in the game, that when used, consume Focus Points. Yes, the Demon's Souls Mana bar is back. The level design is SO GOOD this time, although it's not as interconnected as Dark Souls 1, it's big to the point of making you feel lost.  I haven't completed Dark Souls 3 yet, but thus far, it has been one of the best experiences I had since The Witcher 3 came out!"
Positive,"It's Dark Souls 3 so if you're a fan of the series then you'll know exactly what to expect:- Awesomely responsive and intuitive combat.- You'll die a lot.- An immensely detailed and dark fantasy setting.- Loads of cool weapons and gear to dress your dude or lady up in.- You'll pick up items with vague and cryptic descriptions and think ""What the hell is this and what the hell does it do?""- You'll die a lot.- It's HARD but fair and nowhere near as difficult as people who don't play the series think it is.- You'll die and shout at your screen something like ""daaaaaamn!"" and then come back and try again about 25 times.- There will be huge, scary bosses to fight and you'll think to yourself ""I'll never beat this"" and then on the 10th try you'll beat it (Summon someone to help, no one will judge you) and scream at your monitor.- You'll reach that point in every Souls game where you have to bite the bullet and do some grinding to get STRONGER!- You'll probably spend more time exploring wiki's than playing the actual game."
Positive,try fingerbut hole
Positive,I just beat the first boss
Positive,"I've never played the first and the second game simply because I was intimidate by the Dark Souls franchise.It's a franchise that is well known to be hard, unforgiven and that only a a human with godly reflexes can beat but . . . obviously that's not quite the truth.The game is not actually hard, the only thing that is hard is that it's complicated at first for the player to understand that he isn't an overpowered human that can cut through an army of demon with a chainsaw or a semi-god that can kill gods with his bare hand, you are just a nobody that has to fight his/her way through a dark/corrupted world. You have to learn how to fight against giants, knights and a whole bunch of other creatures that are much more skilled than you.You will have to understand that to progress in this game, as well as any other From Software / any game in general, you will have to take some hit to learn how to dodge them, you will have to miss your attacks to know when to attack, you will have to lose to know how to win.The most important thing is to stay determined no matter what, if you are dying against a boss over and over again just stop playing for the day and come back the next one, it worked for me so maybe it will for you  or you can ask for some help in the forum, people are always willing to help newcomers never forget that because they too had to learn how to play Dark Souls.After more than twenty hours I finished the game and yes it wasn't easy, I died 104 times and yet I haven't fought against every single boss (I think that I am missing like 2 or 3, maybe 4) and I think that I will start on NG+ to see everything that the game has to offer.This game is worth your time if you are willing to let it teach you how to play it."
Positive,Dark Souls 3 is an absolute masterpiece.Really challenging game with incredible graphics and animations. Soundtrack is amazing as well as the variety of enemies.10/10
Positive,i cannot beat the tutorial boss
Positive,"If your a casual player of games, looking for a challenge like you've never experienced, this game can provide that itch for you. depending on how you think when playing games, this can either be quick to adapt to or a complete brick wall nightmare, but satisfying nonetheless when you beat it.For those who are looking for a fun co-op experience that isn't too hard, you have that too! that sounds kinda nebulous, but with friends this game becomes far easier, and also a lot more fun and relaxed as a result. you can all journey together, weaving your own stories in this landscape and making good memories.I can't recommend this game enough."

We kinda felt the duty to accomplish our mission and sacrifice ourself in order to not make their past vain, becoming nothing but a puppet in the hands of gods.Later, we discover that everything was useless.Dark Souls 2 - Nobody remember anymore of the Four Lords, just their souls remained in this corrupted world, Drangleic, four powerfull souls from the Lands of Lordran.King Vendrick is looking for a way in order to win the curse, and it seems he managed a way to stop it, but not to heal it. In the meanwhile his brother Aldia, scholar of the First Sin, discover the real cause of the curse: a seal created from Gwyn in order to keep the first flame alive. This is the First Sin of the Gods, their want not to die.After we ""kill"" Aldia, he tells us the most important thing of the series:""But the question remains.. What do you want, truly? Light, Dark, or something else entirely?""Dark Souls 3 - The flame is now fading in a way that never been before. Lothric refused to link the Fire, that's why bells called for us, champion of Ashes, the resemblance of all the failures of the past. We must find the Lords of Cinder and make them linking the fire, no cares how we manage to do it. During our journey, someone is looking after us: the black church of Londor, descendant of Kaathe's will. We discover that we can usurp the First Fire and give it to the Real Darkness, becoming the Lord of the new age of Humanity.The path of the big betraial, where we cover all the past with ashes in order to break the cycle of the Fire and creating something completely new, an age without Gods, only humans, and gentil darkness..So here we are, at the real Kiln of the First Flame once again, fighting the manifestation of all the cursed ones who decided to sacrifice for the Age of Fire, for their Gods.A fight beetwen the traitors and the serves of Gods, the last fight.Once we manage to win the Soul of Cinder, here something happens.He revives.Nor his body, just His will to not be forgotten.Lord Gwyn, the first lord of Cinder. His soul is still here, fighting for the last time trying to keep the Fire alive.But everything is useless, 'cause every fire will turn to Ashes.And so the flame will fade, and so the world will be merged from grey, silent ashes.Meanwhile, a strange painter is making his last paint, imaging a new cold, dark and gentle world. A world painted with the blood of the Dark Soul, the same souls that tried to emerge all this time, the same caotic soul that wanted freedom from the seal of Light, the seal of Fire.A new, dark world, where Dark Souls could be free.That's the story of many of us, the story of choices, different paths who converged into the same, peacefull end, 'cause everything will vanish, every flame will fade.Thanks Miyazaki, and all the working team.Thanks From Software, and absolutely thanks to all the players who lived in this trilogy."
Positive,I was dying to play Dark Souls III.....Now I am just dying.💀
Positive,A very Soles-like experience.
Positive,"To preface this, I bought and played the japanese version on ps4 to completion already.  I cleared the game 4 times on 3 different character builds, and have invested around 85 hours so far.  This is my opinions based on that.This is honestly my favorite game of all time.  I love the souls series, and with over 1300 hours put into the other 4 games, this has instantly become my favorite of them.  If you take 35% Demon's Souls, 35% Dark Souls, 15% Bloodborne, and 15% Dark Souls 2, then combine them into one, you will get Dark Souls 3.Starting off, what the game takes from Demon’s Souls is the tight, sprawling, atmospheric level design, as well as many other references, callbacks, and influences.  From the original Dark Souls, you have incredible bosses, music, NPCs, visually stunning vistas, and interesting lore.  This game feels more like a sequel to Dark Souls 1 than 2 did, with direct references to the game, as opposed to 2's way of saying that ""something happened long ago"".  From Bloodborne, take the detailed environments, visually impressive graphics (thanks to a new engine), and a dash of enemy and boss designs.  Finally, from Dark Souls 2, take the massive quality of life changes, that make the game more accessible in a positive way.Pros:+Excellent gameplay, with a combat feel and speed similar to Dark Souls 1 and Demon's Souls.+Tons of content, with over 150 different weapons, a wide array of armor sets, and solid amount of spells.+Extremely detailed and varied world, with attention to level design and smart world building.  Like Dark Souls 2, the game covers a lot of horizontal distance.  However, the world fits together in a way that makes sense.+The levels are also massive, with some single areas taking up as much space as multiple areas from other games.  There are many paths, shortcuts, and secrets in these giant levels.+Approachable systems, such as a very simple yet deep upgrade system, where weapons can be upgraded to +5 or +10, and infused with a element or scaling path, similar to Dark Souls 2.  However, the paths are much more interesting, such as a strength scaling, quality scaling, luck scaling, and many other paths, in a very Demon's Souls-y way.+The return of exclusively using estus to heal.  No more lifegems or blood vials.  There is a Dark Souls 2 system of upgrading the estus, however you start with 4 charges instead of 1.  Divine blessings still exist but are very rare and you can only carry 1 at a time.+I was personally not disappointed by a single boss, area, or enemy in the game.  There was no drop in quality like Dark Souls 1, lackluster areas like Dark Souls 2, or annoying, tedious grinds, like Bloodborne.  There was a smooth difficulty curve that increased as the quality of the areas and bosses did, all the way to the end of the game.+Mound makers is one of the coolest covenants in a souls game.  The way they work is to leave your white sign, however when you are summoned you are hostile to the host, summoned phantoms, invading phantoms, and enemies.  Your task is to kill a phantom of any kind, so they act as a sort of wild card.  Every encounter I have had with mound makers has been a fun time.+The matchmaking, at least on ps4, has been incredible.  Very similar to the speed of dark souls 2, but with the password system of bloodborne.  Multiplayer with friends is very fast, and can be done immedietely after the tutorial boss.  The pvp also takes a 2 hit combo system from dark souls 2, where it's relatively impossible to get stunlocked to death unless you get ganked.  Backstabs are also a non-issue, unless possibly the other player has a horrible connection.+Amazing soundtrack, one of the best in the series.  So many good songs.However, there are a few problems that some may have with the game:-Magic is pretty hard early game, other than maybe pyromancy.  When trying to play a mage, you have a lot more stats to focus on, and it takes a very deep investment in faith or intelligence for spells to get really strong.  I played a magic character as one of my characters, and I constantly struggled with whether i wanted to upgrade int for better spells/damage, attunement for more mana and spell slots, str/dex to get a better backup weapon, and health since you start with extremely low health.  The cast speed also feels really slow, and you can't cancel casts.  With an increase in aggression, and low health, starting as a spellcaster is very challenging for the first third of the game.  It is doable however, and by the end of the game is very viable and will hit very hard.-Encounters take a very ambush-y and gank-y approach to them.  This is not a bad thing for me personally, but I know a lot of people dislike this method of approach, and there is a lot of it in Dark Souls 3.  With magic being as slow as it is, it makes playing a mage even harder than it already was.-The world is not interconnected like Dark Souls 1 is.  There are no inter-level shortcuts and areas with multiple entrances and exits.  This is a non-issue for me, because the level design was so good that it didn't matter to me.  However, I know that one of the biggest draws for people regarding Dark Souls 1 was how the world was connected.  So this will be a negative for a lot of people.-There is a lack of interesting covenants to take the place of the ratbros or gravelords.  Most of the covenants have a typical function.  Coop, invasions, or protection of a host/area.  This is a let down, as the weirder covenants were some of the more fun covenants that existed.-This is one of my biggest negatives, but also not a big issue in the grand scheme of things.  There are 2 returning covenants in the game that perform the exact same duties.  The blue sentinals from dark souls 2 and the blades of the darkmoon from dark souls 1.  I really do not see the point in having both of these covenants.  The way darkmoons should work is to use the eye orb to invade the world of sinners who invade other players, and let blue sentinels do the guarding of the way of the blue members.  This just feels incredibly lazy, redundant, and a massive oversight into the possibilities of the coolness of the darkmoons.-Probably the most objective negative is with some weapon variety.  A lot of weapons have copy pasted movesets, with only the weapon art to differentiate them, and sometimes not even that.  A lot of weapons are objectively worse than others for this reason.  Boss soul weapons are also disappointingly underwhelming.  However each weapon class is very fun and different, so even if many play the same between weapon classes, there is lots of types to play with.Those cons aside, this game is incredible.  I highly recommend it, whether you are a fan of the series or not.  It takes all the best parts of the other games, mixes it into a nice dish, and adds its own twist to make it stand above the sum of its parts.  I was blown away, and it surpassed my expectations, which were already extremely high.  I hope that the multiplayer lasts a long time, as I will be playing for years to come."

Positive,i have like 400 hours on Xbox I love these games I would 100% kiss the entire from soft team if I found them to be honest they should be scared that I might just pop out of the shadows and give them a nice little consenting kiss
Positive,"I thought that I would not like Souls games but I am now a fan for life. The difficulty is sometimes unfair but 99% of my deaths are my fault. I got too greedy trying to get another swing in and it cost me. Patience and memorization are important here. It's like a puzzle almost. You learn the level, what enemies are where, enemies attack patterns, find shortcuts. Then it becomes almost trivial the enemies and bosses you had such a hard time with before. One caveat is that I could never get overconfident. Despite knowing what to do I could still screw up so when I die or take a large amount of damage it's my fault.Always respect your opponent, no matter how confident you think you are, enemies can and will punish your mistakes."
Positive,"In the age of estoc, the meta was unformed, shrouded by fog. A land of greatshields, dark swords, and everlasting stamina. But then there were builds, and with builds, came disparity. Strength and dex, int and faith, and of course... fun and tryhard. Then, from the planners, they came, and found the stats for weapons to fit their builds. Straightsword, the first of the playthroughs The Weeaboo Edgelords, and their Blades of Chaos FUGS, the Lord of Damage, and his faithful poise And the furtive caster, so easily forgotten. With the power of builds, they challenged the greatshields. FUGS's mighty blows peeled apart their huge stamina The weebs weaved huge shitstorms on the internet Straightswords unleashed a flurry of R1s and kicks And the Hornet Ring betrayed his own, and the turtles were nerfed more. Thus began the Age of Builds. But soon, the meta will change, and only tryhards will remain. Even now, there are only duels, and invaders see not ganks, but endless bows. And amonsgt the PCs are seen, carriers of the accursed Cheat Engine -Rain, discord memelord"

Positive,"I am new to doing big reviews, I will try my best.Sorry for an incorrect spellings &/or poor grammar.I first played Dark Souls 3 In 2016 couple of months after release.Some friends mentioned how difficult the game is, some gave up, some got good.So I went out and brought it for the PlayStation 4.I decided to stream it, I think I was expecting to be sort of good at it?I was wrong...So, I create my character spending around 20 minutes doing so.He looked cool, I liked it.I think I chose the Knight class at the time.So, I get up out my grave walk down the path, check tutorial messages.Kill my first enemy, gained confidence.Miss a few details, I am now at the Ravenous Crystal Lizard.I die,Over...And Over..Again, I die.So, I thought. What am I doing wrong!? Games an issue, its not me.Yush it was me.So I actually learned his attacks, when to dodge and managed to kill him.I am at the 2 hour mark at this point and have not even arrived at the first bonfire.I get to the bonfire, light it, sit, try out my new emote and I feel good.I kill all the grave wardens, grab the firebombs, jump to the coffin grab that Item.Now I am walking down towards Iudex Gundyr.I have no idea who he is at this time, what his name was.I pulled the sword out, I did not move (I wish I started swinging attacks whilst hes getting up)He stands up, swings at me and I get hit.I run away, use Estus flask, run back, Oh wait no, hes right behind me.I get hit and sent off the edge.I go back, failed attempt again I die.I think I died around 10-15 times.Now remember I am streaming. A family member is watching me die over and over, he is motivating me, It helped alot.But in the end, I could not Git Gud.I quit.Went on Fallout 4 PC, spoke to Preston, on my way to a settlement that needs help.A month later.I thought about going back on, so I did.Made a new character, forgot where I left off and got through the first area in around 30 minutes, less than the two hours before haha.Killed the Crystal creature second try.I am now at Iudex Gundyr.This time I am not streaming. I'm not a streamer, just did it for a group of friends that literally watched me die over and over.This times a lil different.I realise, don't get hit lolI won't lose health if I don't get hit, what a genius.I try slashing Iudex whilst he's standing up and I see blood, slashing sounds, good sign.when he finally stands, I see he lost health from that, I am happy.Fire bombed him at second stage.Ill just round it up to an estimate of 5 times I died to him the second time I came back from a rage quit a month later.So, the Starved Hound scared me.Sword Master brutally murdered me, I lost my Ember.I go back to Sword Master, Die, Die, Die.Yup you can tell I have serious issues with learning at least something about the moveset of the enemy, be patient.Nah, games never taught me that.This is what made me fall in love with Dark Souls.I played Bloodborne after my playthrough on Dark Souls 3, that went actually well considering DS3 Basically trained me.So, I am now in High Wall of Lothric.I die so much, fail at almost everything, I end up with a game time of 20 hours... Seriously.I just could not get my head around the move set, stay patient, the right stats, weapons.Its like through my life of gaming, Dark Souls 3 actually taught me something.My favourite location in Dark Souls 3, Undead Settlement.Everything about it, just perfect.So beautiful yet so terrifying, I loved it.This is the area I decided to ""Git Gud""Stay back, roll when need to, learn every enemy's move set before committing to an attack. Don't go crazy with attacking.Just take a damn breather, give myself space, lure them out if needs be.Why was it that every enemy I see, I charged in like I am literally the Dragonborne.Well, I am gonna one two miss a few in this review.Nameless King ended me a few times.I could not figure out how to escape Aldrich's arrow attack, until I did.Crystal Sage, yup chase the purple one, one hit the fakes.Mimic's fail at Mimicking a chests chain.My PS4 Playthrough ended with NG+7.Few achievements missing, Items from covenants needed.Now were gonna do a little bit more of a jump in the future.I buy Dark Souls 3 on sale PC 2021 December & grab all the DLC.I am NG+11,Stops scaling at 7+, probably gonna start again in the future.WHAT, I say my friend WHAT, is that Concord Kept grind?Vertabrae Shackle.UH, I did it.All of them.I wanted the Achievements, all of them.And I got them.Everything else, yes great, fun.I did it all Offline.I loved PVP on PS4, the amount of hours I spent in Arena & Anor Londo invading & summoning mad spirits, red soapstones placed.I probably spent 10 hours of the 170 at review time in PVP on PC.The moment I learned about the hack sending players into NG+, gaining access to files.Big nope.So I researched If I could get all the covenant items offline, and committed to it.All Achievements unlocked now finally.I have done all of Bloodborne.I completed all parts of Dark Souls 2 Sotfs, just need grind NPC for Covenant items/spells.Dark Souls 1 Remastered is what I am currently playing, I love it.Dark Souls really opened up my eyes to gaming, especially on a game that to me was difficult.I started a No Hit Run, managed to get as far as Nameless King.No armour needed, idea is to not get hit. Fashion didn't bother me when attempting this run.Ancient Wyvern, Nameless kings pet did its fire thing at the ground, I should have ran out of the way but I was a second too late.I love the Drakeblood Armour set paired with the Farron Keep Helm.Plenty more armour sets I like as well.Do I recommend Dark Souls 3?Well, I had never played a Souls game ever before starting DS3 for the first time.I got deep into it.Loved every second of it. Well, the dying got me at the start, but I appreciate it now.The dying taught me to not do that.I recommend Dark Souls 3,I love this game.After this review I am on a mission to 100% Dark Souls Remastered, Then SOTFS.Thank you so much for reading :)I really appreciate you.I hope if you decide to buy this game, you forgive me for the spoilers I dropped.And also I hope you have a blissful playthrough, that brightens your life.F it, I wish you well in life either way.:)Edit:Thank you all so much for the Awards, likes.You are all so amazing, I am very great full Did not expect this O_OFor anyone interested (probably not), I may stream bits of my SOTFS run through for 100% achievement.I'm hoping to do this on TikTok, somehow...But if not, will be the YouTubes. ""JiggleBikeRiddle"" Is the name.Thank you all again, you are all amazing :)I wish you all a fantastic playthrough.Dark Souls and other Soul like (Bloodborne and stuffs) Will always be in my heart, till the day I am nought but an empty shell."
Positive,Love video games but hate yourself?Buy Dark Souls.
Positive,i play games to ignore my depression but this only worsened it
Positive,"As a Dark Souls newbie, this game was extremely punishing at first and tested my patience to the next level. Never have I been forced to realize how bad I am at combat. True, unadulterated, combat. The kind where it is your fault for going in too deep when the enemy was preparing an attack. Where slowing down and observing is just important as attacking. Death after death, and then some more for good measure, I finally managed to take down Iudex (the starting boss)…down to his second phase. Of course he had to have a second phase, I mean, it’s only been 5 minutes since I created my character and this guy is more difficult than most games’ final bosses. Alright fine, let’s try it again….and naturally, the stupid skeleton guarding the boss entrance chunked me for half of my health. This obnoxious heathen never managed to hit me in my previous 16 runs, but now its eyes gained some sort of holy enchantment to make every arrow land on my back. This is the type of game DARK SOULS III is. One without mercy, care, or pity. It took me approximately 2 hours to beat Iudex as a starting Mercenary, but the thrill and adrenaline post-battle was truly something no other game offered. Who knew I could come to love a game that wanted to kill me so badly.As I fought my way through the story, I began to become immersed with the lore and progression system. Every single item’s description, name, and method of acquisition imparts just a tiny bit of knowledge or history onto the player. At first, most of this information is useless at worst, or intriguing at best. These little puzzle pieces manage to eventually paint a very vivid and dark image about the world of Lothric and its inhabitants. Ashes and unique equipment often detail the previous owners’ qualities; a gift to fans of previous games in the series. Although DS III is fairly disconnected with any of the other SOULS games, certain NPCs and discoveries will tie up loose ends and provide closure for particular aspects of the first DARK SOULS game.Unlike the previous games, bonfires are placed just when you truly need them, and most important of all, teleportation between bonfires are available from the get-go. Firelink Shrine, the base of operations of sorts, serves as the location for player stat upgrades, weapon upgrades/infusions, Estus flask upgrades, and bonfire upgrades (increases healing per flask). Similar to Humanity or Human Effigies from the previous games, Ember heals the player and boosts max health in exchange for allowing human and NPC invasions.Although the world design is fairly spectacular, it was mostly linear/bi-linear (city with a dungeon below it) with moderate exploration required for completionists. The traditionally grand map comprised of interconnecting smaller maps through shortcuts is replaced with a more direct route, however, the world is still HUGE. In fact, without proper investigation, it is extremely easy to completely miss 4 optional areas with their own bosses. In total, there are 19 bosses that will do their best to make sure life in Lothric is a living Hell, along with several other mini-bosses in between. The grunt and fluff type enemies are never too difficult – just strong enough to warrant consistent player attention. The extremely well planned level and boss design (excluding a couple) easily makes DS III one of the most memorable games I have ever played. I can clearly recount most of the paths in every area along with every bosses’ movesets and shenanigans. From clones and body doubles, to massive variances in combat range and aggressiveness, the boss fights and surrounding environements are truly, and remarkably, unforgettable.One of the most noticeable changes to the tried-and-true combat involves the introduction of weapon arts. Think of it as a special skill move belonging to certain weapon types. Hacking and slashing is always fun, but turning that long sword into a propeller of death is even more so. Special and boss type weapons are often imbued with properties of their wielder, including a unique weapon art that can be so hauntingly beautiful to perform. Lance thrusts with bursts of electricity, sword strikes covered in fire, and duel-wielded weapons moving in an artistic dance are only some of what you will see. Unfortunately, most of these arts require the use of FP (focus points), and once out, they won’t be usable until replenished.DS III launched with quite a few minor grievances, mostly sporadic FPS drops, but all of them have been fixed. The only major issue at the moment is regarding softbanning due to “Data Inconsistencies” which may occur due to advancing in the game offline (de-syncing with the server) or from online hackers. Continuous patches have been applied since the posting of this review in order to keep up to date with the demanding pvp balance and bug encounters.I can’t stress enough how much I really enjoyed playing DS III. This game is one of my personal contenders for 2016 GOTY. I really regret never playing the earlier two during their heyday, but at least it gives me something to do while i lament the end of this great journey – at least, until the Season Pass content gets released. For those that want to continue into New Game +, DS III fortunately provides 3 other endings with vastly different consequences to uncover, increasing replayability immensely. One of those endings also requires an extremely strict quest-line progression, ultimately leading to one of the most shocking moments in the game!"
Positive,"Let me note a couple things, first off this is my first ever actual review so please don't chew me up.Second, an absurd amount of people are getting this from Humble Bumble this month, which is good dont get me wrong but you should probably know what you're getting yourself into.I also dont have much experience with the other souls game but thats subject to change, in other words this is coming from a strictly Dark Souls 3 player, no bias from the other games or any of that.As for gameplay I believe this game excels once you get ahold of it, I caught on pretty late, didnt know what fat rolling was or why I was so slow up to Yhorm before a friend explained it to me, so yeah, darn. Speakings of Yhorm I didn't like the  Storm Ruler  gimmick at all, same goes with Wolnir's  Braclets I mean you dont technically have to do the Yhorm thing, but its your best bet, I digress. Other then the little things that made the game that much easier, the gameplay kept me on my toes, and my controller(s) accross my roomSoundtrack wise it really stuck with me as well, especially the Main Menu theme, cause who can forget it?Lets talk about the Story, this is pretty difficult to pick up on for the most part, you have to read vague item descriptions and do the little side quests to really get into it, I'm gonna summarize it for you guys though.You are the Ashen One given the task to hunt down and return the five Lords of Cinder to their thrones in the Firelink Shrine to Link the flame once more in order to prevent the age of dark.I think I'm gonna bring up replayability lastly, because thats usually pretty important, which its there.Between NG+ and the achievements I've sank a good 40 hours of my time into this game in 2 weeks, according to steam, which may not be super impressive but its been an everyday routine to hop on and progress on my favorite RPG to date.My final verdict? Buy it and dont give up, this game is HARD to put it lightlyGameplay = 9/10OST = 8.5/10Story = 8/10Replay Value = 8.5/10Total Score = 9/10"
Positive,"If you're a newcomer to the series, I have a few simple advice for ya.Death is the core mechanic of the game, so dont afraid to die.If you are about to smash your monitor. Quit the game for 30mins or more, then come back and try again. Or try again the next day.Dont cheat and DONT lookup on the internet for guide, maps, tips or weapon location, et cetera.I know Its tempting to googling for all the secrets and hidden paths, or location for all items and armors. But leave that for your 2nd playthrough. The less you know, the more you gonna enjoy the game. I bet on my life that A LOT of people would wish to play any Souls game for the first time again. Lastly, if you havent play the original DS, please do."
Positive,"I might get flak for this, but this is for sure my favorite of the main 3 Souls games. The weapons, bosses, combat, and movement are all miles above the previous generations but it still sticks to the horrid and depressing atmosphere that Dark Souls is known for. It's a hard game for sure but there are very few times I've felt the game was unfair. Ringed City, Pontiff Sulyvahn, and Aldrich are by far the worst parts of this game in terms of ""difficult for the sake of it"" from my perspective, and even then once you learn the patterns they become manageable. I'd seriously seriously recommend this, especially if you're new to the Souls games"
Positive,"It makes me want to scream my entire face off sometimes. Sometimes I get up and walk around when I die in a stupid way. I say to myself, ""this isn't even fun"". I painfully laugh in the glow of my screen, and whimper, ""I think I'm done with this."" I look up at the monitor, thinking the game will respond in some way. It doesn't. The menu stares back at me, with no indication of life. It's just here. It's here whether or not I play it. Even if I uninstall it, it's just here, patiently waiting for me to come back."
Positive,"After I've put  hours on DKS3 , I have learned that I should ;1. Being greedy is a mistake. Unless I'm more of a STR build  char with huge weapons2. Timing is important. Especially when dodging.3. Always keen for details.4. Dont be cocky.5. Dont Panic.6. Read another player's messages, and dont forget to rate it.7.

Dying in DKS3 is part of the learning the game process."
Positive,"A white phantom invaded my game while I was fighting some enemies. He watched from afar, clapping and lying down as I ungraciously beat everything around me to death. Once I was done I approached the phantom. He bowed and two-handed a shield. I bowed as well and two handed my greatshield. We fought using only our shields, nothing around us but the sound of clanking and tiny blood spurts as we slowly damaged each other. In the end, I was victorious, but I will never forget you kind shield man."

Positive,"Here we are again, writing about a game in which I have spent almost 500hours, the final masterpiece hymn to the flame and the true successor to the first Dark souls, the game all the fans  we were waiting. As always I've started with a Souls game, I have not been able to fully get into any other one, I've always felt captivated and fascinated with the rule, the harder the battle it's gonna be, the sweeter the victory will be, that's the reason why the Souls games are so addictive and I fell in love with them since the beginning with Demon's on PS3, I can't stop playing.There are so many cool and gorgeous things I can tell you guys, that I think it's better just say:Yo should play this game before you die."

Positive,"As a newcomer to Dark Souls, the first ~10 hours can be pretty intimidating. It's a lot of blundering around, not knowing how all the numbers/mechanics function, and (ofc) straight-up struggling with the game's punishing difficulty. Starting around the first half of the mid-game is when things start to change; the flow of the game starts to make coherent sense, and it's at this point that DS3 reels you into absolute addiction.The process of developing an understanding over the unspoken rules of a formal waltz between player and enemy is what makes these games special. Every victory must be earned; that's not to say that every trash mob will force you to use all your brainpower, but the fact that literally -every- enemy is potentially lethal will force you to respect their moveset, and play around it until it becomes second nature.The game's learning curve, absence of difficulty settings/sliders, and lack of any way to cheese/cheat around it forces you to play in a way that most games didn't raise you to behave. You don't get to march forth with superior numbers and all the odds stacked in your favour; that birthright is given to the boss enemies instead. Button mashing hack-n-slash- tactics are guaranteed failure; you are 10x weaker than they are by design. To survive on the opposite end of the court for a change, you have to become the most annoying and conniving little flea that nicks and nibbles at the boss' HP while refusing to die by all means possible. It's great exercise for a part of the brain that never gets any."

Positive,"DARK SOULS PVP NITPICKING -""EVERYONE HAS ALREADY COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS"" EDITIONGRAIN OF SALT WARNING: This post is by an idiot who played over 1000 hours of Dark Souls 2 and Scholar of the First Sin, most of which were PVP hours at the upper soulmemory tiers.As far as PVE goes, it's pretty good!  Nice places, wide selection of weapons from the get-go, you know the drill.  Everyone is basically in agreement that the PVE is a return to DS1 form and is generally lovely, though personally I think the locations are not quite as fantasy-tastic as DS1 or DS2.  Personal opinion there; YMMV.The PVP is another matter.  Again, fair warning; some of these might just be my cheese being moved, but as a guy who got to know the combat in DS2 fairly deeply, I am annoyed that a lot of clever things were disposed of.  It's not a world-shatteringly terrible affair, but it seems curious to me that several of the lessons FromSoft learned from DS2's two-year-long PVP balancing fiasco were either forgotten or ignored, including but not limited to:- No weapon turncaps.  Any weapon can track a full 180deg after the first attack; in DS2, things like thrusting swords and spears had their tracking limited so that their advantages (range, speed) were offset by poor tracking; without these restrictions, these weapons become much stronger since their narrow hitbox will almost always be where you want it to be without punishing you if you are wrong.- Faster combat.  This is not a bad thing!  The way it interacts with the famously spotty netcode is.  Certain weapons have very fast running or rolling attack animations, and a poor connection can lead to you not even seeing several initial frames of an attack, making certain weapons irritatingly overpowered (I'm looking at you, katana running attacks (and the people who play (very successfully!) with nothing but this one attack)).  This also makes phantom range a bigger problem than it was.- No poise.  I know ""poise"" is in the game as some bizarre mechanic that governs i-frame loss, but that is some small potatoes.   Hyper-armor as a general purpose poise replacement is not all bad; it makes some STR-focused weapons very viable, but certain fast and light weapons (estoc, duh) are more effective than anything else simply because they can be doing damage before you have a chance to get to your weapon's hyper-armor frames as a counter.  Personally, I find this problem is the worst with the Farron Greatsword - its weapon art move hits for a decent bit of damage and is a guaranteed stunlock, but the stun comes long before the damage thanks to the myriad of hits apparently accomplished by breakdancing.  The weapon effectively has a fast weapon's hitstun timing and a midsize weapon's damage, which is an irritating pairing when added to the eons long stunlock.- No backstep iframes.  I straight-up don't see people backstep anymore.  I'm a proponent of the ""more options/higher skill ceiling"" school of thought, and though some people exploited backsteps to the point of being irritating cheese in DS2, I miss having a good portion of my weapon's moveset being viable and not just an extended, predictable setup.  With the faster combat/netcode combo, nobody can expect to evade a hit from another player with a backstep since they'll just hit the space where you were, doing damage without fail.- No aimable running attacks or backstep attacks.  You could do some really nifty stuff with large weapons and manually aiming backsteps and running attacks, but now running attacks are only PVP viable with very fast weapons.  Certain weapons with a running charge for a running attack have a teeeeeeeny allowance for changing direction, but it's so small that it's trivial.  Combine this with no iframes for backsteps and you lose a lot of options for skilled play.- Nerfed offhand moveset.  In DS2, you could do any attack with your left handed weapon that you could with your right, excluding ripostes and other crits.  Now, the only moves your offhand weapon can perform are light attacks and either a guard or a parry (or spells but that's obvious) depending on what you have equipped.  Curiously, when equipping a weapon with an offhand parry move, L1 attacks and L2 parries as expected, but when using any other weapon, L1 guards and L2 is the attack button.  Why FromSoft thought anyone would want to guard with a 1handed weapon or have the input commands mixed up like this is completely beyond my ken.  Again, less options.- No attack cancels.  This sword cuts both ways; you don't see the game or players doing something that obviously shouldn't be possible, which is a pet peeve of mine that I grudgingly put aside for the sake of fun, but you also miss out on a lot of headgames that ultimately decide fights between skilled players.  Cancels were the redemption of large weapons in DS2, and while hyper armor on any weapon larger than a stick is not a bad tradeoff, it still feels like the easy way out as far as making big weapons viable goes.  Less options!- Nerfed guard-breaks.  This seriously rewards extremely defensive play which is SUPER BORING and exhausting.  Greatshields are supposed to be great at being shields; that's perfectly fine!  To not be able to counter one without a whip is not fine.  People did perfectly infuriating jobs of being obnoxious and effective turtles back in DS2 when one guardbreak could swat the shield aside, and now it is much much easier.- Removal of several key gestures.  This might seem trivial, but a large portion of a player's ""vocabulary"" was nixed for some reason.  There are now a million ways to say ""Hello!"" and ""I'm a smarmy jerk!  Look at how bad you are!"" but FromSoft removed the ability to say ""No"" with the No Way gesture, they removed the Mock gesture which was a great way to express confusion, they removed the It's Me! gesture which was the best thing since sliced bread, and they removed the Righty-Ho! which was just great and I miss it.  At least we got the clap and the ""here's my elbow"" and anri's pretentious slow-walk emote!- Broken Covenants.  This doesn't affect everyone, but IT AFFECTS ME AND I AM AS CHEESED AS I CAN BE ABOUT A SMALL PORTION OF A VIDEOGAME.  Basically, some people get summoned to covenants that autosummon you and some people just don't, and apparently it's determined by the steam account that owns the game, primarily affecting early purchasers (as far as I can tell).  Move your file over to family sharing and there's no problem, but this should not be considered a fix and I'm not even sure if it violates the EULA or not so I haven't bothered.  Point is, getting certain covenant rewards is unreasonably tedious for some as a result, myself included.----------------------------These are my major gripes that I think could find broad acceptance.  My minor gripes are FAR MORE IMPORTANT.  Obviously.----------------------------- No bell on a stick and my amazing greathammer 1handed rolling r1 is gone from all greathammers.- No statue on a stick and everyone just circles around the edge of the Pontiff's arena doing nothing.- You can't stand still and turn with a drawn greatbow anymore; the game just interprets this as you getting antsy and takes you out of the draw animation.- I used to be able to play with friends I made in Australia.  Now it is as though we send packets via smoke signals.- NO RUIN SENTINEL SET OR ANY OTHER SET WITH A HELM THAT A HUMAN HEAD COULD NOT POSSIBLY FIT IN.  COME ON, FROMSOFT.  WHERE'S MY GOOFBALL AWESOME GEAR?????I'd still say buy it because I'm an addict and a slave with nothing else to play, and chargeable attacks and weapon arts are the bees' knees.  If you like masochism and hating the thing you love, then the newest Dark Souls is still for you!These are still the developers who, in DS2, had the bewilderingly enormous stones to buff the Chaos Blade on April Fools' Day and leave it that way.Hooray!"
Positive,"So, I bought Dark Souls about 6 months after it came out on pc and well, I was not impressed. I initially didn’t have a controller, even after I picked one up I just wasn't into the movement of Dark Souls. It felt so clunky. . It just seemed like lame, slow combat with no sick moves haha.  At the time I was playing Kingdoms of Amalur or another action/rpg like that. With my issues with the gameplay aside, I would have been down to stick it out and see what the game was about. However I quickly got frustrated with the so called difficulty of Dark Souls. The limiting bonfire system, no quest helper/tracker and the minimalist dialogue from the one npc at firelink made me just give up. I didn't see much of a story and what I did see was about as convoluted a story as I had seen.With all of the frustration I had with Dark Souls I admit I still found it intriguing. I said to myself if they “fix” the movement and gameplay then I’ll give the series another shot. And so I waited, wanting to explore this acclaimed series but trying to find a more accessible entry point. Dark Souls 2 came out and I was tempted but still apprehensive.I bought Bloodborn on PS4 played it for 10 minutes and never played it again. My fault. And then Dark Souls 3 came out, finally, the “modern” souls game I was looking for.*********Spoilers**********************Obviously, I waited for a Steam sale. I finally purchased Dark Souls 3. I was hoping that this would be a way for me to get into the Souls universe. I remembered the vague and cryptic story I had experienced and I was stoked to get into this. So I started up Dark Souls 3 (again without a controller) and after 3 hours I got past Iudex, the first boss. I was excited by the movement being much smoother and also frustrated by the keyboard.  So I proceeded on with the game, moving onto Lothric Castle. I quickly became frustrated with the controls and I just could not progress, knight’s op versus keyboard. So I went out and bought an Xbone controller. I also started watching a let’s play on YouTube. I was determined to give this game all I had this time. I slowly proceeded to get better and more comfortable with the game and the combat. I died to probably every single enemy in that castle.   My deaths, at that time, were far more stupendous than my kills. Die to the Dragon. Die to the skeletons next to the dragon. Die to the Knight after the skeletons. Die to the terrifying-possessed-zombie-thing next to the knight. I learned a valuable lesson with all that dying. Never underestimate an enemy.     A combination of fear and excitement made me slowly progress to the first REAL boss. As I finally encountered this beast I have to admit, I was awestruck. That thing is badass! And he proceeded to ground me into dust. He’s huge he’s strong and he’s fast? How do I kill this thing? I went in knowing this was gonna take a few tries.  Haha, after the tenth time I was ready. I knew this assholes moves and he was going down! Popped an ember and… You Died.  Four more times and I finally owned that beast, the satisfaction was great, and, the relief of the bonfire was greater. Whew!“So this is Dark Souls?” I thought.“This is hard. But doable.” I ventured forth looking to own some more heirs of fire. I rambled through the next areas trying to figure everything out as I went, but I would also be watching my trusty let’s play youtuber to share in my pain and triumphs. That really helped me as the Dark Souls mood can really creep you out! As I slowly grew more powerful, I dabbled in pyromancy. I found my first Ultra Greatsword. I found side bosses and explored and learned about this tragic world. Making my way through the middle of the game, I began to see some of the beauty of the world. There are some truly amazing sites in this game. Irithyll Valley. Anor Londo. So cool.The bosses! Abyss Watchers. Pontiff Sulyvhan. The Dancer. Demons. DraGONS. GiANTS!!! WowSo here I am now, just sitting in Archdragon Peak waiting to find the courage to beat the Nameless King. And so now, coming full circle, Dark Souls 3 has made me decide to play Dark Souls again. Just to give it another shot. Now, I‘m a level 38 Pyromancer heading down to the catacombs. Been enjoying the hell out of it. Not as smooth as Dark Souls 3 but definitely great. This game is one of the best gaming experiences I’ve ever had. I really can’t say enough about this game.Thank you From Software!"

Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is technically my first ever experience with a souls like game and after completing the main campaign and defeating all the boss in the base game, boy do I have things to say about this game.This is one of the best aspects about this game, I've always loved games with methodical combat, games that give you a sense of weight in each attack and who make you think twice about outcomes of every single press of a button. I was introduced to my passion for these kind of games with Monster Hunter: World (PS: I know these 2 games have a lot of differences but I'm not trying to compare them, I'm just stating an example of type of combat I like in games.)There is a vast variety of weapons to choose from... From small and fast attacking Daggers to big and heavy hitting Hammers, from magical Staffs to magic emitting Swords and thunder summoning Spears, its present, and if you're feeling particularly daring u can even go unga-bunga with bare fists or different kind of glove like weapons.You also have an option to infuse weapons with different types of elements and debufs like fire, frost, dark, lightning etc. In terms of variety of weapons this game doesn't fail.The story can be pretty straight forward or pretty deep depending on the players I think... The main campaign and cutscenes and dialogues do a pretty good job at explaining the story well but if u want to take it a step further u can dig deep and find how deep the story actually is and if u feel like u can also read lore ad stuff if u will to do soo, I've read some lore and to be honest it pretty darn good if u are into magical, mysterios stuff.  Aah the gameplay, here comes the fun part. Lemme state the obvious here first this game is hard, like REAL HAARRDD, but if u play it co-op it gets kinda manageable.The gameplay is super fun if you're into this kinda combat, It took me a little bit of tweaking the keybinds to get comfortable with the controls. The game posses a pretty good challenge but the real challenge begins when u fight ""The Abyss Watchers"" the difficulty level go from ""Hard"" to ""Damn this fucking game"" real quick. But it makes the reward and the sense of winning even more satisfying IMO. As the game progresses u travel through a variety of environments and cities. And man is this game beautiful when it tries to be. The sheer beauty in the environment and the creativity gone into the types and aesthetic of the game is faccinating.  As much as I like this game it has some issues that bothered me.The most annoying issue is the camera, sometimes while fighting your enemies you have to fight the camera but emphasis on sometimes.Some people might not agree with me on this one but Invaders were and still are a really annoying thing to deal with, like sometimes I just want to play with my friend, enjoy and play the campaign but then suddenly this Invader with lord knows how many Estus Flask and level decides to drop and kill both of us in like a heartbeat and it can be real annoying (PS: Invasions only happen if you are embered or the person you are playing is embered which is most likely cause the host is required to be embered to invite other players) and done off the most important things to remember it DOES NOT have autosave, I lost my complete agme save file because I didnt knew it.______________________________________________Overall I'd say that no fear comes close to fighting a giant baby with a hand for his head with over 60k souls on you.10/10Would love to give myself a close heartattack experience again."

Positive,"a masterpiece. If you play the game you will understand why I call it a masterpiece. It's impossible to explain with words. You can only know by feeling it. You can only know by playing and being consumed by the dark souls universe. You will ultimately become a better person the second you launch this game. I suffer from an addiction called league of legends. I was a terrible person when I played that trash game. It gave me major depression from being hardstuck gold 3 19LP. Dark Souls has changed my life for the better. It has made me better at communicating with women and ever since I launched the game nothing has come to me but pure joy and happiness. I have gotten married to the woman of my dreams. I have also started a family and I am going to get my daughter into dark souls once she is old enough. I will never let this game die as long as I live. Dark Souls is truly an amazing experience that you do not want to miss out on. It will bring you so much joy and fortune. I have never been happier, and I haven't played league in a very long time now. I dont even have the urge or temptation to even install the game. I think that if smokers played dark souls they would forget about smoking. They wouldn't even want to take time out of their day to smoke when they can just play dark souls 3"

Positive,I hate this game
Positive,I feel a sense of pride and accomplishment.
Positive,"TL;DR - YES, it's good. NO, it's not nearly half as scary as you've been told. Don't be a chicken and give it a try. Probably wait until it's on sale though, the game certainly isn't new anymore.-Technical Stuffs-I'm running a pretty mediocre i5 processor, a mediocre 8GB of RAM, and an equally mediocre 2GB Radeon RX 460 GPU. I've set my graphics quality to 'high', which gets me a clean, steady 40 fps. I don't terribly mind, I can't really see the difference between 40 and 60 fps anyway. Dialing the settings back to 'medium' boosted my frames by an entire 5 fps on average, so that wasn't worth it.I haven't had any crashes yet and haven't encountered any bugs - the game runs perfectly fine for me. -Difficulty-Okay, let's get it out of the way. Is Dark Souls 3 difficult? I mean... kinda, and you'll almost certainly die a *lot*, but it's also very kind to its players.The thing is, DS3 very much expects you to royally mess up pretty much constantly, and it's balanced around that. You can suck as much as you want to, and you'll still be fine afterward; dying doesn't make you lose anything you can't regain fairly quickly.Just take every enemy seriously, even the most common of mooks and the freaking *tutorial enemies*, and don't bother being mad about dying, and you'll be fine.Winning is also never a mathematical impossibility - no matter how crappily you've leveled your character, you can still beat the game with it. Heck, some people take on the game at LV1 (and some even without equipment) *for fun*. I'm not saying it would be easy (because it REALLY would not be), but it's possible. So, seriously, don't be intimidated by the Souls-series' scary reputation; it's not fully warranted, and you're missing out on one hell of an experience. -Gameplay-First off: Yes, you can play DS3 with keyboard and mouse if you're used to that. You might want to put up a sticky note translating the shown (controller) keybinds if you have difficulty navigating the menus, but apart from that, KB/M is perfectly fine and occasionally very useful because it helps with camera management. Oof. What else to say? Melee combat, especially with a controller, is smooth as all hell. Magic is *fine*, but something Skyrim honestly does better. I'm happy with the gameplay, basically, but gameplay is generally not my main focus.-Visuals-OH MAN DS3 is a pretty game. Hardly anybody ever mentions that about Dark Souls, but the design of both characters (human-ish and monstrous alike) and environments is really, really good. The environments are dense, and the render distance and texture quality of far-away backdrops is positively ridiculous. I adore the cloth pysics in this game, too. On sale, you could easily buy the game for the visuals alone.(Only (three-second long) exception: Lothric's face when he resurrects his brother. DUDE, what happened to your high-definition facial textures? You look like you fell out of a very shoddily upscaled PS2 game!)-Audio-Yup. So much yup. Much of the game is surprisingly silent, but when there's music (mostly for the boss fights), it's *incredible*. Very epic, but also very fitting, and finely tailored to the circumstances in which the music plays. I'd listen to it all the time, but it gives me sudden feelings of dread.-Story and writing-Very sparse, but the things you can piece together from dialogue and item descriptions sound intriguing. NPCs tend to stay pretty flat and personality-less, with a few exceptions. Funnily enough, few people will agree on those exceptions. Few people will agree on *anything* in this series, but that's neither here nor there.The weirdest thing about Dark Souls in general is how everyone chuckles creepily every few lines. It's very strange, really.(also, the unironic use of 'thee' combined with the over-the-eyes headpiece of the Firekeeper reminds me of the Mouth of Sauron, and that's a mental image I *really* did not need)-Additional Comments: Visual Design, Worldbuilding-Yes, I'll ramble on about that some more.Everybody keeps raving about how ""amazingly difficult"" those games are, which never interested me much. You know what would've made me play those games *years* ago, though? Somebody mentioning that DS3 in particular is a highly unconventional look at what's essentially a post-apocalyptic world, or that you play various flavors of undead characters in all three games. That is SO AWESOME.DS3 also loves to contrast and combine purity and corruption, light and dark, holy and demonic in something that's pretty much my entire aesthetic in video game form. So many creepy, corrupted cathedrals! Evil angel knights! Morally dubious gods and equally morally dubious people worshipping a great many things! ALL the lovingly modeled Gothic architecture!Have I mentioned the amazing architecture yet? Sure, I'm a bit of an art and history nerd, but I've spent hours staring at pillars because they're so pretty. In DS3, reality and the space-time-continuum is completely falling apart, the world is stagnant and full of unchanging undead, aesthetically rotting, full of half-decayed wall hangings and carpets in gorgeous buildings, brittle gothic-inspired furniture everywhere... I love that so, so much. -Additional Comments: Community, Multiplayer-Multiplayer is divisive and the community tends to feel very strongly about pretty much everything; the tone is much rougher than in most other games I've played. It's stilly pretty fun, though, you just need a healthy sense of humor and the ability to keep your competitive nature in check. (Seriously, don't be That Guy, DS3 has way too many That Guys already)PvP matching is level-bound, so be sure to give it a try from the start; the higher your level, the more difficult starting out would be. You also get rather important items from PvP - you can farm them offline, there's nothing in the game that *requires* PvP... but having to farm those items is generally not a very fun time.-Additional Comments: Business Practices-You can get softbanned from online play for a large array of mostly harmless things (such as using camera mods in offline mode for screenshotting purposes), mostly without an option to rectify that. Some players have reported getting banned without being aware of doing anything wrong at all. FromSoft's solution to cheaters deliberately getting people softbanned amounts to ""keep backups (which a handful of people have reported being banned for, of course) and don't get screwed over by cheaters"". Real smooth, that. It's honestly the only real gripe I have with that game."
Positive,"Try finger, but hole."
Positive,I am dying to the enemies
Positive,Dark Souls III was my introduction into the souls universe and it was truly an amazing experience. I was always put off from dark souls just thinking that it was a little to weird and out there for me to ever really give it a try. However giving Dark Sourls III a try was one of the best gaming decisions I've ever made. This game has some of the best combat I've ever experienced in any game and and the sense of adventure is amazing to experience. I have had more fun in this game than I have had in any other game in quite some time. I would highly recommend to anyone on the fense about playing this game to do it now. I truly do not think you will regret it.
Positive,747 hours later and this game still runs my life
Positive,"Elden Ring is good, but nothing will replace D3 as the fav."
Positive,"Short version:Pros:+ World-building and lore are amazing+ Areas are interconnected+ Exploration is rewarded+ Very challenging but never cheap+ Stellar art direction+ Plenty of secrets+ Great boss battles+ Epic soundtrack+ Outstanding amount of content+ DLC+ ReplayabilityCons:- Still unwelcoming to a lot of people (story, lore, gameplay)- Ranged weapons are still not viable- Interconnectivity is not as complex as before“Long” version:Dark Souls III is an RPG developed by FromSoftware, Inc. and published by BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment. It is the final title in the Dark Souls trilogy.You play as the Ashen One and your objective is to defeat all five Lords of Cinder and bring them back to Firelink Shrine to ignite the flame again.The story may seem superficial at first but, just like in the first game, there is a lot of lore behind characters, items and locations. The game does not really ease the player into its world; you will have to rely on reading item descriptions and watching a few videos to get a general idea of what is going on. Even though it may not be for everyone, the story is engaging enough to keep you interested.While I thought the final areas in Dark Souls 1 were rather uninspired, I feel like all areas in this third installment are good. You do not get anything as frustrating as Blighttown or as cheap as the archers in Anor Londo’s rooftops – you certainly get nods to said areas, but they are not as unfair.Areas are also interconnected, just like in the first game, but this time, I think this interconnectivity is less “special”. In Dark Souls 1, you would explore for a rather long time and finally getting to kick down a ladder to access a bonfire after 30-40 minutes was a huge victory. I remember being completely lost and suddenly opening a gate, only to figure out my starting point was just on the other side. I found shortcuts to be too plentiful and easy to get in this one. It is not necessarily bad, per se, but managing to find shortcuts on my first try after 10 minutes or less felt a tad strange.With that out of the way, let us talk gameplay.It is very satisfying. The controls are responsive and you feel in control during exploration and combat.Exploration is simple, as it does not require tricky jumps or timed actions. You can still jump, just like in the first game, but it was clunky back then and it is clunky now. You get rewards for looking for hidden entrances with better gear and consumables.Combat is great – there is a lot of variety to it. You can use a plethora of weapons/armor to dispatch enemies and depending on your build, you will be able to adopt different playstyles. You can be slow but powerful, nimble but squishy, a bit of both. The choices are endless. You can also be a spellcaster but I still find it rather janky. I feel like the game does a poor job explaining how it works.I decided to go for a high-stamina katana build with a bow on the side. Just like in the first game, the bow is completely useless. I get it, you want your players to engage in melee combat – I understand why some players find ranged weapons “lame”; but come on, I want to feel like a king and fill a boss full of arrows while I dodge like a madman. But I cannot do that in Dark Souls 3 – your bows are absurdly slow and rather weak. You can cheese some enemies/bosses with it but it is not rewarding at all. I feel like it would take a whole lot of work to integrate ranged weapons into the game and the devs would rather keep the options really underwhelming to avoid making the game too easy.Dark Souls 3 also seems to be a lot more forgiving when it comes to damage and healing items. I managed to “trade” hits fairly often, even while wearing light armor. That is something that would be impossible in the first game – trading hits was a fast way to die. Estus flasks (healing items) also seemed a bit “too good”, I never really struggled while exploring because of how plentiful they were. It might have been because I used them all for HP. If you play as a magic user, you will have to divide them between HP and mana, so I guess that would counterbalance its effectiveness (?).But still, combat is a lot of fun if you pick anything besides bows. I will be attempting to use magic for my next playthrough where I plan to get the rest of the achievements. I reckon it will be a lot of fun and completely different from my ninja build.Graphically, I feel like Dark Souls 3’s art direction does most of the work. The actual graphics are fine but nothing special. The characters and world design are amazing, the environments feel vibrant and lived-in. Enemy and boss designs are really interesting with one or two exceptions that feel too “safe”.The soundtrack is stellar. Each track feels meticulously crafted – boss fights are elevated to such a level of epicness that I could recommend the game on the soundtrack alone.Sound effects are satisfying – hits feel heavy and crunchy because of how good the sound is.There is still a bit of janky associated to the game if you plan on playing it with mouse and keyboard as I did, but it is nothing too inconvenient. The game also has some multiplayer elements to it, which I avoided for the most part, but ended up trying after beating the game the first time. It is fun! I ended up trying some DLC bosses with other players and it felt great – the limited communication actually improved the experience. Invaders can be a bit annoying but I feel like you get invaded just the right amount to keep you on your toes. You can actively invade other players too, which I tried once, but I just sat around and drank booze with the enemy. No need to kill someone and ruin their day :pI had quite a bit of fun with the DLCs.I review Ashes of Ariandel here.I review The Ringed City  here.All in all, I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience with Dark Souls 3. While its exploration feels bland in comparison to the first game of the series and some annoyances persist, every other aspect has been updated. The combat feels fair and satisfying, the world is captivating, the bosses are epic and you will be getting a lot of bang for your buck.I still feel like Dark Souls 1 is a better game (with a terrible port), but I had more fun with this one, overall.An easy recommendation.Final score: 9 out of 10. If you enjoyed this review, please consider joining my group and following my curator page on Steam.Controversial opinion: My favorite boss of the base game is… Deacons of the Deep! Loved walking into a group of creepy looking religious figures and the music is great!."

Positive,"I originally played Dark Souls 3 for around 100 hours on the PS4. To get straight to the point, It was one of the best gaming experiences i've ever had!Having recently got a PC replaying the game has reminded me why.Its a hauntingly beautiful journey through a terrifying land. As the tag line states, you will die. Again and again. However the game encourages and rewards your resilience. If you embrace its harsh lessons, every death, every encounter becomes a learning experience. The next time you rise from the ashes you will be stronger, smarter. Braver!Its not difficult purely to frustrate the player or to be edgy. Its difficult to provide that sense of hard fought victory. A feeling i've rarely encountered in any other game series.Despite its harsh world there are genuine moments of beauty and wonder. A dark dungeon giving way to a breathtaking shimmering city-scape. Compelling but cryptic tales of friendship, loss and betrayal punctuate the otherwise stern and cold world.Combat seems simple at first but hides great depth, especially if you are interested in PVP. There is amazing weapon variety and many diverse and bad-ass looking armour sets to discover. Coop and invasions are great fun and still seem fairly active despite the games age. Who doesnt enjoy some jolly cooperation \O/. Some folks will be happy to help you out with that boss your stuck on. Others will try to murder you and take your tongue as a trophy.. but hey, thats humanity right?! Its.. dark soul. On the down side.. not a lot for me. Sometimes connection can be a problem. More so than on the PS4 it seems. I sometimes connect with laggy hosts. Sometimes there are hackers too. I would recommend backing up your save regularly if playing on PC and looking to play online.Hopefully some one found this helpful!Peace"

Positive,"If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pieDirections:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

Positive,"Dark Souls III is more than just a game. Its a test of your mental endurance, its a frustrating and enraging experience that will leave you feeling confused why the developers are trying to kill you around every corner and making the game feel insanely impossible. But as you continue to play you will learn the beauty of retrying. Never giving up and continuing to learn from your mistakes is the name of the game for every FromSoftware title. I've never had a rush of joy and personal satisfaction like this in any other video game to date, feeling that adrenaline pump as you narrowly dodge an enemies attack with little to no heath remaining and getting the final slash on them is unmatched. I cannot begin to describe the satisfaction you feel as you play this game, the weapons feel meaty and real, the enemies are more often than not better than the actually players that will invade your world. The character progression as you go through the different areas/levels feels organic.Exploring in this game is a fun and heart pumping adventure, never knowing where the next bonfire may be, carrying thousands of souls you've just spent 30 minutes farming and battling to obtain. Turning the corner to see the firecoiled sword sticking from a pile of ash is a sight for sore eyes every single time, relief washing over your entire body as a smile cracks on your face. You made it.When I beat the game I dropped my controller and the only reaction I could have possibly had was to applaud the developers for this epic adventure I'd just gone through. It was done... But I was craving more, the New Game feature isn't a new feature in gaming but it was essential for this game! I've started my second play through and good lord it's just as fun.The community in a game full of challenging fights and angry deaths is actually extremely friendly! I've had Dark Spirits invade my world and end up helping me defeat some of the mob NPC's just because I waved and did the Praise the Sun emote at the same time as him, the community is also full of players that will gladly be summoned to help you in boss fights because they remember how hard it was for them. The emote system brings a whole other level of non-verbal communication, most of the time before you initiate a PVP battle you'll get a low bow from your opponent to symbolize they're ready to fight, sometimes you'll even have players that are respectful enough to not gank you while being attacked by another person or NPC which is stunning to me considering how much easier of a fight it ends up being for them. I appreciate how friendly, charming, and welcoming this community is.PRO'S------------Above Average Game Length: 80 Hours To Finish-Friendly Community-Excellent DLC Content -Lots of Replayability-Runs Very Smoothly-Fast Load Times-Teaches Patients & Timing-Insane weapon and armor varietyCON'S------------Some areas feel a little buggy-PVP combat with a laggy person can be confusing, as hits from 20 seconds ago register late. This is extremely rare however, in my 85+ hours of play I've only seen it happen once.-Can cause yelling at your monitor :D-Flat out impossible to play without a controller10/10 game, I cannot recommend this game enough, if you have the patience to repeat battles and learn enemies move sets you'll have an amazing time. My one tip, Prepare To Die."

Positive,"The Devil May Cry 3 of Dark Souls games. My personal favorite of the trilogy and one of my favorite games of all time. While it fails to re-create the immersive exploration of the original Dark Souls it makes up for it with much more refined and fluid combat mechanics that pairs perfectly with an incredible roster of boss fights. The structure of the games overworld is a large departure from previous games. Instead of an open, explorable world where you were just dropped in had freedom of what order you wanted to approach things in DS3 is a linear series of somewhat open areas. There is still a sense of exploration, but it's given more in bite-sized chunks. Because of this the tension and immersion of the exploration from the original is completely gone, especially since you are now able to teleport to (the very abundant) bonfires in the game. Even with this being the case there is still some fun exploration in the game and a number of well-designed shortcuts you can find. It doesn't come anywhere close to the highs of DS1's overworld but it is still lightyears ahead of DS2's series of linear hallways filled with gank fights. In an inverse of the original Dark Souls, the cornerstone of this game is its combat encounters. The game is much faster paced than the previous two but not quite as fast as Bloodborne or more traditional action games. Mechanically it's still as simple and straightforward as the previous titles, revolving around 4 core options: light attack, heavy attack, block and an evasive roll. New to this equation is the introduction of weapon arts, essentially special moves with unique properties unique to each weapon in the game. While not earth shattering, it does add a bit of variety especially with specific weapons getting very over the top and unique special moves. My two favorite weapons in the whole series (Wolf Knight's Greatsword and Friede's Great Scythe) are great examples of this both having fun and unique weapon arts that serve different functions and are useful in different scenarios. Because of the fastened pace, parrying and staggering enemies is now much more important than previous entries. With this in mind the developers made parrying a much more consistent and satisfying mechanic to use and also rewarding staggers even more with a powerful riposte attack that used to be exclusive to parry's and backstabs.  With all of these changes, and because of how fluid and responsive the game feels and controls, the game is incredibly satisfying to play even if it is still mechanically on the simple side. After the disaster of DS2 I would be remiss to not compliment the incredibly refined hitboxes in this game. On more than one occasion I was really impressed by my character just barely jumping over an attack or how close a weapon model got to me without hitting. It's clear A LOT of work went into the hitboxes which is something people may not notice casually playing. The only major negative with the games combat I feel is worth mentioning is the heavy attacks. Heavy attacks feel a bit too underpowered compared to previous titles, even when fully charged. This sticks out especially with how much faster this game is making it harder to land them safely, limiting their overall usefulness to weapons with greatly extended range on their heavy attacks. How big this problem is varies by weapon and build but it feels like it affects every variant to some extent from the multiple builds/ weapons I used through my playthroughs. To further compliment this great combat system is a roster of the best boss fights in the series (or any game series for that matter). When taking into account the DLC there are 31 boss fights in the game, with only a single fight (Deacons of the Deep) being underwhelming. The other 30 range from good to some of the most satisfying fights I've ever played in an action game. Particular highlights are The Nameless King, The Abyss Watchers, Prince Lothric, Sister Friede and Darkeater Midir. I personally made it to NG+4 just to replay some of these fights again, them being that mechanically satisfying with some great spectacle and (normally) and incredible OST to match. On the topic of music, this is also probably the best soundtrack in the series, one I have listened fully through casually from start to finish as background music while working or relaxing. Almost every track stands out in its own way. Where DS1 had incredible music but not much of it and DS2 had a ton of music but only a single track was memorable, DS3 has many more and varied tracks on offer that reach and sometimes even surpass DS1's OST. Visually, the game is also great, very aesthetically pleasing with great art direction. Enemy designs are also unique and varied, not carrying over many designs from previous games giving the game its own unique visual appearance. What surprised me most replaying it now so long after it launched is how well the texture work holds up, especially compared to more recent releases. Story and lore wise DS3 is once again my favorite in the series. I love the concept of ash in Dark Souls and your character's goal and motivation as well as the state the world has been left in after thousands of years of sacrifice perpetuating an age that should have ended long ago. Where DS1 was the beginning of the end DS3 is the end of the end. The lore behind the Abyss Watchers and the Nameless King is some of the best in the series and just makes the world feel larger and adds context for the story of DS1. Even stuff falsely labeled as ""just fan-service"" like a small section of Anor Londo returning is a highlight. In DS1 we were introduced to the bastard crossbreed of man and dragon, who were banished out of shame to another plane of existence to keep up the appearance and purity of Anor Londo. Now one of these bastard crossbreeds, Yorshka,  is the only being left in Anor Londo that is remotely sane, human-esque as well as the only remaining living remnant of Gwyn 's legacy.  It's really great world building and shows how far that kingdom truly has fallen. The game is bursting with similar lore tidbits and implications that are really well considered and help expand the world established in DS1. The netcode, while far from perfect, feels at least more stable than the previous two games. This was the first game I didn't mind engaging with the PVP and even had some fun with it while I finished maxing out every covenant in the game. If you don't like PVP or invasions, it's once again opt-in like DS1 needing to be embered (equivalent to unhollowing in DS1) to be able to be invaded. Covenants are another system that also saw some improvement. While it's still vague what each does and offers without having to look it up online you can now join and be a member of all of them at the same time with no penalty so leveling them and gaining their rewards is far easier and less finicky. The defensive PVP covenants are also a really great addition and a lot of fun to engage with. Just like DS1 the DLC for this game is once again some of the best content in it. The Painted World, while a bit on the short side, has a lot of interesting lore and ends with one of the best boss fights in the series (Sister Friede). The Ringed City is incredible from start to finish and has TWO of the best fights in the entire series (Darkeater Midir and Slave Knight Gael). Unlike previous games in the series, however, there is no ""definitive edition"" that bundles all the DLC together with the main game on steam at a discounted price. Because of this you'll have to purchase them separately, and even now years later they are quite expensive. I would say wait until a Steam sale to get them or on console you can find ""Dark Souls 3: The Fire Fades"" edition for under $20 that bundles everything on the disc. An amazing title. While not as groundbreaking or well-rounded as the original, what this game does well, it does really, really well."
Positive,"Ok I think I have played this game enough to give it a proper review. ====TL:DR====Great game single player wise. Excellent boss fights and music. Fairly high replayability value. Tons of weapons, armor and spells for you to try out. A few glitches in PvE but nothing serious. Feels closer to Dark Souls 1 than 2.Co-op is fun as always. PvP has some issues so it's a hit or miss. There are some bugs in multiplayer caused by lag.As for DLCs, 1st DLC felt short. But it has a great boss fight. 2nd DLC is simply amazing. Well worth the money.I highly recommend this game. This has become one of my all-time favorite games.Lengthy but detailed review ahead.======The bad======Game has slight occasional glitches such as enemies glitching through terrain, enemy projectiles going through solid objects such as walls or even the floor. Keep in mind these are not frequent. Some people may experience micro stuttering issues even on capable hardware.Spell casting is more difficult in this game due to two reasons. You can't reliably cancel casting animations (except healing miracles). This makes using magic against fast bosses/enemies a nightmare. You don't have a fixed amount of spell uses like in previous games. You have a mana bar. (called FP in this game, I just call it mana) and you have to use Ashen Estus flasks to refill your mana bar. This is not a bad thing. The bad thing is you have to allocate some of your healing Estus flasks as Ashen Estus flasks (you can change the amount). A mage already invests a lot into stats and equipment (just like previous Souls games) but now mages must sacrifice some of their healing Estus flasks as well. I call bull on this one.Ability to dual wield pretty much any weapon combination and powerstancing is GONE. One of the best things Dark Souls 2 brought to the table, is just gone. There are some paired weapons in the game but they are few. You can still equip weapons in both hands but the ones in left hand cannot use their full moveset.New Game+ is not nearly as creative as in Dark Souls 2. There are more powerful versions of rings in NG+ and NG++ but that's it.The biggest issue in multiplayer IMO is the bugs that are mainly caused by latency issues. For co-op, it's possible for friendly phantoms to get stuck outside the boss fog gate (can't go in). This is because friendly phantoms are not yet properly synced with host's world. This will be obvious to you as the phantom since host player's animations will be static until you're properly synced. If it's a friend you can ask him to wait. But can't do that with random strangers. I never summon people because of this. However I place my summon sign all the time and it goes without issues most of the time. For PvP, it's possible that you can never hit the invader because he has no hitbox (invader is not really cheating here). Just like friendly phantoms have no hitbox when you try to attack them. But the invader can hit you just fine. This issue only seem to happen when you have friendly phantoms in your world, regardless whether they're NPC or actual people. It's as if the game mistakenly treat the invader as a friendly phantom on your end but on their end, it's normal.PvP was not enjoyable for me. Invasions prioritize hosts with friendly phantoms so if you invade, you'll be fighting multiple people at the same time. The game has much faster combat in PvE than previous Souls games so rolling cost very little stamina and healing with Estus is almost instant. These things make PvP a headache. In invasions everyone can heal, even friendly phantoms and invaders. This is very annoying when you're a lone host (like me) and invader runs behind enemies and use Estus.========The neutral========This game has no standard poise. Some weapon skills and spells grant you poise for a brief moment. You still have hyper-armor. This can be good as you won't run into havel monsters with straight swords. This is not good when a puny hollow with a tiny broken sword can stagger you when you're in full havel armor which literally made of heavy stones.Game is very linear compared to previous Souls games. Personally I don't mind this. But it can get repetitive when you're doing another playthrough.A lot of fan service of Dark Souls 1. I don't usually mind this but sometimes it felt a bit too much.=======The good=======Ok finally we get to the good stuff.Despite all the issues I mentioned, PvE gameplay is still really fun. Weapons have smooth transitions from one attack to the next. You can play smart using both melee and ranged weapons to make things easier. Combat is a lot faster and way more fluid than previous games. This makes some fights really intense. And as usual, the game is quite challenging (except in the beginning)Weapons have weapon skills that use your mana bar. These are special moves or sometimes buffs. Some of those moves are downright crazy, in a good way.Most boss fights are simply AMAZING. Has some of the best boss fights in the series and some of the most difficult. Bosses have good AI and most have a good amount of different attack patterns. And some bosses are quite fast. They'll definitely keep you on your toes. Boss fights also change usually midway into the fight.Most boss soundtracks are incredible. This one has the best music in all the Souls games IMO.Fairly high replayability value. (not as high as Dark Souls 2 though) I had a blast playing the game with different characters (some melee, some magic). Also did SL1 challenge run and a bow only challenge run. They were more fun than I'd anticipated.Co-op is still awesome. No more Soul Memory. You can set a password so only those with same password can connect to each other. This method override usual things that restrict connecting with people, things like being in same Soul Level range. This makes playing with friends easier than ever. Even a very high level character can join a low level character, but high level characters will be nerfed to match the host's level.Overall I highly recommend this game based on how awesome single player content is. Praise the Sun \[T]/"
Positive,"was the first Souls game I had ever played, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect. I expected a difficult journey (though I wouldnt know just how difficult), and gameplay similar to games like The Witcher, Skyrim, or Dragon Age. What I ended up getting was a game that made me feel like I was handed a sword and told to explore this insanely unforgiving, relentless, and utterly merciless game. Imagine if - with all your years of fantasy game experience - you were handed an actual sword and told you face this world. Do you think you would be good? No, we would all mostly get pounded left and right. This is what Dark Sousl 3 does to you. It's not your typical fantasy, where you feel like you know how to play and ""you got this"". Dark Souls 3 casts a feeling of helplessness and feelings of unfamiliarity into a seemingly familar journey.  but a dark, dark, unforgiving bully that will never spare you. This game will kick your legs in and then continue to kick you while you're down, and it couldn't be better. Not only are the graphics impeccable, the mood is enough to make you go wow. Not only that, but learning about the lore could be a game on its own, deeply sown within each item description, enemy, and place you visit, are inklings of game plot and lore. and will slaughter you and your dreams with brutality and the strength you wish you had. You will be crushed time and time again, but this game is like drugs, and you will continue to come back for more, whether it be for vegeance, pride, or anger. There are so many weapons to be found, views to be sought out, friends to be made, people to rescue, magic to learn, bosses to defeat, stories to be heard, secrets to be discovered, blood to be bled, and souls to be lost.Your armor will be your comfort, your weapons will be your arsenal, your spells will be your plan B. You will nervously dodge, fail to parry, attack too early, attack too late, miss attacks, run out of stamina, and desperately run,  this game is like bootcamp.I recommend Dark Souls 3 to anyone who is a fan of the Fantasy genre, likes a challenge, isn't afriad to back down, and has the vigor to push on. Praise the sun!"

Positive,"Calling Dark Souls “challenging” is like calling the sun “warm”Let me tell you about Dark Souls.Dark Souls is a game that will make you into a man. A scrawny fourteen-year-old, after two hours with this game, will be grooming his muttonchops and ready to ship off on the next boat to fight the Kaiser. If you are already a man, it will make you into some sort of bizarre double-man. What’s that you say? You’re a woman? You don’t want to be a man? Too bad. That’s the Dark Souls way.You’ve probably heard that Dark Souls is hard. Pshh. Lots of games are hard. Some are even harder than this one. The difficulty is not the point. What sets Dark Souls apart is the way that it doesn't just kill you, but also stomps on your genitals when you’re down. And it will make you realize that that’s what you needed all along.It’s a lot like life. Sometimes in life you win, and sometimes the giant armored skeleton stabs your face off because the flying mantis monster you didn’t even see shot you in the back with a spike at *just* the wrong time. And when that happens in life, do you respawn at the same spot and carry on like nothing happened? NO, asshole. You go back to the beginning of the level, leaving all your hard-earned souls out there on the pavement, and you fight your way back. And you learn a lesson from the whole thing, because you should have been wearing the correct ring, now shouldn’t you? That’s life.The trend in hard games these days is to unlock “Easy” mode for you once you’ve died enough times. Do you think Dark Souls does that? Do you think Dark Souls is so much as aware of the concept of “Easy” mode? NO IT IS NOT. If Dark Souls even knew we were talking about “Easy” mode, it would come over here and kick the shit out of all of us. And we would deserve  it.Dark Souls it’s like being married to a woman who is attractive and charming and funny and intelligent and you are soulmates and everything is perfect, right? She is the perfect woman. You could not ask for a more perfect woman in the world. You love her, and she loves you. Only, she has one flaw. Every 5 minutes, she punches you in the face…For no odd reason, she just punches you in the face every 5 minutes. Even at night, you wake up, she punches you in the face. You recover, get 3 minutes 38 seconds of sleep, then she punches you in the face again. And you love her for it. That is Dark Souls.Now, don’t let this dissuade you. Dark Souls is a pitiless master, but let it never be said that it is not fair. The game rewards handsomely those who stand up to it, and the greater the challenge, the greater the glory.What the hell are you waiting for?10/10"

Positive,"After a controversial second entry that had fans divided, the Souls series returns for its third and (at least for now) last outing, concluding the saga of the Flame. As you begin your quest as the Ashen One, you immediately feel the vast improvements over its predecessor. The game feels smooth, responsive, and beautifuly designed. But there are some more profound changes to the feel of the game. While DS1 (and to an extend DS2) had slower more methodical way of exploration, DS3 is faster, more aggresive, punishing the player for relying on his shield and tanking the enemy attacks too much. This is a fast and furious game of aggression and rolling evasions!It wouldn't be so fun if it weren't for the tight controls that feel better than ever, a far cry from the clunkiness of part 2.To compliment this change of pace, we have a bombastic soundtrack that brings a feeling of urgency as opposed to the soemtimes quieter more somber nature of the previous titles. There are certain points in the soundtrack that evoke some memorable moments from the previous games, a nod to the past legacies, however sometimes the nods, especially in environments or enemies might be detriment to the identity of a game, soemtimes feeling it relies too much in the past instead of daring to experiment too much and move forward. But that's not always bad, especially if your plan is to close a trilogy.Graphics are beautiful with some amazing environments, some of them dare I say are some of the most beatiful locations ever seen in Dark Souls and special mention has to be made for the   Dancer of the Boreal Valley  boss, which is perhaps the greatest most elegant looking enemy in DS and definitely among the best in videogames of recent memory! If there is one small gripe with the world design is that it never quite reaches the masterpiece that was the level design of DS1 with it complex interconnected paths (an almost metroidvania-like experience) or it's more interesting variety of locations and enemies. And while the progression is more linear, closer to DS2, it improves with the zones offered here being tremendously huge, offering lots of exploration and some intersting shorcuts to help out.As a personal humble opinion, this game also feels to be a bit easier than the other two entries and on the shorter side in terms of game length, though keep in mind that i didn't explore every optional nook and cranny and maybe having experienced two games already I was better prepared. For newcomers to the series, the beginning can be a bit too rough, especially the first boss, but things get straighten out soon after. UPDATE: I explored most the optional content. (it's good!) So is this the best game in the series? Hard to tell. It's actually an amazing game that I had a blast playing it, perhaps the most fun I had in a Souls game, with lots of quality of life improvements in its design and menu interface, with its fast, tough, challenging but fair gameplay but on the other hand it sometimes lacks the mystery and haunting exploration of its (slightly more cumbersome and rough original). I guess it all depends on what do you want from a game. After all, nobody can stop you from experiencing all the games in the series.Perhaps DS1 will forever remain the true classic due to better level design and world and more interesting lore, and this game lacks some of the feeling of loneliness and horror lurking at every step you take, but DS3 is a very strong contender for having the most fun slashing through hordes of abominations. All games have something great to offer so why stick to one when you can enjoy them all anyway?Concluding this review, the technical aspect of the game was perfectly fine, never encountred any major problem, besides some  framedrops (or miniscule freezing) that occured for seconds in some places before immediately resuming the game fine without any hitch. Steady 60fps and responsive, Dark Souls ports have come a long way since the problematic days of the DS1 original pc outing.If you are a fan of Dark Souls you don't really need me to tell you to get this game. If you like a challenging and intense dark fantasy epic then look no further, Dark Souls 3 is the most polished of the bunch and a great videogame overall. Join the covenant of GitGud and praise the Sun!"

Positive,It good game you can use big hammer or cool spell. 10/10
Positive,"What a game. Do your self a favor and play it. Its not going to be easy. Its a hell of a learning curve if your new to the series.You will die a lot. You will rage, a lot.Don't give up on it though, and eventual you will get it."
Positive,"When my life became boring and disappointing, and I felt anger in me but no where to release, that's the time I came to play this game. After killing a bunch of monsters and players, I begin to feel my energies restored and I could have my inner peace once more. This game is really helping in maintaining my mental health compared to the stressful real world. Sincerely love it!"
Positive,"After years of playing all kinds of video games this has to be the hardest game i have ever played. When you step into dark souls 3 prepare to die alot... this game will make you tilted on a new kind of level. but the feeling when you finally beat that boss or finally clear that area is insane. Thankyou for making dark souls 3 my favorite game ever. i would recommend this game to anyone i know, but i will always give out the warning that this game IS NOT CASUAL. Graphics are great, gameplay is amazing, pve is challenging, pvp is hardcore, the system of invasions is amazing and will make you shiver everytime  you see that message pop up.Overall 10/10 Best game i ever played."
Positive,"I don't usually write reviews because most people couldn't even bother to read them. Despite this, I would say that this is an amazing game that is surprisingly dead for how good it is!Dark Souls III was my introduction into the souls universe and it was truly an amazing experience.People always say Dark souls is difficult, Dark Souls is hard. But it really isn't. It's challenging. It requires your attention. Masterful architecture, stunning graphics, wonderful level design, full of shorcuts and the fights. The tactical side behind each fight leaves so spoiled that every other game fighting mechanic seems rather simplistic and boring in comparison.Bosses are fantastic for the most part. Every bosses were unique and well designed. TBH the bosses are so good that you feel honored to be killed by them. Each boss has a personality and backstory that makes fighting them either extremely exciting or super sad. One of the most beautiful things about Dark Souls III is the music. The music is simply stunning!10/10 for me"
Positive,"Best game I ever played my whole life. The entire experience of playing this game is outstanding. The graphics are just clean and incredible, the gameplay feels really fluid and fun, every enemy in the game is perfectly designed for the series. This game is going to impress you from begin to the end."

Positive,"Like putting your hand in a blender and watching yourself press the button.However, in all seriousness this is an amazing game. Fun, beautiful, interesting story, it has it all. Co-op is extremely amusing and all the bosses are fun to fight albeit sometimes a bit aggrivating as aren't prepared. I give the game a 9/10, that 1 is just for that one time I died from a cliff"
Positive,"OK , so I've just beat the Dragonslayer Armour and had left with 9 etsus flusks and 0 FP.I reach the next bonfire which is pretty close , I light the bonfire but I don't rest at it , because there is a summon sign.I summon this ""Myla the Thief"" which I though at first that it was an NPC  but a few seconds he/she jumps around near the elevator contramption which is near the bonfire and I realize that thief is spelt wrong and that he/she is a player.He/she collapse and then starts to go ahead in the Grand Archives we fight with the Crystal Sage and the other enemies which are new to me , even the hands on the bookshelfs were weird because I didn't use the Wax.While we fight and advance I start to notice that ""Myla""  was using only a small dagger and he/she was showing me to use the hidden ladders and levers , he/she even showed me the part where are the gargoyles outsides.We get outside of the library and he/she collapse , I though that it was because of the statue and that it was something about the story , a few seconds later I realize that we are attacked by 2 NPCs who look human , 1 second later I noticed the archer too . We win the fight against this trio and proceed further to the bridge with the stairs where I was close to die a few times , yet we reach the end of the stairs and there is a room with a fog wall.I saw a summon sign so I summoned it , it was ""Sirris of the Sunless Realms"" a true NPC .I go through the fog and soon they come too, we fight with this boss ""Lorian,Elder Prince"" where I was trying to learn his mechanics , finally we won .Or at least that's what I though , the ""we won"" wasn't actually a win because the boss wasn't dead , it was only the first phase of it .We looked doomed ,""Sirris"" was almost dead and I had only half of hp , 1 etsus flusk and  1 divine blessing. But we fight and fight , I get knocked a few times by the mechanics which I didn't knew. Yet ""Myla"" was fighting with his/her dagger a boss  whom he know that it was my first time. We tried to aggro the boss , one by one , he was hitting him a few times , getting his aggro and then I was doing the same trying to do my best.Even if it looked over I fought with only 20% hp while the boss had half on the second phase.In the end our struggles pay off.The boss is dead , we rejoice with our gestures and spamming the animation for the empty etsus flusks.While I light the bonfire I realize that I had 261320 souls and later I realize that I've just beat the last Lord of Cinder ""Lothric, Younger Prince"" whom he was in phase two of the boss.And this my friend is the story of my CO-OP journery in Dark Souls 3 with a ""Thief"" whom had only a dagger, a journey that I won't forget so soon.Edit:Fun fact :I had my Estus Flask at +0 ,because I didn't knew that you could make + (Later I've found out through some wiki)"

Positive,"ok so there's a player named ""You"" and I see messages on my screen that he's dying all the time. he must be a noob"
Positive,Insanely based and sigma
Positive,"1. Don't look up guides. ---- Lets be honest, the story is weird. Do I even understand what happened? Nope. Did i make my own incorrect conclusions about who my character was and why I see ghost characters? You better believe it. In addition to this, the different areas you explore are so unique that you'll never want to stop pushing forward. Don't bother to stop and read about them, just walk about and do your own business. You may need to backtrack to find an item but it is rewarding to see how far you've progressed from enemies you used to struggle on. **Side Note: Maybe look up the stat descriptions because that shit is confusing. 2. Embrace the constant sense of dread  ---- If you can afford it, always explore the world Embered. When you are Embered, you are more powerful but open the possibility to be invaded by other players. There is a match making system that only allows people around your soul level to invade so you have a clear shot to win. These fights are always unexpected and bring high intensity adrenaline randomly into your life. If you win, you will feel like the greatest badass in to ever walk the world of Lothric. This is seriously like the best part of the game. 3. Cry  ---- You will cry not because it is a challenging game, but because when you beat it you can't ever play it for the first time again. :'( If you do these 3 things the game will be a 10/10 for you."
Positive,My dad used to beat me so I'm used to it
Positive,"getting midir to 1 hp and then dying to it is truly an unforgettable experience, i recommend"
Positive,"The Dark Souls franchise has become a very dear one to me. The entire game is less of an RPG and more of an experience. When I started the games, I was but a wee lad wanting to try something new. My stepbrother had bought me Dark Souls and I began playing, and from there my concept of videogames changed forever.I was fully immersed in the ruined kingdom of Lordran, and its take on a declining empire is amazingly shown without any direct knowing of the lore. Another thing I greatly enjoyed was the combat. It was gritty, unforgiving, and most of all, fair. This formula carried onto the second game and, although the world wasnt as flourished as Lordran, it was nice to get into a new game and do the trial by fire that is a souls game.Now we get to the review of the game itself, and to say the least, it is truly what separates boys from men. The world of Lothric is like no other, and will stand the test of time as one of the most beautiful and fleshed out worlds ever. There is no part in this game that was created as an afterthought to the original intention and it all melds together into this lifelike realm, filled with both malicious entities that only wish to bring you pain, and NPCs that ease it with interesting dialogue. A big portion of this game, however, is the combat and its amazing depth. No enemy is ever going to be a pushover and will do everything in their power to stop you from completing you quest, but notice how I didnt say that the enemies were unfair. The bad reviews about this game would make you think so, but every enemy has a weakness and its your job to utilize them to the best of your ability. Your not without tools for this task however, as  every weapon can be used with great efficiency and precision, and can be upgraded to make you the most badass dude ever. Trust me, when you're farmer johnson slaying enemies with your fully leveled up pitchfork, you'll understand.For me though, the best part of this game, and of the entire series in general, is the experience. I play this game for the most part with friends, and it is truly a journey like no other when with the fellas. The stories you tell from this game are like no other and brought me and my comrades together as true friends. All in all. I would recommend to anyone brave enough to touch this game to get the whole series."
Positive,"DS3 is one of the few games I feel compelled to write an actual review for as it introduced me into what is now my favourite gaming genre (and series) of all timeI'll be brief because there are a trillion other reviews out there that will go into everything I've mentioned below but in orders of magnitude more detail-soundtrackThe music in this game would NOT feel out of place in a lost Beethoven or Mozart Discography -visualsThey still hold up, obviously not as impressive as Elden Ring but that's a given considering it's nearing 9 years old-storyThere is no 'good' ending which is a perfect way to close off the series. Fundamentally, the story is quite similar to DS1's story but has enough nuance to distinguish it and make it interesting in its own way-handlingDS3 is by far the best handling Souls game. Both the combat and movement feel so fluid and refined compared to the other two games-enemy designVery little complaints. The game is full of a huge variety of unique and interesting enemies. There are only a couple enemies in the entire game I would consider a determent to the experience - as in - the game would be better off without them. One example being the jailers in irithyll dungeon. They're only there to artificially extend your time in the dungeon and I think prove that sometimes Fromsoft gets 'straight up annoying' and 'challenging but fun' confused-boss designDS3 has by far the best bosses in the series, but I'm going to be a negative nancy again and only talk about the irritating onesALDRICHAnnoying projectile spammerCRYSTAL SAGEAnnoying projectile spammerTWIN PRINCES' SECOND PHASEAnnoying projectile spammerSOUL OF CINDER SOMETIMESAnnoying projectile spammerHave you figured out I'm bad at dodging yet?WOLNIREither the hardest or the easiest boss in the game depending on if he wants to breathe out his nasty fart gas and instakill you or not-armour and weaponsDS3 allows for a lot more build variety than the previous two titles. Every weapon in the game is viable for PVE if you have a build to support it. PVP is slightly different, you CAN get by without a meta build but if you're bad like me, you won't have a great time. I will say though, INT and FAITH both feel slightly redundant in this game. Not to an extent where they're not worth playing, but to an extent where you WILL think to yourself; ""huh.. my wizard guy felt a lot more powerful in the older games"". It may just be that the schools of magic were overpowered in the previous two games.DS3 also has the best fashion souls of the 3 games, with a lot of room for mix-matching armour sets to make the drippiest character possible. It's not on the same level as Elden Bling, but definitely the best we had until Elden Bling was a thing.-dlcsAshes of Ariandel is a good DLC for sure, but The Ringed City is definitely the better of the two. It honestly feels like a very early Elden Ring build. 2 of the 3 best bosses in the entire game come from The Ringed City, Gael and Midir. Father Ariandel and Sister Friede are definitely the best of AoA, and they are a close contender for the 3rd best boss fight in the entire game (I've given that spot to Nameless King)-conclusionEverything here is my own opinion obviously, but I think 99% of people out there (or 92% of people, according to the steam reviews) will agree that this is an awesome game. DS3 will always be a classic and one of my personal favourites.BUY IT!!! LONG MAY THE SUN SHINE!!! HAHAHAHAHAAaa"

Positive,"I picked this game up on sale and i went with the deluxe edition as i knew i could refund it under 2 hours if it wasn't my thing. A common misconception with Dark Souls is that the game is incredibly hard and you'll be smashing your keyboard through your monitor and bouncing off the walls in rage. I can confirm this is not true and actually once you spend a few hours getting to know the game and how to roll, you will die less often and when you do die, it will actually be quite funny. The game so far has kept me interested, there's loads to explore and it is a lovely scenery to take in. The game does not guide you in any direction however if you need help either ask a friend, look on the forums or watch some videos. Overall this game has surprised me a lot, for someone who rarely plays single player games as i don't often enjoy stories on my own, this game has come through very well. I haven't delved into the multiplayer pvp side just yet but i want to complete the game first. For a short reviewStory / Exploration - 9.0Graphics - (for 2016) - 7.5Weaponry - 9.0 Should you buy this game? - Yes!!"
Positive,"The darkest of souls. P.S. If you want to be a magic character instead of being a melee character then I can guarantee that by the time you finish the game you will have become a melee character. Not everything may begin with the blade, but everything ends with the blade, especially if you're British :D (help i have been stabbed 27 times and am currently bleeding out in an alley in south london, this is a cry for help)"
Positive,"I played this after Elden Ring, and going in I thought this game would be tiers below the masterpiece that Elden Ring is. Yet I was completely wrong, this game not only holds it ground but holds up very well almost a decade after release. Stunning visual locations, good enemy/boss variety and expansive combat. This game is incredible and I loved exploring each new area looking for the next boss to take down. Truly a must play in the souls series for anyone."
Positive,"Dark Souls III.....This series means a lot to me. I started playing Dark Souls during a really hard time in my life, it helped me forget about life for just a bit by consuming most of my time and making me furious. So of course I'm going to recommend this game.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 But, from a perspective of a new player, this is the dark souls game to start with. It's pretty easy to pick up and not too difficult and sometimes a breeze (once you get the hang of it). Now for returning players, the game ties up a few loose end side stories and lore e.g; Patches and the First Flame plus it adds some new gameplay features so it's not just a copy and paste of previous games.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So in conclusion I recommend this to anyone who's either heard of dark souls but hasn't ever played it, and to returning players. Please play this game it's still worth it's $60 price ($15 on sale right now)"
Positive,"Q: Give me a TL;DR version.A: Buy the game and git gud.Q: I heard the game is hard. Is it good for causal player?A: Yes.Q: Is it good for Skyrim player?A: Yes, but you'll need to learn new mechanics such as parrying and roll timing.Q: Is it a good game for family, friend etc?A: Yes. The game has a password feature to co-op with friend. I think the game is educational for children, as it teaches people to not give up and overcome hardship.Q: Is this game full of rainbow and candy?A: No, it's closer to a horror game, especially in some later areas. Even prettier areas are infested with monsters. The atmosphere of this game is very grim and grey-ish.Q: Tutorial?A: Check the signs in the first map. You can check the keyboard-controller maping in setting. The first map has mooks, a mini boss and a boss for you to play with. The tutorial boss, Gundyr, teaches you various evasion technique.Q: Is there a mini map?A: No. But since you might die a number of times you'll get familiar with the map. There are many shortcuts.Q: Is there an easy mode?A: It's called greatshield, you can get one in the second map but need some levelling up to use it. Starting as knight (default) also counts as an easy mode in early game.Q: I don't like invaders.A: Start the game in offline mode, you can change this in setting. You can still play with NPC phantoms but cannot co-op. If you are online, stay unembered prevent invasion but you cannot co-op. If you are invaded you can also run toward the boss fog gate. Edit: you can join Way of Blue in the second map, that will lower the chance of being invaded as well.Q: Mooks attack 100 times in a row.A: Try spacing.Q: Mooks gank me. Unfair!A: Try looking around, this game is known for enemy trolling you every corner. Lock on feature will spot enemy above.Q: Bosses are too fast.A: It's kind of counterintuitive, but you sometimes need to roll toward them. Check Youtube if you have trouble. Don't worry, dying to boss is a learning process.Q: What's the main strength of this game?A: Best video game soundtrack.Q: What's the weakness of this game?A: Too short compared to DS2, not enough armor/weapon/spells.Q: Should I buy DS1 and DS2 instead?A: DS1 is more noob friendly IMO, and a better defined story. DS2 has many different mechanics, better PvP but terrible PvE ganking. It's completely up to you.Q: Will I feel confused by the story when jumping directly into the third game?A: The story is always vague, so it doesn't matter. Check Youtube lore channels for better understanding.Q: I've heard that NPC questlines are hard to complete without guide.A: Just talk to people and do what they say, check the shrine to see if there are new dialogue. One thing you need to remember is that progressing in Rosaria's Finger (a guild, you cannot equip the guild item or offer the leveling item) will end another questline. Also the magic merchant will leave if you ignore your promise.Q: I'm a completionist. What if I miss some gear?A: You need to reach NG++ for 100% achievement, so feel free to look online for checklist in NG+."
Positive,"It's ""OK"" at best. I wouldn't put more than 5 hours in."
Positive,I played this after finishing Elden Ring and if you loved Elden Ring then it's very likely that you'll love Dark Souls 3 too. The cycle of death and perseverance makes the eventual successes you achieve all the more sweeter.
Positive,"If you liked dark souls 1 or 2 then just buy this game as it's basically the same formula with some tweaks.If you've never played a souls game then let me ask you these questions: Does the idea of facing a moderately tough (for a souls game) boss in the first 5 minutes, without any level ups or extra equipment, sound appealing to you?Do you like dark fantasy? (If you're a fan of berserk then this is definitely the game for you)Do you want a game challenging enough where even the most basic enemies can kill you very quickly if you mess up?If the answer yes then is this the game for you, if not then get gud or get out."
Positive,Fighting a boss in this game is like having vigorous angry sex for hours with somebody you absolutely hate that ends with the best climax ever﻿.
Positive,"I would never get tired of how superb awesome this game is, always having the nostalgia to play it one more time whenever it's mentioned, or heard a reference to it."
Positive,Bloodborne on pc when?
Positive,"Seriously, one of the best games i've ever played in my life.I've never been a fan of RPGs myself, always went for FPS games. But i got an interest for this game, for it was known for it's ""diffculty"" (more onto that later), the bosses, the sceneries, etc.I was gifted this game, and i have to say, it was one of the best gifts i've ever received.About the game itself, if you are scared to pick it up, don't. The game is not as hard as people make it out to be, it just leaves you to discover stuff for yourself, to learn the mechanics, playstyles, etc.This game is by far the best for beginners to the DARK SOULS franchise, for it has the most polished gameplay out of the three, with some more simpler mechanics...kinda of. Parries are definetely something that actually requires a bit of skill, and the same goes for backstabs, to a certain extent. You have to be more precise with stab than in previous games, but we're getting offtrack. The story is good, nothing really amazing, but the main focus of the story is good. The lore of the rest of the kingdom of Lothric (and the DLC worlds too) are what's interesting about DARK SOULS games. The lore of every boss, every area, every enemy, it's all really fascinating and well crafted, just like in other games, so it doesn't disappoint in that regard.Gameplay in itself i found pretty satisfying, but i do think the PVP part of the game could have some problems fixed (Hackers, Griefers, etc)Soundtrack in the game is also pretty awesome. There is something in particular about the Final Boss' theme that has made a lot of people really emotional (myself included). It's a really cool easter egg, but i won't spoil anything. This game's music is something you have to experience yourself to understand how awesome and well produced it is.The game in itself is beautiful. It has stunning graphics and is extremely well optimized (except for the beggining of the Ringed City DLC, all the ash may eat up your frames). All the effects, boss fights, sceneries and enemies have an immense amount of care put into them, to make them feel like they belong in this fantasy world, and to look the best they possibly can. In short, DARK SOULS 3 is an amazing game, not too far from a masterpiece in my opinion. Shame that it still has some things that should've been improved by this time, but whatever, the game is still playable. I highly recommend giving this game a try. Seriously, it's amazing."
Positive,"I've been playing this game for the last month, and I do not understand how I have not played it until now.I have to say that this is one of the best games I have played in my life and I do not regret even a moment.I managed to beat all the bosses in the game including all the optional bosses.Absolute Masterpiece."
Positive,"A Souls game always comes with a few new starting classes. Regardless of whether you are a hardened veteran or anxious newcomer, it’s worth knowing what exactly the differences are this time around.Dark Souls was a world where history had already happened over hundreds of years, and you as the Chosen Undead were learning about it by picking through the debris. In Dark Souls 3 this long-term wear and tear is applied to the Lordran we knew.+ Memorable and challenging boss battles+ Expert level design+ Beautiful setting with ample secrets+ Weapon Arts+ Deep combat system+ Surprisingly interesting lore+ Amazing soundtracks/atmosphere/cinematic intro"
Positive,"Yes, indeed. It is called Steam, where the transitory lands of AAA Titles and cheap Indiegames converge.In lagging through pvp, the players discovered the truth of the old words:""Git Gud!!11.""When the link of the servers is threatened, the trolls toll, unearthing the old Lords of Metagame from their parents basements...Parryking, Saint of the Caestus...Tryhards Unskilled Legion, the Patchnote Watchers...The reclusive lord of the Profaned Poise, Havel the Cosplayer...Only, in truth... the Lords will abandon their Controllers...And the Beginners will rise.Nameless, accursed players, unfit even to beat Gundyr. And so it is, that Noobs seeketh Skill."
Positive,"First of all, this is NOT a game. THIS IS ART!This game is probably top 5 my favorite game. I liked 1st and 2nd part, but compared to this one, they are not even close. Ignoring difficulty to actually complete the game, but options, locations, lore, bosses, combat animations, music, everything is just PERFECT. Cannot explain my emotions playing this game. I actually liked ending and I am 100% going to complete all achivments and endings, since this game has 3, and you cannot decide which one is better than the other. This game is MUST if you are a gamer, and this one is 10/10. Total recommendation and test your nerves, patience and, dare I say, skill :DGood luck playing it and finishing it. TOP GAME and cannot wait to play ELDEN RING!"
Positive,I keep screaming but God won't answer.
Positive,After all those hours spent in the game i can say...the first boss is finally dead.
Positive,try finger but hole
Positive,"And Moses said to Ramses:""Git Gud, you filthy casul""-Revelation 21:6"
Positive,"Hands down the most satisfying RPG I've played ever. Top tier sound track, top tier story, top tier gameplay, and top tier PvP. Do yourself a favor and get into it."
Positive,"This game was a blast from start to finish. I think Bloodborne is still my favorite souls game overall, at least of the ones I've played, but Dark Souls 3 seems to have more variety in how you can approach the game. I played most of the game with a one-handed weapon and a shield but I really want to jump back in and try it again with a magic build. It managed to hit the difficulty curve perfectly, hard enough to where I had to focus and pay attention, and definitely got frustrated, but where each time I felt like I was learning something new and getting better."
Positive,"5 hours in, I was like ""This is so unfair! Why isn't there an easy mode?"" and ""Ahh!! I hate multiplayer, why won't these evil spirits leave me alone!?"".50 hours in, now I'm deliberately under-leveling my character to make it more challenging.  And I'm doing all sorts of online activities like crazy. Dark Souls has the power to convert people, to make you love what you used to hate, and that's a very transformative experience. I'm glad I didn't give up on this game. I hope you don't either. It's going to be worth it."

Positive,"Before playing this I started with first Dark Souls (not on Steam though) and what can I say - I had to spend a few evenings just to complete the tutorial part of the game since I couldn't figure out how to put a shield in the hands of my character and use it to protect myself. Also had no idea there's autolock so you can probably understand by now that this made the game even harder for me than it was designed initially. I swear to god I would abandon this game if I was 11 or something, but being an adult makes you stubborn and gives you that special ""I need to finish this"" feeling about everything you start doing.I've spent around a year trying to beat the game and had most problems with Ornstein & Smough. Evening after evening I tried to make my character stronger to actually be able to survive this massacre. I played this for a few hours, got despaired and switched to other games. Sometimes I abandoned playing for weeks or even months. But eventually I was able to complete this and it felt like one of the biggest accomplishments in any video game I played so far. I've never had an experience like that before and I loved it.Dark Souls 3 appeared to be less challenging since I was able to call for help anytime I wanted and being lazy in nature I didn't hesitate to do this. It felt like cheating but it's really hard to torture yourself knowing that this can be done in a few minutes with the help of a few pro players. This way I could actually enjoy playing the game and it became more of a relaxing experience since I don't always want to be destroyed in moral way after having a hard day at work which happened a lot at that time. This was also the first time I used the multiplayer aspect of the game and it felt good but also punishing since my fighting tactics usually sucks comparing to what people usually do when they play this game.Overall I feel that DS3 is like DS1 on steroids, at he same time it was easier for me in many ways and I was able to complete it much faster than DS1, which isn't bad but at the same time the fact that I can get help almost any time stole part of the fun I had while playing DS1. The bottom line here is that one definitely should play this game if s/he liked DS1, but I suggest avoiding getting help from other players if you want to get similar experience."

Positive,"So, having played the other souls games to death, I decided I'd challenge myself and roll up a deprived build. Being the lazy asshole that I am, I decided that I wasn't going to get any new weapons or armor after I picked a set I liked. Now let me tell you guys.... I was wearing the rags from the uchigatana master, and the sages hat.... I was wielding the starting club, and grass crest shield.I played the game to the best of my ability, and I played the whole thing solo. I was having a ton of fun.The enemies were faster than all the other games, but I could demon souls roll now.... none of their attacks mattered so long as I ""Got gud"". And gud I was... for I had played the others. Now somewhere in my head I had this crazy idea that no one would think of normally in dks1. ""What if I go raw on my club for max physical without ever having to put a point in my str or dex?"".  I was thinking in my head, the scaling would be horrible, the damage wouldn't last, I would die before I killed anything.I went on to beat every boss with that shitty little raw club, without help from summons, NPC or otherwise. Since I had no need for my souls I dumped them all into health and stamina. My friends and I got the game at the same time, and I was the first to finish. Not only that, when they had complained about certain areas that were built to exploit the weakness of their builds, I had powered through them. When they had mentioned some annoying bosses, I had beat them on my first try.My faith in Miyazaki had carried me through. I learned that through my self imposed suffering that I had found the perfect PVE build. Everything else in the game was put in, with its promises of power if only I would stray from my path.... from my God Miyazaki's teachings. I denied them all and was rewarded.(PS the club is shit for pvp, don't even bother. I still pwnt people tho b/c they were scrubs.) Once I had completed this journey and basked in the immense euphoria of beating a souls game with a club basically naked. I had something in my inventory.... a certain greatsword from a certain prince with C, D, D, D scaling in the four main stats.I knew what I must do. I pumped every point henceforth into those four stats while still in rags and that overly gigantic hat. I went on to rip entire thirds and fourths off of boss healthbars in new game +.For everyone who gives a bad review because something that was once the right way has been changed, you must change. You must embrace Miyazaki and cast aside your worldly desires for defense, poise, damage, range. You must cast aside your shield, you must cast aside everything that you believe to be a reasonable choice against an army of monsters and use your faith in Miyazaki as a weapon. (And not a faith build, club > lightningbolts.)I have seen the light, and I have been rewarded. You can experience unbridled bliss and joy, by ascending to paradise. When I arrived, it all faded to black as that last ember slowly died. Through the deafening silence, only two words filled my mind. Two words described what had happened. Why I had succeeded and where others had failed. Two words that described my journey. Two words that embodied my faith in Miyazaki. Two words I had lived by since I first played, even kings field and evergrace! TWO WORDS RANG THROUGH MY MIND OVER AND OVER! I had broken down into tears because I had found the answer and stayed true over all these years...And I will tell you what they said to me...""Git gud."""
Positive,"This game will give you an immense amount of satisfaction along with deep suffering. Sadly, after playing any soulsborne game, all the bosses in other games tend to appear much lamer."

Positive,"Dark Souls III.So here we are, friends. At the end of an era. It has been a long and glorious journey together but as it always is, all good things must come to an end. I have been sitting on this review for a long time now because I definitely didn’t want to say goodbye to the series that has to date defined my adult gaming years, but with Elden Ring just around the corner and the hype beginning to rise from the overwhelming excitement, I thought this would be the perfect time to finally put this review to rest. So with no further delays, Dark Souls 3.Dark Souls 3, is a beautifully written tale that perfectly captures the essence of sorrow and urgency that you would expect in such dire circumstances. This couples nicely with the smaller individual stories you will explore along your journey with the finale bringing them all together for the emotional end of the series. The game takes place in the fictional Kingdom of Lothric. You are the Ashen One, a being that was without the strength to rekindle the flame, you fell to its power, you were buried in an unmarked grave, and forgotten. Until now.As you awaken once more from your promised rest, you are given one last task by the Fire keeper, as the First Flame begins to fade, to gather the existing Lords of Cinder who have abandoned their duties to the kingdom, and together decide the fate of Lothric, once and for all.+ Movement: As with any good adventure game, especially a souls-like which essentially forces you to always be one the move or die, movement smoothness is key. Thankfully Dark Souls 3 has taken everything it has learned from the previous games and implemented it all perfectly here. Movement is fluid and seamless and provides you an optimal experience as you traverse the world.+ Combat: Essentially the bread and butter of the this genre of games. Combat is fast and rewarding, while constantly teaching the player that mistakes can sneak up on you if you aren’t prepared. This is one of those scenarios where practice makes perfect, and with each playthrough of Dark Souls 3 you will become a far more proficient manifestation of destruction.+ Bosses: In a game that has you forcibly bring to heel great beings with lord souls infused into them, you can imagine that boss fights will play a major role in this game. Indeed they do, you will experience your first boss fights rather early on and the experience you gain from them will carry you to the next, and possibly to the end, as you learn all the intricacies of combat and behaviour along the way.+ Items: Dark Souls without a huge variety of equipment wouldn't be Dark Souls. Dark Souls 3 has elegantly pursued this mindset with its variety of weaponry and armour that simply put, has turned killing into an art form. From giant hammers, axes, swords, daggers and even magic for those inclined, Dark Souls 3 has something for everyone and will let you comfortably test them out as you progress.+ World Design: I’ve always been a great admirer of FromSoftware’s world and level design, in many ways perfectly capturing the essence of every moment. Dark Souls 3 has really excelled in delivering such an experience, with the help of better graphics and the knowledge derived from the previous instances. The world is masterfully developed to provide the perfect storybook experience coupled with the uncertainty that is always present in Souls games.+ Character Development: This is where the real niche of Dark Souls is born, to be entirely honest. The character development not only defines how difficult or easy the game is for you, but also gives you an enormous repertoire of paths to pursue as you find your own personal build that will carry you to victory. Not every build will work spectacularly for all scenarios however, so evolution and development are crucial to your success.+ Player vs Player: While I’m not a huge fan of the player vs player side of things, I have come to terms with their existence in these games. It works well with the game world and can easily be avoided if you aren’t interested in pursuing this game aspect. Killing bosses does “Ember you up” ,allowing invasions to occur, but the competition is often fair and well placed so it’s not an overwhelming disaster.- No Hand Holding: It has always been a downside for many gamers, that there really isn’t any tutorial or hand holding in these games, while I like that you have to discover everything on your own, it can be off-putting to many that you aren’t provided any basis to learn the game before the real challenges are set upon you.- Lack of Map: There really isn’t a map for you to pull out to navigate the world, This can be a real deterrent for many gamers as being lost is never a great feeling, especially in Dark Souls where almost every corner has an enemy hiding in its shadows, or a trap lying in wait.Nobody can deny that Dark Souls 3 looks beautiful, it has been lovingly created from the ground up, so that every single aspect of the world captivates you in some way, Whether that’s by bringing you further into the experience as a whole or by just stopping you in awe at the glorious scale of it all.Dark Souls 3 offers you a steady frame rate on mid-end hardware, capped at 60 FPS, Dark Souls 3 is still a console port however, and suffers from that with its limited scope of graphical choices. There was no visual distortion during my substantial playtime across both the console and PC versions.The world is vibrant and gorgeous in almost every facet of its design and that is clear from the moment you start playing, right until the moment you finish. I often wonder what makes a game's audio truly spectacular. I believe it's the essence of it that lingers with you, possibly forever. It has been a while since I played Dark Souls 3, yet if i close my eyes and remember the different fights, i can hear the cacophony of the orchestra, rising and falling with every slash of my sword, the bass as I roll in and out of danger. Coupled  perfectly with the clank of metal on metal, the jingle of armour as you traipse across the landscape and the overall atmosphere that you are in a world on the very verge of toppling to the ground at any second. Dark Souls as a whole has captivated me to my very core with its stunningly designed soundtrack and atmospheric audio. I had no concerns with the audio quality at all during my play time.Oh how badly I wanted to rate this as “Flawless” I unfortunately couldn’t, As perfect as the game world is for me, it fails to deliver that seamless experience for all gamers. It is a challenging game world, designed by passionate developers for their fans. This doesn’t really allow easy access to it for the broader audience. With this in mind though, the game world is masterfully designed and developed, the soundtrack captivates from the first moments you hear it and every single fight leading to the very last will feel as epic as the first. This is more than just a game it's an experience and a journey, of your character and for you coming to terms with the dismal decisions that will be laid before you. This is a must-play experience that cannot be simply spoken about because words really don't do it justice. It is best enjoyed in the heat of combat and for the countless hours you will spend exploring and daring its treacherous landscape."

Positive,Praise the Sun!
Positive,healthy people don't play pvp
Positive,Yo this game is literally dark souls
Positive,good game ahead
Positive,what you know about rolling down in the deep
Positive,"I like the variety of weapons and armour, and that the heavier weapons feel meaty when you swing them around. The combat (which is the real 'meat and potatoes' of the game) is great fun, challenging yes, but the game is designed in such a way that its almost always worth one more go.You try, you fail, you improve slighty, repeat 5 times, achieve success, dopamine is released, you realise its 2am, you feel shame."
Positive,"A lovely game only The Great Miyazaki could create. The aspects of Dark Souls, the series as a whole, are irrefutably unique and addictive. DS3 did a great job bringing back to the rolling i-frames of DS1 with much smoother game play, it felt completely natural. 9/10."
Positive,Beat the first boss on my first try and relatively quickly.Thought I was pretty good at this gameProceeded to get fucked a good 10-20 times by some naked samuraiCouldn't beat him in a 1v1 so I resorted to taking myself out and him with me by rolling off the edge10/10 would get anally raped by a katana wielding badass again
Positive,"By far the most fun I've had with a Souls game. While the world is a bit more linear than DS1 and DS2, it more than makes up for it with much more fluid gameplay. I've spent so much time playing it in different ways, including all ""normal"" builds, challenge runs like SL1, Skills only, no healing and magic only and with mods like Convergence. And even after over 700 hours, playing it is still enjoyable to me. Easily one of my favorite games and I can't recommend it enough."
Positive,"So why am I writing a review of Dark Souls III early in 2019 when it came out like three years ago? Because it’s a trash review, thats why.I was never really someone to push themselves in games. I rarely played anything that was popularly considered ‘hard’. Why was that? Well it was because I was a lazy person. I avoided challenge in the gaming media because then the games that were meant to relax me felt like work.I played games with strong emphasis on narrative like the Telltale franchises; or the games that made you feel powerful even when you did little more than mash one button to win, like the Dynasty Warriors games.One day I was spending some time with a few mates. One of the guys there — who to be honest I didn’t really know that well — turned to me and said, ‘I want to try playing Dark Souls with you.’ I didn’t really know why he said it. I still don’t. But he did.I was skeptical, but I also didn’t really have a good reason to say no to him so I reluctantly agreed. I had no idea what I was getting into.Dark Souls burned by in a flash. I died a lot — like sooooo much. If you could lose your life to it, it must have gotten me at least a dozen times. Dark Souls II was a riot of yelling and so much hate on that jerk Dark Lurker. But there being major boss battles that I couldn’t call in back-up to help me with meant that I had to face the traumatic task of learning how to actually play the game. When I eventually made it to Dark Souls III it was a bizarre experience since I had the feeling that I didn’t suck at everything. Dare I say I had even ‘gotten gud’ (no. But I had certainly improved!)The Dark Souls trilogy is easily one of the best times I’ve had with gaming. It was also the series that taught me the joy of challenge in games — even if I was a slow learner. I can easily recommend it to anyone who finds themselves even a little interested in the idea of a game that is going to push you.I don’t dislike my narrative games, and I still appreciate my button mashers, but games with genuine challenge have a special kind of richness to them that I’m glad I’ve learned to appreciate. So this is a review where I barely talked about that games mechanics, plot or characters. But as I said at the start, it’s a pretty trash review. In fact it’s arguably not even a review at all. I see it as more of a thank you letter to a friend who pushed me to step outside my comfort zone."
Positive,yeah this game? this game good. best game? probably... pretty good yeaaaaaah. get game. get claymore. get gud. fun game. get 100%. no more game? get sad. play game for 20th time? is very nice. Truly a Classic

Positive,"Dark Souls bosses are like dating beautiful girls. First they feel impossible but once you learn their patterns, weaknesses you can easily take their souls. Forge their soul into a weapon and face (date) harder (more beautiful) bosses (girls).10/10 best dating simulator."
Positive,how the fuck am i supposed to play anything else when this exists?
Positive,"My first souls game. I was one of those people who said the game wasn't for me. Now, after 34 hours full of rage and dying, I can say that it's one of the best game I've ever played. Praise the sun !"
Positive,DOES NOT OPEN FROM THIS SIDE
Positive,"Atmosphere is fantastic, the armour designs are kickass, the combat is faster and more refined than the previous games in my opinonvery fun, definitely recommend"
Positive,"I can't write anything about this game that hasn't already been written elsewhere, and better. But: It took me dozens of tries in the span of about 3 years before I could finally get into the Souls games, and now Dark Souls II and III are some of my favorites. If the games don't click for you at first: don't give up, skeleton!"
Positive,"I was going to do this review when I have all the achievements but I just found out that  this game doesn't have SteamCloud. I'm quite surprised that an excellent developer like FromSoftware doesn't realize something so important. I found out about this because I wanted to play the game on my laptop and my game doesn't exist.I want people to know because if you change your PC, format it or want to play it on another device, if you don't have any save files, you will lose everything.You can make a backup and that's it, problem solved, but there are people who don't know that and that's why I'm writing this review.Oh and the game is amazing, one of the best experiences I'm having.Edit: I got all the achievements, now this game is part of me."
Positive,"**RECOMMENDED AT ANY PRICE.****YOU WILL WANT TO HAVE A CONTROLLER.**one of the best, most compelling games i have ever played.ignore the hype, this game is not as difficult as you've heard, what it is is *extremely unforgiving* with almost no margin for error.it has a steep learning curve and treating this like a standard hackey slashey will get you killed very quickly, and those deaths may cause ragequits - but the game is never actually *unfair*.it is merely extremely unforgiving.you'll get better and as you get better, the game will get easier, because you've become so much better at it.and other games will feel lesser."
Positive,"I am a 55 year old biker and trucker father, and probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories.thank you dark souls."
Positive,"No clue on how to preface this, so I'll say it outright - what an extraordinary game. I've had plenty of grievances with it - and, looking back on it, I still do - but holistically, this is a game for the ages. It is so thematically dense, and the way FromSoft managed to marry that with the gameplay in one of the most non-intrusive ways deserves praise on its own. I got the Deluxe Edition for €12.50 from WinGameStore (shoutout to them & gg.deals for their incredible platforms) and it's been a blast. Below you'll find the (approximated) number of times it took me to defeat each boss.  Base game Iudex Gundyr: 1 Vordt of the Borreal Valley: 1Curse-rotted Greatwood: 3Crystal Sage: 1Abyss Watchers: 3Deacons of the Deep: 2High Lord Wolnir: 1Old Demon King: 8Pontiff Sulyvahn: 10Yhorm the Giant: 3Aldrich, Devourer of Gods: 13Dancer of the Boreal Valley: 16Dragonslayer Armour: 3Oceiros, the Consumed King: 5Champion Gundyr: 4Twin Princes: 18Ancient Wyvern: 3Nameless King: 5Soul of Cinder: 2Ashes of Ariandel Champion Gravetender: 3Sister Friede: 13 The Ringed City Demon Prince: 8Halflight, Spear of the Church: 4Slave Knight Gael: 12Darkeater Midir: 9 Comments on the bosses  I started hitting a wall right after Pontiff. A reason for that being Bloodborne, and the idea that I had to unlearn what I had apprehended from beating the prior bosses in that game. I started using shields more, and I was never good at managing stamina. This was until I realized that I had to pace my strikes & adopt the more conservative playstyle of waiting around for the boss to exhaust their abilities, then riposting myself.. And so on. And that's how I started mastering the unspeakable ability of timing the i-frames on the rolling mechanic and I felt like a stranger no more. Bloodborne, this is not - and though traces of that game are to be found here -, I found that I had to be more patient and clear-headed in this one. I adored the more methodical approach required for Dark Souls III and learning the mechanics of it all served me well. Anyhow, another wall I hit was while going against Aldritch. I had plenty of trouble with the RNG, plus I've honestly never been particularly ecstatic to fight caster bosses. To boot, this one also happened to be quite disorienting to fight against. Then came the Dancer of the Borreal Valley - fantastic boss. But this was a moment wherein I truly had to learn to master (or at least develop a semblance of mastery) rolling and timing and simply not letting greed take over. Too many times was I only one hit away from victory that I let go and had the Dancer kill me. It took me quite a bit, but I can't say I regret learning all of that. The toughest boss, however, wasn't Dancer. In my case, the Twin Princes were, by and large, the toughest enemy faced in Dark Souls III, the DLCs included. I had difficulties keeping up with Lorian's teleports, and then came the second phase, and the heals from his bastard brother, and the spells. Jesus Christ. Praise the mount, after all; for it was Lorian's alacrity to down me that was the most troubling. The degree to which the Twin Princes punish greed cannot be understated - you wait for an opening, get one or two hits in, and that's it. Patience is the name of the game in this fight. And I'd be lying to you if I said it didn't frustrate me - it did, but in the end, there was no bigger feeling of pride and accomplishment than upon seeing the  Lord of Cinder Fallen  text and the bonfire that came with it. My favourite bosses? Champion Gundyr was probably the most enjoyable fight. Look at the kick, look at the moves! Gundyr, WHAT WAS THAT!?! Fighting Sister Friede was quite a splendour, too. She's such a dumb dumb - she trips over furniture while she's invisible! I loved Gael. Midir was a clunky fight, but all the spectacle makes up for it. The Demon Prince fight was also a fantastic gank battle. Dancer & Twin Princes are also up there. Conversely, fighting Oceiros was a tad frustrating, if not also a reason for the thought that they'd added some scrapped Bloodborne bosses in here. Oceiros. is. a. Bloodborne. boss. Simple as. That is clearly not a fight designed for the pace of the combat in Dark Souls III. The Nameless King fight was also kind of annoying in the sense that I had trouble making him out in that arena. The camera was not designed for that fight - just as it wasn't for Midir. Soul of Cinder felt unusually easy for an end-all boss - I can see why people consider Gael to be the true end-game boss, a sentiment I concur with. To conclude, buy this game. It's got a charm few games can even come in spitting distance with. Now I mostly spend my time at the Ariandel Chapel bonfire, lending a hand for those in need with the Elfriede fight. If you ever need any help with the later bosses, I'll be happy to help!"
Positive,"The sequel to Dark Souls 1 that we deserved. I love the series - and so, let's get down to the things I dislike about the game. >>RANT BEGINS<<*Extremely linear in comparison to Dark Souls 1, and extremely short in comparison to Dark Souls 2*I was never a fan of sorcery, or how overpowered it seemed to be in the previous game. For some reason, though, sorcery seems to have been gimped considerably, way more than I'd like. Being an effective sorcerer now requires full commitment with very little in the way of build flexibility or room to explore. You'll still melt most everything in the game - but it will feel significantly less fun.*From seems to have delighted in nerfing Faith to oblivion for a long time now, and this game may just be the worst example yet. As of Patch 1.09, there are actually A COUPLE actual Faith weapons, and offensive miracles are MARGINALLY useful in certain controlled circumstances, now. Before recent patches, it was entirely useless.*Most weapons seem recycled from the previous two games, with not much in the way of new weapons. Though there are plenty of boss weapons, Dark Souls 3 seems to have largely ignored the Dark Souls 2 quality-of-life improvements that made boss weapons actually useful. As it stands, very few of them are even viable. The same can be said for most offensive spells, as well.*The Poise reworking means that heavy armor is now almost meaningless, save for large weapons' hyper-armor. Anything but the lightest of armors feels like a waste.*Although I am not fond of Dark Souls 2 in general, I have to admit that that game went to considerable lengths to make most weapon builds viable. Dark Souls 3 seems to have thrown all of that out of the window. Cookie-cutter builds are sadly all too common as a result, with not a lot of the flexibility, variability and surprise aspect that PvP (and even PvE) had in the second installment.*NPCs seem to have considerably less dialogue this time around.*Covenants are mostly broken and largely meaningless.>>RANT ENDS<<With all that said? Dark Souls 3 is a wonderful game, and feels like a true successor to the original Dark Souls, even if it doesn't quite manage to be as good as the first installment. The controls feel amazing, the enemy and boss design are as strong as ever - if not stronger - and the world and lore are worthy of the name. Weapon Arts add an interesting layer to combat, Focus Bars instead of Spell Casts (as it was in Demon's Souls) increase flexibility. The music -might- just be the best in the series (though that's obviously heavily subjective). NPCs have less dialogue overall, but almost every single one of them has a questline to pursue. In truth, these may not feel like groundbreaking changes from the first game, and really, they aren't. Yet, Dark Souls was never really about innovation for the sake of innovation, but solid design polished to a mirror sheen. And even though Dark Souls 3 has a few flecks of tarnish, it is a fitting and satisfying closing to this beloved, genre-spawning series, and even with it's flaws, it's better than most games out there."

Positive,"Welcome home, ashen one."
Positive,"""I help anytime""The plunging attack is the most powerful move with a usb steering wheel"
Positive,"Hmm .... Mmm ... oh yea!1. My noobism:I've heard about games from the ""souls"" series for many years. I've always had an approach to this series like a typical newbie. I never played, I always thought that this game is difficult.I do not have to say HOW I was VERY wrong and how much I have lost over the years.2. ReviewThis game is addictive and satisfying, only some souls-like and rogue-like games can match. However, the games from the Dark Souls series offer an unforgettable atmosphere, constant anxiety, but also fascination and fulfillment.The game offers a lot of combinations of builds thanks to a large number of armor sets, weapons, classes, spells, statistics, fighting styles, and special abilities.There is so much that I do not want to write about it anymore.Regarding the soundtrack, I have never heard the greatest music in the main menu and at some matches, maybe only the one from The Witcher 3 can match. Subtle, motivational, climatic, UNFORGETTABLE!The quality of non-player character voices is the highest class, I have not heard such a good voice act in a long time!Multiplayer is quite specific, can be liked or not. Calling other players to help at the same time exposing yourself to the invasion of hostile players is ... original.Unfortunately, if someone is accustomed to the classic co-op and passing the game with a friend, he may feel a little disappointed. Every time you die and use the checkpoint, you must repeat the monotonous procedure.There are so many secrets to discover, so many connections and dependencies that without a guide you can easily overlook something. Still, I recommend playing this game twice, once for the experience, the second time to test another build, discover the secrets, take part in even more demanding challenges.You can go through this game several times and still discover something and of course still feel satisfaction!Unforgettable defeats and victories, getting to know new opponents, learning new tactics, etc. Everything will stay in my memory for many years!Now I'm able to believe that Dark Souls games can change a human being to a certain extent.Praise The Sun!"
Positive,I would recommend it
Positive,"How to describe this game ? Simply! You kill some enemies, find some loot , you run around screaming because a big thing is chasing you and you die by rolling off a ledge by accident............Fun!"
Positive,"I highly recommend this game, but understand that it isn't for everyone. Once you pass the learning curve it becomes a very enjoyable experience because of the feeling you get from overcoming a challenge.Ignore all the stupid kids yelling ""git gud"" whenever you ask for help. While ""getting good"" is definitely the primary way to pass a hard area, the game is amazingly designed so that you can always overcome the challenge somehow; whether it's by grinding, trying something else, leveling up, or asking a white phantom (a friend) for help.Don't be scarred away by the difficultly, just rise to the challenge."
Positive,"ashen one, hearest my voice, still？"

Positive,this game is amazing and for only 12bucks on humble bundle get it now!!!
Positive,Didn't know depression and fun playing could be mixed that well.
Positive,"Never thought that I would play souls game. This was my 4th attempt playing this game I think. But finally I managed to beat it! Oh God it feels so good. I was so addicted to beating the bosses. I didn't care about deaths anymore, I just wanted to beat the game! What a great experience 10/10!"
Positive,"The Journey Concludes ...Straight after the second game , Dark Souls III is installed and quickly start making my way through the first area... Game feels much smoother, sounds much better and my god the visuals are breathtaking, i feel its like seeing for the first time, like now i am properly seeing and what i did before was just preparing myself for this visual masterpiece... Not long ahead Gundyr and the first Boss fight starts ... and it feels amazing , feels like home... The excitement for what is to come fills my heart and makes me eager to progress, impatient to see and experience as much as possible as soon as possible. Lothric Walls, Undead Settlement, Road of Sacrifices , my screenshot library filling faster that the enemies falling from my blade. Exploring every corner, reading every item description, enjoying the view, talking to every NPC , enjoying myself and savoring as much as possible because of the forthcoming unavoidable end of the franchise that limbs closer with every inch of progress i make... And then memories also start kicking in from every single familiar thing ... Solaire, Andre, Siegmeyer, Black Knights, Anor Londo, Silver Knights, Gwyndolin, Artorias, Sif, no chest ahead, Earthen Peak, Dragonslayer ... Memories bringing me back to the previous games, my struggles but also most importantly all their amazing moments too. I will miss these games, i will miss the excitement for the unknown adventures lying ahead... Keep progressing and i see slowly the game preparing me for its end, arcs finishing, plots wrapping up and not long before, i find myself at Archdragon Peak ringing an ominous bell... Cutscene and then one of the most epic, if not the most epic, intro of every Boss, Nameless King, the firstborn himself riding on a dragon... The fight might have been difficult , but i dont want to finish it, i can feel that the end is near... Doing my duty and overcoming him, predicting that the final boss is next, i decide i should start the DLCs ... Snowy struggles and constant test of my skills keeps reminding me that the game still has more to offer and some more left in it to challenge me with... Friede and her father's arc shows me the power love holds, no matter the circumstances... Midir reminds me of Kalameet and the git gud philosophy for one last time... Gael, now freed after our encounter, shows me what i have to do, bring a closure to the game and its story, finish what he started...And there i stand , in front of that breathtaking Dark Sign, with the experience of the whole franchise behind me, pushing me forward for one last time, against all those that came before me, against Gwyn and against my own past selves... The fight, as befitting to its importance amazing, the soundtrack behind it giving everything it got and making me understand how high the stakes are and ultimately prepare myself for my time without Dark Souls in it anymore... And then its just me and the Dark Sign, alone in a world of ash thinking back on everything i achieved, wanting to forget everything so i can relieve them and above all feeling proud... what some might find it silly, me finding it a life lesson... When i started the trilogy i was in need of some strength and courage irl... and i feel that these games helped me towards that , so not only i thank them for their gameplay and plot, but for also the lessons that they reminded me, courage - persistance - patience and so many more... I cant recommend this trilogy as much as it deserves and still cant thank myself enough i chose to experience this journey...Thank you to FromSoftware, to Mr Miyazaki, to Bandai Namco and all the people that helped alongside this journey, the comments, the messages - even the bloodstains... I really hope Bloodborne and Demon Souls come to PC one day, if they do i will be there ... Solaire , i finally found my sun ... Dont give up skeletons, dont dare go hollow, but keep pushing forward, one more area, one more opponent, one more bonfire ... Because such is our fate ...Praised be the Sun"
Positive,"This game saved my life.I am 50.My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.Thank you"

Positive,"Yes, there's fan service, I could have used a lot less.Yes, there's no actual innovation to be found here.Yes, the graphics are not technically top notch.Yes, the sound and effects could use some polish and can be laid on a wider spectrum.But there's something about how Dark souls does ""End of the world"" like no other game can.There's something about the broken places, obsolete faces, rusted armor, tired gait, collapsed ruins.And it takes you through a different experience, where there is huge potential for you to fill up the blanks and make your own interpretation of the world.It is the journey that matters here, not the destination.Hidetaka Miyazaki, take a bow."
Positive,it's a nice and relaxing game filled with joy and happiness that will make you come back for more!
Positive,Dont give up skeleton 3
Positive,"the dancer hurts my little, tennis ball-sized brain but other than that this is a very good game, a must play even, if you find existence too good"
Positive,"-The gameplay is amazingly fluid and precise.-There is verry little input lag, even if you play with mouse and keyboard.-You are able to roll diagonally towards or away from your enemies when the camera is locked onto them, instead of only letting you roll straight towards or away from them.-As to be expected by a Souls game, you have to keep an eye on your stamina bar. You cannot just reclessly keep hitting or rolling, forcing you to think wether or not you play more risky or rather safe.-Items have not only resistance/attack atributes, but also weight, so, like in other Souls games, having heavier armor may reduce the damage you take by enemy hits, but also slows your moving speed and your rolls down. The player must choose carefully what armor/weapons/rings they wear.-The soundtrack is atmospheric and the sound design in general is pleasing.-Although some soundtracks are less powerfull, they still all fit the setting and are verry high quality music with many nunances and details.-Like the other two Dark Souls games the music isnt present everywhere, giving you silence to hear the quiete background sounds of the levels and to think about where you are on your journey and what is happening. Simultaniously, because the music isnt there for the most time of playing, it makes the music all the more powerfull and impressing when it does kick in, while entering a place of great signinficance or a boss arena.-It is capped at 60 fps, but it should run on most pcs always at that framerate and it is good enough for a 3rd person role play game, wich doesnt have fast camera movements for the most part.-I havent encountered many bugs. Rarelly the game crashes, maybe a couple times a year. There are some glitches here and there, but i havent seen gamebreaking bugs so far.-The graphics might not be the best looking out there, but they are cohesive and form a nice looking world.-Shadows and lighting effects look nice and most surfaces and especially character models have sharp and detailed textures.-There are quite many settings to adjust, but antialising doesnt have high settings, so there is always some amount of jagged edges if you pay close attention.-The level design is verry well made. Many people dislike it because not all levels are completelly interconnected in a tight area like they are in Dark Souls, but it offers a wide variety of locations, in a continous world with next to none loading screens. Also you can see many parts of the world in the distance, meaning you can walk through an entire area, look back and see the places you have been, or you can look forwards beyond the edges of your current area and see parts of the places where you will later go. You may not have the same freedom as you do have in Dark Souls to go in one of many different directions from the beginning, but you still can choose to some degree in wich order to play through the areas and you can even choose to go early in late game areas... if you are a masochist or a professional speed runner, much like in Dark Souls.-Each location offers not only different types of enemies, but also different types of environmental hazards and its own setting with its own kind of beauty.-There is a plethora of different items to discover. Sure there are some items that are ""useless"" and many items you wont need for your playstyle, but there is freedom of leveling up your character and choosing the equipment that best suits your own way of playing the game. Generally speaking there is some usage for almost all of the items in the game.-Each fight is challenging and requires the player to think and make propper use of their weapons and equipment.-Combat is methodical. Every type of enemy has their own moveset and the player must understand each type of enemy and adapt their playstyle to them or use the right weapons and armor.-Running in a fight head first and attacking without thinking may have you soon surrounded by enemies and result in a fast death.-Bossfights. What would a Souls/Borne/Sekiro game be without bossfights?! The bosses here are, as expected, quite hard when you face them the first time. Some may be easy in general, but every single boss is unique, with his own skillset, moveset, strengths and weaknesses. No matter what path you choose for your character and how you play the game, there are challenges for every player type. Fights you find to be easy may be torment for others and fights wich other palyers find easy you may struggle to get through.-There is no ""perfect build"" or ""easy mode"". You must understand what you are doing wrong and correct it, or maybe even change your gear if you find your weapon, for example, being too slow or too weak for a boss you are struggling with.-The player decides on their own how they build their character. You are free to choose when you level up and how you spend your level points in the different stats of your character.-When you die you loose your ember status. To restore it (wich increases your max health by 30% and enables the ability to summon other players to your world and also to be invaded by other players, if you play online) you have to either beat the next boss or consume an ember.-Also when you die, like in the other Dark Souls games, you drop your souls and it gives you one chance to go back to the spot where you died and retrieve your souls (the currency you receive from defeated enemies, wich you can spend to level up, buy items or upgrade your weapons). If you die again before you retrieve your dropped souls you loose them.-Stroger enemies give more souls, so while you progress thorugh the game you have a higher income so to speak but also each level up increases the cost of the next level up a little bit. Also you can find souls as items and you can sell the items you find for souls.-Dispite what the internet wants you to believe, Dark Souls 3, like all Souls/Borne/Sekiro games, isnt that hard. The difference compared to other games is simply that you dont get everything shoved in your face. You have to learn through failure. The game demands from you to overcome your enemies and ""git gud"". It will never just hand a victory over to you, but the more you will enjoy every single victory, as you actually achieved it either through skill and timing or through clever use of your equipment and patience.-Dark Souls 3 has plenty of help built into it, but you decide wether or not you open the help menu and read what the stats of your character and equipment do, you decide if you stop and read the developer messages or not, you decide if you open the item descriptions and read what each item does.-The hard thing here is to learn from your mistakes, to bring the willpower to endure failure and grow to be able to succeed. You have to turn on your brain and understand the strengths and weaknesses both of your enemies and your self.Overall Dark Souls 3 delivers a verry enjoyable experience.It offers a decent challenge for new and experienced players alike, while never being really unfair.The world is immersive, the lore goes as deep as Souls lore goes and the presentation is impressive.Gameplay is verry good and the atmosphere is amazing.If you are up for a new challenge or if you are already familiar with Dark Souls and seek more of that experience i can highly recommend this game to you.On the other hand if you are verry impatient and dont like to invest time into completing a game then this is clearly not the right game for you."

Positive,"DS3 is a playground for a very special breed of people. It’s freaking brutal sometimes, but it gives you a few chill areas you can walk kinda casually through and take in the nice gothic and archaic scenerie.Anyone considering buying it these days knows about the infamous difficulty of FromSoft games and the Dark Souls series, so I’m not going to get into that. I’ll just add that it’s the FromSoft game with the most replay value for me personally.And... I love Siegward of Catarina. I just want to cuddle up with him, get cozy. You know, share a bowl of Estus Soup together... just being happy for a little while... before reality hits you again, ruthlessly."
Positive,"Going into Dark Souls 3 I was honestly a little worried because this was my first Soulsborne Game.The first time I attempted to start playing the game I failed miserably at the Tutorial Boss, I was just not used to the mechanics. After finally getting through after a time longer than I want to admit I started to really enjoy the game.By no means did I understand the leveling system, which weapons or armor to use or why I would use magic. Mostly I still don't understand these things.Now I am roughly thirty hours into my playthrough and close to beating the game for the first time and I had an incredible time so far. Not only is the game incredibly rewarding when you finally beat a boss you've been struggling with for a while but also for going out of your way and exploring the vast world and its secrets.Certainly there have been numerous occasions where I got tilted and mad for not being able to get through a specific section but thanks to how well polished the game is I had to confess time and time again that it was only my fault when I got stuck. It never felt like any fight or region was unfair or unbeatable in any way. And even if I got stuck for longer there was always the option to go back to a previous region and explore further there.I am already a couple hours into the game but still feel like I haven't seen much of it. To me it feels like there still much more to explore and learn. Currently I am sitting at a point where I think I didn't even touch on the countless ways you can choose to play this game with different leveling, weapons and playstyles.I will absolutely be playing this game more and again in the future and also want to look into the DLC. I can not stretch enough how fun the game is to me and how good it feels to play something that is just so much different from everything else out there.Dark Souls 3 is an honest recommendation for anyone looking for a challenge or simply wanting to play a different kind of game."

Really love this game. So for those on the fence about buying this game 8 years after release I say go for it cuz I got this game in like march of 2024."
Positive,"I cannot say much of anything which has not already been said about this game. But who can stop the provocated hands of a writer? I can add scarcely anything but praise which already exists in excess for this game. But, as a newcomer to the series, this review, then, by default is primarily, though not exclusively for newcomers such as myself.Everything about this game, from the gameplay, the graphics, the vague PvP, to the yet vaguer story/ lore is something intense, something which stands apart from the vast array of titles which are paraded onto the digital and retail marketplaces. And although everything about this game is intense, nothing seems forced.. The voice acting done is insanely good, I mean, there are splendid baritones of the men and also the soft lullaby voices of the women.It is simply a treat to walk through the world of Lothric, 'a land of monstrosities', which is a world fallen into ruin. Not just the visuals but also the music is simply amazing, just perfectly fitted for each moment, there exists a piece of music for this game.Dark Souls III does everything well, including its silence, we...are silent, we speak nothing, we have no voice and it would be a joke to call ourselves the protagonist, we are just an undead on a forsaken quest for which we won't be thanked or remembered. It brings out the stark and lovely misery, in many ways, it is much like real life struggle of real life heroes. Some of the stories, nay, most of the lore of the bosses and NPC's are deeply moving, and there exist a plethora of videos on YouTube if you want to delve deeper into their sorrow and mull and wallow in sadness. The choice of weapons, armour is also something worth mentioning. You can even don the armour of the bosses you defeat which also plays a part in the greater irony of the world. And yet more tragic, in some sense is the soul transposition concept with which we can make weapons out of the souls of the bosses we fell.But the defining characteristic, the thing for which even casual gamers such as myself reach back time and again into the game, is the GAMEPLAY, which is absolutely brilliant. It cannot be compared to anything, things are, indeed compared to the SOULS gameplay. The combat, the management and investment of stats (RPG perspective), the quests you take, the friends you make, the routines you break...Each button press, each light attack, each special move, each dodge, each and every movement and action that you make the character do is important, it is more than a pattern, it is not merely repetition, it is getting skilled, gaining confidence and familiarity and then going in and getting through which fills you with fulfilment and contentment.Even the abstract lore and story is presented in such a poetic and beautiful way that one cannot help but probe further into it, through the sources which the game itself provides, stringing together clues, piecing together fragments of scraps from descriptions and dialogues. But the curiosity which is invoked by the subtlest of hints is something which made me, at least become a fan of lore videos which plentifully plague YouTube.The essence and SOUL of Dark Souls III lies in the way it retains its uniqueness despite everything being compared to it."

Positive,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

Positive,"dark souls 3 is a video game developed by FromSoftware and published by Atlus for the PlayStation 3. It is the third game in the ""Dark Souls"" series and the first developed for the PlayStation 3. The game was released in March 2012 in Japan, April 15, 2012 in North America and Europe, and April 19, 2012 in Australia. The game, while not the first to be available in Europe and North America, was the first entry in the ""Dark Souls"" series to make that leap. The game takes place in ""the Great Continent"", as previously"
Positive,"Dark Souls III is everything you wanted from the first Dark Souls, and leaves out what made you dislike Dark Souls II. While I will continue playing this game even after completing it; I wanted to give you guys a proper review.Environment is breath taking, and puts the earlier Dark Souls games to shame in comparison.Far more interesting enemies than humans in armor, including bosses.Nostalgia is strong with this game, and you'll love every reference thrown your way.AI improved dramatically, so enemies are going to give you a challenge.Weapon variety is great, which also applies to armor.Armor cannot be upgraded, so wear whatever you want. Fashion souls is back!If you love exploring, this game will consume you. Easy to get lost in.So many shortcuts, secrets, illusionary walls, you'll always stumble on something new.Co-op is easy to access, and hardly any problems with the server.Character creation offers a ton of options for making your character stand out.Each weapon has a special ability, making each one unique on it's own.NPCs are really developed, and don't stay in one spot. They're also very likable too.Quests are back, so you can go back to certain areas and activate new events.If you like horror films, this game has some nightmare fuel for yah.Can now get your flask out during a fight without searching through slots (hold down on down depad).Replayability is a solid option for sure. You'll most likely have multiple playthroughs.Enemies don't despawn, so you can grind to your heart's content.Your covenant changes the kind of invader you are (sunlight makes you a golden red phantom).Soul Memory is gone, so get as many souls as you want for upgrades / items.Four endings to earn, each offering a strong impact to the story.Heavily influenced by Bloodborne's mechanics, so most enemies are fast & furious.Enemies don't really have a stamina limit, so they can spam their combos for awhile.Lack of spells, hexes, miracles, and pyromancies. They're all cool, but not many to be found.PvP is sluggish, inferior to Dark Soul 2's PvP which was fun and balanced.Certain enemies can't be beaten unless you have certain items or do certain tasks.Game can feel short if you don't take the time to explore any optional areas.Until you reach more than half way into the game, weapons are hard to upgrade.Too many ambushes, which leaves you less surprised when it happens again.Most enemies have higher poise than you, so you're going to be dodging / blocking more often.Game is more demanding with graphics than Dark Souls 2, so you might need to turn certain options on low.Certain areas make the FPS drop, or lag so be ready for that.Tends to crash now and again, depending on what you're doing.Covenants are weak, and not satisfying to rank up in.Invasions / invading isn't fun because again PvP is sluggish, wonky and poorly done.NPCs can die easily from anything, so an enemy can kill them during mid conversation.Ember is hard to find, but luckily helping hosts gives you one per successful mission.NPC enemies / invaders deal more damage, have more HP & poise than you. Unfair.Can lose the chance on getting items / armor if particular quests failed.Greatswords and weapons alike are either weak or OP, there is no middle ground.Game rewards you for being aggressive & spamming over thinking carefully like previous games.Luck is useless due to the fact you can grind enemies without them despawning.Is Dark Souls III worth getting? YES. It's an excellent game and despite there's a lot of issues I have here and there with it, they did an excellent job making this game spectacular. NPCs are engaging & very interesting, bosses along with nearly every enemy possess unique designs, almost all the weapons are handy in doing something useful, co-op is very enjoyable to be a part of, scenery & the setting is absolutely beautiful (even in the areas meant to look ugly are appealing to the eye), and each build is going to be fun to experiment with. Granted, it's a shame that the game wants you to play it like you're in Bloodborne instead and most of the enemies are way to hostile & fast for their own good, but otherwise this game is a solid 8.5 out of 10 for me. Worth full price, plus we haven't even gotten the DLC yet! Hope you guys were able to get most out of my review, and please feel free to ask me any questions about the game!"
Positive,"Gives you depression and deep thoughts about humanity, but yet, one of best soundtracks you will ever hear, in games or movies, and great story.. Sad there won't be more of Dark Souls.. 10/10 game <3"

Positive,"Wow just realised that after devoting 400+ hours and 100% completion of this title i haven't recommended it. Obviously i recommend this, its hard but not unfair the lore is extremely deep but takes a lot of investigation via item descriptions and environmental ques. but every item, every placed creature, or background furniture. Is placed with purpose to provide the story and build the tragic world you are experiencing."

Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is the final Soulslike game I played, having played before every other one made by FromSoftware. Visiting the same old places from Dark Souls 1, and meeting the same characters or their descendants, seeing those signs and landmarks was so special to me.I love games where there's continuity, and coming to DS3 as the final game in FS's Soulslikes catalog, and seeing familiar faces and places was the icing on the cake to me, it made the whole journey so exceptional and so real.Every time I entered a new area, to me that was my favorite area, and no bonfire was lit without a memory, or a nod back to the past and to DS1 being felt, seen, heard, or invoked in my head. This alone made the game incredibly special. How it tries to tie everything together and put an end to it all. Albeit what is an end really is up for debate, if there's such a thing whatsoever.The amount of weapons, spells, shields, and armor sets is staggering. They went all in, no matter what kind of stick you like to wield, it's here. Some of the most memorable boss fights are here, seeing good old, and grey, Anor Londo again was worth the world to me. The Firelink Shrine being displayed on my screen sent a shiver down my spine. All of Gwen and Gwynevere's statues, Onion bro, Andre, and Havel.I think whatever can be said about the gameplay or the game itself has been said before throughout the years so I would like to talk about something that was never said before, about how this game made me feel.Pathos, what the Greeks used to describe as emotions. Something that already resides in us (Dark Souls 1 (and 2) and their events) and was invoked at every turn, the linking of the fire, our duty, our sense of purpose which we remember and hold ever so close to our hearts so we don't go hollow, the state of the world, and its inhabitants, and the eternal unanswerable question, why are we here? The whole thing went before my eyes, and I find it hard to talk about now, there's just so much, I feel so much yet I can't pour it into words and I think that is exactly why I love those games so deeply. It's that elusive invisible thing that you feel as you concur the game, as you bear the duty, O branded one, of linking the fire and renewing the world for again that is your duty. And perhaps, that's simply why you are here.To me, it wasn't about gaining power, ascending, or traveling through the cosmos, all of those are themes we have seen before in their games, to me it was about doing what I was meant to do, for this fight is a fight for the flame, for my fellow kin and one where I wasn't about to squander.Prithee, Hollow, is this not what we were rallied for and to the Asylum up north sent to achieve?Prithee, Hollow, is this not why we jumped into the raging sea in Things Betwixt?And, Prithee again, Hollow, is this not why we wake up and head to our home, the Firelink Shrine, where it all first began just to end again?From a Nameless, accursed Undead, unfit even to be cinders... to a true Lord, fit to link the Fire.This is what it is about to me. It does not matter where we came from, or what we are, what matters is what we do with the little knowledge we have, in the face of the dying, crumbling, and lonely reality we are in.Similarly, IMO, it is as is our journey in real life, we know not where we came from if we had existed before, nor do we know where we are headed exactly after, if to any place. But in my opinion, what matters is the journey and, ironically, as you build your character in Dark Souls in the game, you are meant to build your human self character in real life. One and the same, and all driven by one's choices, in a world where we presumably had no choice about anything whatsoever.Our weaknesses and hollowness could never stop us from rising again and marching on towards achieving our duty, zealous as ever and brave as ever.Once a choosing undead, is now a Lord of Cinder."

Positive,"90+ hours on record, got all achievements, new game +4 on main characters and 3 different characters ready to go into NG+ played through. Love the game really I do, but what I do NOT love getting banned for no reason and then not getting an answer beyond [Caution] invalid data detected.Things I did when I got the [Caution] invalid data detected message. (Did not work duh) Deleted my main save that had 4 characters one of which on new game +4 and started a new one.Deleted everything to do with the game off my PC, then reinstalled it all.Changed OS and wiped the whole PC (Nothing to do with DS3 just wanted a fresh start) so literally only thing on my PC that I've installed at the time of writing this, Steam, Google chrome and Dark Souls 3.Also submitted a lot of support tickets, even went to so far as to email a copy of my savefile to FromSoftware.Got no response and now I get on today to find I have been penalized.GG no RE.EDIT: 30/07/2020.

Positive,"When I first saw Dark Souls 3, i was intrigued by the art style and game-play but always maintained that I was never going to play it because it was too hard and I would never be able to finish it.Then one day, I thought 'why not give it a try?' and test myself. I then realised that the game is only as hard as you make it and you have to completely change the way you play as you will be punished for being greedy when fighting anything. Take your time, be patient and you will defeat them. If you die, pick yourself up and try again.Now, after completing them game, I would recommend it to anyone that has thought about trying a souls game but shied away from them as being too hard as you might surprise yourself."

Positive,"“Yes, indeed. It is called Lothric, where the transitory lands of the Lords of Cinder converge. In venturing north, the pilgrims discover the truth of the old words: ""The fire fades and the lords go without thrones."" When the link of fire is threatened, the bell tolls, unearthing the old Lords of Cinder from their graves...Aldrich, Saint of the Deep... Farron's Undead Legion, the Abyss Watchers... And the reclusive lord of the Profaned Capital, Yhorm the Giant... Only, in truth... the Lords will abandon their thrones... And the Unkindled will rise. Nameless, accursed Undead, unfit even to be cinder. And so it is, that ash seeketh embers.” I am a big Souls-Like fan thanks to Dark Souls III, the first game of the genre, and the series, that I have played. I have been planning on writing a review about this game for a long time now, but never found the perfect timing to do so. Now, that the game is having a discount, and probably there will be plenty of people coming to give it a look, I decided to write this review. Like I did with my Dark Souls: Remastered review on Steam, I will separate this review into 2 main parts: the Technical Aspect and the Story/Plot/Lore of the game.  Firstly, I would like to say that this game has not the same mechanics as Dark Souls I and Dark Souls II, they end up being faster-paced, and also a lot of hitboxes issues have been improved. With that said, due to the date of launch of the game, it’s is obviously getting better graphics and textures, 2 aspects that the previous games weren’t strong at. Being FromSoftware the company that we are talking about, the scenario, the ambiance and the designs are, of course, on the point and perfectly fit in each occasion of the game, giving the player the same immersion given on the other Soulsborne games. Being even more detailed on that aspect, places like High Wall of Lothric, Irithyll of the Boreal Valley, The Ringed City, Archdragon Peak, and Kiln of the First Flame, will mostly pass to the player a feeling of astonishment due to the amazing landscapes and atmosphere that they have. While, on the other hand, there will be areas that will give the player the feeling of progression and curiosity about what is to come, like, Road of Sacrifices, Cathedral of the Deep, Farron Keep, Catacombs of Carthus, and actually most of the other places to visit. Just like Dark Souls I, areas in Dark Souls III like Archdragon Peak and Untended Graves will be hidden and will only be discovered with certain triggers. The music can be really amazing at some bosses, but at others, it can feel kind of boring, which is a negative trait when compared to Dark Souls I’s unique compositions by Motoi Sakuraba (that being only my opinion though). The combat mechanic varied a lot from the previous games to Dark Souls III. Now there are specific habilities and possible combinations with each weapon presented. It synthesized ideas presented before in the other previous games and ended up making a pleasurable result (and, as said before, faster-paced). Lastly, to conclude this topic, Dark Souls III is a game that will not feel somewhat tiring when compared to the other Dark Souls, it balances every aspect already mentioned and does an amazing job to entertain the player for the first run until how many times one will feel like to play it again and again and again (in my case, 4 runs have already been completed).  It would be impossible to put together every piece of lore in a review, thus I will be summarizing the main plot.Unkindled, the player is a composition of the ash from the once, fire-devoted, undead that has given itself to the flame, and its duty remains the same. The game starts off presenting that the “fire fades” and that the Lords go without thrones. Giving that we are in the same universe set by Dark Souls I and II, we are left with speculations until finally arrive at conclusions by progressing in the game. The whereabouts are the “same” as Dark Souls I… However, there are slightly different things that might give the idea of the passage of time. Hundreds, or perhaps, thousands of years have passed since the Age of Fire and mighty new Lords of Cinder have linked the fire to maintain it. Even though there are controversies on the “time” aspect in Dark Souls III.  The time seems to be simultaneously blended with the Abyss and dark of long ago (in which the concept of time doesn't exists) and also the present that is experiencing the undying cycle of the fire legacy, which would probably be a base for proving the theory of the End of the World during the Filianore cutscene in The Ringed City (in which there is a burst of light, indicating time, and, consequently, a time-skip beyond the living of anything). As for the main objective, the player would have to kill the 4 lords of cinder that neglect themselves to link the flame once again because it would be useless and that they would die in which way.  The only one that remains in the Firelink Shrine is Ludleth, whom has long ago linked the fire, and now is just waiting for his end on his throne... for that, he is known as The Exiled.  The objetive of killing those Lords would be to acquire the necessary power in order to link the fire.Killing every Lord of Cinder and putting their ashes on their thrones will let the player travel to the Kiln of the First Flame,  the place where the battle against Soul of Cinder happens, a manifestation of every Lord Soul until then. Not only in terms of new Lords of Cinder speculations and lore the game creates its identity, but there would also be the side-bosses encounters that reveal individuals or even groups that shaped the dying world of Dark Souls III (e.g. Pontiff Sulyvahn; Oceiros; etc). In terms of DLC (Ashes of Ariandel and The Ringed City), lore-wise speaking, it presents a rich story completion and also the Grand Finale for the series with the final boss fight against  Slave Knight Gael, an undead, like you, seeking the blood of the Dark Soul for his lady's painting, who would be going to paint a new world for humanity.  I cannot put in words my passion for the game, I can simply recommend buying it with or without a discount, it is worth each time played and each credit paid. I do not even possess a high knowledge about the game yet, but I am still discovering and reading about its deep and amazing world. Got some free time? Get Dark Souls' series to play and you will not regret it."
Positive,"I rate this game: 9.5/10!1st off; This game is my introduction to the series. Dark Souls III is a game that wasn't on my radar, wasn't planning to play, didn't think I would enjoy. It is a game that viewers on my Twitch Channel (The Chronicles of Euther[www.twitch.tv]) challenged me to play. In short, Viewers were betting subscriptions -vs- me not dying more then 1000 times. I took that bet and streamed the entire game on Twitch. I died approx 700 time before 100% the base game. This game cost me two- (2) controllers. The right trigger snapped two- (2) times. It was truly an experience worth struggling (and I mean struggling) through and I invested 374 hrs in this game to date. Regarding the story line and Lore, you will have to due some reading on the internet. There are side stories, too, and you really need to pay attention to what the NPCs say, or you will miss something. No doubt.Dark Souls III is an action role-playing video game developed by FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows. An entry in the Souls series, Dark Souls III was released in Japan in March 2016 and worldwide in April 2016.It was/is  critically and commercially successful, with critics calling it a worthy and fitting conclusion to the series. It was the fastest-selling game in Bandai Namco's history, shipping over three million copies worldwide within the first two months after release. A complete version containing the base game and both downloadable content expansions, titled Dark Souls III: The Fire Fades, was released in April 2017.This game will test your patience, fortitude and emotional state. I can not count the amount of times I RAGED playing this game.The game is played in a third-person perspective. Players are equipped with a variety of weapons to fight against enemies, such as special weapons, bows, throwable projectiles, and swords. Even shields can act as secondary weapons but they are mainly used to deflect enemies' attacks and protect the player from suffering damage. In addition, attacks can be evaded through dodge-rolling. YOU WILL DO THIS ALOT! I'm not kidding... Bonfires, serve as inventory, Save and Travel checkpoints. ""Ashes"", play an important role in the game (you will have to find this out yourself. Magic is also featured in the game, known as ""focus points"" (FP). When performing spells, the player's focus points are consumed. There are two separate types of Estus Flasks in the game, which can be allotted to fit a players' particular play style. One of them refills hit points, while another, newly introduced in Dark Souls III, refills focus points.Combat and movements are fast and fluid. The mechanic are will done. Several player movements (such as backstepping and swinging heavy weapons) can be performed pretty rapidly, allowing players to deal more damage in a short period of time.Throughout the game, players encounter different types of enemies, each with different behaviors. Some of them change their combat pattern during battles. You will need to spend time LEARNING (through trial and error) about each enemy to defeat them. The game places more focus on role-playing; the expanded character builder and improved weapons provide the player with more tactical options. Finally, the game does features multiplayer elements like the previous games in the series. I was really surprised how much fun I had playing with other players too. It was a blast.Finally, the visuals in this game are phenomenal! I kid you not. If that is your ""thing"", you are going to be amazed.  Here is the link to my  Screenshot Wall. Take a look for yourself.https://store.steampowered.com/app/374320/DARK_SOULS_III/"

Positive,"On the surface it's hardcore RPG series full of memorable, fun and sometimes frustrating fights.If you dive deeper, you will find sad and dark story of the game.But at the bottom it's actually really good philosophical work. It's about neverending life and death cycle. About how everything will crumble to ashes someday, only to be replaced by something new.  About how living beings decay to mindless walking husks when they loose their purpose ..."

Positive,"This is a great Souls game, and in my opinion, a great game overall. I really enjoy the combat, audio, and if you are able to stomach the fact that the mouse and keyboard controls aren't great, it plays well with a controller.The world design is pretty good, but seems a bit linear. There are connections and shortcuts throughout the game, but the path is still one and you gotta follow it to progress through the game. The ability to teleport from each bonfire is also a proof of the linearity, since it would take ages to move from an area to the other, just by running. The story is told in a great way, for those who take their time to analyze and actually ""study"" the game environment. Storytelling is done throughout the game by environments, enemy placements, items description, drops, so on and so forth. Basically every element of this game is telling a story. This game is great. Would recommend it? Definitely."

Positive,"I found a rapport with the game. The game hates me, and I hate it too."
Positive,It took longer for me to beat champion Gundyr than Sister Friede and Slave Knight Gael combined!!!
Positive,"This game redefined my life. Sure, gameplay is great and all, but the story, and, more importantly, how the story is told (through the use of a veritable spiderweb of interconnecting hints and subtle cues), is bloody amazing. 10/10. Would go hollow again."
Positive,"Dark Souls III is definitely a slow burn if it's your first Souls game ever, like me. At first, I was mighty nervous to wander 10 steps away from a bonfire, and MANY of the game mechanics remained a mystery until they were explained by veteran friends and a fair amount of wiki browsing. I nearly gave up entirely, but pressed on since I had heard such great things.Eventually though, I too fell victim to the intense Stockholm syndrome this game infects in its players. After 15ish hours I was no longer afraid to explore every corner of the maps, and the more intricate mechanics became second nature. I now wander into PvP areas with excitement rather than fear. Common mobs became minor roadblocks instead of epic battles. I've finished up to Ashes of Ariandel and look forward to Ringed City with great anticipation.The bosses are amazingly designed. It's an odd game, too, in the sense that some of them seem excruciatingly hard for some people, and other players beat them on the first round. This game represents a different playing experience for each one (I for instance, had more rounds against the Cursed Rotted Greatwood than the Nameless King). It's got a huge learning curve, for sure. But once you get the hang of it, you start to actually enjoy it. It's become one of my favorites, at that. Do yourself a favor and give it a shot, you won't regret it. Though, be aware that you'll probably screw up your first playthrough (and that's okay), since many of the character quests depend on ridiculous triggers in very specific points in the game.Also, the jailers can suck on my ashen one."
Positive,"If you're new to the series, I highly recommend starting with the first game, as Dark Souls III is full of fanservice and heavily references the original game. Not to mention that the original Dark Souls is generally regarded as the best entry in the series.With that out of the way, here's what I liked and disliked about Dark Souls III and also some words about its PC port.- It's the prettiest Dark Souls game. The moody dark fantasy world realized in current generation graphics is a marvel to behold. All the armor sets and enemy animations are very well done and full of little details.- The combat is much more fast paced and very fluid. You have a lot of fine control over your every little move.- There are many quality of life improvements over previous Dark Souls games. E.g. the covenants are just items that go in a special equipment slot. You can respec and change your appearance, you can change your weapon's infusion while keeping its upgrade level, you no longer look like beef jerky when you die (unless... spoilers).- Fashion Souls. There's a lot of armor/clothing sets in this game and you can wear them on the looks alone. For better or worse there's actually very little difference between various armor sets defense wise, and none of them can be upgraded, so no need to grind for that either.- Some really cool secret endings!- Poise is now basically useless. It only activates during the wind up animations of heavy and ultra heavy weapons (the so called hyper armor mechanic). Even if you're wearing full Havel set you will still be staggered by rats. Sure, it makes the combat more risky and rewards being aggressive, but I don't think that removing an already established mechanic from the game is good design.- I'd be fine with this trade off but heavy and ultra heavy weapons aren't very useful in this game. The combat is very fast paced, the enemies are very aggressive, which means that you will be mostly rolling and attacking with straight swords. Some bosses and enemy types would be very difficult to engage with a slow heavy weapon while simply spamming light attacks with a straight sword completely trivializes them.- The game just loves spawning groups of enemies to stunlock you. And it also spawns enemies behind you or drops them from the ceiling. Predictably, this results in a lot of cheap deaths until you ""git gud"" and memorize their spawn points.- The bosses are very flashy and usually have multiple phases, however unlike the regular enemies they pose very little challenge. I beat the vast majority of the bosses on my 1st or 2nd try. Only some of the optional and DLC bosses are truly difficult.- Some things are really obtuse. You're not going to complete most NPC quest lines or find secret levels like Untended Graves or Archdragon Peak on your own. I mean, why would anyone attack a random statue in a random room? Or use a particular gesture in a seemingly unimportant place?- No cloud save support. This is just silly at this point. I lost a 10 hour save because I got a new SSD and had to reinstall Windows. The Steam Cloud API is very user-friendly and it shouldn't take much time at all to enable it on the developer's end. Dark Souls: Remastered had it, why not here as well?- Xbox controller button prompts only. No mouse/keyboard or DualShock button prompts. Not a big deal for me personally, as I always use a controller with these games, but it's a shame regardless. And again, this feature was available in Dark Souls: Remastered, it's baffling that it's not here as well.- Very poor anti-aliasing support, only offers some basic FXAA. Can't really get rid of the jaggies unless you have a really powerful GPU and just downsample from 4K or higher. Don't believe the screenshots on the store page, those are staged and heavily edited.- Generally runs very well, but some areas (like Archdragon Peak) have weird 1-2 sec lag spikes where my framerate drops to 50's or mid 40's. On the whole, the graphics settings don't seem to matter much and won't affect your performance in any impactful way. I played it on max settings and 1080p on a GTX 1070 Ti and it ran at 60 fps (which is the cap) 99% of the time.Overall, Dark Souls III is a flawed game, but still leaps and bounds better than most Western AAA games as it focuses on the gameplay first and foremost and doesn't just hold your hand through the cutscenes."

Positive,"After having tried different builds/characters and playtroughs, the best way to describe Dark Souls 3 is to consider it like the perfect baby between all the souls. It has the - awesome -  feel of Demon's Souls and its hub, the lore and the parry system of Dark Souls, some of the improvements (you're not forced to go NG+) and the lenght of Dark Souls 2 and, finally, more characterized weapons and a slightly more fast paced combat system from Bloodborne. I would say the same on the level design, with a central hub and many huge areas connected between them. Slightly more linear than Dark Souls but larger than Bloodborne and waaay more complex than Dark Souls 2: wherever you go there are plenty of secrets and treasures, without considering the amount of creatures, NPCs and missable quest.It's the perfect conclusion to a great saga. I hope Namco will not milk it.P.S.Now, my beloved From Software, can you please make me a new Armored Core/Tenchu? possibly on Steam? :DP.P.SIn the comments there was concerns about the lenght of the game so:The first playtrought last around 40-60 hours, after that you can easiliy speedrun it like all the Souls.You can also respec your character for free and don't proceed to NG+, so it's easy to test builds!!"

Positive,"Every adventure amidst the decayed lands of Souls universe, have you ever wondered who you are, truly? The hero who cleanses all putrefaction, a wretch defiling the lands... or something else entirely? Stick around until the end of this review and you'll receive an insight through a very special work of art.The final piece in the Dark Souls trilogy arrived fairly quick after its second sequel - From Soft fans with no ability to hold their anticipation rallied fiercely since its announcement, spectacularly epic trailers and finally release date. Intro is another masquerade layer of degeneracy obscuring what's really the current state of world like: macabre & grim, unrelenting death awaiting any unprepared lucid soul with one purpose of consuming your sanity. You'll be introduced into character creation menu with many more options this time around, new classes and some old ones brought back. As everyone with minimal knowledge of Souls genre knows the gameplay is what brings back people time and time again; its extreme versatile arsenal offering too many weapons to hold in your character's hand and properly utilize in just few playthroughs. It is guaranteed that you're gonna want to experience more than a class, weapon or spell, provided by the unmatched quality and replayability of gameplay in this particular genre. From Soft has evolved previous established mechanics into new weapon skill capability, allowing every weapon to have a third special function like buffing, attacking or dodging. Although I'll remark they have ditched powerstancing from previous title, one of the best features I've witnessed for an Action RPG in my opinion.Mastercrafted artwork is highlighted by an improved engine which shines in lighting effects, DS III is holding the reign for that iconic landscape. Less variety in armor but also new higher quality sets, I sadly have to say texture overall has been held back by console limitations. The boss fights are fewer in number but greater in quality, they went all out with fan service not that I personally mind, most battles are still challenging even after hundreds of hours. Level design borrows a lot of ideas from Demon's Souls, which they applied very well to make you strategize next set of actions instead of mindlessly rushing through hordes of undead. As always, patience is required to not go hollow and become a wandering skeleton; trial and error while improving by learning from past mistakes. Online p2p has been enhanced greatly compared to older works however still not at a point where you can say you haven't been bamboozled by seemingly out of range attacks, it's using dedicated servers for matchmaking only. PvP balance was never a main focus for the series so expect most players to use overpowered builds which require little skill to delete your HP bar, more so than previous Souls. Array of meta arsenal has a decent balance where you can choose your preferred style and retain a good relevance in being successful, just wish it had more admissible meta alternatives. OST continues to strive very highly as it's iconic for the series. And don't forget, never hand that thing, your dark soul.[]- attention to detail- dazzling landscapes & artwork- masterpiece OST & sound effects- boss fight design- password system to allow easy matchmaking- npc & their questline improvement (firekeeper highlight)[]- optimization could be better- linear path choice of area progression- poor blue sentinels / blades of the darkmoon designRise if you would, for that is our curse git gud."

I just wish they had more time to complete the game as they saw it - with more bonfire mechanics and many more content. I think DS III is great game, but if final release of the game would kept world as it intended to be, it would be a perfect game for me. Still waiting for possible (?) complete edition with all cut content."

There´s something about this game that just amazes me which are the boss battles...they are so immersive i literally yell when i´m fighting them,i feel fear courage and despair and it is so goddamn satisfying,especially when u kill the bosses, u just feel so rewarded. This game was incredibly hard for me,it was really tough to beat it for me and i gave up many times but in the end,at the end of the game,i really felt like i achieved something,something worthy.If u are like me and u have never tried dark souls i highly reccomend it as it is for me an unforgettable memory."
Positive,"As this was my first Dark Souls game of the series I haven't played (well... finished) any of the other Dark Souls games. And the reason is simply because Dark Souls II's hitboxes are too broken for me to enjoy it and I don't have a controller to play Dark Souls I. YES that means I finished Dark Souls III with a mouse and keyboard..... But I will tell you this for all the people who are still unsure to buy this because they don't have a controller. Mouse and keyboard works perfectly fine! A controller might be ""The best Dark Souls experience"" but as a PC gamer I wish to play games on a mouse and keyboard and not be expected to buy a controller to play a certain game. One of the most beautiful things about Dark Souls III is the music. The music is simply stunning! It fits perfectly in every area and it really gets you into the dark atmosphere that surrounds the Kingdom of Lothric. The cutscenes are also very well made and really get you hyped to get into the game to learn more about its dark story. The diologue voice acting is very well done and makes you actually want to listen to what the characters have to say.As for the bad part of the game, since no game is ever perfect. The port from console to PC is kind of horrible.... First of all you have to navigate through the menu using E as enter and Q to go back (DAFUQ?!) and all the controls are displayed as controller buttons. Which is very annoying when you are new to the Dark Souls series and first play through the game. There are tutorial messages but ofcourse they all display the controls with controller buttons aswell... Thanks to this you have to open up the options and look at all the keybindings to see what button is the equivalent of the controller button displayed. But becides all that, once you learn the controls you should get the hang of it fairly quickly and you will get used to it in no time.Right now i'm about halfway through new game plus which some of the borderlands players might recognize as true vault hunter mode (you basicly play through the game again with your same character and you get to keep all your weapons and stats but everything is slightly more difficult) and I am still enjoying every second of it. I see now how some people have spent over 300 hours on this game because it simply never gets boring. YES it will get frustrating at times but you just have to keep going and not give up! It is perfectly fine to take a little break though when you are having trouble with a certain area / boss. As I have done this plenty of times aswell and that really allowed me to keep enjoying the game without getting mad at it too much. If you keep having trouble beating an area or boss you can summon a friendly player to help you out as there are plenty of people out there willing to give you a hand.I know not everyone will agree with my opinions and this certainly won't be the same for everyone. If you are into RPGs, like finding new items and gear and are up for a challenge. I'd say buy it and see for yourself! Don't let the fanboys discourage you or the fact that you might not have a controller. But don't buy the game and then get mad that the controlls are fucked because it is already very clear that Dark Souls games have shitty console ports.Great game, great atmosphere and an amazing dark story. But keep in mind that it is a bad console port and if you are planning to play it with mouse and keyboard you will have to deal with the consequences. I say it is worth a buy but not everyone can enjoy it like I did."
Positive,"Decent overall, bosses are a massive improvement over DS2 both in challenge and visuals :)fuck the cathedral and fuck the library"
Positive,its like crash bandicoot with swords
Positive,"DS3 delivers a great Dark Souls RPG experience more akin to the first Dark Souls than DS2. Fun boss encounters with a variety of builds possible. Would recommend installing the Cinders Mod to fix ""issues"" with base game like poise/making all builds/weapons viable. Be way of online play as you might encounter hackers & interacting with them may get you ""banned"" from the online matchmaking.Dark fantasy action combat (Souls-like) RPG If you're familiar with previous Dark Souls games, the gameplay for the most part is the same. You begin by creating a character and picking a starting class (e.g. Knight, Pyromancer, Sorcerer) with predefined stats and equipment. You progress from area to area killing monsters and absorbing souls from fallen enemies. At the world hub, you can spend your souls to upgrade your stats to make the build you see fit. Bonfires are scattered around and are basically zone checkpoints that you return to once you die, or you can teleport from one bonfire to any other bonfire in the world. You progress through the game by clearing zones and killing the zones' bosses, namely a specific set of bosses need to die before the game's final boss becomes available but you'll eventually encounter every other boss along the way. In terms of what is new in DS3 that isn't found in DS1 or DS2, DS3 introduces weapon arts to the game which are pretty much a secondary attack style/animation (besides from the L1/L2 attack) inherent in pretty much every weapon in the game. Weapon arts expunge the FP (blue) meter to use and therefore have a finite amount of uses like spells. The art style of DS3, like previous Dark Souls titles, is deliberately very bleak and oppressing. The world lacks much color and gives you an apocalyptic feeling as everything in the world is soulless and wants to kill you. The environments and game effects are nicely textured, the weapons and armor and unique and interesting, animations are great and give you a clear sign of what an enemy is attempting to do, and overall everything came together nicely. Some areas can get quite dark so bring a torch/light spell if you can't see so you don't get surprised by a mob lurking in the shadows. You play the role as the Ashen One, an undead who rises from the grave to fulfill the purpose of returning the souls of the  Lords of Cinder to their thrones in order to end the curse of the undead and end the cycle of the First Flame. There's a lot more going on that you have do discover yourself by reading item descriptions and listening to NPC conversations. DS3 has a lot of lore to be discovered and if you are highly interested, there are many videos out there that explain it in much detail. •DS3 feels like a return to form as most movement and combat animations are similar to the original Dark Souls. If you played DS2 and everything in that game felt/looked awkward, you'll be happy to know that's been rectified here.•The game can be a great challenge for newbies and veterans alike. You are constantly kept on your toes on the lookout for possible enemy ambushes as there are plenty of deliberate item and enemy placements throughout the game. •Hundreds of weapons, armor pieces, and rings to equip and create a build from.•The introduction of weapon arts makes weapon choice a lot more interesting as you can choose a weapon based on its attack style/specific weapon art properties.•Boss encounters are unique and fun. Only a few are gimmicked to be defeated a certain way, but otherwise you can defeat them how you want: solo, with help, with swords, with magic, etc.•PvP exists in the form of covenant-based/red-orb invasions where players intrude into other online players' instances and attempt to defeat them by however they choose to. There are also unofficial but more honorable PvP locations where players duel each other and usually abide by a set of honorable rules (e.g. no healing allowed). Technically, PvP is an opt-in feature as you can disable all PvP by playing in offline-mode, but that would also disable co-op viability.• The Cinders mod is touted as the ""definitive way"" to experience DS3 as it brings into the game armors and weapons from previous Dark Souls games, fixes & enhances the poise system in the base game, mixes up enemy placements in the world/adds new enemies into previous zones, creates alternate routing by connecting previously unconnected zones, and adds in toggleable difficulty settings in Firelink Shrine to make the game even harder for the veterans out there. Did my most recently playthrough of DS3 as an all-around caster using Cinders and it was great fun. Gets my recommendation for sure. •Online play is a hit or miss. You can run into legit players doing some honest (or not so-honest but at least not cheating) PvP, or you might encounter someone who just one shots you (because cheats). This is a double-edged sword as interacting with hackers might get you on a banlist that matchmakes you only with other people that are also on the banlist. It's a slippery slope that I cannot provide much insight on as I haven't played online since 2016.•When I last tried building a caster in 2016, I recall that it felt very underpowered/underwhelming. I don't know if casting has since been buffed, but playing as a caster felt comfortable and natural with the Cinders mod so you might want to use the mod if you decide to create a build in such a fashion.8.5/10A good return to the feeling of DS1 and a good departure from the dread of DS2. Solid RPG combat, a deep & engrossing world if you choose to look into it, and an overall fun time killing everything before it kills you. Checkbox reviews are lazy copy & paste bullsh*t. ASCII art reviews tell you nothing. ""Let's be honest, I only wrote this review for awards"" is a waste of everyone's time.

Positive,⸸ pain ahead.𓆩 10/10 𓆪 First souls game and I felt every type of emotion. >.<Wonderful and unforgettable landscapes and soundtracks.
Positive,"It is now hard for me to believe that I actually refunded this game on my first attempt at it. When I was greeted with a lagging feeling 60FPS locked and tips that only showed controller buttons I could not be bothered dealing with it. It was only after falling in love with Elden Ring (a game I also initially hated) that I decided to give this game another go and boy I am glad I did. Sure it looks and feels a bit dated, sure it is frustratingly vague and obtuse as far as any help with where you are meant to go or even basic mechanics. But at its core DS3 is one of the most engaging and rewarding RPG games I have ever played. I found myself getting up early and choosing to miss out on sleep just to discover the next part of a map I had been grinding towards opening up. A good RPG should make leveling up something you want to keep doing and it should feel rewarding and DS3 most definitely does that. Map design is fantastic and I frequently found myself saying ""oh damn that is so cool"" at how cleverly maps would twist back on themselves to reveal (and hide) shortcuts and secrets. The gothic styling and the grim feel of the world all set such a foreboding scene that the brutal difficulty compliments. Yet there are moments where there is a lot of beauty in this depressing world - below is an example where I was in a dingy underground cave only to exit to this breathtakingly beautiful view:While this is obviously a difficult game, I actually found most of the boss fights a lot more manageable than some of Elden Ring's bosses. While they are tough, their animations are not too fast and the game doesn't throw unfair BS like Godskin Duo at you. The only complaints I have there was one later optional boss where the biggest enemy you have in that fight is the camera - I HATED that fight with a passion. There is also the same clipping of weapons that Elden Ring has, where bosses can hit you through solid objects - very unfair in such a difficult game. They also make you run an annoying long way back to some boss fights, often through enemies and when you die so often this can get tiresome fast.  Overall I cannot recommend DS3 enough and while it is difficult, if I can play it anyone can as I am generally too lazy to learn every attack pattern and counter but can still fumble my way through. In fact the difficulty is one of my least favorite aspects of DS3, it is the incredible world design and RPG elements that make me love this game. I would go so far to call this a must play game if you love the RPG genre and you are willing to put in a bit of effort with the expectation of some pain."
Positive,"Does this game even need a review? 100/100""Ashen one, what is wrong?"""
Positive,I am never been this relaxed while playing a game. Its like listening to orchestra while having a massage. Feels great really recommend this game for people who want to relax their mind and body.
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is the souls game that we wanted, and it is the souls game we got. As the smoothest and most refined of the trio, DS3 takes what was good in DS1 and DS2... and expands on it (aside from no power-stancing).To start, the gameplay is extremely smooth, and combat works exactly how you desire it. One of the biggest issues I had with DS2 was that combat felt clunky. That issue does not exist with DS3. Due to DS3 being a lot more modern than DS1, the combat also just feels more fleshed out. You still have your melee, ranged, magic builds, but DS3 introduces a mana bar. I still think the game was meant to be played melee, but whatever build you do is up to you...Bosses were extremely memorable and scale up pretty reasonably. The bosses in the early game are manageable even if you are new to souls, especially since quite a few of them are gimmick bosses. However, we get some of the most memorable bosses across the souls games in DS3. Whereas in DS1 we had many extremely memorable bosses, DS3 introduces a large plethora as well (DS2 bosses were overall less memorable IMO). Some of the ones I thought were most memorable include: Nameless King, Lord of Cinders, Sister Friede (DLC), Gael (DLC), Lothric Princes, Aldritch, and Champion Gundyr. What's better is that DS3 is actually quite related to DS1, and you'll even revisit Anor Londo!Map design is also excellent for DS3, and you get some of the same stuff that we loved about souls in DS3. Most of the main world is connected in some way as a big map, with twists and turns bringing you to new regions that somehow link up again afterwards. Shortcuts, hidden paths, bonfires, etc. make the map and levels really fun to get through. One of the best feelings is when you'd been grinding for a while and then suddenly open up a shortcut via an elevator or something.The only part of the game that I highly disliked is the 100% achievement hunt. DS3 is basically souls achievement grinding on steroids, because getting all the rings takes so much time. Additionally, in order to get all the different spells, you need to max out covenants. To max out covenants, you need certain drops that were meant to be received via PvP. Now if I played DS3 when it came out, this should have been no issue because there were plenty of people playing online. However, years later now the online base has dwindled, making farming covenant items much harder. If you were to farm it PvE, it has an extremely rare chance to drop in certain mobs... making the PvE grind experience super super annoying, boring, and uninspiring. I ended up sticking it out for 100% to the end, but it was not worth it.Overall, definitely one of the most fun Souls games. I highly recommend you pick the game up and give it a swing. You will not be dissappointed."

Positive,"Hi. I 100% finished the game. Here are my thoughts. +Game seems more challenging than DS2.

Enemies are slightly stronger (hardly noticeable) but otherwise, the new playthrough is exactly same as NG. Rings are only slightly better. Except Gold Serpent Ring +2. It's amazing, -Terrible frame drop when loading new areas. If your computer isn't Lord Skynet, the game will force you back into the main menu for low FPS. You'll need to restart the game to continue online. -If you have just enough stats to wield a weapon in two hands, your status page will not display the true AR chart. Mildly annoying. -It takes ages for you to be summoned as a Blade of the Darkmoon or as a Watchdog of Farron. You'll end up doing a lot (like literal days of farming without lengthy online sessions) of farming/grind just to max these covenants out. (If you're interested in getting all achievements)-You can tank (partial parry) a hit and immediately continue to parry again. A single reposte will usually kill you because everyone online is a Hornet Ring wearing, twinking asshats. -Online player character models sometimes just don't load, becoming completely invisible (but can be locked on). -Sometimes, enemy character model won't even have an animation. Leading to hilarious/frustrating duel. -There's no Guard Break mechanic from DS2. It takes multiple kicks to break a Greatshield. A smart greatshield user won't let you kick multiple times. -40% of invaders are Estoc R1 spammers. The other 40% is impregnable greatshield users. The 10% is Iron Flesh/Sacred Flame glitch users who insta-gib, defenseless people. The last 10% are the noobs that need to git gud. In summary, Iron Pineapple is the bane of all things nice in DS3. -Poise still doesn't work like you want it to. Instead, hyper armor is granted to heavier weapons when swinging. Heavy armors will take heavy stat investment with questionable returns. That's all I can think of at the moment. TL;DR version:+It's better than DS1 and DS2. +It's easy to play with friends. -Frame drops. If your PC sucks, then you're gonna have a bad time. -Online PVP will kill you little on the inside, unless you're a PVP veteran from previous Soul games."

Positive,Truly a roller coaster of emotions.

Positive,"At this point there is little reason to review Dark Souls III.It is the end of an era; the passing of a franchise; fire fading to darkness.It is beautiful and sad and almost perfectly designed.Farewell, Skeleton."
Positive,Very fun game some parts frustrating others just really fun and complex. The scenery in this game is cool all the way around. I myself find this game a great way to make new friends may it be invaders or summons. Really fun game. Long May The Sun Shine - Siegward of Catarina :praisesun:
Positive,"It's hard to put into perspective what emotion this game gave me. At first the game was very confusing and fun at first. Just explored the few aspects, the tough enemies and even fought the very first few bosses. I think the over all punishment of this game is it had no mercy or forgiveness if you missed or skipped certain NPC's or events. Roughly that happened to me a lot the very first play through. I spent probably around 130 hours on my first game. Having chose the pyromancer as my starting class, thinking this was the only way to unlock pyromancy until I realized everything in the game was at my disposale, just took some time to get. Once I finally understood the mechanics of this game, the item and the leveling and upgrade systems I dove deeper. I saw the story behind this game, the lore behind each character, the story this game so passively told and what effect it had on the society and people you come across inside the game, most importantly your own. being beaten down thousands of times over and over, back to back with almost 0 to no progression in the game is part of the experience. This game wants you to send you to the bottom, failure this game wants you to fail so you know how good it feels to win. What it feels like after dying countless times to a single boss only to eventually win with 0 estus left and all health left to nothing but a drop. You do this a lot more than once to. My sense of curiosity got to the best of me to, trying different load outs and weapons. What's best for certain bosses and what works best against certain enemys? PvP strategys and how to get involved more into the game. Even trying a few co-op runs with friends. All of this led to well, the end of your story. The final boss right? You're done, this is it. The end. You take all this experience and so rightfully win. Is it truly the end though? Being able to start a fresh new start right after. There is no true end to this game to me. The final boss was never the final boss for me. I just kept going. This game kept awarding me with such a deep connection of failure and successTo touch base on the DLC, I had probably already played through the game 9 or 7 times. Before I considered buying the DLC knowing I loved this game. I explored the new DLC's without searching anything up making sure not to spoil any new things I were to come across. Almost as if this was my first time playing the game again. The DLC was short and sweet to the taste and jumped you right into the action but I felt most connected with the story in the Ringed City.!!!SPOILERS!!!   (heres the ending of my review to avoid spoilers, other wise keep scrolling if you don't care :)that was truly the end and I actually felt sad. That was the true end of a game and series I loved so much. Of course I played it over and over but after that it never felt the same. so to anyone out there who took the time to sit down and read the comment to someone with more than 800+ hours on darksouls IIInot only am I telling you to enjoy yourself with this amazing title. Stretch the experience the longest you can by taking your time with every knick and cranny the game offers you because this game is more than a story or a game to me. It's a journey :).The whole vision of failure and winning came to a test when I tried going against the Iconic dragon: Midir. Slaying him felt super rewarding. I love the boss weapons you can net from him to.It all led up to the princess, and then to Gael. I think it took me the most time out of all bosses to kill Gael. His OST music is absolutetly the best in the game by far in my oponion as well but once I finally landed that final blow on him I didn't really feel success. It all fell silent, my headphones faintly played their last note to the music that led to the death of what was truly, the final boss. You're just left there in that open dessert. that was truly the end and I actually felt sad. That was the true end of a game and series I loved so much. Of course I played it over and over but after that it never felt the same. so to anyone out there who took the time to sit down and read the comment to someone with more than 800+ hours on darksouls IIInot only am I telling you to enjoy yourself with this amazing title.

Positive,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
Positive,"MASSIVE EXPLOIT!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 4: it's live!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 3: they're now officially working on the issue. Negative review will be removed after everything is up and running!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 2: Yesterday a statement was released regarding the ongoing issues with Dark Souls.The problem is recognized and allegedly they are working on fixing the issues for all titles.They ""have made the necessary security measures on all platforms"" for Elden Ring's upcoming release. Whether that means the issue is resolved, or the servers are disabled on launch (for PC) is unknown. The Dark Souls titles will stay offline until after Elden Ring is released. The full statement is available on @DarkSoulsGame twitter.As a sidenote: the negative recommendation is only as a warning to people unaware of the current issue with the game, this is/was a security issue with potentially catastrophic impact, were people to exploit it for real, luckily the people who figured out the exploit had good intentions. Next to that is the inability to play online for the time being. How much of a detriment that is to you, is a personal matter. The game can still be fully enjoyed in offline mode, as was stated in the original review. I've been deleting some comments that were first of all incredibly toxic, but also thought to ""outsmart"" me by noticing I have been playing the game over the last few weeks. This game is IMO easily one of the best games to have ever released. However, it is unacceptable that FROM Software has never taken care of it's online services, and issues with hacking, also before the RCE exploit was discovered. Leading to the point were now the servers are offline completely. I don't care about the online functions being down, so I am fine playing until the release of Elden Ring. However, this might not be the case for others, so you should know what the current state of the game is, and that it won't be resolved until after Elden Ring's release.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update: servers are offline for From Software to work on the issue. This includes other DS titles as well.A community made mod that was already released to counter other forms of hacking, now also (allegedly) works against the RCE exploit.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Warning to anyone buying/playing this, especially with the Elden Ring release coming up.Just a few hours ago it became known that there is a ""Remote Code Execution"" (RCE) exploit leaked.Essentially this gives people invading your world or Co-op setting the possibility to run ANY code/program they want. Leading from crashing your game/PC to accessing any passwords/information stored or destroying/altering anything you have on your computer. It can also be used to wire moneyfrom banking apps.Proof can be found on Reddit. There is links referring to Twitch streams were these exploits were used to annoy streamers, but also to gain attraction from FromSoftware and BANDAI NAMCO.The game is playable in offline mode, this can be selected in the main menu, restart the game to be sure it starts in offline. The BlueSentinels mod does not work. Allegedly this RCE exploit can be used in Elden Ring."
Positive,"The Third and so far final game in the Dark Souls saga, Dark Souls III does not disappoint. Although it makes quite a few changes from the previous games, most of them are welcome ones.A few examples:1. Dying isn't as punishing. Your health bar only drains about 20% when unembered compared to DS2 where you could lose an enormous chunk of your max health, especially if you died repeatedly.2. Stamina is a lot more forgiving, allowing you to dodge-roll more without getting exhausted and taking a huge beating. You aren't forced into putting a bunch of points into stamina just to survive faster bosses chain attacks and can instead allocate them elsewhere.3. The Estus Flask (Health Potion item) can be used while moving. While you should still use it sparingly since it does disable dodge-rolling until the animation nears its end, this means you can avoid some lesser attacks and create distance while healing up.4. Embers, this game's equivalent of Humanities and Human Effigies, which maximize your health-bar and enable co-op among other things are a bit more common. At least when compared to the Effigies from DS2.5. Combat in general feels a lot less clunky. This did come out after Bloodborne so it makes sense that they sped up combat a bit as a natural progression of the series. It's not as fast as the Bloodborne combat, but it's the most fluid and fastpaced it has been in Souls so far.All these things and more should make Dark Souls III a bit more welcoming to newcomers, and it seems to have worked. Dark Souls 3 was very well received by fans and became Bandai Namco's fastest selling game ever.Of course, just because the game is more accessible that doesn't mean it doesn't provide the same kind of methodical challenge, intricate level designs and fascinating world-building that the series has become known for.Personally I found most bosses to be more enjoyable and memorable than anything from DS1 or DS2. I think the overall design has been vastly improved since the older installments, no Bed of Chaos or Seath the Scaleless here. Although there were times when a few of them bordered on frustrating it was mostly in the optional areas or DLC, and as such can be put off until later when you feel ready.There's no Blight Town either, the closest we get is a short swamp area near Farron Keep. Although there are still a few poison-dart enemies in the Cathedral of the Deep as well as the Grand Archives, but what is a Souls game without anoying little bastards with blowdarts?In terms of narrative, you revisit some locations from the first game and as always there are some returning favourites among the cast, but the game itself takes place far later in the timeline and it serves as a sort of finale.However, as should have been expected, we are left with even more questions than answers. In the end, the story is open to interpretation and there are several people far more knowledgeable than I who have done so on youtube. I personally recommend VaatiVidya's videos if you finish the game and wonder what the heck just happened.I had a wonderful time with Dark Souls 3, and ended up spending almost as much time on it as the other two games combined. If you wonder what all the fuzz is about and want to try your hand at a Souls game, I think this might be the best place to start. Even though the original game has its charm, Dark Souls III should be much easier to pick up. Although it is a sequel, the timeline is so convoluted that I don't think you'd need to play the other games first to enjoy this one. Instead you can tackle them in whichever order you'd like.Now lets hope Demon's Souls and Bloodborne will finally come to PC!"
Positive,only for katana roleplaying weebs
Positive,"In the short time that I've been playing this game I've already been blown away with the return of a true Souls experience. The Combat is quick and responsive and the enemies feel much more intelligent. The first thing I noticed with DS3 over the others is how incredibly smooth it is. Dodging has never been so fun! They've added a few things to make the initial start a little less aggravating, without over-doing it and making it too easy."
Positive,"Roll souls 3 i don't recommend you play online at this point its filled with toxic players and twink players Offline tho the game is fun. whats a twink you might ask well they are ,Low leveled, high end gear players who:-Grief fellow low level players who still have base level gear; meaning they get one shotted or can't do much damage.-Small Update to clarify something , im not saying that the entire community is toxic, just a decent chunk of it is."
Positive,"It's Dark Souls 3 so if you're a fan of the series then you'll know exactly what to expect - - Awesomely responsive and intuitive combat.- You'll die a lot.- An immensely detailed and dark fantasy setting.- Loads of cool weapons and gear to dress your dude or lady up in.- You'll pick up items with vague and cryptic descriptions and think ""What the fuck is this and what the fuck does it do?""- You'll die a lot.- It's HARD but fair and nowhere near as difficult as people who don't play the series think it is.- You'll die and shout at your screen something like ""Bullshit!"" and then come back and try again about 25 times.- There will be huge, scary bosses to fight and you'll think to yourself ""I'll never beat this"" and then on the 10th try you'll beat it (Summon someone to help, no one will judge you) and scream at your monitor.- You'll reach that point in every Souls game where you have to bite the bullet and do some grinding to get STRONGER!- You'll probably spend more time exploring wiki's than playing the actual game.So Yeah, it's the Dark Souls we all love and it's pretty great."
Positive,Amazing chest ahead!
Positive,"This game is not for the impatient or easily frustrated... That said.Dark Souls III introduces a new a way of approaching fiends and phantoms in combat. This requires (you)the player to learn the ropes of the game through enemies. The movement is fast and unique, and so are the enemy's movements that make it a challenge at first. The Unique sets of weaponry combined with armor, fashioned along with formidable enchantments. This can create awe-inspiring characters that can fend off other players in fear. Otherwise, creating a challenge for other players or the enemies that trying to conquer over. The gist of this only prepares players for the awaiting doom of weaving through a boss's attack and striking back.The monumental buildings and cryptic tombs that are surrounded by a torn down world the player travels through. Createing an ominous setting the player can only assume they are in for trouble. The ambient of rooms obscure hidden paths that could not be found without aid from other players.Although, a weapon with a blade is reccomended the game allows the player to add attribute points towards specific stats. This not only allows the player to use certain items at their potential but it also lets them choose their way of player. These are the main builds I have observed.. (Pyromancy, Miracle, Intellegence, Archers, and Swordsmen). The diversity players can approach an enemy are unique and each weapon has it's unique style of play.The story revolves around the player(Unkindled), rising from a pile of ash that must seek out the Lords of Cinder to return them to their thrones and assume their souls as a new champion. The player must seek out to restore a successful linking to the ""flame"".*The game's aspect ratio can change the brightness to a high an absurd high value.*It's reccomended you get a Nvidia 900 series card or the AMD equivalent with a four core processor.*V-sync is very useful in the game and eliminates tearing issues very well."

Positive,"The game of Dark Souls 3 is a very fun and rewarding experience for those who really want to try it. I have had a great time playing this game, I just wish they would have done better with their anti-cheat system in the beginning. I would recommend this game in its current state to anyone I know or anyone I do not know. The pvp is frustrating, the bugs are frustrating, the game itself is very frustrating. But it is a lot of fun."

Positive,"I summoned a mad phantom with the intention of dueling him, but instead he sat down and offered to toast with me. We continued on throughout Undead Settlement together despite my wariness of him and he helped me take out all the mobs in the surrounding area. After a while, I became accustomed to fighting alongside my newfound friend and started turning my back to him knowing full well that he would protect me to his last, dying breath.We were a team. The best of friends, and nothing could stand in our way. He may not have been a Warrior of Sunlight, but Solaire's legacy thrived on within him. Jolly co-operation resumed until we neared the Curse-Rotted Greatwood... And it was then that I decided to take yet another chance and summon a second Mound-Maker to see if we could rally him to our side.The plan seemed successful at first. But it wasn't long before I noticed some suspicious patterns in the phantom's movement, and his interest in my backside became a significant concern. My anxiety was proven justified when the phantom took a swing at me with his greatsword and missed.My loyal protector raised both his hand and his middle finger at the attacker, before charging forward with fury the likes of which none in Lothric had seen. He made it his personal duty to end the traitorous life of the one who would dare attempt to strike at me, and before long the violent fool was fleeing from our jolly wrath. He rushed up a ladder and leaped across rooftops before finally dropping a harmful distance to the ground, giving us an opening to attack. My companion launched himself from the rafters and his flowing cape waved majestically in the air as he readied his sword and plunged towards the infidel who would dare spit on the tenets of co-operation and sunlight.The valiant protector lunged his sword deep through the attacker's back before he could escape, the weapon grinding through bone and flesh and rendering him a lifeless husk. I dropped down following this, and we waved and spun our capes at one another in excitement and victorious glee.But this was the end of our time together. We gave each other one final wave before my friend's body started to fade away as he was whisked back to his own dimension.It hit me I'd never see him again."
Positive,"The Dark Souls 3 Community is cancerous & trash. There won't be one day where you don't meet someone spamming, trolling, cheating, hacking, & of course pointing down after they kill you in the most annoying way possible. You might come across some friendly players, but very rarely if at all. Even I find trouble not wanting to be trash because everyone else is to me & shows no respect. It's a cycle of getting trolled all the time, getting mad then turning into one of the cancerous players yourself. As for the game itself I have 2 words. Buy It. I've beaten this game at least 60 times between Xbox One, PS4, & Steam. I have all the achievements for it. You will be put to the test of beating one of the hardest games known to the general gaming community. You will die, over, over, & over again. You will think that it's impossible after being stuck on a boss for 4 hours. I have personally been through hell when I started playing Dark Souls, but in the end it is worth it. It is a amazing game.Even though the community isn't great I still recommend this.You can enjoy the game & the community even if you're a friendly player like myself, just be prepared to have a lot of patience. Otherwise you will end up either quitting the game, or turning into a sh*tty player like everyone else by the time you beat it.Praise The Sun ☼"

Positive,"I've played all of the Souls games, including Demon's (although never finished it to the very end). Ever since I first played Dark Souls years ago, I fell in love with the franchise. It was the first Souls experience to me. That game showed me that games can still be very challenging, with amazingly well made fantasy worlds including all sorts of nightmarish creatures. Dark Souls 3 continues the epicness the earlier ones had. I love this game, even if some moments felt impossible or quite frustrating lol. It has much of the same old gameplay mechanics from previous games, but with new additions too and the combat is mostly fast-paced.I feel like it's a great mix of Dark Souls and Bloodborne, without the dash-dodge of BB. The world itself in Dark Souls 3 is amazing in my opinion, not as well made as the perfect design in Dark Souls with those upper and lower journeys, which is the best in the series. But it's still really cool and you can basically go visit every place you see in the distance eventually. That's one thing I love about these games, to feel like you actually are in this huge unkown mysterious world. As previous games, DS3 doesn't hold your hand. You have to figure out where to go, how to fight enemies and bosses, learn their weakness and patterns to win and death will teach you again.There were few areas or enemies which I didn't like so much because of reasons, but that is a part of these games. I do love how DS3 pays tribute to DS1 in few ways, but I won't go into more detail about that.The soundtrack is soooo fantastic and introduces many cool songs, which fit well in the intense boss fights to make them even greater :D.New monster design is mostly amazing, as I said it reminds me of Bloodborne with certain opponents. Also some of the monsters feels like, as if they were taken inspiration from Berserk manga again as the creator is a fan of it, which is of course really great. I have to say that the boss design and fights are some of the best I have ever encountered, there are many memorable ones and at least 3 were really tough to me. One of the bosses felt a bit disappointing because of the way to defeat it, but was still so cool. I think I did every boss fight as solo, except one. And when you do it alone, the feeling and adrenaline rush is so much greater. The last boss of DS3 could very well be the hardest fight I've ever fought in games and I loved that, even harder than Artorias of DS1. Part of it could be because having a different build than in previous games so it honestly felt impossible, I dunno. But oh boy...it was just insane and such a thrilling fight. Lots of suffering, but eventually when you survive alone these kind of encounters, that feeling of victory is so good. I don't think many other games give that satisfaction and this is one big reason I love the Souls games. Fighting alone in the dark places, against a gigantic or just ultra aggressive bosses is simply one incredible feeling.The multiplayer is similar to DS1. When you summon friends for co-op, they can help you on the road a long time or help kill a boss which is nice. Not badly done like in DS2 where you disappear after killing a couple enemies. I've read many being disappointed with the game, like having connection issues or getting banned for no reasons. Which sucks. But I personally barely had any issues as my Chloe in my 60h+ journey, there was perhaps only 5-6 times when I couldn't enter boss fog door to help a fellow player after he summoned me. Because of connection lag, but that's it.Well it seems I ended up writing more than I first planned :). I say Dark Souls 3 is definitely a worthy send-off to the franchise, as it is informed to be the last one. An epic dark journey and amongst my most favorite experiences ever. I recommend this to those who want to experience challenging and really cool gaming moments. For fans of Souls it's a must.10/10"

Positive,"Does Not Open from This Side: The GameUpdate: I'm leaving the real reviews up to those much better at it than I am, but I'd like to weigh in on the performance and stability issue going on. I'm playing the game on an R9 380, 12 GB of RAM, Win7 x64 and an ancient AMD Phenom II 955. It's on lowest detail at 1680x1050, but the game runs at a pretty solid 25-35 fps. There's some parts that play at 10-15 fps but overall it's very good considering my CPU is the equivalent of a potato nowadays, and according to the sytem specs I shouldn't even be able to run it. I've also had zero crashes as of yet, and I've played it since release so I've been playing on version 1.03."

Positive,"700+ hoursThis game is fantastic for new dark souls players, it is more forgiving. but still has the full spirit of a dark souls game, if you quit, you will find yourself coming back to it.The pvp really different from the other 2 games. but its action-packed and full of life. especially when invading post-pontiff. 3V3 all day long.If you are somewhat interested in a decently hard game, you should pick this up and play."
Positive,"So, after putting a lot of hours into all of the Dark Souls games I decided to write a review about this awesome game! Dark Souls 3 is the third and the last Dark Souls game in the franchise, and frankly, it is a worth end to the series. Now let's talk about some aspects of the game. Ever Since Gwyn has linked the first flame, there were countless other heroes that relinked the first flame so that the age of fire can continue. The current four Lords of Cinder rise from their grave because the fire is threatened. These lads are supposed to re-link the flame so the age can continue, but instead of doing that, they would rather watch the flame die out. So the flame wakes up the Unkindled. You are one of these unkindled ash. Your job is to bring the Lords of Cinders back to their thrones. Either alive or as ashes. My overall opinion of the story is that its pretty awesome, but can be really confusing sometimes..and it needs a lot of reading. Dark Souls 3's gameplay is basically Dark Souls 1's gameplay, but with a lot of fixes and balances ( and some fuckups )You still have the same main stats, but some of them either got removed, or they were made into one stat ( Endurance no longer gives you more equip load. Instead, equip load can be raised by spending points in Vitality.  And also, the Resistance stat from Dark Souls 1 is completely gone, you can't invest points directly into resistance ) Also, because of a lore aspect, you no longer have the option to stack up Humanity. Actually, Humanity is quite gone from this game, instead you use Embers to restore your link to the other worlds and also give you an HP boost which lasts as long as you're alive. ( To Simplify it , once you use an ember you can be invaded, but you can also summon other people to help you at certain areas ) Summons ( also Invaders ) also have the option to use Estus ( although the overall Estus you can use while being summoned is reduced ) Now you can also equip up to four Rings!Oh and one other thing, Poise is completely broken. Covenants also return, and quite frankly some of them are really fun and give you good rewards, while some of them are totally dead. For example, The Blade of the Darkmoon ( my favourite covenant from DS1 ) is utter shite in this game, since you can't level up, because the covenant itself relies on another covenant( Way of Blue ) which is a completely dead covenant on levels above 25. Overall, the gameplay is pretty cool, you have a lot of variety in Magic Stuff ( Pryomancy, Offensive or Healing Miracles, Sorceries , Dark Sorceries/Miracles/Pryomancies ) and you also have a ton of Melee weapons to use. This makes DS3's replayability INSANE, because you can literally make ALMOST ANY KIND OF BUILD you want.  I highly recommend using a controller. 'Nuff Said. I think the controlls are good, but if this is your first Souls experience, you gotta get used to it first.  This game is super gorgerous! It looks amazing in almost every area! I especially love how Irithyl looks like, with all that snow and stuff. Superb! I really like how some weapons got some extra details ( Boss Weapons look amazing! ) The enemies are also very nicely detailed. Almost all of the areas look very cool, but honestly there were some areas that could've been bigger and better detailed. For example, the Profaned Capital is a joke. It's basically a 5 minute run to the boss and that's it. The armour in Dark Souls 3 is really good! There are a lot of armour from DS1, for example you can get Lautrec's armour..or Artorias's armour. You can do a lot of cosplay by combining other armour pieces together. Overall they have a lot of variety.Dark Souls 3 continues DS1's and DS2's trend with having some ridicolously easy bosses. Wolnir, Deacons of the Deep, Crystal Sage and the Anchient Wyern are basically a joke. Dark Souls 3 also continues the other trend from the other games, which is that the main guys you are supposed to defeat are probably one of the easiest bosses. The Abyss Watchers themselves aren't so hard, Yhrom the Giant is a complete joke. Aldrich isn't so particularly hard either. Although thank god the Twin Princes actually manage to put up some kind of challange. I would've enjoyed if most of these bosses put up some kind of challangeAlso, there are the Invaders. I myself don't have a really big problem with invading, but some people really don't like how this entire system works. Alright, that about covers most of what I wanted to say, let's gather the cons and pros.-Fitting end to the Series-Lore is quite interesting-Awesome gameplay mechanics-Good variety of magic or pure melee weapons-INSANE ammount of builds. You can almost make any kind of build you want.-Graphics are awesome-LOT of throwbacks to Dark Souls 1.-Forgot to mention, this game has an amazing soundtrack!-Most of the bosses are really well done.-Can be played as coop game almost entirely.-PVP-Lot of NPC questlines- The main Lord of Cinders were pretty easy to defeat. Yhorm the Giant was pretty dissapointing.-Some areas in the game got very little ammount of detail. The Proned Capital had some potention, but it was completely wasted.-Poise sucks arse. It's broken. It does not work.-Fuck Covenant farming.-The insane ammount of lag in PVP. People can literally hit you with a broken straight sword 3 meters in front of you. I don't know if PVP is designed that way or not, but they definitely should do something about it.Sometimes you land a huge hit, and the enemy easily rolls through it, despite the fact that seemingly you hit the dude in the nuts.If you already have completed Dark Souls 1, and loved it, I definitely recommend you to purchase Dark Souls 3! If you have not yet played any kind of Souls game, its still worth to pick up, but you'll need some time to get used to it. This is an awesome end to this awesome series!Thanks for reading this review!Edit: Grammar and formatting"

Positive,"Remember that teacher in school who always picked on you or made your life hard? Remember that kid who didn't like you and picked on you? Remember that test you didnt study for and failed? Well, everyone is like that in Dark Souls 3. It took me 3 hours...to get past the tutorial. I recommend this game for BDSM fans and masochists. 10/10 from masochists all around the world."
Positive,"An action RPG with a challenging gameplay and atmospheric world, where players confront formidable enemies and uncover a complex, interconnected narrative in a dark and visually stunning universe.In this game you will play as Ashen One, and your main job is to link the First Flame. The First Flame is nearly extinguished, as its fire is fading due to no one linking the flame for a long time. Prince Lothric of Lothric was destined to be a Lord of Cinder and link the flame, but he refused due to being cursed and disdaining the linking of fire.Lothric's rejection led to the Undead Curse taking over, bringing on an Age of Dark without the flame being linked. Then, one day, a bell rings at Firelink Shrine, signaling an emergency to save the First Flame before it fades out. This bell wakes up the old Lords of Cinder, like The Abyss Watchers, Aldrich the Devourer of Gods, and Yhorm the Giant, along with you, the Ashen One.Now, the Ashen One is a special undead called an unkindled. Unlike the others, they couldn't become cinder and link the flame, so they don't have an internal flame or soul. No soul means the Ashen One doesn't hollow after death like regular undead, overcoming the curse. To successfully link the First Flame, you've got to take down the previous five Lords of Cinder.The gameplay is unforgiving, rewarding patience, skill, and a thorough understanding of enemy patterns. Character customization adds depth, allowing players to tailor their playstyle through a variety of weapons, armor and magic options. The interconnected world promotes exploration, uncovering hidden secrets, shortcuts, and lore. The risk-reward balance is a core element, as death is a common occurrence, yet each defeat serves as a valuable lesson, which motivates players to hone their strategies, ultimately overcoming the formidable challenges that await in the hauntingly beautiful realm of Dark Souls III.Due to the absence of cloud save support in Dark Souls III, it's crucial to manually back up your save file to retain your progress.

I went for a dexterity build, took the Mercenary class, and played the whole game with the Twinblades as it suited more my playstyle. Achieving all achievements took around 85 hours with two new game plus playthroughs. Main game was 61 hours, with 20 farming Covenant Items. Most were easy with help from Steam forums, but Darkmoon Covenant was a grind. I also played Ashes of Ariandel (4.5 hours) and The Ringed City (8.5 hours) DLCs. Ringed City is a must, you will play the most enjoying boss, Slave Knight Gael, which is widely considered to be the final boss of the entire Dark Souls series.Regarding the pricing, the game's initial cost of €59,99 and the Deluxe Edition at €84,98 seem somewhat steep, especially considering the game is available at a 50% or greater discount during one of Steam's major sales. I managed to secure my Deluxe Edition during the Steam Summer Sales for €42,49. Despite the game being released in 2016, I found the price justified and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it!- Secure Progress: Always back up your save file manually.- Starting Class: Find your ideal build at https://soulsplanner.com. For PvE, starting class choice matters less.- Master Dodging: Prioritize precise dodging over shield reliance. Learn enemy attack patterns for well-timed rolls.- Parrying Advantage: Coming from Sekiro, parrying is easier and perfect parries deal no damage.- Covenant Item Farming: Essential for 100%, farm items in your first run to avoid increased difficulty in subsequent NG+ cycles.- DLC Strategy: Play DLCs after your initial run; not necessary for 100%.- 100% Achievements: Two NG+ cycles are required for full completion.- Learn Enemy Patterns: Observe and learn enemy moves for effective prediction and counter.

Positive,"I purchased Dark Souls 3 at full price, knowing very little about it, got to the first boss ten minutes into the game, died like ten times, and immediately got a refund. But I kept thinking about the game, and when it went on sale recently I decided to give it another try. I just kept at it, inspired by the Idle Thumbs playthrough, and now I'm almost 60 hours into this character and I love it. It may be one of my favorite games of all time. Sometimes it's infuriating, but oh man, when you finally power through whatever boss or obstacle is holding you back, it's an amazing feeling. Give it a try and don't give up on the first day like I did the first time I tried it. It's worth it. I'm thinking about getting the DLC and I simply never purchase DLC for anything."
Positive,"Awesome game for everyone, especially for casual players. You have unlimited lives and wide variety of different and powerful weapons. Your character literally cant die at all so there is no condition for losing. You dont even need to find healing stuff: you will get it very often at lots of checkpoints.Perfect graphics will also attract players who like fancy look'n'feel. A good storyline accompanied with extremely beautiful cutscenes will not let you fall into boredom. Just try any game from Dark Souls series: these games are absolutely funny and they are suitable for relaxation after a hard day.In total: 10/10"

Positive,"""Greatest hits"" album of Souls series and Bloodborne. Instead of creating something new, this game uses a lot of locations / ideas / NPCs / enemies from other games in one bundle.PVE might have been the best in the series, if not for the lack of poise. The fact is that a meagle rat can interrupt you. You get staggered after a single hit by anything.The combat is still great, if you play as a light weight dodger with fast weapon. If only players had some poise. Enemies DO have it, after all. The system is in the game.Enemies themselves are cloned in several locations. It's a little bit annoying to see enemies from the first two locations well past the big chunk of the game, but with new ""look"" and lore, pretending to be new enemies without any connection to their counterparts from earlier. There's still a good variety and they differ in their behavior and form.Location design is fantastic! They look great and designed well, with good looping for shortcuts (the game does suffer from ""does not open from this side"" disease though) and enemy placements. And they're bigger than locations from previous games. You would often look from the high place and see a lot of places you have visited or would visit. Simply gorgeous. It would seem at first that the world is interconnected like it was in Dark Souls, but, sadly, this is not the case. The game is very linear with very few branching paths to different locations.And one of the hidden locations is a relighted version of one from the main course of the game. There's not a single unique enemy in it, the boss is one of the previous ones with added aggression. And they put there unexplained fanservice items which do not fit in with the lore. The location looks and feels great, but it's still a damned reskin.Bosses. It's hard for me to judge their difficulty, each boss feels good, that's for sure. Two of the bossfights might go in the top ten boss fights out of all FromSoft games for their sheer feel. And this game contains the best last boss.PVP might have been the best in the series. It did so many things right this time around. So many things... But it suffers from the same problem as PVE - lack of poise. Every weapon stunlock. Meta is to spam R1 into oblivion. Parries are harder and much more punishing for mistiming. Which is good, but that also means you can't parry spammers and the first hit stunlocks you so you get hit two-three times always. Aside from overpowered Caestus (it allows to parry like in Dark Souls (on reaction) and has incredibly fast recovery animation, which let's you roll away from attack even if you missed a parry) and they brought a system from Dark Souls II where you can't parry heavy weapons (running and rolling attacks excluded). So they really hit a nice spot with parrying in this game. Time to nerf caestus recovery animation (i.e. - prolong it).They also ""fixed"" backstabs. It has a starting animation now, like in DSII, but in DSII even with this animation backstabs were often glitchy and unfair. In this game out of hundreds PVP matches I was backstabbed once and it was my fault (got greedy on attacking one player and his buddy caught me mid animation), while I backstabbed countless parry spammers (besides caestus - recovery from parry is not immediate and with a bit of prediction of a parry you can easily punish players for spamming).Back to weapons. Light weapons are a meta, since stun-locking and fast attack speed. Are heavy weapons dead? Not entirely.They brought back an amazing system from Demon's Souls called ""hyper armor"". When you swing a heavy weapon, at some point in the swing (differs for different weapons) hyper armor activates and you can no longer be staggered out of animation. So you still get hit, but your attack is not interrupted and you can hit your opponent as well. It's incredible. The problem is - hyper armor does not start immediately, so you can still be thrown out of heavy attack by a poke from a dagger while wearing full Havel's. It's still much easier to win with light weapons. The only way you can die from heavy weapons is if you make a mistake. They reduced stamina consumption for rolls, so it's really not that hard to dodge forever. In the end heavy weapons are a gimmick and with them you're hindered against good players by quite a lot. Still winnable though.Just a small note - range. There's almost no phantom range! Unless you have a bad connection to your opponent - you can have a hitbox porn where weapon only hits you by the length of it's actual model. No bs with double range for pokes like in DSII, which ruined PVP for me there. Now it's always depends on connection. And most of the time connection is good.Invasions. FromSoft really wants weak players not to suffer? But why? There's already such thing as ""offline"" for those who dread being invaded.If you're running by yourself - embered, don't summon anyone and don't use a dried finger - high chances you won't get invaded at all (two covenant areas are exceptions). Until you ""touch"" online by summoning - you're mostly safe. So invaders mostly invade co-opers and gankers. Which puts them in quite a pickle. It's still doable 1 vs. 2 or even 1 vs. 3 (this games allows up to six players in one session. With max three white summons), but if you get to a tryhard gank - your chances are slim.Phantoms (whites, reds, blues, purples, whatever) get half amount of estus flasks they have while being in their world. There are no other replenishing healing items. You can have a single divine blessing of siegbrau on yourself and that's it (all spares go to the botomless box). So From finally did it right with healing items both for PVE and PVP. You also get back one Estus flask for every enemy phantom killed (so for red this means if anyone at all dies, since reds are not allied with each other). Semi-same system in PVE, where you get a flask after some number of mobs killed.In the end it's a great title. But it's a rehash of the previous games, so I don't feel it's possible to rank it very high. It's above Dark Souls II, that's for sure, but is it above Dark Souls and Demon's Souls? No. At least not for the returning player. Because we have already seen everything in it before playing. It was done good before and this game failed to improve ideas, only to copy them."
Positive,"Now, with my vast experience of every SoulsBorne game, and each of those from the Dark Souls trilogy on at least two platforms, I believe I can offer a well educated judgement of Dark Souls 3. I will be comparing it to its predecessors, naturally, but I shall also judge Dark Souls 3 as a game in its own right.So, for those that haven't played a Souls game before, and won't understand my comparisons. Dark Souls 3 is an amazing game, but don't buy it. Go play the others, at least Dark Souls 1, or I'll come to your house and slap you until you do.Right. For those experienced in souls, and want to know what Dark Souls 3 is like. Prepare to be both amazed and disappointed by this game. Dark Souls 3 keeps the complex combat of the previous games, in face goes one step further by making it so complex that it makes no f***ing sense. Diminishing returns and the peculiar new 'poise' mechanic make ultra-heavy armours mostly useless, as they weigh you down. It's fine for me, because I always had 0 poise, but for those that always killed the 4 Kings by R1 spamming in Havel's.... gone are those days - but chugging is easier. As usual, there's a hell of a lot of weapon variety. Unfortunately, only a few from each class are viable, as many weapons are wholly outclassed by others in their category. The same goes for armour, but nobody cares because fashion is what's important. Despite what some say, magic IS viable in DS3 and actually remains the most powerful thing in the game if used correctly. Hyper Armour is a new addition. Certain weapon types now offer hyper armour during parts of their animations. This is good, since there is a lack of useful poise, but is very easily abused... and so 2-handed Hollowslayer is very powerful against someone who can't parry - not kidding, among the best weapons in the game.The world design is similar-ish to DS2 mixed with Demon's Souls, but the individual area design is more akin to Dark Souls 1. In general, it's bloomin' good, I just wish the world as a whole was more connected. The HUB of the game works a lot like ademon's Souls and Bloodborne. Host to your very own Maiden / Doll for levelling, merchants, a blacksmith, and gathering place for various NPCs... it feels a lot like the Nexus in this regard. It is also disconnected from the main world.The story and lore is just as expansive as its predecessors, and only more theories and secrets are coming to light as time passes. The same goes for a NPC quest lines. They are very akin to those in DS1, boasting unique encounters with NPCs and witnessing their stories unfold as yours does - take Ostrava, Siegmeyer, Solaire and Logan's quests for example. Most quests are as complex in nature, each with their own emotional and compelling story, as well as new kinds of gameplay features to improve upon the quests. Honestly, I think DS3 is host to some of the best NPC quests and characters, on par with Bloodborne and Dark Souls 1. Unfortunately, we have no Mephistopheles asking us to kill everyone, but there is one similar quest, and obvious reference.The soundtrack is amazing, on par with that of predecessors, and accompanied by equally awesome bosses. There are slight disappointments, as with all of the games, but the majority are very good. Just be warned, bosses are more aggressive in DS3.Finally, I'll summarise. Dark Souls 3 has its fair share of disappointments, but the are few enough not to tarnish the beauty of the game, and they are almost all mechanic based disappointments that may or may not be altered in later patches. The game, as a whole however, is fantastic and absolutely worth buying. PvP takes getting used to, because of the changes,  it is still good. And some covenants suck, but that's nothing new. However, don't let it deter you from getting yet another FromSoft masterpiece.PS - Also... do buy that PS4 for Bloodborne, because it IS worth it."

Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is the third entry in the brutally challenging dark fantasy series created by From Software. It is a third person action roleplaying game with a focus on intense fast paced combat. The game offers many hours of content and fun amazing boss battles which really are the highlight of this game, finally beating a boss after the 20th or so time gives you a level of satisfaction unrivalled by most games out there. On top of that is some truly amazing level design and a gorgeous soundtrack. The graphics are good for its age and some locations in the game look stunning thanks to great art direction. It will also offer you a generous amount of replayability and you will discover new things even after several times beating it.  Phenomenal boss battles unrivaled by other games Third person melee combat Soundtrack Level design that requires you to think Zero handholding Very fun with a group of friends Cool magic Brutally challenging difficulty Multiplayer is laggy sometimes Unsatisfactory PC port Lack of proper mouse and keyboard controls Online co-op is needlessly confusing Questionable placement of two certain bonfiresThis has to be one of the hardest and most challenging games I’ve ever played. The gameplay consists of walking around decrepit environments riddled with tough enemies, secret pathways and hidden items. The level design is truly amazing, feels quite interconnected with many shortcuts and you actually have to use your brain, except for one instance where there are two bonfires right next to each other for no reason. That combat in this game is amazing with a huge amount of enemy and weapon variety and it is very fast paced with a large variety of playstyles. Are you someone who plays as a tank with a massive sword or a wizard who shoots spells? You can play as both leading to lots of replayability and messing around with weapons to find the one you like. The best part about this game is the boss battles which are so good you will find all non-Soulsbornekiro game’s boss fights lacking in comparison to this game. There is also online co-op and PvP to play with friends however figuring out how the co-op works is very confusing until you get used to it. I’ve rarely bothered with PvP but it’s usually laggy and frustrating. The graphics are good for their age of the game and some areas look outstanding. It is also a very good game to see in motion thanks to the fluid enemy animations in combat. However, every single one of the default characters in the character creator screen look like they’re constipated and have brain damage, NPC’s mouths don’t even move when they speak except for one and the game always looks like it has a light grey tinge to everything. The sound design is good but reused sounds from previous Dark Souls games. The voice acting is consistently good and there’s not a single bad performance. The soundtrack is incredible and sounds great, you will be listening to the soundtrack on Youtube long after you’re finished with the game and gotten bored. Unfortunately the PC port of this game is rather meh, no 21:9 support and It’s locked at 60fps. As someone who uses an ultrawide 100hz monitor, I am rather disappointed and it is my main flaw with this game. However the gameplay is good enough for this to only seem as a minor issue in the overall experience. Also, when you use a keyboard and mouse there are only Xbox controller inputs for the UI making it almost impossible to play for people who don’t own a controller. I’m not a fan of RPGs, but this is an exception; it’s made me want to play and finish the other two Dark Souls games, Bloodborne and Sekiro as it’s just that good. Everyone should give this game a try even if they think they’re not going to enjoy it.Follow our curator page: OCG-Curations if you like and want to see more reviews like this one."
Positive,"Finished Dark Souls 3 after an intense 11 days. With a Soul Level of 116. Spoilers from here on.In short, it's a great Souls game. It feels very focused in most aspects. Changing covenants is easier, armor upgrades are gone, stats are trimmed down, the world feels tighter, grinding for upgrade materials wasn't necessary. I also liked the slightly improved weapon infusing system. There is now a more clear way to infuse weapons with each ""elemental"" and still have stat scaling while there are ""simpler"" infusions available of each kind for better base damage output but no scaling at all. Sounds complicated when reading but it's the easiest upgrade system so far. Another mechanical change is that the camera and player movement feel more similar to Dark Souls 1 which I prefer over the feel of Dark Souls 2. I enjoyed the pacing and focused design. Reminds me of Demon's Souls.This more focused design also shows itself in the world and bosses. There are fewer bosses and the game generally felt lighter and shorter, seeing DS2. It by no means lacks content though. Especially compared to Dark Souls 2, the world feels more believable and cohesive. The areas themselves are also better designed and most importantly to me, offer much better boss encounters than its predecessor. This makes me most happy as the bosses in DS2 were for the most part lackluster. I thoroughly enjoyed almost each and every boss for their unique designs, unique behaviors and unique flow of battle. Interestingly enough I had the by far easiest time so far in any Souls game with DS3. Not sure if it stems from the experience in the series but on the other hand I've heard of friends with tales of horror about certain bosses which I managed to down on my first or second try. In terms of music Demon's Souls and Dark Souls offer more haunting and memorable tracks but there were several nice ones here that caught my attention. Abyss Watcher and Prince Lothric boss fight music namely. The cast of NPC and the questlines were well done with some personalities being nice additions to the Souls series. To my understanding this will be the final entry in the Dark Souls franchise, so it was nice to have references and nods to the whole franchise, starting way from Demon's Souls. I enjoyed reading weapon, armor, spell and item descriptions, vaguely hinting at the players past achievements but the throwbacks don't end here, by far they don't. The blacksmith is the very same Andre of Astora from the first Dark Souls which surprised me since this is taking place apparently a long time after the events of the first game. While him being the single only major identical NPC, I still would have liked it more if he at least was a descendant. Ah well, it was breaking the immersion a bit. There is a fine line between recognizing heritage and recycling and for the most part it's thankfully the former but having seen all the content, there are areas where I would not blame someone for using the word ""recycled"". Anor Londo is actually not one of those though as it was a very small area, basically a run-up to a boss, so I was absolutely fine with its appearance. Most of all it did not feel like a cheap copy-paste but made sense in the lore and world. Time passed, so it was decaying and crumbling, very well done. Sadly though the existence of Silver Knights was not only done beyond a little nod but felt copied. They added few new attacks but they were the same old Silver Knights with the same old gear, not even brittled or broken to show signs of time! That was a big immersion breaker and I did not enjoy facing them which only became sadder at the amount. The area could have become much more memorable and impactful by making the Silver Knights wear broken, torn-apart armor, maybe even broken weapons and slower, less lively behavior. The way they are depicted though is not well done.Later on when you end up in the Untended Graves there is an interesting ""Aha"" moment upon realizing it's the starting area but that gets replaced by a ""Why"" moment when you realize it's not that the original area changed its tone and time but this is a parallel world/different area?! Dynamically changing the area from a certain point in the game would have been better. You fight a variant of the same boss and later on fight Black Knights. Similarly to the Silver Knights with almost no differences to Dark Souls 1 but worse as the location does not make much sense. Shame.Thankfully these ""recycled"" occurrences were not too much, so I could forget about them once hitting subsequent areas which did not have these issues at all. All in all, I am glad that the Dark Souls franchise is ending as I want to see FromSoftware build a new world with different mechanics, different ideas without expectations & shackles that come with a franchise. From a technical point, Dark Souls 3 has network issues which I have not encountered in previous games. Frequently summoned players become glitched, lacking any animations and just glide which makes for a subpar multiplayer experience. Same happens to the player as a summon in that no enemy or boss has any animations which made for several severely anti-climatic boss fights where this issue obviously occurred for multiple summons who could hammer on a glitched boss without any repercussions. It's not the majority of the multiplayer experience but happens more often than is acceptable.Other than that the game shows stutter. It was only mildly annoying and never became a major issue for me thankfully. What did bug me were the load times when browsing through the inventory. The larger images take a second to show which annoyed me.Despite the lengthy criticism, the positives outweigh them by a landslide and the ups are much, much higher than the lows. Dark Souls 3 is a very good Souls game and stands tall on its own with many of the most memorable and enjoyable areas and boss fights in the whole franchise. I am eagerly awaiting new content, so I have a reason to play more of this gem of a game."
Positive,"I don't know what to say about Dark Souls 3 that hasn't been said already. The game has an incredible atmosphere, and coupled with the soundtrack, it creates a very impressive play. The gameplay is probably what most people vouch for, and they are right, it is really challenging and very rewarding. I would definitely recommend the game, especially if you have friends who already have it."
Positive,"Dark Souls III was my introduction into the Souls series. I actually owned Bloodborne on PS4 and played a small amount but hadn't put together its relation with the Souls series and couldn't wrap my head around it at first. Because of that, I went into DS3 a tad nervous that it wouldn't be the game for me. Could I have ever been more wrong?I typically play FPS (i.e. R6Siege) or Open-World RPGs (i.e. Fallout/Skyrim), but this experience has evolved my outlook on gaming as a whole.DS3 is a must-own for anyone who enjoys methodical combat intertwined with RPG elements. The game has beautiful environments that are accented by some truly horrendous enemies dwelling in them. The game challenges you (something any person should know about the Souls series), but it never feels unfair. It just requires you to learn from your enemies and adapt to them, with each one/area posing a different style of threat. I was stuck on Iudex (the first boss) for hours, and just before I gave up, I finished him, and I was sucked in by that satisfaction.Invasions are still frustrating after my 170 hours. PvP is a huge adjustment after PvE, as net-code and player skill makes your attack-timing entirely different. Hackers also exist, so there can be some very frustrating times where you're trying to get better but you simply can do nothing but watch as someone instant-curses you or uses their super-speed. But, the PvP system also allows you to try out builds that fit a unique niche that you may not have been able to use viably trying to play the story mode. This extra dimension further extends the seemingly endless replayability this game offers. I would suggest trying to tackle some invasions early (SL85 or lower), as there's a huge learning curve and most players above this level are weathered vets that will show no mercy.I never thought going into this game that it would be one of my favorite games of all time. I cannot wait to go to Bloodborne and the other Souls games, but for right now I am still very much enjoying my THIRD playthrough, and plan on making a few more for some different level/functionality characters. 9/10"

Positive,"This is my little Christmas present to this amazing game: a plus one from me! This is possibly my favorite game of all time.  TL;DR at the bottom if you don't want to read this long love letter. ~before we begin, a small definition~  Deification (de·​i·​fi·​ca·​tion | \ ˌdē-ə-fə-ˈkā-shən) (noun): 1. the condition of being treated like and considered to be a god  2. The act of making something into a god People often misunderstand the goal of Dark Souls. They think it is to beat the final boss and possibly achieve some comprehension of the vaguely told story. However, I say different. The goal of Dark Souls is not to defeat a boss, but to become a boss.In Dark Souls 3, you begin as a filthy undead that doesn’t know which way is up. Your first challenger is Iudex Gundyr- another failure of a warrior, cursed to be in the same wastes you were resurrected in. When you defeat him, you begin the path from nothing to everything. Soon you run through a ruin of a cursed city, searching for the Lords of Cinder- far less failed warriors than Gundyr. As is stated in the game, they are not made Lords of Cinder for merit, but for might. When you have defeated all of them, you prove your superiority. POINT DOWN.Along your journey, you kill all sorts of outcast lords and warriors. You come across other players trying to complete their own journey- some you may kill, others may kill you. Some will become your allies. You’ll find that in this brutal masterpiece of a game, allies can take you a long way. Even when they are your partners in crime- as invaders. Throughout your numerous interactions with them, you will learn things, obtain new items, and gain experience. At this point you will unconsciously begin to realize the goal of Dark Souls. 60-70 hours after your first victory over Gundyr, you will arrive at the final boss of the base game. Like before, you can go alone for an ultimate challenge to prove yourself… or fight with your sunbros to fulfill the “quest” that the story has you chasing after.Then you will begin the DLCs, which have the better parts of the game in all aspects- the most interesting weapons, the most fun and well-designed bosses, the best part of the story (which is actually really good, it just takes effort to get into). The further you go into Dark Souls, the more challenging and of higher status your foes become. By the end, you travel to the Ringed City to finish the story of the whole series. This DLC has THE BEST bosses of the series, and is a must buy if you get this game.Then you are done… with the first step of your journey. Some think they are finished when they defeat  Slave Knight Gael , but no. You begin NG+, and the journey repeats, but with a twist- you now have your status from before; the overpowered weapons from the lords and warriors you defeated, the experience from fighting with and against other players, the levels from the time you invested. Also, up until NG+7, the damage and health of all enemies gradually increases. It’s for this reason that I think NG+7 is the true ending of the game. The ultimate challenge, the final test of all that you have learned and accumulated. You see, Dark Souls is not about beating all the bosses, it’s about becoming a master of the game. It’s about ascending from a lowly hollow to a  lord of Lothric  or the  bringer of the apocalypse  or a PVPer who never loses. Dark Souls is about overcoming its massive difficulty again and again until you become a part of its challenge for future players. Dark Souls is about deification- the ascent to godhood. Become a god, and then you win.And then you have the undisputed right to  POINT DOWN AT THOSE FILTHY CASUALS  stop playing this extremely addictive game.  One of the best RPGs of all time because you truly become a part of its world, and it's not by choice- in lures you in, forces you to defeat its challenges, and lets you slowly realize that you are the center of it all, that bettering your own skill is the true goal. Role-playing so damn immersive you actually aren't role-playing- you as the player are actually the whole damn point. A game truly dedicated to itself. Everything that defines a masterpiece."
Positive,Yes. Just release me from the basement.
Positive,Walk past the shade of Darks Souls 2 and bring back the glory of Dark Souls 1.Praise the sun!! \(^o^)/
Positive,A perfect mix between Bloodborne and Dark Souls. 10/10
Positive,"overall one of my favorite games ever, ive played 100 hours on ps4 but decided to switch to pc and am shocked by how much better the quality is"
Positive,Alright lets make this short for all the Darksouls Fans out there: + no permanent HP loss+ amazing leveldesgin+ artstyle is beyond everything Ive ever seenNow go ahead and buy it. Also praise the sun nerds :)
Positive,"Watched my kids play hours and hours of Dark Souls. They were very good. Game looked awesome. I love games. I own 300+. Kids said ""dad, you have to get Dark Souls."" I said ""I have to get Dark Souls."" I got Dark Souls. I've played 5+ Hours. Still haven't beaten the very first boss. Kids looking for new dad."
Positive,"Love it! Dark Souls 1 was my favorite, only due to the dark feel and story.  While I enjoyed Dark Souls 2, my biggest complaint was that it never felt like it had any direction, or purpose to follow. Dark Souls 3 fixed that issue, while going back to Dark Souls 1's dark gothic atmosphere. While also bringing in so much awesomeness into the combat system, with the new stances and weapon arts, the game requires a lot more planning to break enemy shields and blocks, and PvP feels more indepth.  Dark Souls 3, is easily my favorite of the 3 games. However, I will say that if you're coming to Dark Souls 3 for the PvP, and expecting a change in the latency, you will be disappointed. There are still huge delays when being invaded and having to fight someone. Another thing which bothers me, while not a major thing, is if you summon someone into your world for help, you WILL be invaded shortly after, which kind of sucks when all you're trying to do is kill a boss or something, the good thing is often you are 2v1, and can easily dispatch the invader.Either way, I give the game a 9/10, would be 10/10 if the latency issues were addressed.If you enjoyed ANY of the previous Dark Souls, you WILL love this one."
Positive,"Prepare to experience all of the following;Spamming rollTwink InvadersPraise the sunGit gud'Wtf is that?'You diedOverall this game is a ton of fun, especially if you're just getting into the souls series. It is definetly the easiest out of the 3 in my opinion but still has an aspect of hardness and a lot of suprises to be uncovered the further you get into the game. You're most likely going to die at every corner on your first run through but the satisfaction of actually beating the game for the first time is a joyful experience.10/10"
Positive,DS3 > ER

Positive,"There are 3 types of enemies in Dark Souls 3.Huge enemies - you hit the legs ( or hands in the case of one in particular in this instance ), and watch out for their slow but area wide and very powerful attacks.Small enemies - you hit them on the back and they come in many different flavors, from slow and stupid to very quick and hard hitting. But all of thim, circle, defend/parry and attack them from behind.And then there are dogs. Fuck dogs."
Positive,"Dark Souls III is a decent homage to the Souls series with some quality of life improvements here and there. It is a decent Souls game, though definitely not my favorite. -------Be prepared that despite how much I enjoy this game, I do have a lot of criticism.--------The areas of the game look beautiful and much more lifelike than in previous titles. Bosses are also incredibly memorable due to the variance in their design and movement. It’s a bit difficult to say what I like about this game that is better than in other Souls games because there frankly isn't much. It’s a solid title for the same reasons that the previous entries were. From Software played it fairly safe with this title. While Dark Souls I and II had some bosses or mechanics that were incredibly hit-or-miss, at least they attempted to things that were truly different. The last entry of the series felt like it had lost more than it gainedI greatly miss the existence of any kind of static poise like the previous entries had. Considering this title is much faster paced than the ones before I felt this game would have benefited the most from it.I personally don't mind how linear this title is, though I do wish the areas felt more interconnected with one another. Things like later areas having paths that return you to previously inaccessible parts of a previous area would have made the world felt much bigger and would have made exploring more interesting.Next is the new FP system. While the FP system changed how a player controlled the number of casts they could have, it really didn't do much to change the gameplay of spell-casting itself. While I admit the system makes pure spell builds more viable for PvE, it comes at the cost of making them almost too strong in PvP depending on the build (if you've fought a lightning arrow user, you know what I mean). Because of that I wouldn't say it does anything revolutionary or new.Weapon arts leave me with mixed feelings. I love the effects of certain weapon arts such as Champion's Charge from Gundyr's Halberd or the Sacred Light and Flame from the Twin Prince's Greatsword, the latter of which is my favorite weapon in the whole game. Sadly it feels like you can never truly enjoy weapon arts because they cost FP. Most weapon-based builds cannot afford to invest any levels into attunement. And because they fight at close range, they also cannot afford to prioritize any ashen estus over regular estus. I really wish they would have made weapon arts cost weapon durability instead as they did in the previous titles for unique attacks since durability can be replenished with repair powder and it would still prevent users from being able to spam weapon arts during a fight.My final gripe is also related to weapon arts because I feel their existence is the reason one of my favorite parts of Souls games is gone. There seems to be much less moveset variety among weapons than in previous titles. Sure some were broken, but I prefer broken over boring. In DS2 we had spears with attacks from 4 different movesets and greatswords that had straight sword movesets when 2-handed. So many weapons had unique properties like this that made them each so memorable, whereas in DS3 almost every weapon from a weapon class feels identical to use with only a few exceptions.I know I sound like I hate this game at this point, but I don't. My playtime alone should be proof that I love DS3. I love it for the same reasons I loved the previous two, it's just that I don't love it for many reasons outside of those. This game had a lot of potential that I feel it missed out on. This was made even more evident to me after playing the Cinders Mod. I honestly have little to no desire to return to vanilla apart from pvp since this is the only remaining Souls game with a large enough playerbase for such. I understand why From Software took the safe route for this game and don't blame them for it. It was a good decision if this was truly the last Souls title they plan to do. I only hope they will be more innovative in future titles like Elden Ring (keep in mind I have not had to opportunity to play Sekiro myself, but it seems to be a step in the right direction)."
Positive,"Launch issues will not be discussed because FROM knows about them, and are already working to fix everything.What is Dark Souls III? This game is the next entry into the Dark Souls series, featuring the same 3rd-person RPG gameplay of it's predecessors. It  takes place in the same world as the previous titles(though now in Lothric), and includes all the expected puzzles, traps, bloodthirsty enemies, complex/beautiful environments and secrets you could ever want. Dark Souls has a brand new engine this time around, the same as that of Bloodborne; you can really feel the difference in smoothness and graphic quality.Positives:The legendary difficulty is back(they patched it in before release).This installment easily has the most in-depth fighting system of the series.The lore and narrative are still puzzles in their own right, and there's a lot of it.The game is on par for PC options.Most areas will run at 60fps if your computer is within spec. The game is beautiful.Soul memory is GONE! WOOO! Also, enemies won't disappear after you kill them a bunch.The boss design, as usual, is on point. They are all unique, scary, and challenging.The soundtracks are amazing, they come to life in the game's best moments.The game start-to-finish without doing any side stuff takes an average of 30 hours.The level design is miles ahead of Dark Souls II, you'll notice that immediately.Veterans of the series will be familiar with most systems, like sliding into a new comfy chair.Combat has been entirely reworked, down to each individual weapon. Dual-wielding is viable!Classes don't lock you into a playstyle, choose what you want and build on it. You can respec too!PVP is better than ever, especially with the new covenants!Online functionality has been expanded.Based on the ending, this is probably not the final Souls gameNegatives:The world is kind of linear in some areas, but it's not very noticeable.There are a few framerate and graphical issues. Some areas are worse than others.There is noticeable pop-in.Some grinding is neccesary. (May not be a negative for you!)Keyboard and mouse controls are just okay(using a controller is highly recommended)(Yeah, that's it. Wow.)So is it worth it?A thousand times yes. This game takes the best of the previous games and expands upon them. The Souls formula has been entirely reworked, and outfitted with the new Bloodborne engine to deliver a beautiful, polished product. Veterans should feel right at home here, as everything they know and love is in the game waiting for them. Those new to Dark Souls will have no problem using this game as an entrance to the series, as this is really, truley, the ultimate Dark Souls experience.(Did you like this review? If so, please vote it up! Feel free to add me and check out my Steam Group.)"
Positive,"The time has come for me to touch the pen again and write something about the game where I spent the good last weeks. I want to add that this review is based on my personal experience and opinions. The following review is also based on my only one playthrough of the game (including DLCs). I would also like to thank the person who bought this game for me, as well as the person who also gifted me the available DLCs.Before starting, I will state that I have not previously played any of the Souls games series or similar, which may have contributed to how I played and how far I came. But let's not beat around the bush, it is time to enter the world of Lordran, where the flame of life begins to dim.I will start the review by mentioning of what I have heard so much, and with which I personally did not have major problems. A lot of people have spoken in a environments where I'm active that the control are terrible. I played on the keyboard and mouse myself, so I do not know how it is on the pad, but the game allows you to change everything in options, although it is very intuitive by default and you can get a feel by the first two locations what to press to achieve the effect we intend to achieve. I would like to say that the character that I eventually played was a Pyromancy Knight, so I did not have much contact with what it is like being an archer, mage and so on.As for the interface of the game, it lacks a forced tutorial for the first time, because many things can be overlooked, and all this is caused by one of the biggest drawbacks of the game - all interface buttons are still shown as if we were playing on the pad. Not once in the game did I rate the messages, because I could not figure out which button suits it. Nevertheless, it did not prevent me from enjoying the game, when at the fingertips we have Souls' Wikipedia containing information about subjects whose descriptions are not very clear - and I really recommend reading these descriptions. I sold a special shield myself which increases the renewal of stamina, just because I did not read its description and that would help me a lot.As I mentioned earlier, this is my first contact with the Souls-like game, which is why I slowly began to understand how the gameplay looks like within those. The world of the game is limited to closed locations, and most of what we see is really amazing views, but more on that later. The game as a whole is one to two lined, where the task is to move through the mazes of rooms, corridors and swamps to unlock shortcuts, illusory walls or more bonfires, until the end we encounter a boss fight. Although for some people it may seem monotonous, all locations are diverse, thought out and work well together. The exploration through them is not so satisfying by the enormity of opponents which we have to repeatedly have to break - dying more often from the hands of monsters than bosses is a normal thing.The combat system in this game is almost precise, although you can complain about hitboxes of some weapons or monsters. based upon my game as a knight, wielding a light and a great swords was intuitive, however, everything was releated to the most important rule of these games - greed. Every opponent in this game is different, so an attempt to kill him immediately can only result in an unfortunate death. The most important is the analysis of what movements they do and the appropriate response time. Often, you must dodge a few times before you attack - and the DS3 game is very punished for greed in an flurry of attacks. However, when we have enough of opponents (although I recommend fight with lots and the unique ones for special loot), there is always an escape option which I used, and somehow I managed to root out through many locations until the next bonfire.In the world of Lothric a bell sounds, signaling the fading of the flame, which protects everyone from the infinite darkness. With the roar of the bell wake up the undead, whose task is to tame the Lords of Cinder and bring them to their thrones. That's all we learn from the intro of the game and, in fact, what we should remember, because during our wander we will not see such a development of the story. It exists in the world and it depends on us how well we will be exploring to discover secrets and know more about story of it all.If we're talking about story exploration, most of what we'll find out are side quests that are completely different from what you would encounter in other games of this type. Scattered around the corners of the world, NPCs offer us their services as long as we find them alive and we will not get through the game too fast. The slight problem is that during the first wandering, we can practically omit all side tasks through their complicated and multiple paths design, hidden from our eyes (Outside of beloved wikipedia) steps that we must do to be able to complete them. Rewards for tasks are usually the constantly increasing offers from buyers, however if we skip a well or do not look at every angle, it may turn out that we do not know the full potential of the game.I mentioned this part a few times in the previous parts of the review and it does deserve a separate category. The diamond upon the crown of this game is undoubtedly the bosses with whom we will face. From cursed trees, meetings with the Vatican and swordmasters, the diversity of bosses requires us to learn how they move, what attacks they perform, find a way to read the best opportunities for attack and how many of them can be done. Although many internet lists rate some bosses extremely low, I had a lot of fun against most of them, although I had to take a break from the game for a while to regenerate the batteries before fighting the last obstacles. Some fights are a bit short in the context of how easy they can be for many classes, though they can cause problems for others. A good example would be Ancient Wyvern, which is definitely one of my favorites, but it would be best if killing her would require two or three beats, each time with a different path taken. A couple of battles are also dependent on the roll of the dice, but I am fully aware that this is not something that happens only in the third part of the trilogy.Going toward the end of review, the second most precious gem of this game is this. Through catacombs, cities and valleys, all the locations we meet and explore during the game are beautifully constructed. Many of them merge with each other in intricate corridors, and in many places we can stand and for a good few minutes to enjoy the view, exactly like the first visit in Irithyll of the Boreal Valley. I would like to mention that in terms of design on the part of the game, some of the locations do not evoke such emotions, however, if you remove opponents only to be able to enjoy eyes, they would also find inner beauty.As we are talking about audio as well, I have to mention the music and sounds that fill the universe of this game. Although I have not experienced music in the normal world, which was an unpleasant surprise for me, the music that plays during the main menu or all bosses significantly compensates for it, when church choirs or massive instruments warm up in our interiors in order to overcome all difficulties.At the end of the review, I would like to say each of its aspects gave me great fun and I hope that I will find the strength to be able to continue my adventures. Certainly I will rate the game on solid 9/10, and this is only when it comes to the base game, cause there are still waiting recommendable DLC content, about which separate reviews do not plan to write due to lack of that much content and trouble to write off them like this, for now."
Positive,"This game is absolutely brilliant. From Dark Souls 2 to 3 is one of the biggest redemptions I have ever seen. DS3 doesen't have that much colour to it. The most you'll see is a few gradients of grey, brown and blue. And yet, the game is stunningly gorgeous. Absolutely beautiful. The combat, just like the first two games is relatively simple, yet very very rewarding. The bosses are some of the best I have ever seen in any game. Especially the DLC bosses, they are on another level. The level design is great, but is missing a bit of interconnectivity, somehting I feel makes a world feel more real. The soundtrack is phenomal. Almost every track has a hint of melancholy to it, and thats what makes it beautiful in my eyes. It's bittersweet. This game is in my opinion the best Dark Souls game and is what truly sells the trilogy. A fantastic masterpiece, with many fantastic aspects. However, there is one glaring issue with this game I cannot ignore. The trophy hunting. When I'm trying to platinum a game, I want it to be a challenge. But not in the way this game does it. If you want all achievments for DS3 you need to put in a tedious amount of hours into farming. It's so annoying and takes so needlessly much of your time. It's such a boring way to drag out the game, and I don't know why they made it this way. Other than that, this game is a fantastic way to send off the trilogy of Dark Souls and is one of my favorite games of all time. Thank you Fromsoft."

Positive,"Before this review starts, I know I screwed up the Dark Souls II review, so I apologized for that one.Dark Souls III is a RPG game created by From Software and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment (formerly Bandai Namco Games). The game sets in interconnected world of Lothric. The whole throughout of the playthrough, you will find similar area from the predecessors, the enemies, the NPC, weapons and armor for long time Dark Souls fan. The lore is still cryptic as usual and you will find the lore understandable if you know what is going on during cutscenes and dialogs. The game is running with Bloodborne engine, which is a great thing. So, let's talk about the changes in this game.The changes for Dark Souls III is somewhat accessible. Accessible as in - upgrading armor is removed, so pretty much you can wear whatever you like (Fashion Souls III). Combat system is great, but power stancing from Dark Souls II is gone. The poise, ugh it's completely obsolete, no matter what you wear. Covenant system seems to have a nice change, where you can change at any time without losing the Covenant.Okay, I am going to do a positive side. I am not sure if it is a fixed difficulty where for the first 11 hours, I feel like this game is easy. Fast forward, holy shit, it can be friggin hard and take 20+ tries to take down the boss. The enemies and bosses do have their own unique attack patterns as usual, so it is not the best to play agressive. I have not played the Sorcerer or Pyromancer yet, but I am assuming they are still powerful but not as overpowered from the predecessors. The item system is improved. The official soundtrack of Dark Souls III, it's a 10 out of 10.  The combat system is extensive, you can change variety of weapons (my favorite weapons so far is Great Scythe and any twinblades). The multiplayer is now better than ever. I can't tell you how much I love the matchmaking options system, where you can put the password so one of your friends don't get summoned by randoms and play offline system. This is the best Dark Souls multiplayer yet. I am done with positive side, now I am going to talk about the negative side. Everytime I beat any boss fight, the bonfire spawns at the boss fight area (how many friggin bonfires are there in total?). I feel like Dark Souls III is being generous to players because it doesn't feel like an actual difficult game from predecessors. I really do understand that people who never played Dark Souls before. I found New Game Plus to be more, easier than playing on your first playthrough. It's disappointing and I wish they could've done something to New Game Plus, like damage modifiers, enemy health pool and usual stuff to make the game difficult. The poise in this game like I said feels nothing to me. The performance issues seems to be minor at times, even hard froze, FPS spikes, that's it. The items in this game can be worthless. The PvP, it's really annoying how people play - as in chasing the invader but getting baited by PvE enemies, the meta can be broken. Newcomers will find it difficult when getting invaded by seasoned players, so it's best to play offline on Matchmaking Options. Forgot to say that the PvP is riddled with cheaters and modders.Man, I got to say that I am still sad that I finished the trilogy (need to get the Season Pass to play the Ashes of Ariandel and The Ringed City). The combat system, lore, bosses and items are great. But performance issues are minor, boss fight area bonfires are unnecessary and poise system is obsolete. This game made me want to come back and sink more hours into the game for builds, PvP and pretty much s h i tposting memes for me (Hail yung maestro). The conclusion was satisfying and I am glad that I finished the Souls series. I will give this game a 9 out of 10, a great solid recommendation for newcomers and veterans alike."
Positive,Best boss fights in the series.
Positive,"When my life is going great and nothing is getting me down, I play this to bring me back down to earth. 10/10 Would be humbled again."
Positive,"Dark Souls III is glorious—that is beyond dispute. Some feel allured by its combat mechanics and challenging nature; I felt drawn in by the clandestine lore, sombre, dying world, soothing voices and, of course, grandiose music.Yet whilst contemplating the wonders of genius loci, I oft strayed and started poring over helpful texts… and therein I discovered the mob. Should one dareth to voice their dissent, their skill would be called in question. In unison, the mob shall mockingly set ablaze any blemish tarnishing perfection. Their painted world must persevere.Truly, requires this game an inordinate amount of ‘skill’? Dark Souls enforceth ways which provoke frustration and rage. It rewardeth thoroughness, keen senses, patience and nimble reactions. Ashes are in the dark, expected to crack open obscure hints most walk past blindly. One must employ mental fortitude and keep training; other than that, no especial ability is to be had. If one doth not compensate for weakness through amassing souls, all depends on dodging and remaining cool-headed.Refined aesthetes who delight in sipping the sorrows of complainers ought to consider some—casters particularly—struggle with the antiquated targeting system. As such, sorceries commonly fly opposite of the locked-upon enemy. Worse yet, focusing upon a draconic torso turneth the world around. For a collector, covenants constitute a nightmare—as do items that vanish if one doth not venture the world in a specific order. And brawlers are ever at risk of being expunged due to nefarious invaders.Dost thou not love pain and suffering? Thou wert warned."
Positive,"Hi, my names Burt and I'm here to clean youThe time is currently 03:14 AMI was sleeping in my bed peacefully, until my specialized intruder alarm woke me up.I've designed it to wake me up from my sleep once someone breaks in to my house, I've also insured it would be hard to detect the detectors.The time has finally come.As the intruder makes his way through the house, he, unaware, walks into a newly formed battlefield.Yes.The moment he walks one step too deep into his final regret, the house becomes a warzone.Boxes. A dozen, nay, nearly a hundred of small storage boxes were attached to the ceiling all throughout the house, almost mimicking the ceiling itself.As the intruder takes a step further, and yet another--The gates of hell open.Every single box, every single one opens and dispenses upon the land the wrath of my automatations, war lords.Smaller boxes. Objects with an irregularity. Tentacles, wielding knives.Before the intruder even begins a reaction, he is showered in a vore hentai scene, a dozen tentacle defense machines begin flailing and cutting him up.He had no where to run, as the floor was crawling with death itself.The time is 6:00 AM.I consider myself a morning man and I rise up.I go down stairs after disabling the Wrath Button.For a moment, I'd forgotten why it was lighted red, as it indicates that Gates Of Hell was activated.As I descended, I see naught but a pool of blood and a hundred tentacle devils scattered throughout the ground, deactivated. Resting.""Ah, now I remember."" I smiled. This is why, despite this being an automated defense, I decided to make a waker along with this.As the intruder was being sliced and diced all night, I had the pleasant symphony being played to me via speakers next to my bed.A direct recording of the man screaming to a hundred boxes slicing him up.What a pleasant night it was, I thought to my self.And thus-My new day begins."

Positive,"Dark Souls 3 Is a magnificent game, just as all the other projects Miyazaki has been a part of. No Dark Souls game has disappointed me in the past, much the opposite actually, so of course my hopes were high when I first played this game. Long story short, no matter how high my hopes were, this game was able to surpass most of them.Dark Souls 3 decides to go back to It's root story telling, like in Demon Souls and Dark Souls 1. The game starts you off with a short premise, a short explanation, targets you need to defeat, and then throws you off in the world. Also going back to It's roots is the magnificent level design. Like always the areas in Dark Souls are all inertwined, rewarding the player for exploring around. Shortcuts that take you hours back, making everything more accessible and forcing you to memorize the areas so seamlessly. This way of universe building really enriches the gameplay experience and Dark Souls 3 without a doubt, delivers In that regard. A couple new classes have been added, and some removed, even bringing back the Pyromancer class, which I very much approve of. The humanity system Is a little different this time around. No Humanity or Human Effigy's but now you must use Embers. Embers will, just as the humanities, grant you the ability to summon/be invaded. Your max HP does not suffer small penalties from each death as It does in Dark Souls 2 but when an Ember is used, your max HP bar grows massively, as well as healing you, as It did in Dark Souls 1, but unlike Dark Souls 1, you may not consume an Ember after already using one. The humanity counter is long gone. (Good)In other words the Embers are the junction of all the good parts about the previous instalment`s ""humanities"". Which i very much approve of. Another notable difference are a couple new stats to upgrade. The most notorious; Luck. Luck does what you'd expect, It boosts your Luck, as a rusted coin would, but permanently. It's good for item drops. The covenants this time around also work much differently than the other games, and in my opinion for the better. In Dark Souls 3 you'll find around the world insignias for covenants, and you may at any given time, equipt which insignia you'd like. Each one of them of course, having their own benefit or draw back, regarding the type of playthrough you'd like to do. Some insignias are very easy to find, others almost impossible on your own without a walkthrough or someone telling you about their existence. Talking about walkthroughs, Dark Souls 3 continues the magical tradition of completely destroying you over and over and over and over. The combat system In Dark Souls 3 Is by far my favorite out of the others. It's much faster and the varietly is so much it can actually get a little overwhelming. This game introduces the weapon arts. Each weapon in this game has a special attack, which will take a little from you mana bar. (Also this game now uses a fucking mana bar which can be restored using a different type of estus. You'll have to balance your estus usage depending on the type of build you're making. The estus for you mana are taken from your max quantity of estus you have. This max number goes up just like in Dark Souls 2 when finding Estus Shards and returning to firelink. They did not go back to the kindle system of Dark Souls 1, so God Bless)The main Hub in Dark Souls 3 is very cool, It's not even close to be as good as Majula but It for sure has it's charm. The music is super relaxing and most of the time you just can't wait to get back and explore around the area. It would always feel great going back and finding a new npc there, or even some items that I didn't see before, even transfer boss souls, etc. But In all honestly it gets a little morbid later on, making it lose its relaxation feel, depending on how you play the game, of course.Oh and speaking of boss souls, unlike the other instalments, you may now transfer boss souls into weapons, shields, spells, miracles and rings from one of the lords of cinder, that stays in the main hub. Which Is a major convenienceBut that's actually the thing I DON'T LIKE about this game;IT'STOOEASYAlthough very excited when I finally was able to beat the game, I was also very fucking surprised by how fast I was able to beat it. I remember that the first time around playing Dark Souls 1 and 2 they took me around a week or two to complete just one playthrough, ending up to be around 60-70 hours of gameplay. I beat Dark Souls 3 In a couple days, ending up with roughly 30 hours of gameplay. All the bosses in this game, on the most part (LOOKING AT YOU WYVERN), are extremely well made, and very relentless, easily one of the best parts about it. But I never felt the same feeling I would always get while playing Dark Souls 1 and 2, the feeling of ""ooooh shit no no not right now what the fuck is this shit?? this is impossible!!?!?!"". Usually when playing Dark Souls 3, you just can't wait for the next boss fight cause you just want to fuck shit up, and yeah that's a great feeling, but the whole feeling of dread and knowing that you're not nearly as strong as you think you are, and that anything can just come and fuck you up at any moment the other games gave me really gave true meaning to those playthroughs. The feeling of overcoming such difficulties in the previous games where much more orgasmic.To compensate a little, the enemies is this game are usually a lot more relentless then the other instalments, even sometimes being a little frustrating, as If their stamina was infinite. All these enemies are dealed with easily If you thrive to attack them with the same aggresiveness that they have, other than staying on the defensive. Another MAJOR issue I had with this game was bonfire placement. There are literally bonfires that are less than 10 seconds apart from each other. I remember finding that very fucking stupid. Also a lot of fan service Is made in this game. The players that are more fond of the first Dark Souls game will most certainely be very much pleased with how the game plays. Areas from the first game come back, familiar faces and armour, many easter eggs and even weapons. To add in on the weapons, Dark Souls 3 decided to continue the dual wielding from Dark Souls 2 but makes It a little easier with putting both weapons for one slot. There are tons of weapons like this so you can go crazy. They also brought back the torch but actually made it as a weapon so instead of using the flaming butterflies and relying on that stupid time limit, just equip it as a weapon and you're more than ready to go. A great improvement. Poison also goes back to it's roots, not drying your whole HP bar  in miliseconds like in Dark Souls 2. No more life gems. And they also decided to do the Dark Souls 2 bonfire mechanic of just lighting them up serve as a checkpoint instead of having to rest at one like in Dark Souls 1, which i appreciate. To end It up, Dark Souls 3 Is an amazing game. Lovers of the previous games will adore the adventure 100% guaranteed. Newcomers to the series, this game will for sure be a great starting point, for its the easiest, most beautiful, less cryptic, of the 3, and I love it!9/10lol jk theres no poise0/10"
Positive,Very good game
Positive,"So I am over 60 years old and fairly new to gaming in general. Jumping from Killing floor (fairly new at that also) to this gives you an idea. Before this it had been many years since playing ANY games(I owned an n64 back in the day). So, I am floored by this game. To me its amazing. I explore around sometimes doing nothing but looking around. I have gone through a fair amount of the story line - again - its all amazing to me. In short I love it. I now am branching to more games, as I find I enjoy playing more then one game at a time. I love the characters of this game, the visuals of it, and have no complaints. Occasionally I run across a very minor glitch of getting stuck or something, but this does not bother me. I do not expect perfection. But I want to emphasize this is very rare. Thank you fromsoft for making such an amazing game"
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is truly a masterpiece imo. let me explain why:- The soundtrack is nothing less than a fucking masterpiece. I even listen to it in my free time.- The gameplay is challenging enough to keep you on your toes and alert at all times.- The combat is a fucking masterpiece, especially the bosses. Boss fights are essentially duets with the boss performing a line and you having to answer appropriately otherwise you die. - With every boss fight you'll be dumbstruck by how amazingly thought out each one is. No two are exactly the same and each one has its unique own twist that forces you to adapt your playstyle accordingly- WAY too many games these days just hold your hand throughout the game, eager to show you all of its nooks and crannies. Dark Souls throws you in with a brief tutorial and a giant ""fuck you"" tattoo'd on your forehead before testing your metal against the first boss of Dark Souls 3 not even 10 minutes into the game.-Dark Souls kind of reminds me of Skyrim. You could be on your 8th playthrough and still find things you never knew even existed. - The lore is a whole new area to master with thousands of npc's and bosses who's stories intertwine in one way or anotherIn short this game is a fucking masterpiece and its well and truly worth the full pricetag. PRAISE THE SUN \[T]/"
Positive,"Just a fuc*ing LEGENDARY game. Very good game, nice lore, nice gameplay. I haven't seen any bugs, yeah, I'm pretty sure there is alot of bugs but I haven't seen them. I played this game something like a 100 real hours.. And I can say it woithout a doubt: This is the BEST GAME EVER!Giant, sometimes almost immortal bosses, detailed open world, good lore. It's PvP there and an exellent combat system (better then For Honor's xD). I killed my FIRST boss after 2 hours of pain and suffering, but it was worth it, all that joy after the kill, I just can't convey it in words. I didn't killed a couple bosses, but I enjoed to play this game, it was alot of good time with a friend and some random people, it was a good time... At last I want to advise you to buy this masterpiece. If you have some friend or several friends, so you just MUST buy and play this game at least 20 hours. I want to warn that it's a lot of farm at the game, and don't take mage or pyromancer for the first time because it's too easy..| Enjoy this game just like I did :)"
Positive,"Let me first explain basics of Souls games. Every time you die, you lose all your souls(DS currency). If you go back to same location where you died you can collect your souls, but if you die again before collecting souls you will lose them forever. You can use those souls to level up and then upgrade stats, to buy stuff, etc. You can obtain souls by killing enemies, or collecting souls through items. To understand story you must read carefully descriptions of items, listen to dialogues etc.In this game you can play melee, you can cast magic or miracles, all depends on how you wish to play. You need to worry about your equip load so you don't roll slowly or move slowly. There are bunch of weapon classes, and bunch of weapons. Swords, greatswords, ultra greatswords, axes, whips, shields, daggers, etc. Many miracles and sorceries too.Multiplayer works like this. You can invade the world of other player with some special items, and there you can kill them while they are playing through game. You can play co-op with another players, or phantoms. You can also post red sign on the floor and if someone calls you, you can duel with them.- Really good  boss fights, especially Ringed City DLC, but main games has good ones too- A lot of weapons have special skill that can be activated with left hand strong attack while 2 handing I think(didn't use it much).- Lore is okay, it's not super interesting, but it's pretty big. There are references to the first game, but also a lot of new stuff. It is good overall.- Ringed City DLC is amazing, with awesome boss fights and tells pretty good story, that is also very tragic. It is good conclusion to the end of Souls series.- Poise. In first game poise was working properly. You had to have certain poise number to be able to take 1,2,3 hits from certain class of weapons without getting staggered. There is poise here too, but it only works in special situations. As I understood, poise works only during your attack. And because poise doesn't work when you are getting hit, this means that stunlocking opponent is quite easy if you hit him. That's one of the reasons why straightswords are strongest class in the game. You can succefully land few hits in the row by easily stunning opponent while just smashing your light attack key/button. - Ability to summon 3 phantoms, making this game absolutelly easy for players who rely on others. I always disliked players who co-op first time playing Dark Souls. This game is supposed to test your skill, if you can't beat it alone, just don't play it. That's my opinion at least. I don't mind co-op after first time. Sure, people can play however they want, but I've never seen more bad players in Souls games than in this one. Every 5 mins someone asks in forum for help for bossfight. This is also horrible for invasions. I always loved invasions, but in this part, they are terrible. I am not sure what the hell is wrong with Dark Souls community in this part, but in 9 of 10 cases when you invade you will get ganked. And it's usually at least 2 phantoms. However in this part, when you invade you can heal too, but guess what, you get half of estus flasks that you should have, while host has same amount. Everyone can heal, and because of that everyone does heal. You are maybe thinking, well they were always healers in Dark Souls, but I was able to punish healing. Wrong. Here it's hard to do that. And why is that? Well cause you can heal too fast and cause you can heal while walking. Aside from gangking invasions, where you get small amount of souls if you kill host, duels are not much better either. You can play in arena, where is not allowed to heal, but still even there, it all comes to who lands first hit, and after you land it, you will mostly drain at least 50% of opponent health. It's more about output damage than about skill involved. There is also failed backstab animation sometimes, where opponent rolls or runs just before you backstab him, but still animations occurs making you vunerable at that moment. - Multiplayer lag. First I thought that maybe I am having issues with my internet. But nope. I checked youtube videos, everyone has these issues. Those are in-game issues. And what exactly I mean by that. Basically in a lot of cases when you attack opponent and attack animation doesn't even land on opponent you will hit him, or opposite. If you let's say hit 20 cm next to opponent you will probably hit him. It's like some additional phantom rage. This is of course most noticeable with straghtswords. They have range like greatswords, great for catching opponent after roll, and for attacking opponent while keeping distance too.  - World is really boring imo, besides Ringed City DLC, but to get to Ringed City you gotta beat Painted World of Ariandel and that DLC is really boring Dark Souls 3 is an okay Dark Souls game. It has great bossfights, good lore and amazing dlc Ringed City however world is really boring imo. Also I only recommend playing this game, if you have played first game, because it is necessary to understand lore. Pretty good game overall.Note: This explains how I rate games in my reviews. https://imgur.com/gallery/z9ZjA47"

Positive,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character, and started playing, but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
Positive,This game is a game.
Positive,This Game Is Hard But i Love It !!
Positive,"Souls 3 was my first souls game. It took me some 3 hours, and 20-30 tries to beat the Gundyr, the first boss. The pure exhilaration of that final, triumphant victory hooked me for over 2 years, long after I beat the game and DLC's. I incredibly highly recommend the game to all who can afford it. Sadly nowadays the Online playerbase is mostly quiet aside from a few popular invasion areas/hard boss fights.If you strive for a challenge, this is one of the games. Ashen One, Be sure to bring more souls..."
Positive,"A very rewarding yet unforgiving game, set in a dark fantasy world. Dark Souls 3 is or not one of the best Action RPGs out there. Having a lore-rich interconnected semi-open world, the game shows how it should be at its best. Fun boss fights, good soundtrack, beautiful environment, fun pvp, high replay value, and satisfaction from your own success are one of the many elements that this game has.10/10 buy it when whether its on sale or not. You will have your money's worth."
Positive,"i was quite shocked during my first playthrough when i somehow managed to trigger a hidden cutscene where this npc, i think his name was ringfinger leonhard? leans over out of nowhere and kisses you on the mouth with tongue. i smiled really wide when that happened and thought that this had to be one of the most awesome games ever and i turned out to be right. well done and thank you fromsoftware"
Positive,Absolutely enjoyed....wanna tell about the whole game but imma lazy guy :).....as the last game of the series it ended up perfectly..loved everything...❤only disappointment is there is no free cam..cant take cool screenshots like wide angled ones..that's the only thing i dont like...although it would be a big APPLE cheese if the free cam was here isnt it XD...anyway totally worth for the price...so just grab it if u havent already...
Positive,"Excellent game , difficulty on point , multiple ending available , A huge world to explore Dark souls is known as a game to make gamers suffer and it won't change in the third one I would recommend that game only for hardcore gamers who want some challenge (better with co-op)"
Positive,"If the first Dark Souls depicted a world gracefully drifting towards the apocalypse, Dark Souls 3 shows one on a spiraling, feverish descent directly into it. It’s a fierce and punishing behemoth that dares you to take a step forward before knocking you back, again and again and again. But with a bleak, yet beautiful world that’s enthralling to explore and packed with secrets to find, I always felt compelled to come back, eager for that familiar thrill of overcoming even the most exacting challenges.Dark Souls 3 does suffer from occasional framerate dips and a few underwhelming boss fights, but beyond that, its epic scale, aggressive obstacles, and rich development of existing lore make it the grandest and fiercest Dark Souls adventure yet."
Positive,undertale for chads
Positive,embrace the darkness and emptiness
Positive,"If you're interested in Dark Souls, I recommend playing the first game first. Even though the remaster of the first game has it detractors, it runs wonderfully on both console and PC so please do not let it hold you back. DS3 has many callbacks to the first game, which made it much more enjoyable. This game does not need another positive review, but I'm going to throw my 2 cents in anyways even almost 3 years after release. Boss design is much improved over the first game. The bosses are hard, colorful and much more flashy on screen. Each boss really feels unique with no reskins like the first game (which had 3 demon bosses). I am not that good at these types of games, so I had plenty of time to appreciate each boss :)  The art and environment are stunning and even the normal mobs have great detail. The only place that FROM seemed to have regressed since the first game is level design. It is so much better in the first game. This game, although more visually beautiful has a much more linear design, and the worlds do not feel as connected. Great game, and a great time to play it with Sekiro coming out this March."
Positive,"so yeah. this game? pretty good. oh yeah, you'll get a lot of enjoyment outta this one buddy lemme tell ya. oh this game? DARK SOULS III? good one, that's a good one indeed. a banger, the kids say. this game gives you one helluva ride. helluva boss? no, not that. a helluva time, thats what you'll get with this one. the bosses in this game are pretty sick too. a little easy, a little hard, no in the middle, no in the far. the far left? no, this game is more like the progressive right. other than that, this game? enjoyable. you'll get a lot of enjoyment outta this bad boy. if you see it on sale, you should buy it. if not on sale, then you should still buy it. there's this one boss and he goes ""kabloom."" yeaahh that'll show them. it'll show them that Anyways uhm... I bought a whole bunch of shungite, rocks, do you know what shungite is? Anybody know what shungite is. No, no Suge Knight, I think hes locked up in prison. Talking shungite. Anyways, its a 2 billion year old like rock, stone that protects against frequencies and unwanted frequencies that may be traveling in the air. So thats my story. I bought a whole bunch of stuff, put them around the la casa. Little pyramids. Stuff like that."

Positive,Hard but Great :P
Positive,"Just beaten it for the first time after beating Dark Souls 1 once and Elden Ring like 15+ times. Dark Souls 3 is now my favorite game in the series. Like sure a lot of bosses in the first half aren't that fun with a few exceptions like the abyss watchers, but the second half of the game is worth going through aldritch and the irithyll dungeon 100%. Dragonslayer armor, Abyss Watchers and Soul of Cinder are some of the best fights in the series and the only two fights that compare in elden ring are Maliketh and Godfrey.My main criticism is that because the game is so linear, you can't really get your build together quickly like you can in Elden Ring or Dark Souls 1. Depending on how you wann play, the game might just say ""beat half the game before you can use what you want"" and then you can't even play a different build and change it later, because that fails one npcs questline. So if you want to complete that, you can't respec and her quest is only complete after the second to last boss. For the first Playthrough I'd recommend a quality build where you level dexterity and strength equally. You will meet the stat requirements for a lot of weapons so you can just try anything out to see what you like.and use the ""talk"" option when talking to NPCs. They will usually explain important gameplay features and lore to you.anyways, 8/10 game. The first half is a bit underwhelming but consider it warmup for the second half that is insanely hard, but also where the real fun is found.I also look forward to trying the DLCs, which are just as good as the main game from what I've heard."
Positive,"EDIT: Ever since posting this, the situation was mostly handled by FROM. Updating the review to positive.That single moment when a guy is livestreaming himself hacking and he still doesn't get banned, meanwhile thousands of innocent people get banned because they got hit by his weapon with hacked stats, great job devs, this is why gaming is going to shit:FIX YOUR FUCKING GAME FROM!!  The guy known as Malcom Reynolds has got close to 1000 people banned in his 6 hour hacking livestream yesterday and is now back, livestreaming again. Still no update from the developers, thousands of customers are getting  their saves ruined, stats reset, inventories deleted and we get no official answer...  Now there's copycats for Malcom using similar cheats, some are even more effective than the original, they are also livestreaming, number of people affected is over 2000 right now. From what I've heard FROM staff is on vacation because of Golden Week in Japan, they will return in 4 days, really great moment to take a vacation. If they don't address this when they return the online is probably gonna die out in a matter of weeks. Day 4 of the hackfest and still no official response from the developers, not even an apology or deadline for a fix. Only one forum moderator said he was ""looking into it"". Malcom and his copy cats have continued to cheat this morning and the end doesn't seem to be in sight as the developers seem to just not give a fuck, they're enjoying their vacation while people who paid for their game are getting banned left and right.This has also attracted some media attention as Gameranx posted an article about it this morning: http://gameranx.com/updates/id/50164/article/meet-malcolm-reynolds-dark-souls-3-hacker/ Day 5, still no update from the developers on fixing this situation via an update or hotfix. There's less reports of Malcom but the copy cats seem to have spread to other areas of the game, reports keep coming in on the community hub of hacker encounters. Only fix right now is to backup your save and wait for FROM to come back from their holidays...One of the recent hacker reports: http://steamcommunity.com/app/374320/discussions/0/357285398693846473/ FROM should be coming out of their holidays today so we should receive an official announcement in the next 24 hours. It's been over a week since the game became infested with hackers and we haven't had a single official word from the devs.I have been receiving alot of hate for this review, seems this thing has split the DS3 community between ppl who won't take shit from any developer and demand to be treated fairly and the ppl who would defend the game and FROM no matter what and resort to insults and name calling.If you have a normal response with evidence and strong arguments vs my review then go ahead and post. If you start posting insults and name calling then I will delete your posts, please keep it civil. It has now been ONE WEEK since the softbanning problem came up and still no official answer from the developers. There's still a stickied post about the 1.06 patch which was supposed to come out on April 27th, even tho today is May 8th and we've got no patch, they didn't even bother to update the sticky post...Their holidays are over, they have ignored the playerbase for over a week and there doesn't seem to be an end in sight.I will stop updating daily since this issue seems to take forever to get resolved, I will try posting a small update every few days and will update my review once this is fixed, if FROM ever fixes it."

Positive,"Let me start of by saying, I tried Dark Souls 2 ages ago and I didn't like it at all.So now during the winter sale I decided to give the Dark souls series another shot, so I ended up buying this gem right here.I played for 2 hours, then said to myself : Is this really a game I can play? (I struggled a bit with the first boss, and struggled even more in the next area I got sent too)However I ended  up refunding the game.   WHICH WAS THE DUMBEST THING I COULD'VE DONEAfter the refund I obviously uninstalled the game, but after an hour or so, I wanted  more, alot moreAs I said earlier, I haven't played any Dark souls games so I can't relate to what they are like however.. The bosses in Dark souls 3 starts out by being mediocre, the hardest part is by far to get to the bosses.halfway through or so the bosses starts to become extremly effin interesting and the shit is difficult, really took a 180 and ramped up like nothing seen before. Especially the Namless one.. Tough one, once I finished the game, I ended up hunting a few achievements, then i set sail into NG+ and instead of making a brand new character I respecced my character completely went from being a warrior to a pyromancer, Going from a Warrior to Pyromancer was a major turn aswell, Playing the pyromancer is so different to being a melee character, a completely different way to play.Or simply just beat the game as your starting class or completely switch mid game, completely possible.. The game is so free in that sense, you can do whatever you want.. (well almost)Best game I've ever played, the story was absolutely amazing aswell I rate it  9/10"

Positive,"Game is amazingly beautiful with the different areas.  The combat is hard as one would expect in dark souls game.  I do love the enemy variety.  The bosses range from kind of easy to absolutely extremely horrific in difficulty, but that is what makes it exciting .  You never know if you come across a boss that will devastate you or be not so bad.  I am working slowly through the game after restarting because i had forgotten the mechanics of the game.  Having a good time and feeling very excited when i finally beat a very difficult boss.The game runs well and has no issues in that area for me.  Definitely a must play for souls players.  I will update once I have finished the game and Dlcs.  So far, I do suggest this highly to any souls or souls like players looking for a nice challenge."

Positive,"After playing through Dark Souls 1, my co-worker gifted me Dark Souls 3, this time, I was very adamant on not being guided, though, and just given hints/tips to not ruin any NPC Side-Quests, which can be quite obscure. I've also beaten every single boss completely solo. I feel like Dark Souls 3 improves upon a lot of the aspects of the original, and I quite enjoyed it, even more than the first one. There's some very cool weapons, and tough as nails Boss Fights. My favorite one has to have been the Twin Princes, which I felt, was very satisfying to master, and I felt incredibly good after being them. I'm planning on playing through this game more in the future, trying out different builds and hopefully buying Dark Souls 2 as well soon.8/10"
Positive,"Another Dark Souls and another 140+ hours gone. Here is my review broken up in different parts:As a PC port: pretty good, although I did experience BSOD multiple times. I hardly ever get this on other higher end games, including past DS games, so I suspect that this game was not 100% optimized for pc. Overall, it played well and I was able to get 4K, 60fps pretty easily. As a game: I absolutely recommend this game to anyone interested in action, adventure, RPGs, or metroidvania type games. It's totally good, often intense, and very engaging. I think the fighting mechanics are top-notch and there's so much variety in bosses, enemies, weapons that you can be entertained for a very long time. Whether you get it on sale or not, you won't be disappointed. It's absolutely worth the money. As a Dark Souls game: This is supposedly the last in the Souls series. I'd say overall it's the best, but only marginally. In fact, the innovation from 1 to 2 and 2 to 3 is pretty lacking. Don't expect a major shakeup in the DS formula. This is both good and bad for veterans of the series. It's pretty much the same game you played before, maybe with a few QOL improvements, upgraded graphics, and marginally better play mechanics. Unfortunately, they seemed to have streamlined the formula to the point where the only good weapons are swords and done away with DS2 dual wield function (which wasn't great, but at least it was there). So, in total, this is probably the best DS but honestly not that much of an evolution over the series. Criticism and praise: having played the series back to back in a relatively short time span, I can say that what makes DS great isn't really the fighting or the lore but the levels. The levels and the level design are a feature all to themselves. The masterful design and detail that made DS1 so great and was lacking in DS2 is back in full force in DS3. I absolutely love when levels open up with interesting nooks and crannies and eventually double back on to themselves with clever shortcuts and secret passages that make your progression worth the danger and risk. DS3 is at its finest in these moments. Also, the detail given to each level, all the little features that you can interact with (i.e., break) are excellent and give the levels a life of their own. Some levels in this game are done better than others, but overall all they are beautiful and fun to play through. I would have preferred a little bit more variety (you play through no less than 4 different graveyards) and maybe some totally different locations from past games (just like the past 2, you visit churches, castles, a swamp, and a run down village) but I guess that is what DS is about. The worst criticism I have with this game is that there is a very thin story that I found uninteresting and uninspired. Yes, DS has always been about digging deep to learn the lore and finding story details sprinkled in item descriptions or cryptic dialogue, but you'd think by the 3rd entry, they'd at least be able to build on the past games to give some semblance of a coherent story. That's just not the case here. In fact, it got to the point where I was running from boss to boss not knowing, or even caring, who they were are why I was doing this. Hell, I don't even know why I was killing most of the bosses in the game. Was it to the light the fire at the end? Was it to stop a curse? I still don't know. It's a shame that they couldn't build on what happened in the past games to make a story that answers all the questions and gives some finality to the series. Instead, you basically end this game just like you did with the other two. Again, this is a good port, a good game, and a good DS game. I just wish they did a lot more than make a Dark Souls 3.0, because that is what it feels like."
Positive,"+Good art design. Cool lore.+Polished combat. More forgiving than previous ones but harder to catch up with it because it is faster. +There are many ways to make the game easier for you, from usable items to different builds, magic and weapons.+Good item, armor and weapon variety.+Smart level design, which encourages you to try different things gameplay-wise. It also uses visual story-telling, so most of the things don't look out of place. (unless it is designed to be)+Good enemy variety.+Pretty graphics and animations.o The story is kinda obscure like older games. Which certainly gives it a charm.o It is easy to miss some NPC interactions. But they add replayability.o PVP and Co-op is a little too disconnected to the main game. Covenant rewards are pretty hard to get and not that cool. Some enemies and bosses are too easy with co-op even though some of them react accordingly with more AoE attacks. But they're still features and it's fun to play with people.o The dodge is powerful so it helps with faster builds while making slower builds relatively worse.o Shields are not good.- Dodge is too powerful for the PVP. It is mostly a shit show. It becomes too chaotic and invasions can take forever.- Armor is mostly fashion. Heavy armor does not justify dmg absorption. Poise is not affected by armor anymore(at least not enough it makes any difference). Especially when rolling is this strong. Shields are useless, so some builds are not good as they used to be. There was some gameplay value in the previous games which is not here anymore.- There are places where the game feels inconsistent. A weak looking enemy not staggering when hit while a big guy can't stand against you. A mob spamming his best move. AI pathfinding freaking out. To be fair the game is about observing the enemy before acting so it does not affect the gameplay horribly.- Some bosses are either too weak and/or don't feel special.- Mouse support is not that good but they tried.This game is not perfect but it is perfect with its flaws. It is aware of itself and does not pretend to be something it is not. The PVP and Co-op are not that good but you have to go out of your way to use them anyway. The armors are bad, but it is not like you can upgrade them like in DS1, they don't make you feel like armor is that important. Those bosses who don't feel special are not really special anyway. They're dudes who happened to be in your way. This game is a complete experience, this game is difficult, it does not hold your hand and it becomes way easier when you figure it out like every game should be. It is never unfair, it is either you or your character not suited for that part of the game. Use your items, upgrade your items and abuse the systems of the game. The game will not feel cheated if you abuse it as it tries to abuse you constantly. Play it at your pace, don't hit your head against the wall, try to go around it. And if you feel like you don't want to find another way, you can still do it your way but it might be way harder. It is okay to be upset if things don't work out, but if you don't like to get upset at times, there won't be any relief when you beat the challenge. So get ready for that.DLC REVIEWS:-Ashes Of Ariandel:  Short but fun. It is worth it but does not cut it when it comes to surprising you. It has 2 nice bosses, but nothing really new. Mostly some generic enemies and a beautiful map. The painting has its own story, but it is not as interesting as the rest of the game because it feels disconnected.-The Ringed City: This DLC would be really good if it was not bullshit level hard. High HP and DMG enemies all around. One of the bosses (the optional one) is like something from WoW or a JRPG. It takes a while to bring him down as he can pretty much one shot kill you instantly. Other than that, it is pretty cool because it keeps on giving. It surprises you with traps that you have never seen in Souls series before. It shows you bits of unseen lore about the order of the Dark Souls universe. The Dark Souls series end. But these games are never about when you get there anyway. It's always the climb."
Positive,There is beauty in death
Positive,I hate this game
Positive,"Sprawling level design, thrilling combat, and masterful indirect storytelling make Dark Souls 3 the best Dark Souls yet!"
Positive,"The game is good however you look at it. The engine is the newest of all Souls games (based on Bloodborne's), graphics, music, environments, everything is top-notch. Bear in mind that because of the said engine combat is faster paced compared to Souls 1 and 2. While there are still shields and they are viable the emphasis this time around is on rolling and dodging. (I haven't played with a shield so I cannot tell with confidence how good is the shield play.) The story is decent but most importantly it puts an end to the saga in a satisfying way while it manages to keep the world fresh by adding more lore and mythology at the same time. Make sure you play both DLCs as they are crucial to some of the deeper lore that's been seeded way back into the intro movie of the original Dark Souls.PvP is fine but with the poise debacle it's ruined for me. Poise was a good mechanic, alas FromSoftware couldn't balance it so they turned it off completely. It's a shame really. Covenants are very fun this time around, probably the best implementation of all three games.If you've played at least Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 3 is must."

Positive,"Ever since I got my hands on Dark Souls 3 I was simply transfixed. All of my waking hours have been spent in an endless pursuit of souls to further grow my collection of fancy weapons, and despite praising the Sun I don't remember the last time I've seen it. I have become something alike the hollows that roam the land, utterly consumed by Dark Souls 3.At this point its fairly well known that Dark Souls 3 is good, but I don't think simply 'good' does it justice given that I am currently thinking long and hard on whether Dark Souls 1 is still my favorite game of all time. So what exactly makes Dark Souls 3 so compelling, and how does it match up against the entirety of the extended Souls family?The first thing one will notice with Dark Souls 3 is that its an evolution of all the concepts found in previous games, with the biggest influence coming from Bloodborne, what with the numerous dilapidated hamlets, dirty villagers driven mad by things far beyond their understanding, and a constant oppressive aura that spreads throughout the majority of locations. The combat is another good example as its much, much faster than what you might find in Dark Souls 1 and 2, while still retaining that slow, methodical pace we've all come to love about the Souls series.Naturally, since we as the players get better character handling, faster dodge-rolling, and overall superior combat mechanics, the monsters get their own set of upgrades as well. They are far more aggressive than in previous games, able to chain multiple attacks in order to punish you for expending your stamina, and most importantly, a fair bit smarter than the bunch that precedes them, though they still have issues grasping the concept of doors.As for the encounter design, I believe Dark Souls 2's catch phrase fits here rather well: Prepare to die! After seeing players stomp all over their games for a couple of years now, FromSoftware have stopped pulling punches, and have designed enemies and locations in such a way that they will often punish the unwary traveler, while simultaneously greatly rewarding those that think outside of the box.While Dark Souls 3 may be a brutal mistress, it does love you, so almost every time it horrifically murders you, throws you off a cliff, or has rats gnaw on your kneecaps, it also gives you a bonfire shortly afterwards, both as an apology, and as a reward for a battle well fought. The end result of this sort of level design is that I never felt pissed off after dying, instead I would keep all of my anger bottled up within me for the 30 seconds it took to run back to where I was, promptly go medieval on whoever killed me, die again because I was reckless, and then finally decide to try and approach the situation like a sane person.But perhaps the best encounter-related feature of Dark Souls 3 is that the dreaded puzzle bosses, ie. bosses that require you to deal with secondary mechanics besides simply fighting them, are for once interactive, and most importantly, fun to do. My favorite example of this is a boss fight that occurs relatively early in the game against a Wizard that is weak on his own, but is capable of spawning powerful illusions from the crystals he throws around everywhere. Instead of simply smashing his face in like you would with Pinwheel from Dark Souls 1, you will need to actually deal with the crystals by choosing on the fly which ones to destroy, and which ones to ignore as you endlessly pursue a boss that likes to run away and laugh at you. The final thing I want to mention is the exploration as the open-ended levels from Dark Souls 1 and Bloodborne are back with a vengeance. There are secrets and side-areas almost everywhere, so much so that despite considering myself an obsessively thorough explorer I managed to completely miss one boss, a fact that a friend who never even touched Dark Souls 3 pointed out to me when he noticed a hillside path I managed to completely gloss over. Worst of all for my sanity, I've found exactly one secret wall, which is just enough to let me know that they exist, and that I've probably missed dozens!There is so much more I want to talk about, but this review is already running long, so allow me to simply end with this: After playing Dark Souls 3 non-stop for the past week, the only thing I am currently looking forward to is playing even more of it. After all, I have to go back and beat the living daylight out of the damn knight that has managed to best me over a dozen times now, because as everyone knows, if you don't beat someone at first, you keep throwing bodies at them until you do!If you're interested in a more detailed review, I welcome you to either check out the written version I've done:http://www.gamesear.com/reviews/dark-souls-3-detailed-review-from-a-long-time-fanOr the video review that backs everything up with some pretty pictures:"
Positive,"I'm a true gamer now.In all honesty, I confusingly enjoyed this game with a love/hate relationship, playing this game was enjoyably difficult but each death made me want to progress further to beat the game. It pushed me to do better the next time, which this game tests the patience of only few people. I picked this game up mid last year, played and defeated Gundyr, and then I just couldn't bring myself to challenge anymore. I dropped it and didn't pick it up again til 4 days ago from writing this review and I am happy that I did. The game in short is about the protagonist finding and returning the five lords of cinder to link the flame which basically means the player encounters various enemies and bosses throughout the game with different playstyles, abilities etc. The game is gorgeous and the cinematics are great to watch. Some bosses are definitely better than others design and control wise since some enemies are boring or too easy like Wyvern, Deacons or feel a bit broken like Two princes, minibosses.The game is enjoyable and the progression feels very player based allowing them to combo and upgrade to their preference with armor, weapons and upgrading the player with souls. It feels very open compared to other video games but this game is both very difficult and easy. The game feels like it has too many bonfires, like when defeating dragonslayer, there is a bonfire just ahead in sight making it quite pointless and unneeded to have that many at times. I feel that the game slowly becomes easier because the player is more experienced with the gameworld and enemies, their reactions and character behaviour to weapons and armor. The game is difficult but the improvement of the player makes the game easier. This doesn't however cover all since bosses like nameless knight and pontiff sulvyvahn will give difficulty no matter what (in my opinion).In conclusion, this game could go through a few tweaks since hitboxes seem a little off and walls need to act like walls rather than enemies being able to stick their spear or sword through and hit me. I also feel like the frost knight miniboss is very overpowered and the only way to defeat him is by cheesing the elevator or having him stuck on the staircase. The game is enjoyable and the lore is very indepth, the game I feel is very balanced but remove a few bonfires since it takes away how some parts are easy and the game looks great. Really enjoyable first souls game and I hope to pick up the others soon to play and experience them!8/10"
Positive,As expected this is a very good game.  While it doesn't have the inner connectivity of the levels like in Dark Souls 1 I feel that in almost every other metric it is a better game.  Hopefully Dark Souls 4 comes out at some point.
Positive,makes my balls create more semen
Positive,One of the best!
Positive,Dark Souls III is the Dark Souls of Dark Souls games. I am kind of disappointed in the fact that this doesn't have DOOM Eternal combat but I guess not every game on earth can have DOOM Eternal combat.
Positive,"Treasure ahead, therefore try jumping.You died."
Positive,"Prithee, be careful."
Positive,"I lost my souls virginity in 2015 when I spent the night at a friends house and he had just finished his first SL1 run of DS1 and he wanted to show me the game. I was hesitant, just being a human being in high school, everyone has heard of Dark Souls and its ridiculously high skill floor that will punish anyone unable to take a few poundings for the sake of growth. I gave it a whirl, and he told me to play as a knight, because it would be the easiest if I was new to the game, later experience has told me that he was either full of it or genuinely had no idea what he was talking about. A few years later, I went home for winter break my first year of college, and one of my best friends had gotten really into DS3 and offered to lead me through the game in co-op. I had very little experience in soulsbourne games and playing in co-op seemed like the way to go so I could at least try to have some fun. About 90 hours later, Dark Souls 3 is one of my favorite games of all time, easily in the top 10 along with the original Jak and Daxter game, Dishonored, and Dark Souls 1 as of late. This game was my first in-depth souls experience, so I'm very familiar with it and I have a fairly easy time playing it, which leads me to feel that this is the easiest of the 3 DS games. Whether that is truly the case or not, I absolutely love this game. As of writing this I have almost 450 hours (most of which were spent grinding for the sake of hitting max soul level) and I have completed the game 8 times, including an SL1 playthrough that absolutely obliterated my pooper. Some of my favorite parts of this game:I have four different favorite bosses, each with a different category. Nameless King for challenge because Midir just makes me sad; also he has one of the best boss fight songs. Yhorm is probably my favorite boss in terms of the lore of his plight; I feel genuine sadness when following Siegward's quest, and I really appreciate it. Conceptually, the Watchers of the Abyss are my favorite boss (as well as exceptional boss music), Artorias from DS1 is such a cool idea, and the fact that this boss is an homage and continuation of Artorias is very nice and well done in my opinion. My favorite boss to actually fight is The Dancer; the fight seems to balance all of the skills you've acquired throughout the game, and she's just dang fun to fight. My favorite environment in the game is Farron Keep; Calling back to Artorias, the Wolf Covenant is located here and the whole feel of the area is eerie and memorable."
Positive,Born too late to explore the earthBorn too early to explore the universeBorn exactly the right time to play this masterpiece...
Positive,"it feels like saying goodbye to a dear friend, I hate it."
Positive,"*favourite game of 2010-2020*This game made me feel like i was exploring a complete universe. Not complete as in ""every person walking around the main hub world is loudly complaining about the next big boss I have to go kill but only after obtaining the next item found in the chest and the weapon skill from the old man"" blah blah blah blah. Not complete in the way that there are 500 NPC's and they all live in houses that contain the exact same dinner table, bedside table and family dog. Dark Souls 3 says FUCK YOU to that kind of game play and it plops you down in Sam Raimi's ARMY OF DARKNESS (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHZQEtG8xYo).  While games like Skyrim and Witcher 3 are ""huge"", they can break immersion with issues like strange enemy placement, before-mentioned chatty NPCs everywhere, and these cut-and-paste assets littering the world. Here are my PRO/CONS for all of  the TL:DRsPROS-EXTREMELY ATMOSPHERIC WORLD. Beautiful.-Amazing enemy/boss mechanics and design. (mini pro: Horror fans like should delight as well)-Clean, clean, clean gameplay. Crisp hit boxes. Don't swing a large sword in a little hallway, just like in real life. ""oh but muh gameplay"" yeah but MY REALISM IS SUSTAINED.-Good RPGness. Truly infinite ways to approach the world and bosses. Want to role play as an elegant woman who fights with a rapier, but after dying many times adopts a more sinister guise as a hollowed phantom who fights with a sytche? Want to play as a barbarian who discovers the basic magical arts of the flame, and then grows into a strong, passionate pyromancer who helps others a WARRIOR OF THE SUNLIGHT (a PVP/PVE covenent)? Want to play as an Old Wizard/Witch who wants to explore the arcane arts by whatever means necessary? Want to play as an actual White Knight, protecting your online PVP waifus? Want to just say fuck it, and LITERALLY roleplay as Guts from Berserk with his actual sword? Yeah you can do that.-Fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun PVP/Co-op-Difficulty can be offset by summoning people online for bossesCons:-This game demands your attention, and if people don't approach it with an adaptive mindset then it is ""HARD GAME HARD GAME HARD GAME TOO HARD WHERE IS EASY MODE SHIT GAME"".  Yeah, if you are sitting at your rig at 2:00 taking a couple of bong rips, drinking whatever weird IPA, YEAH, maybe you might die a couple times if you DON'T EVER ADJUST YOUR GAME PLAY. Same token: If you approach Dark Souls 3 the way you would approach a boss in baby games like Ocarina of Time (that is to say, acting like you'll be able to survive long to find the bosses super exploitable weakness) yeah, then you'll get squashed like spaghetti.-Overrated difficulty (THIS IS MY REVIEW AND THIS IS WHAT I THINK). When people are speed running this game with guitar hero controllers, guess what:::you are approaching the game wrong if you can't beat it. The first boss of BOTW I approached (i think it was the camel? the boss killed me with a billion lasers? I had like 4 hearts and died about 15+ times, WHERE IS THE OUTRAGE FOR THAT? If 12 year olds can beat breath of the wild, you can beat a dark souls game. Nothing in this game is really that hard if you keep levelling up and you try a simple build. I have made about 5 characters and the game gets easier each time. -can't marry the firekeeper(I would recommend playing dark souls remastered AFTER dark souls 3. It is nice this way.)"
Positive,put bloodborne on pc
Positive,"I like the game, there is no denying that, especially since I’m close to finishing my fourth playthorugh, yet I can’t be ignorant just because of that. The greatness of every component that makes Dark Souls III is crippled by its poor technical execution and I’m afraid this is a result of the fans’ and journalists’ attitude towards the game. Praising without questioning has given the developers a free pass with the end result being countless bugs and problems that went unfixed throughout an entire series making their way into its finale.                Dark Souls III is a good game that combines most of the great elements of its predecessors into one final blow. The impact of the finale is subject to each gamer perception towards the series. In my case, I said that the best way to improve on the series is to find the balance between its two predecessors while focusing on fixing the problems of the past and Dark Souls III did only half of that. How important each half is? I guess the time spent playing the game can be interpreted as an answer to that.Pros:+ Impressive artistic design+ Epic soundtrack+ Mysterious and captivating story+ Good level design+ Refined combat system+ Greatest roster of boss battles and the best difficulty curve in the series+ Atmospheric+ Good itemization+ Fun PvPCons:- Bugs from the previous games made it into this one with new additions- Some issues with mouse & keyboard- Linear world design with a few exceptions- Perhaps too much fan service- The graphics quality and graphics related problems- Little incentive to continue with NG+ and onwards- Weapons balance issues due to Poise stat having no effect- The lack of proper support for the Online component- Annoying lag in Online playRead the full review at:http://thegameslashers.blogspot.ro/2016/05/dark-souls-iii-review.html"

Positive,"This is one of those games that you'll always remember even after playing it several times. Yes, is that good enough. You feel like a fly against huge bosses that will rip you apart. To be fair, you can summon warriors from other worlds (another player) and make the game easier, but hey I didn't summon any player in my world, I'm a little crazy... I like to help people kill their bosses and get extra souls so I can level up.The graphics of this game are nice, but what really is amazing are the locations, such beauty and gorgeous landscapes. The story isn't a strong point, you have to read a lot about item descriptions, but the gameplay is what is most important in this game and the ability to play new game plus.I give this game 5/5, really loved playing it and getting all the achievements."
Positive,"Ashen One,You possibly might die around hundred times, but that won't break your spirit to kick that angry boss face-off.

Positive,"Update - This is by far the best  Souls game compared to any ohter such games that FromSoft has made. My ranking goes as follows :-Dark Souls 3 >> Bloodborne > Dark Souls 1 > Sekiro > Elden Ring > Demon Souls > Dark Souls 2I recently finished Bloodborne, and it comes very close to Dark Souls , but it is not euql  to it, because of just one thing- non-replenishable health regen items . I mean, I want to enjoy the boss battle, not take a detour to farm for   Blood Vials  to heal myself. The only drawback of Dark Souls 3 is the run up to the boss, which is somewhat tedious and time taking. I love the game so much that despite having completed the game on PC sometime in 2017. I bought the game again for my newly purchased PS5. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Review as on 2017 :-This was my First ever Souls game.On killing the first enemy(not the boss),I kind of felt,""Is this the game that seemed to be so difficult.""Upon encountering the first boss,""This game was not meant for me.""Now,having beaten this game,I wanna play the entire series.P.S-Game content intended for matured players,not for Weak Hearted and Patientless people.If you are reading this,then dont forget to:""PRAISE THE SUN"""

Positive,Better than Elden Ring
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is a game that could be described as a love letter to masochists everywhere. If you’ve ever wanted to experience the thrill of victory followed by the crushing defeat of being stomped by a giant, flaming dragon, this is the game for you!At first glance, Dark Souls 3 is a beautifully crafted world filled with stunning landscapes and terrifying monsters. It’s like a medieval art gallery that decided to throw a party but forgot to send out invitations. You’ll find yourself wandering through dark castles, creepy swamps, and even a few places that look like they could use a good cleaning. Seriously, who needs a maid when you have undead knights lurking in every corner?The combat is where the game shines—or should I say, where it gleams like a freshly sharpened sword ready to stab you in the back. The controls feel tight and responsive, which is great because you’ll need to dodge, roll, and possibly perform an interpretive dance to survive. One moment you’ll be feeling like an invincible warrior, and the next, you’ll be flat on your face, wondering how that giant boulder managed to crush you without even breaking a sweat. It’s like a game of hide and seek, but the seekers are out for blood, and they know all your hiding spots.Now, let’s talk about the bosses. Dark Souls 3 serves up some of the most epic confrontations you’ll ever face—if by “epic” you mean “a battle that will have you questioning your life choices for hours.” From gigantic, multi-armed beasts to terrifying sorceresses who can turn you into a puddle of regret, each boss is a unique challenge. Just remember, the key to victory is to learn their patterns—if only they didn’t change them on a whim! It’s like they’re trying to teach you a lesson in humility, and boy, do they succeed.The story is another layer of the experience. It’s there if you look for it, hidden like a secret room behind a wall of pain and suffering. You’ll pick up bits and pieces of lore as you go, and while it’s intriguing, you might find yourself more focused on surviving than piecing together the narrative. Who needs a plot when you have the thrill of being chased by a horde of undead?Now, let’s talk about the DLC. The additional content is like a cherry on top of a very painful sundae. It adds new bosses, areas, and gear, but also ramps up the challenge to levels that might make you question your sanity. Achieving 100% completion feels like a full-time job where the only benefit is the sweet, sweet taste of accomplishment. And let’s not forget that you’ll likely need to tackle New Game Plus at least two more times to unlock everything. Because why not torture yourself a little more, right? But deep down, I know I’ll dive back in, because the thrill of the challenge is just too enticing.Overall, Dark Souls 3 is a beautifully crafted game that rewards patience, skill, and maybe a bit of insanity. If you’re looking for a game that will challenge you to your core while simultaneously making you laugh (because you’ll need it after dying for the hundredth time), then grab your sword and get ready to embrace the darkness. Just don’t forget to grab a snack—your next play session might last longer than you think!And despite all the pain, the suffering, and the endless dying, I give Dark Souls 3 a solid 10/10. Because in the end, it’s not just a game; it’s a masochistic journey that we’re all secretly here for!"

Positive,"""I will not rage! I will not break a controller! And I will never uninstall Dark Souls until finish!"" these were my first words before even touch for the first time Dark Souls III; and I'm proud to announce that at least one of these objectives I accomplished (""Remember, the controller isn't guilty!""). However, after this experience, I have ascended, finding my inner peace and removing any notion of rage from my being.As the other games from the Souls series, you need to kill monsters, collect souls, and use them to level up. When you die, all your souls are lost, and you respawn at a bonfire. Luckily you can get your souls back! The challenge is returning to where you died and to the next bonfire without being murdered. It's a rough and hard system to endure. Right from the beginning, Dark Souls III isn't easy; even the initial enemies can be a challenge for new players. However, where you can really feel the difficulty is fighting the first boss, which for me, is the hardest until the fourth. But... how can the initial boss be harder than the next three? It's technically hard to say that he is harder than following bosses, but there is a big difference between them: He is a gigantic impact for someone playing the game for 10 minutes; and when the player encounters the others, they already know the basic mechanics and how the game works.In terms of gameplay, Dark Souls III doesn't have many differences to its predecessors. However, FromSoftware decided to improve and add a few new mechanics to the combat: the focus bar and the weapon skills. Pyromancies, spells, and the use of skills will now consume FP (focus points). However, sadly, the focus points don't work like stamina and can be only restored at a bonfire, by using an Estus Flas, more precisely, the new Ashen Estus Flask, or with regen items (rings, weapons,...). This addition affects more pyromancers and sorcerers because of their high consumption of focus. This can be problematic to these classes, making them more limited with the high usage of spells; because, as can be awaited, isn't easy to be regening FP while fighting a group of enemies or a boss.Most weapons have skills, and their abilities will depend on the weapon's stat requirements; for example, a heavy sword will have a strong attack as a skill. These skills, as I said before, will consume FP. However, if the player runs out of focus, it will consume stamina instead.The online aspect of the game is enjoyable. It's a good choice to explore with friends, and it has a good PVP community, even being annoying when you get invaded.I believe that every RPG needs customization; and thankfully, Dark Souls III doesn't miss that. The first thing that you do after creating a new save is to personalize your character. It can be male/female, tall/small, skinny/fat; whatever you please. After that, you can choose your class; each has different stats and gear and decide how you start the game. However, this is just the beginning of what is coming! Spread across the game's world are hidden paths and secrets. These will lead you to items.The Dark Souls lore is something special! I found myself reading notes, item descriptions and paying attention to dialogue. There are many references to the first game of the franchise in Dark Souls III, and I would love to see a better introduction to the story.Because of that, I would recommend you to check some videos or ask some info to a franchise veteran to understand the lore better. However, most of the story is speculated by the players. It can be confusing and not that direct but is a different and enjoyable way to explain the events. Anyhow, I believe that this can system can fail some times, because of the missing information about characters, events and objects.About Dark Souls III itself, the story is about the Ashen One, an undead with the duty of defeating the Lords of Cinder and return them to their thrones; thus putting an end to the cycle of the First Flame and the curse of the undead once and for all.To make the story of Dark Souls III a bit richer, there are some questlines during the game. Some can be rough to play and watch because of their story, however, a good addition to the lore.Specs: Intel Core i7-8750H; NVIDIA Geforce GTX 1660 Ti; 16,00 GB RamOptimization: I played on max settings at 60 fps. I didn't notice any frame drops, and the game ran well...Hardware: Dark Souls III is playable with the keyboard/mouse (without promps) and controller.References:METALLICA- Kill 'Em All REMASTERIron Maiden - The Book Of SoulsGood choices to listen while playing!"
Positive,"I love this game, but there are a few issues you should know before purchasing. So I guess these will be cons first, then I'll hit up the pros.CONS: My biggest gripe with this game (there is another one, we'll get there) has to be the optimization. There's no settings that drastically affect FPS in any real sort of way, aside from resolution and the more prominant, ""oh of course these settings will affect FPS"". But those are only one or two settings. Textures, shadows, reflections, all of that jazz can be set to medium/high settings and you won't see any difference in FPS if you usually played on low. This sounds good, yes, but if you're wanting to get rid of that constant 40 FPS in one area, you're not going to have any settings to help increase those frames. And frames are important in this game. The other big gripe I have has to do with the camera. The camera controls have been seemingly downgraded from the past souls games, which I didn't think was entirely possible. Dark Souls 1 had a great lock on system, where you could lock onto an enemy from further away and it KNEW what you were wanting to lock onto. If you were surrounded by enemies in DKS1, changing lock on to a different target was a breeze. But in DKS3, sometimes that changing enemy lock on move just doesn't work. Getting attacked by a giant crab that deals half of your HP while simultaniously being surrounded by tiny crabs that do hardly any? Which do you think lock on SHOULD lock onto? The massive crab or the little one? Apparently it thinks that the little crab is more of a threat, thus ending your character's life with one swift claw strike. Awful!Pro tip: a lot of bigger enemies have SUPER slow wind up attacks. It's hard to predict a lot of the time, but with practice you should counter it well. It can be very annoying to get hit by slow attacks because you expect them to be faster, but it's okay. Onto the pros:I'll keep these short because all the other praise has been said in other reviews. Bosses are fantastic for the most part. Each boss has a personality and backstory that makes fighting them either extremely exciting or super sad. Each boss has a second (sometimes third) stage which can throw you into a fit of rage, or make you shrug because not that much has changed. But the intensity is fantastic in these stages.The lore in this game takes after the lore from Dark Souls 1. While you don't need to know exactly what you're doing in order to play and have fun, it's suggested that you either buy and beat Dark Souls 1 (and 2, if you want, but nothing significant really happens there, not from what I can remember). Or watch lore videos on youtube, whichever works for you. Either way, the story unravels in item descriptions and they're probably the most entertaining thing to speculate and hear about when you're not actually playing the game. The story is amazing, you just have to think a little.And finally, my favorite thing about this game, is the fact that it took everything that I loved from Dark Souls 1 and made it better while also removing everything I hated about it, too. For example, you shouldn't need to know how to toggle escape from a Chaos Zweihander, you shouldn't hate invasions because of backstab fishers and abusers. I think that's about it for what I have to say. Tl;DR: it's pretty fun, worth the money, buy it. PS: Get the Ringed City DLC first if you don't have enough for both DLC's.PPS: dark souls 3 did invasions right, fight me about it."
Positive,"Overall:Everyone already knows Dark Souls, but don't let its reputation scare you away. These games are not overly difficult. They are punishing, but are (mostly) fair.  You will die quite a bit, but don't be discouraged. If you're looking for a tough but fair RPG, there's no better series. And I believe Dark Souls 3 to be the best of them. The combat is the most fluid and fast paced in the series, and has some of the best boss battles I have ever experienced. There is a lot of weapon variety, and there are many possible character builds. There is a new feature, combat arts, which are attacks unique to each weapon that add some depth to the combat. The game will not disappoint in the gameplay department. Furthermore, the game looks and sounds very good. Some of the environments From Software have created are breathtaking, such as Irithyll. Each boss also has its own unique orchestrated music track that makes taking down these foes feel all the more epic and satisfying. If you have any interest in the series, I highly recommend you give this game a shot.  Online:The online components of this game are mainly Invasions and Co-op summons. Invasions are fun, but can be very unbalanced. Co-op summoning is fun if you want help getting through a tough area, or if you want to play with a friend. You can also let other players summon you to assist them. The PVP arenas also provide a good amount of value, but they are DLC exclusive. In the arena, you can fight 1v1, 2v2, or 3v3 battles against other players. You can also fight in 4-player or 6-player free-for-alls. *Some people have reported cheaters messing with their games and banning them from online play, but I have not encountered any myself.*DLC:The first DLC Pack, Ashes of Ariendel is a bit short, but ends off with one of the best bosses in the game. The Ringed City is longer and has boss battles of similar quality. The Ringed City is a fitting sendoff for the series. I found both DLC packs were worth the money, but if you could only pick one, I would get the Ringed City (Although once again I do recommend the season pass). Getting either DLC pack will give you access to the arena."

Positive,"After almost 2 years since FromSoft gave us DS3,there is no true challenger for this game.The single player experience is unique with great areas and hard boss fights.Pvp is very good and again FromSoft add for us some advanced mechanics (and i'm not talking about weapons art) makes it's very interesting.Overall Dark Souls 3 is a must have  for players who want's more challenge in their experience of playing a game"

Positive,"Dork Souls III is a game where you are tasked with escorting a bunch of senior citizens to their jumbo Lazyboy chairs, so that the barbecue may commence. Along the way you'll fight a bunch of skrublords in edgelord armor, befriend a man cosplaying as a vegetable, spam roll to win, black crystal out of a gank squad's world, and express admiration of the star around which the earth orbits.

Positive,"Nothing hurt worse than fighting Sister Friede for the first time, taking a while to learn all of her tells, beating her, then watching her rise back up with a pissed off Father Ariandel, panicking because of the erratic attacks, getting PTSD from O&S, finally learning that the 2nd phase isn't so bad, getting the slab and glad that the fight is over only to realize that bitch Friede doesn't know how to stay dead and comes at you even worse than before, taking 10+ embers just to get enough health to survive the fight and then finally beating her after 20 something attempts.Best game 15/10. Would rip my hair out all over different NG cycles again.EDIT: Okay, Slave Knight Guts is freaking insane. It's basically the content creators asking Miyazaki what he wanted in a final boss battle and he said ""Yes""."
Positive,"this was my first ever souls game that i had ever played and beaten. This game is insanely good. The music, the enemies, the bosses and the npc's are so well written and unique that its hard to compare a game this good to anything else. The last boss fight made me so anxious and when i finally killed him after a couple of tries, it was a feeling unlike any other game has given me before. 10/10"
Positive,Slave Knight Gael is the greatest Souls boss ever. A suitable ending to this greatness of a series.
Positive,Prepare to get bullied by teleporting dogs and hard bosses...
Positive,"I just finished this game which is my first souls game, and I just had to write a review for it. Before I start, I have to say that if you are planning to buy this game, you should buy it ASAP because my biggest regret is not discovering this game sooner.This was a very fun game in my opinion in terms of its skill cap. It was very fun clearing areas finding new items and beating the mobs that would stand in your way. Exploring the beautifully designed world of Lothric is also always worth because of its amazing aesthetic. The weapons system was also quite enjoyable to me because discovering new swords, armors and spells always opened my options to more character customization and broadened my view on more ways to play the game. In regards with the bosses, they gave me a whole load of happiness by doing them. I found it fun learning how to fight them, to dodge their attacks and learn their weaknesses in order to succeed. Each boss victory, with the exception of the relatively easy ones, gave me always gave me extremely happy leaving me with feelings of accomplishment. With the lore however, I found that the game itself actually doesn't give you much details. You would have to watch a couple of youtube videos to learn it. This doesn't mean though that the lore isn't good. The lore for me is very exciting and fun. The story and the world of Dark Souls is in my opinion one of the best in all the games I have previously played.For anyone who reads this, I hope you find this review useful."

Positive,It truly has been a journey.This game has made me experience all the emotionsand gave me many fond memories of the strange and wonderful people I met along the way; including both NPCs and players. Dark Souls will forever be something special to me and is the type of game where there is always more to explore in this beautiful melancholy world. I await Miyazaki's next Masterpiece and until then I'll continue to fight my battles sword in-hand; thus I highly recommend this game.

Positive,"FromSoftware still refuses to bring the servers back up. Elden Ring is now their only game playable online. Good job killing one of the largest and most dedicated communities in gaming. Update: after being down for over 6 months (early February - late August 2022), the servers finally came back up. Praise the sun! Now I can finally play this game with my friends and get invaded every 5 minutes by some twink who no-lifes the game.Still mad that it took them 6 months to bring back a SINGLE one of their games, but it's better than nothing. Thanks Mr. Software"
Positive,"You know, I initially planned on just finishing this game just once with the Ursurper of Fire ending, aka the best one, then move on to Elden Ring, which y'know, reasonable.Here I am, on my third run as John Sekiro after finishing Sekiro, Sharp Uchigatana +10 only, parry as much as possible. I am addicted. I haven't even touched Elden Ring yet. Please stop me. I am too hooked.I am not good with analyzing details of games, I'd rather have fun and experience them. So here is the gist of my first-time experience with this game.FromSoft is world-class in terms of worldbuilding and setting the atmosphere. Even in the gameplay, I felt uncertain heading towards the next area, afraid that my weapons or stats will not even be feasible. But then I just kept on heading onward. And man, the feeling of barely scraping by and surviving endless counters gets my heart pumped. Early game Dark Souls experience are always unmatched in terms of uncertainty and ambiguity for your experience up ahead.As I progressed through the game, I got more gear/armor/magic, leveling up my character little by little, it was maybe baby steps but I was getting more powerful, I was improving myself as a player. I started to recognize enemy patterns, I was able to fully read Lothric Knights' moveset. And you know how fast their movesets are lol, really overwhelming at first. I was stuck at Dancer at one point and I kept going back to challenge her every time i upped my weapon stats or soul level. I did not give up, I knew I was improving because I started to be able to dodge through her attacks and read what she was able to do next. It f e l t  s o  g o o d.Anywai gud game git it, even if it never goes on sale. It's still worth it full-price. Fromsoft deserves your hard-earned cash."
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is pretty cool, I guess.You play as an Ashen One, a champion destined to defeat the lords of Cinder and link the first flame, a sort of beacon that keeps the light in the world while at the same time keeping the darkness at bay.I think.After beating up a large man with a coiled sword in his stomach and a very angry tape worm living inside him, you find yourself in a temple called the Firelink Shrine, which is looked after by this cute lady that has a very long list of chores for you to complete while you're out. The Firelink works as your home of sorts, it's the generally safest place and all of your friends live there. But it doesn't have a couch or broadband internet, you could probably sit in one of those giant chairs that one of the lords of Cinder used to sit in, I guess. I can't really go into much detail about the plot without spoiling a lot of things, so instead I will dance around talking about it like I'm playing the floor the lava. Dink Rolls 3, like it's predecessors, is an action RPG in the same vain of games like Blade of Darkness and Crusader: Might and Magic. While making your character, there are a multitude of options outside of just making them look like Gargamel from the Smurfs. You can choose where this character comes from, which doesn't do anything but change the general back story and appearance, but you also get to pick a starting class. In the long run, and much like a communist state, class doesn't really matter, but it can be used to give a head start to whatever stats you actually want to level up during the course of the game.Combat handles almost like two mustached gentleman having a boxing match, unless you're fighting one of the many monsters that lie in wait, in which case in turns into you hoping that it doesn't try to eat you with its horrific chest mouth. Your characters left and right arm are assigned by default to the triggers or bumpers on your controller or to your mouse. You can also lock on to your enemy so you can strafe around them and you don't end up being smooshed because your shield just so happened to be pointing the wrong way. There is a surprising amount of diversity to the combat, you can play as a shield bearing knight or SHOTGUN WIZARD to be sure, but the equipment and stats really help how you shape your play style. You can just go it as a knight or mage, sure, but weapons are assigned to your hands rather than your character itself like other RPGs. Putting a staff or a charm in one hand and a sword in the other will allow you to cast spells as well as whack anything that gets too close, just like using a shield in both hands will let you block doorways for others and giggle at them like the massive jerk you are. Drake Souls 3: Hotline Bling also has this neat online feature like it did in the other Souls games. Others playing the game can leave messages that can warn, inform, or screw with others. The game will also leave blood stains on the ground to show you where other chumps had died so you can either avoid the danger or stand in amazement at how some people can get killed in this game. But most prominent, and arguably most important, is the coop and PVP features in the game. While embered, which is this games equivalent of having humanity, you can find summon signs on the ground that allows you to summon others into your game. This other players will help you defeat the area and it's boss in return for an ember upon success. Or more than likely they'll be killed in your place so you can trek on while they make a splat on the floor. Kind of like a Loony Toons episode.  But maybe you aren't going to be a helpful little ghost that beats up monsters for others. Maybe you want to be... THE BAD GUY! Throughout the game you can find these little red orbs, or one big infinite red orb if you do something for someone. These red orbs allow you to invade other peoples world as a red phantom. As a red phantom, you must kill the host player in return for a few rewards. You don't even have to kill him yourself, actually, you can just have the world do it for you. Though be warned, because that can backfire through another of the games items I'll leave for your to discover. All these online features really work to enhance the general experience of the game. It makes the lonely journey not feel so lonely now that you know there are others on the same crusade as you are. It can also work as a motivator showing you that it's not as hard as you thought if others could do it. There are also these groups in the game you can join called Covenants, which work as a sort of guild system for the online community. Each Covenant has their own thing going on as well as their own goals.The world of Dan Souls 3 is fairly large and expansive in it's own way. While the world of Dark souls 1 was like a ball where everything is connected, the world of Dark Souls 3 is more like a branch, with a main road that breaks off into a plethora of curious locations. There's always this sense of wonder and treachery when you embark on a new quest through a dangerous area, something that the second game seemed to lack since none of the areas didn't seem all that connected. Like how the top of a windmill led straight to hell. Getting immersed into Dark Souls 3 almost makes you feel like a Witcher, if that makes sense. While you can just go through the game and reach the end, there is a lot of reward for exploring and finding secret areas and dungeons that you may have not had to visit during your journey. You learn about the world around you by paying attention and scrounging for lore through various NPCs and items you obtain along the way. The items and equipment you pick up each have a description ranging from just the use of the item itself to the origin and history of the character it may or may not be related to.  They don't seem all that important, but sooner or later things begin to click and you start to understand the world around you a little bit more. The boss battles is where Dark Souls 3 really shines, some of them are lame, sure, but most of them feel like a climatic end or halfway point of your expedition into a dungeon or a cave or a castle or whatever. Bosses are fast, vicious, and hit hard, forcing you to think on your feet. They challenge your reflexes and decision making skills and you feel like a true hero when you manage to make a boss look like a fool by dodging all of their flashy and powerful attacks.BUTShould you play Don King Souls 3: Screwing Mike Tyson? It stands as a nice end to a series. As much as I would prefer if From was known for their games about robots dashing at one another aggressively, I can see how Dark Souls became their most venerated series. It's a game that I can see pulling people into the series and making them interested in the previous games in the series. Is it crushingly difficult as some people make it out to be? No, but it's challenging, it expects a certain amount of competency from the player and doesn't want to just hand things to you. Its kind of lame to see articles and videos floating about on the internet of people who's entire job revolves around playing video games wishing that the game had a easy mode just because they were unwilling to learn and adapt to the games mechanics. Which is why you should listen to me, Dirk.Dark Souls 3 is the kind of game that expects you to actually sit down and play the game, be engulfed in it's dark and foreboding world, learn and connect the pieces that make up it's lore. Is it the best RPG ever made? No, and if you didn't like the other games in the series, I doubt you'd like this one. But is it a fantastic game? Definitely. Dark Souls 3 gets 5 heavily armored camping trips out of 5 and the Dirk Dickbutt stolen Oscar award of approval."
Positive,"I quite enjoyed DARK SOULS III. Although the world is not as branching and connected as DARK SOULS I there are some areas that do have a similar flow to them, where one bonfire joins several paths together through the use of shortcuts. The gameplay is incredibly fast and fluid in comparison to the first two Dark Souls games, something that I was not prepared for during the early hours of the game. I loved the game so much I kept going until I had unlocked every achievement.I know some players took issue with the amount of throwbacks and references to the previous games with recurring characters, locations, and items from the previous two Dark Souls, even Demon's Souls, but I didn't mind at all. The original Dark Souls is the end of the beginning so by the time DARK SOULS III comes around there is an established ritualistic and recursive behaviour in regards to the fading flame. Just like in real life where the world is constantly changing, each civilisation's forgotten history falling victim to entropy, so has the world of DARK SOULS III.DARK SOULS III is difficult but far easier and simpler game to play than the original. Player movement is so fluid and the amount of invulnerability offered when dodge rolling is a huge boon to the player, it's hard not to view it as an exploit. I never bothered with PvP in the previous games but that changed here; after overcoming my nerves I found it incredibly addicting to the point where I'd stay up until 4am messing around as a Mad Phantom just to confuse the players I'd invade.While DARK SOULS III does have its issues in regards to broken mechanics - such as poise not working properly, hackers, and wonky collision systems - it manages to improve on the formula due to some necessary quality of life changes and technical optimisation. I consider DARK SOULS III to be a seriously amazing game, a satisfying closure to the series, and I hope never to see it revived."
Positive,This is definitely one of the hardest game i have ever played. But if u like to torture yourself than this game is for u.
Positive,very amasing :)
Positive,Gotta git gud.
Positive,"It's a shame that the only reason there's downvotes is because of day 1 crashes not because of the game itself. And when the game is fixed, these reviews will never be changed therefore leaving a mark on the game's rating. I myself have not experienced any crashing at all and so far had a smooth experience. This game is pretty fun and as someone who is new to the series and sucks, beating the first boss made me feel my heart beating. Thats how good it was. This game is hard. If you're not up for a challenge then this game is not for you. I was skeptical about this game at first, but now i'm hooked. Please don't look at the ""Mostly Positive"" score seriously after the initial release because by then the crashing at the bonfires, etc will be fixed.My specs: (In case anyone is wondering since I don't crash)2x 780tii7 6700K64GB RAMEDIT: I've read that choosing Knight as your class will fix the crashing. Other classes cause the crashes."
Positive,"Derek's Soul Tree is a game about a dead guy who goes to kill skelly bones, spookymen, other dead guys, and also a tree, (from which the game gleans its title) in an effort to become lord dead guy and steal some bits of burnt marshmallow being guarded by a really angry dead guy. Using tactical maneuvers like trying and failing to get the fuck outta the way of the big, imposing death swoops, slices, stabs and smashes, dead guy dies a lot, but he's got mad perseverance and keeps coming back for more. You'll encounter memorable characters like ""Bullshit Hammer Guy"", ""Bullshit Magic Lady"", ""Bullshit Fleshy Godzilla"", and Nemesis from the much beloved Resident Evil 3. Train yourself to use fearsome weapons like Big Ass Hammer, Fucking Monster-Sized Death Sword, Sharp Stick From Hell, Wolverine, or if you're a casual tryhard, you'll use Edgelord's Katana and whine like the little bitch that dropped it when your shit gets kicked in by a fucking mountain wielding an even bigger fucking mountain. This game is a whale of a time and will have you simultaneously shouting in pain, frustration, anger, and misery. Occasionally you'll feel accomplished, and net a solid amount of spoopcash, only for some dipshit named Bones Mcstoner to invade and fuck up your shit with a damn bullshit attack that you totally dodged I swear it. Game sucks and I love it."
Positive,cool gametry finger but hole
Positive,finally finished character creator
Positive,Do you like RPG's?Do you like platformers?Do you like good Player vrs Player combat?Do you like endless hours of single player and multiplayer?
Positive,"The PvE in this game is very good. If you're buying it for that (which I assume most people are), then it's definitely worthwhile. Similar in quality to (the first half of) Dark Souls 1, maybe even a bit better now that poise actually works. World layout isn't as good though.The PvP on the other hand...dear lord, it's the worst of the 3 Dark Souls games. By a lot. Flawed in a lot of very frustrating ways. And of course From has literally no idea how to balance weapons, so some weapons and weapon classes are just plain worthless. Nothing new there."
Positive,"What's a better way to celebrate beating this game than writing a review for it with adrenaline still rushing through my blood. Admittedly, being a hardcore long time Souls fan, I went into this game quite late as I've only recently acquired a gaming computer of my own. And Dark Souls 3 was an amazing journey that makes that wait worthwhile.My tale of coming across the Souls series was that of a happy accident. It was on an used Xbox 360 my parents bought for my 15th birthday that I discovered still locked achievements for a game called Dark Souls. And for reasons unknown, little me was drawn in immediately, perhaps by the icons for the achievements itself. So I set out immediately in search of this elusive RPG game that just came out a few years prior. Before I know it, I was hooked, dragged into a rabbit hole of bloody, exhilarating adventures; becoming a die (try) hard fan of the franchise. That also sparked my interest in extremely difficult games later on and subsequently a passion for roguelikes.Now at the end of a short trip down the memory lane, comes the actual review for the game itself. As most may know, the difficulty in Souls game have reached an almost legendary meme status where they'd be compared to a slightly hard game. And DS3 was no different, albeit the game in my opinion feels a less challenging than the first one. The game, however, made up for it in the way of clever enemies, maps and bosses' design. Most if not all of the bosses from the game have two phases to their fights, forcing the player to switch up tactics - a feature not common in previous titles. For example, my favourite boss fight is with the Dancer - avoiding any spoilers here - has the first phase consist of primarily clearly telegraphed attacks but as soon as the second phase rolls in, its attacks become much faster, much more dangerous to dodge nilly willy. As with other games made by From, lore and storytelling plays a very important role in their games. And this aspect is even stronger in DS3 with more lore hidden among item descriptions, even more NPCs with their individual quest lines to complete, all with their own very satisfying ending. And in my opinion, story elements in DS3 are strongest in all of From's games.Dark Souls are incomplete without amazing pieces masterfully crafted by various talent composers that literally breathed soul into these games - all the boss fights would feel extremely empty without these sounds in the background. The soundtrack of DS3 is no exception and I find myself listening to them from time to time to get a quick boost in morale.In short, Dark Souls 3 is an unforgettable experience is a definitely must have for all the Souls fan. Here's to more hours in this amazing franchise. P.S: if you're trying Souls game for the first time, I'd highly recommend the more clunky but amazing nonetheless first Dark Souls, preferably skipping the second game - the black sheep of the family, and finally finishing with Dark Souls 3, before moving onto Sekiro and Bloodborne."
Positive,"And there you are again.Couldn’t keep your greedy fingers off my old armor, I see. Oh no, don’t look at me like that! I won’t grovel in the dirt this time. We’ve left those petty grievances behind us, don’t you think?You know, I’ve realized, we really couldn’t be more different, you and I. And yet here we stand, the both of us, undead, yet unbroken. Me, I’m simple. Truly unbound. Nothing to gain, nothing to lose. But you… I’ve seen your ilk… time and time again.You grasp for the faintest glimmer of hope. Kind-hearted fool that you are. You are blinded, by the very light that guides you, so you stumble, searching for answers… driven into madness by the things you uncover. And still, you remember… what any sane person would rather forget.You want to save everyone. Pitiful, really. You can’t even save yourself. And the more you try to help… the more you will lose. Whether you risk everything for glory or offer all that you have left with boundless compassion. No one can foretell the consequences of your good intentions.I’ll never understand what drives you. Is it your thirst for knowledge? Faithful duty? Petty revenge? No matter, you shoulder a task far beyond yourself. And through all your trials, you realize… that you measure up to it after all.And when even the gods despair and shy from their duty… when the last fire fades and the abyss grabs at your heart, you hold tight the embers that burn your fingers… and face the end… unknowing, deceived, yet always sure of yourself.Why?Bloody hell… no matter, it’s not like I care. But I suppose I’ve amends to make and a debt to pay. The more things change, the more they stay the same, eh? So, how about I help you with… well, whatever is behind that door. You do like to stick your ugly nose where it doesn’t belong, don’t you?Well then… lead on!"
Positive,Hey! Thats pretty good!
Positive,"Devs: How much swamp do you want in our game?Miyazaki: Yes""Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll meI ain't the sharpest tool in the shed......""8/10"
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is the supposed end of the series, and finds many amazing ways to wrap it up. I'll be doing my personal feelings on the game, at least rating wise, instead of looking at it like a critic. The very first thing I want to say, is that you can play the games in order of 1, 2, 3, but in my personal opinion, an order of 2, 1, 3, would be better for most players. Dark Souls 1 and 3 have many similar elements and are more closely tied together than 2 > 3. Now to get onto the ratings for this specific installment of the Souls series.Story: 9/10 - The story, like all of the other SoulsBorne games, are stories that aren't directly told, but more found by careful exploration and looking at every tiny detail the game offers. For people who want a more direct story telling, this can be frustrating at times, as you might find yourself thinking 'Why am I doing X or Y?' but for those who want to try to find the story based off of context clues and small details, it's perfect.  Subtle details make the world feel more alive and connected, and make forming these own connections yourself that much more rewarding. If you find yourself wondering what the lore is behind something specific I might recommend looking it up on YouTube, as there are many wonderful people who cover the subject.Gameplay: 9/10 - The gameplay is similar to Dark Souls 1, instead of Dark Souls 2, which has its pros and cons. Pros - Quicker, sharper, with a bit of the realism taken away, which in a fantasy game is fine. Cons - PVP is a bit overwhelming at times, especially if you're new to the game, there will be people who have played the game for years now, and just do invasions to kill and trick brand new players. People say 'Easy Peasy, Lemon Squeezy', but in cases like this, if you're starting the Dark Souls series with this one, I'd like to say 'Difficult Difficult, Lemon Difficult'. There can also be times however where you find some of the funniest and friendliest people, randomly gesturing, helping you through levels, or dropping you end game items that you otherwise wouldn't get until the end of the game. Really anything happen. The SoulsBorne community is nothing if not random.Besides that, if you're the type of person, like me, who enjoys learning by mistakes, blood, sweat, and tears, it's definitely a good style for you, and the amount of reward you feel after defeating a boss you've been struggling with for hours/days is amazing.Customization: 8.5/10 - A large part of what I enjoy about Dark Souls 3 in particular, is the difference and variety in builds you can do for PVE. From an assassin using magic to make themselves quieter, to knights using faith to slam lightning into their enemies, to a bowman ducking and weaving between enemies to pelt them down, there's something for everyone's style of play. Some fit better at different times than others, and if you truly don't like your build you can respec once you reach a certain point in the game. Appearance wise you can also take the time to make your character appear however you want, but if you wear a helmet you won't be seeing your characters face much at all.Music: 10/10 - Maybe perhaps the best part of the entire SoulsBorne series, the music is near flawless and always beautiful. From the most melancholy piece, to the most epic, the music is something that tugs at the heartstrings in your soul and truly makes you feel for this dying world. Nothing bad to say about the music anywhere, other than I could use more and more.All around: 9/10 - This game is nearly perfect in many aspects for me, but falls short in a few others as well. The story is wrapped up very well (depending on which ending you go for), the combat is very finely tuned, and as you go through the game you feel the world struggling on-wards, attempting to live its last breath. The area where the game falls short is playing through after your first time, it feels much much shorter. It's VERY easy to miss certain NPC quest line. Certain ones can't even be completed without playing through the game multiple times, so if you're a completionist, be prepared to do multiple playthroughs. Final Thoughts: I highly recommend this game for anyone wanting to be engrossed in a decaying world, one that is difficult and gritty, but rewarding at the perfect times. Beauty abounds and difficulty astounds, but with time, perseverance, and a bit of luck, you'll find yourself enjoying one of the best games of the last decade."

Positive,"Can't wait for that which ruled the skies and gave life it's full brilliance. That's right: The Elden Ring. Oh, Elden Ring... Shattered. By someone. Or something!Don't tell me you don't see it.Look up to the sky.It burns."
Positive,"Now that Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is right around the corner there is probably a no better way to sweeten the wait, than revisiting arguably most widely recognized From Software production – Dark Souls 3. It is one of those games, introduction to which feels somewhat redundant. On the other hand, if you are somehow unfamiliar with the Souls franchise or its most prominent instalment, it is truly a high time for you to catch up. Alas, Dark Souls 3 is a critically-acclaimed action RPG game, best known for its high level of difficulty and climactic boss fights.  This combined with the fairly complex combat system and a not-exactly-cooperative camera became staples of the Souls franchise. It is worth noting that Dark Souls 3 is a far more direct sequel to the first part of the series, taking place in the same kingdom hundreds of years after the events of the first game. Dark Souls 2 on the contrary, took place in a different kingdom altogether and was only loosely related to the previous game, even that only after the release of the Scholar of the First Sin edition. Early Years It is relevant to establish how exactly Dark Souls 3 is related to the other From Software releases as this is where the main thought behind this review comes from, namely, Dark Souls 3 is a compilation of previous From Software games rather than a new title in its own right. Paradoxically, this is not only precisely what the fans wanted, it is also the reason Dark Souls 3 is the easiest to approach of the series. With essentially 4 games worth of experience (including both Demon’s Souls and Bloodborne) From Software boiled away everything the player base didn’t like rather than tried to go in any new direction. The outcome is DS 3 being the most distilled “From Software formula” experience to date.The road there was based on trial and error. Let's assume that Dark Souls was the groundwork for the rest of the franchise. It was remarkably clunky from both movement and camera work standpoints. It required making frame-perfect maneuvres with a truck on an ice ring. To say the least, it took practice, but what in Souls series doesn’t. On the other hand, it had highly praised, organic world. The premise of the vertically built game was simple but it allowed locations to blend into one another in a heaven-to-hell aesthetic. Sadly technical condition of the game as the PC port was a complete mess and even most popular fan-made fix got banned at one point. It had a huge following, but there was a lot of room for improvement. Then came the Dark Souls 2 and creators grasped the opportunity to innovate. In a different time and place lorewise it seemed fit for rules to change. Death penalty was changed into HP reduction, enemy respawns became limited, multiplayer component got improved and magic greatly expanded. Vertical construction of the world was changed into horizontal with a main hub of Majula splitting into 4 roads, each leading to major bosses and thankfully bonfire teleport was available from the get-go. Then again horizontal construction of the world was far less fluid and most memorable bosses of the game were present in the DLCs. The main game included way too many “gank bosses” with what should be a highlight of the title often turning out rather mediocre. There was an interesting addition of new enemies appearing in New Game + though there weren’t that many players that went through multiple playthroughs to experience this. Despite possessing greatest variety in terms of viable builds and equipment, Dark Souls 2 didn’t reverberate with the fanbase so well as its predecessor did, not without controversy, it is seen by many as the worst entry in the series.  Prepare to die again With such background, it is no surprise that Dark Souls 3 revisits the place of Gwynn’s legacy. With returning characters and locations either visually inspired or flat out the same as in the first game. Dark Souls 3 blends two previous games leaning heavily toward the first, but there is one other key component to the mix. Bloodborne’s much higher-paced combat. It was a huge novelty to the Souls series making the combat system and movement overall incomparably faster and more fluent. This direction is further highlighted by new weapon category that can be best described as “special” introducing unique and often extravagant movesets to each of these specific weapons. With moves that can make the player feel nothing short of being an anime protagonist, coming back to the first game seems like having an engine removed from your race car and being cordially asked to keep participating.In many ways, Dark Souls 3 feels like a cut back on changes introduced in DS 2 with those “replaced” by a solid those of fan service to the enthusiasts of the first game. Especially the latter goes without question. Just to name a few examples: both onion knight and Patches return as NPCs, also two of the game main bosses are strongly tied to the first Dark Souls, one being literally Artorias fan club and other residing in Anor Londo. Furthermore numerous iconic looks from the first game return in Dark Souls 3. Given that armour stats make the least impact on the game in the entire franchise, DS 3 submits entirely to joyful cosplay of the “fashion souls”. Dark Souls 3’s world is built much like DS 2. There is the main hub of Firelink which sprouts an essentially single core road, splitting into several side-routes along the way, though most of location transitions are handled much more smoothly. That said, the hub is handled in a far more immersive fashion with numerous characters visiting the shrine. Not only all the essentials are in a single place, but gradually filling up Firelink Shrine also gives a solid reference on your game progress.Lastly, Dark Souls 3 remains consistent in the series approach to telling its story, that is hardly doing it at all. The player can either follow popular fan theories or making up their own, based on scarce snippets of information that can be derived from visuals and item descriptions. Arguably, the general premise of Dark Souls 3 is ending the story that began with the first game, showing a “true” end of the world. The silver lining One of few things truly ingenious to Dark Souls 3 is its absolutely striking visuals. It is the most picturesque instalment by a longshot. Dark Souls 3’s bosses are also a huge highlight, all of them having 2 phases. Additionally, with the general tempo of the game increased, the fights are more intense and satisfying than they ever were. Paired up with soundtrack specifically made to match the fights, Dark Souls 3 delivers the sensation of a truly epic undertaking. While being a little obscure, Dark Souls 3 offers large amount and variety of NPC questlines and interactions. Perhaps DS 3 is a somewhat uninspired game and in certain areas such as the number of valid builds or magic is a step back in regard to DS 2, it remains a tremendous game. Given the series notoriety for its difficulty it is not a title for everyone, though if you are not afraid of rising up to the challenge over time, this game is a must-play. Also if you were to pick a single title from Souls series this is the one to go with. Not only it is the most polished, but it also has by far largest multiplayer base. Dark Souls 1 atmosphere and Dark Souls 2 improvements... by your powers combined, I am Dark Souls 3."
Positive,It was my first souls game and I will be revisiting all the priors just because i would like to play more souls. It was a semi-rough journey with a learning curve since it was never a series I really got myself into. But Once I learned i thrived and honestly it is one of the most rewarding experiences you can ask for.
Positive,"The atmosphere in the game is over the top, opponents, not to mention the bosses, make you shout, with some bosses there is a feeling that in addition to the boss himself, the camera is also fighting with you."
Positive,It's not every day I like a game better than Dark Souls 1Edit: Well I enjoyed the game itself. Too bad I saved and quit at an extremely high-frequency-crash area.
Positive,you will most certainly die.you will die 20 minutes into the game.you will die 20 hours into the game.you will die 1k hours into the game.pretty nice for suicidals like me :D
Positive,Praise till you're hollow. \[T]/
Positive,My first Fromsoft experience and still my favorite to this day.  Can't stop returning to it for more blessed punishment.
Positive,"It's hard to describe the experience of playing Dark Souls. It is a journey that not all can complete and one that will test your endurance and patience. They put you up against what feels like insurmountable odds things that hit harder than you and faster than you. You will be killed, krushed, hacked, slashed, burned and butchered, yet despite it all you are able to overcome the odds that are stacked against you, and the feeling of overcoming those odds have never felt sweeter."
Positive,"Many times have I’ve stood at the summit of this dying world and longed for it to let me in and thus lighting the last flame. But for some reason the gate has always slam shut and I’ve never really felt the warmth of its disparity. This is the first time I have managed to traverse the kingdoms and give it new hope to become a Lord of Cinder.Throughout the age of video games, there are a few titles that are possible to admire without even having to play them. But sometime you are fascinated by the vivid hints of its concept, the art, the unique experience, overshadowing any flaws it might have. Because Dark Souls have flaws, oh yes! Flaws that would be cut into history as the most strange of decisions.If you have been living in a world of Darkness until now, Dark Soul is a game about never feeling at ease, never being secure, never knowing what will come and always dying at the smallest of mistakes. You traverse this masterpiece of level design, trying to reach the next safe haven of a simple bonfire. At times you may find yourself on the other side of a fog wall, fighting an opponent five times your size, but with twice your speed. But don’t be discouraged by those daunting battles. The essence of the game is in the gratification of an impossible victory.The genius nature of the Dark Souls universe, is not telling you anything, giving you snippets of poetry or the ramblings of a knight turned madman, not making any sense. Anyone not dedicating a large quantity of time, will make little sense of the story. But that is ok, because for a vast number of people, trying to interpret the story, puzzling it together, makes the whole community come together as the archeologists and historians of Dark Souls, filling the internet with theories and story-arches. Even if you are not part of this collective, watching the community collaborate, is a awe-inspiring thing.If you are pondering the question of: Should I get into Dark Souls this late? The answer is an overwhelming YES! This is the most polished version so far, all the clunky technical issues of the past have vanished, the bonfires are abundant, the frame drops are a memory and it is most certainly worth dying for."
Positive,"This is my first souls-borne game, and it has been a weird ride. I did not buy it in the Humble Monthly, but I convinced a bunch of friends to buy it then and join me. 3 of them havent beaten the first boss, one is about midway through, and the other has beaten the final boss. It was interesting to see my friends rage, and that alone made purchasing Dork Souls 3 worth it. However, you are getting so much more than that.The Gameplay is fast paced and rewarding (most of the time). I never died more than 2-3 times in a place, maybe its because I R1 spammed my way through my first play through. Builds in DS3 can be simple or complex, some strategies will work and some wont. In my first ng+ run when I went for the Usurper Ending, I respecced into making a Miracle Class, then a Sorcerer Class, then a Pyromancer. Each playstyle is different and unique enough to where you can have hours goofing off and blowing up shit with magic. There is a definite learning curve here, but once you get a grip on it 95% of the deaths you recieve are fair game.The Online Aspect leaves something to be desired. Invasions can happen at the worse times, but invading always seems to end up in a world against the Host of Embers and 2 Sunbros which can be a nuisance. Another gripe with invading is that sometimes it takes forever, and joining a game after 10 minutes of waiting can easily get you booted back to your world if the host bum rushes the boss fight in the area. There are also serious latency problems with people using a bowl of potatoes as a wifi hotspot and they start warping around and hitting you from miles away. Another gripe is that Blades of the Darkmoon and Blue Sentinels can only get their covenant items by being summoned randomly into a  Way of the Blue's world when he gets invaded. It never seems to happen, making two VERY nice items almost not unlockable. Summoning friends sometimes doesn't work out, even if you are the host of embers and someone from Idaho in the middle of a war camp joins you, the HOST will get hit reg problems on the AI enemies. Cheating doesn't seem to be too big a problem, but 2 or three times I have run into people who just swing you around with the power of Cheat Engine.The Covenants are garbage. Its basically a grindfest for the little covenant items to get moderately good gear, some of which is required for the achievements. It is 10 of the covenant reward item for the basic rewards, then another 20 for the final reward making it a total of 30 invasions/defend sessions per covenant. Thats where a good 40 of my hours went, sitting around the Pontiff Sulyvahn bonfire waiting for a Way of the Blue to get invaded or to invade someone without 3 sunbros and 2 Darkmoons ganking me.The Bosses are memorable and a fantastic challenge. They act as checkpoints to make sure you have what it takes to procceed. Some of them would randomly grab you when you were nowhere near and just slam your ass into hell, and sometimes they hit you but it doesn't register. The only boss I consider to need a nerf is Darkeater Midir from the Ringed City DLC. Even with fully maxed out weapons and soul amounts I grinded for hours for, this dude tanked hits like an asteroid. I've tried Base Run, NG+, and NG++, only finishing him off by cheesing him with sorceries in my third playthrough for a spell. I think thats the only time I truly got pissed in Dark Souls, so a fair warning.The Level Design is very atmospheric and well crafted. I know the levels like the back of my hand, and where items are located for NG+ runs. You do occasionally run into weird level loading problems where you see textures blockier than Minecraft, but maybe thats just my computer. The enemies in each level are themed nicely, and there is plenty to explore and find.The Soundtrack and Boss Themes are Hype Inducing. Pummeling bosses to memorable soundtracks like the Dancer's and Souls's really makes beating each boss memorable. Everything about the sound design is top notch, except whenever the playable character makes a noise whether its an emote, one of those weird stones, or taking damage. These noises are slightly jarring, and really take me out of the immersion, its probably a me thing though.The DLC purchased together is a fantastic deal and a good amount of content, however if you purchased Ashes of Ariandel alone you really arent getting much for the 15 USD. Ringed City however, is easily worth the 15 Dollars. Both DLC feature new bosses, new levels, new items, and overall just more fun to be had.The Lore is confusing. You either need to really get into it and watch videos explaining every detail, or just briefly skim through cool looking item's descriptions. What I did understand was good, and if I ever decide to play other Souls-Borne Games, I will invest a lot more into learning the story. If this is your thing, theres a lot here to dig your talons into.Performance Is Not The Best At Times, but if you can run the game maxed out at a stable framerate you really have an eye candy. I cannot do this however, and at medium settings I drop frames heavily in the begining of Archdragons Peak and the Dreg Heap. There is a bit of crashing whenever you whip the camera around to hard, especially during boss battles / summons / fricken Archdragons Peak.The Community is a Mixed Bag. You get the R1 Spammes with dark gear, and then you get the helpful people on reddit comparing weapon stats and bowing. Its interesting.The Price I would say is fair, but getting the game on sale with the season pass at 30 dollars USD is a steal. Better yet, if you didn't buy DS3 for 12 Dollars with Ashes along with a slew of other games something is wrong with you. I personally paid the 40 dollars for DS3 w/ DLC, and it is most certainly worth it. In Conclusion, Dark Souls 3 is a game I put too much time into just to get all the achievements so I can feel justified writing a review. Pick this game up on sale definitely, a good 8/10.dark eater midir is bs"
Positive,">Got summoned for Soul of Cinder as a Sunbro>While getting summoned host gets one shot by someone with a one shot build>The invader adds me>""NOOB GET GUT REKT CASUL"">Instantly removes meThis is seriously the best game on steam"
Positive,Buy it.Git Gud.Love it.
Positive,Out of all the dark souls games this one is in the top 3
Positive,"I love this game more than I love first Dark Souls. This game is more fast peaced than previous two and even more challanging. But every time you hit a wall you will try and try to climb over it untill you succeed and feel sweet satisfaction of victory!Pros:- Great combat system- Great story- NPC side-quests force you to explore world even more (but are worth it)- Amazing soundtrack- World design (it's beautiful and clever)- Enemy and bosses design- Challanging, sometimes even hard, but not impossible- Jolly co-operation!- THERE IS NONE FUCKING BLIGHT TOWN!Cons:- You will get hit through walls- Enemies unlimited fp/stamina- Camera can and probably will screw you with 25 inch dilldo- Laggy PvP- PvP douchebagsTips? When in doubt, roll like a madman.Also Praise the Sun!"
Positive,"Yes, Indeed. It is called Lothric.     It's not just about losing or winning. It's the process of you falling down again and again, standing up again and again and growing up. When you finally succeed after countless failures, at that moment, you will feel that the previous suffering is worth it. Although there will be a new journey of suffering, that's the fun of the game, isn't it?     Never forget your original intention and what you are pursuing. If you can't stand it, look at Solaire the Warrior of Sunlight. The sun on his clothes is painted by himself. What else can you complain about? (Praise the Sun). XD     Mayst thou thy peace discov'r & Let the sun shine on this Lord of Cinder!     Ashen one, hearest thou my voice still?"
Positive,Kinda bad idk just buy it
Positive,Better than Elden Ring
Positive,Only buy it on sale.
Positive,"When you think life doesn´t f*ck you hard enough, this is the place you want to be.The breathtaking landscape and architecture, jaw-dropping weaponry and exceptionally-good-at-what-they-do inhabitants will insure your stay to be a pleasant one, provided you have the sanity to match the challenge of despair.An experience best enjoyed with friends, if they won´t throw down the towel on their first ragequit.Would totally wiggle-waggle my weapon at strangers for no apparent reason again! 11/10."
Positive,"In my adventures to find games to play I stumbled upon Dark Souls 3 (DS3). Six years ago, I started playing the game with an old friend but put it down due to finding other games to play at the time. Well, for the past few weeks, I have been playing DS3 and I have to honestly say that I wish I played this game a lot sooner. I love everything that this game has to offer and the builds you can make in the game are amazing.ProsWonderfully crafted story in its world-building and item descriptionsChallenging gameplay that will make you think about your next moveOptional side quests that are actually fun Many different builds to use and try outBeautiful graphics that make the areas amazing and creepyConsSide quests either have specific or small windows when they are availableNow, I can’t really talk about the story of DS3 simply due to the fact that it’s not told directly to you. The story of the game is mostly interpreted by the community so you will have to take it from there. The remainder of the story is mostly found on item descriptions and its world-building, which is also not told to you directly but just by looking at it you can get a feel for the world. From the buildings you see to the enemies/bosses you fight, it’s all unique in many ways and I love it.I am someone who loves Dark Fantasy stuff and DS3 doesn’t necessarily need to have a story for me to fully watch. I loved how the world also has a bunch of influences on the Berserk series and I can even see some of the comparisons in the game.Now whichever Dark Souls game you play, they are all known for their gameplay being difficult in many ways, although it should, of course, be worth noting that difficulty is subjective to everyone. However, I will say that DS3 is a challenging game in its own right. There are tough enemies to deal with around the corner and challenging boss battles that you can go and beat. You are given some tools to help you deal with the bosses and if you have a friend who also plays the game, you can summon them to help you in the boss fight as well.After you kill an enemy or boss, you will be given Souls. These Souls will give you upgrades to stats. Strength will help you carry heavy weapons more easily - if you don’t meet the proper strength, you won’t swing the weapon properly. Dexterity also helps as it makes you carry more weight and if you don’t meet the requirements for that, the weapon will bounce off enemies. Endurance will help increase stamina, which gives you the ability to do more actions like attacking, etc. Vigor will give your character more HP, which is good for survivability when fighting enemies or bosses.I could go on for more about the stats in this game but that is pretty much a whole review on its own for me to talk about. There are soft caps and hard caps for all the stats in the game so there will be a point at which you will get less than the usual level per stat you increase.There are also a few starting items you can get to help you at the beginning of your run. One thing I have to note is that no matter what item you start with, you can get everything else in the game. Including the item you start out with, whatever you get will only give you what you start out with. Unfortunately, though, there is no Master Key like in the first DS game. That’s fine as you can travel pretty much to any bonfire at the start of the game.With that in mind, there are also a ton of different weapons, armor, and builds that you can use in the game. You will have to meet certain stat requirements to use some of the weapons or armor so sometimes you will have to farm for Souls. There is magic in the game but it’s ok for the most part, you can use spells as you do have a magic meter, and doing a magic build is possible but it’s an investment. You will need a high faith level to use some of the best spells and to do damage, thus making you a glass cannon of sorts.After defeating a boss, you will be awarded a Boss Soul. These special Souls can be used to acquire new weapons. Or you can use them to get extra Souls to get extra stats for you to level up, do note that if you do this you can’t recover the Boss Soul unless you fight it again on New Game+.There are times when you have to go back to certain areas or explore the world in some way to progress through the story. While you may get stuck, you can explore the world or if you want to look up a guide, there is no shame in doing any of this as some of the info you get is vague.There are also some side quests and optional bosses that you can fight that can give you some nice rewards. They add things to do in the game and it’s always nice to do other activities in DS3, the game offers quite a few things to do and explore and it’s worth it to try the optional quests.Although I mentioned that some of the info that the game gives you is vague, well that also applies to the side quests as well. As they either have a specific or small window of them being open and if you progress in the game, you will be screwed over from doing it. You can beat one boss for you to only be locked out of a side quest because you did not speak to a certain NPC on the other side of the map. It’s not the player's fault for this, it’s just FromSoftware never gave you any hints or cues to do certain things.DS3 is a very beautiful game, the areas you visit look dark and depressing but have some sort of undead-life feel to them all. It makes you want to explore what lurks around every corner. NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Quad-Core Processor 3.50, and 16 GB of RAM, I experienced no issues while I was playing and got a constant 60 FPS while playing.Dark Souls 3 is one of those games that I wished I picked up sooner to play and I am honestly glad that I finally found the chance to experience the game. I had a ton of fun playing it and this has encouraged me to try out the other games in the series. I even went and bought the DLC's which were a ton of fun to play and explore throughout. I highly recommend this game to fans of the Dark Souls series or to those that are wanting to start out with it. There is a ton of replay value to have, and the game even has multiplayer.Ahh, another one, roused from the sleep of death to review at Life Needs a Little Sin  for good quality reviews"
Positive,"First of all, the changes affected the design and elaboration of locations, which became much more interesting to explore in order to move forward. There were some lore additions directly related to what happened in the first part. The world has completely rotted and needs the beginning of a new era, which only those who are not worthy of becoming ashes can do. Ashen One (ash), called the Fire Keeper, is controlled by the player, forced to travel a long way to fight the Lords of Ash, returning them to their thrones in the Firelink Shrine. With these actions, Ashen One must end the Age of Fire and begin a new one, thereby putting an end to the curse of the undead.Dark Souls' lore has always been boss-based, so I'll highlight Aldrick, Devourer of Gods. Has an interesting backstory, character model and, in my opinion, attacks. Yes, they are “borrowed” from Gwyndolin the Dark Sun and other characters, which looks impressive in the compartment. Lothric, the younger prince and Lorian, the eldest prince also do not leave indifferent, leaving a taste of sadness at the end.Added storylines that are easy to miss because some actions are impossible to figure out. Concerns Henri from Astora, bringing a good ending. It follows that you need to be constantly vigilant so as not to miss small details that can seriously affect the outcome. Otherwise, if you carefully examine the locations, communicate with NPCs and read the descriptions of the loot, it will not cause any difficulties.The big problem with Dark Souls remains cheaters who enter the world like red phantoms. It is unpleasant to lose coal because of guests who are not capable of a fair duel. This would include pinging, which is additional pain in one place, since it is difficult to cause damage. This does not apply to players who create mini-bosses and provide a real opportunity to win. Overall, if you are in the right place at the right time, red phantoms are not a problem.There was only one major bug - a failure under the textures after the battle with Abbys Watchers. It was so surprising, and the pools of other people’s blood confirmed that this was not an isolated incident.If the previous parts of the series did not work, then this one should be given a chance to prove itself. Must have by default. And I'm ready to marry her."
Positive,this game is not difficult
Positive,"This land is peaceful, its inhabitants kind."
Positive,"A Completionists OpinionDo you like dying over and over, the only release will be a brief moment of peace before the next giant monstrosity grinds you into paste? Does that sounds good? Well have I got just the game for you. Value for money:    There is well over 100 hours of gameplay here. Story:   Rich and deep for sure, so long as you are willing to go digging for it. Art style:    Outstanding vista’s, monsters and atmosphere all round.  Sound track:    Add to the game, it’s there and does its job.  Glitches:    None that I found. Difficulty of gameplay:    Um… its Dark Souls? Literally the Dark Souls of Soulslike’s. So yeah it’s a bit on the tricky side. Enjoyable gameplay:    Well I loved it so much I kept coming back. Would I replay it:     I did, a few times. Controller needed:    Yes. Yes it is, if you can do it on keyboard and mouse good for you. But yeah a controller is recommended.  Time to complete:    150 hours or so Guide needed:    If you want to complete the game I’d probably use one. Can be completed in singeplayer:     Sorta, but not really. Can be completed in one playthrough:    Nope, needs three to collect everything. Difficulty based achievements:    There is only one difficulty so nah. Random achievements:    Nope all of them can be earned. Completion advice:    I would read several guides on all the collectables if you are so inclined. Be warned it’s a long game but later playthroughs can be done a lot faster. Whilst you can grind for the covenant (multiplayer) items in singleplayer, the drop ware is insanely low. As soon as you can join the blue sentinels and then the blades of the darkmoon covenant, they are by far the hardest to get matched up for in multiplayer. The other covenants can be earned but if your character goes above level 130 matches become very infrequent. Don’t be afraid to coop a boss with randoms or your friends. The drop in souls you get can easily be farmed later on.Speaking of farming, killing the one knight nearest to the Lotheric Castle bonfire a long way into the game is a very fast way to get souls, especially with all the right gear on."

Positive,"I just finished my first playthrough on Dark Souls 3 in around 40 hours of playtime. And I have to say, that in all of these 40 hours, I had the most enjoyable, satisfying time in gaming and it instantly became one of my top 5 favourite video games.The game was so good, I am willing to keep playing it, going further, unlocking everything, even if I know it will be a pain. But pain was already there, considering this is a souls-like game.Seriously, if you want to play souls-games, and you don't know where to start, this is the best one to start with."

Positive,"Honestly, this might be my favorite From Software game. Sure, it doesn't have the pure innovation of Demon's Souls or Dark Souls, but it polishes both of those games and adds the better parts of Bloodborne to make a nearly perfect experience. DS and even DeS have some of my favorite levels, but DS3 puts it all together in a beautiful package. Once you start getting to the later parts of this game, you really feel like the devs went above and beyond in that way to make the best of all worlds type of game. I don't think anything will match my first moments in DeS, but this one sure has me hooked and the coop is really solid, making it a more friendly game in some respects.The graphics are the best From has put out period. After the horribly janky 30FPS of Bloodborne, damn this just feels right. Perfect image quality and 4K at 60FPS with a 1080ti or better. Turn DoF off for a nicer look with full detail. I could not ask for more in visuals department outside of clipping fixes.The story and lore is probably a tad redundant by now. I still have very little emotional connection to the hero, and I just don't buy the less is more theme anymore. From really needs to invest in some better storytelling. I don't want or need Witcher 3 type dialog scenes every 5 minutes, but I do want to to care about the characters in the game. They should take a page from Ghibli films to assert their conservative approach with a bit more heart. Outside of that, this is still a great package with decent bits here and there. Much better than Bloodborne for me.From has some quality characters in here, and the bosses are great fun, yet it just need a bit more detail and complexity to the characterization of those at hand. Places like Irithyll are just stunning and the best the series has ever looked, but this game goes beyond that in the DLC and in general most areas are about the best they can do at this time for the Dark Souls vibe. The connective environments are amazingly resonant, and looking at the castle as you move in and around it during the beginning is brilliantly done better than any other of their games. From has really crafted a spectacular world here full of great detail.I feel like you can critique some of the balance though. Too many rings are useless, and I really wish they would have tweaked that aspect to make the builds a little more varied. Certain swords seem to immediately assert dominance, but after you get to the middle there are a lot of options with weapons and spells. Overall, the usual complaints from a From game of course. I didn't find this one too hard at all. Plenty of bonfires and coop make it almost too easy in parts, but you can treat that part how you want to make your own difficulty. For me I didn't want to struggle too much so I did some cooping for once, and it was a blast all told. You definitely still need to be very careful in certain areas, so it's not like the game is giving you free passes. And at this point in time you won't get coop spawns all that much anyway, though, the community is still active to this day in late 2024.Both the DLCs add a lot to the base game and completes the package well. I have never been one for multiple playthroughs, but they offer plenty for Souls enthusiasts with DS3. I can't see how any Souls fan would not recommend this. The controls are back to amazing after the horrific controls the B team peddled in DS2. No more awful deadzones, no more weird acceleration curve. This one feels great to maneuver with in all respects. The atmosphere, sound, and visuals are overall From at the top of their game. It's definitely an homage to their entire work as a studio, but it stands tall as a great game in its own right."
Positive,"Praise the Sun, always."

Positive,"Thank you my precious lord Miyazaki,you taught me to restrain my soul,i don't regret any seconds i spent in this trilogy.I am infinitely grateful for making me feel the weakness of humanity.All these masterpieces actually show us what we can achieve with our faith.I can say without hesitation it's the best thing I've ever experienced.I will never stop praising the Dark Souls and my master Miyazaki i guess."
Positive,"I have so many positive things to say about this game that I honestly don't know where to begin.I guess I'll start with the difficulty.The game is extremely difficult, I mean it's Dark Souls, I don't think anyone is surprised by that.If you're not familiar with Dark Souls games, all of them are very difficult but that's exactly the point and half the fun comes from overcoming the difficult challenges that the game presents to you.I'm a newcomer to the Dark Souls series, and this is the first souls game that I've played and finished.I liked it so much that by the end of the game, it became my favorite singleplayer game of all time.If you're not up for the challenge and do not like trying to learn boss patterns, I don't think this game will be your cup of tea.Even regular enemies are tough and some of them may make you want to scream and smash your controller against the wall.There is no tutorial, the game doesn't hold your hand at all, and you're pretty much on your own from the beginning.YOU have to figure out where to go, what to do, what items do, which weapon is the best for you, which armor to wear, which stats to level up, how to beat a boss, etc.I liked the UI in this game a lot, it's very simple and doesn't have a bunch of obnoxious UI elements that cover up half of your screen. It's small, useful, and simple, and the menu is really easy to navigate!Boss and level design are so far above average games, it's unreal.Every boss looks good and unique and has his own attack patterns.Every area in the game has its theme and is very fun to explore.It's very rewarding to get an upgrade or a new item from just exploring the world, everything has its purpose and a lot of things have interesting lore behind them.Unlike most other games, in Dark Souls, you have to work for it in order to get lore.You have to look for NPCs in areas of the game and talk to them to get bits and pieces of the lore, which later you have to put together in your head.If you want even more lore, you can read the descriptions of various items.The game uses environmental storytelling and doesn't just serve you everything on the plate.In terms of replayability, I'd say that it's worth replaying the game multiple times to get different endings and fight your favorite bosses a few more times.The game has a feature called NG+ which allows you to replay the game with the same character and not lose any items (except specific ones like keys) and keep your levels, spells, weapons, etc. There are a few optional areas and bosses in the game that you can easily miss if you're playing for the first time which is one more reason to replay the game.Gameplay is very fun.There is rolling and attacking, those will be 2 main things you're gonna use, of course, there is more to it like weapon arts, spells, parrying, blocking, and things like that, but I found myself using mainly roll and attack buttons, and I think that's how it is for the majority of players, especially new ones.There is a ton and I really mean A TON of different weapons that change how you play the game depending on which one you're using.On the one side, you have slow but hard-hitting weapons such as greatswords (which is my personal favorite), and on the other side, you have fast but lower-damage weapons like katanas and daggers.Don't let anyone tell you you're using a bad weapon or your build is bad because you can beat the game with any weapon if you practice enough, and if you're REALLY good you can also beat it on level 1, naked, and by using nothing but your fists.The graphics are pretty decent considering it's an almost 7 year old game, but that is not very important in my opinion and you should not expect much in that department.Dark Souls 3 runs well on older systems and you shouldn't have problems running it even on higher settings if you have even a somewhat competent PC.There is also PVP if you play in online mode, but I haven't tried it yet so I cannot comment on that.If you're really having trouble with some boss, you can summon a friend in co-op to help you out, but I wouldn't recommend it since beating a boss alone and all by yourself feels infinitely more rewarding, at least to me.There are only 2 cons about Dark Souls 3 in my opinion.1. Keyboard and mouse controls are awful, I strongly recommend not using them to play this game, a controller is pretty much a must-have if you want to have a good time!2. Camera. In some boss fights like 1st phase Nameless King, when he's riding that dragon you're fighting the camera more than you're fighting the boss.These cons are easily forgivable since there are so many good things about Dark Souls 3, and everything else about the game is epic!I have so much more things to say about the game, but this review is already too long, so to summarize:1. Extremely challenging game.2. No tutorial or hand-holding, you're on your own from the start.3. Very simple and minimalistic UI.4. Godly boss and level design.5. Fun exploring.6. Interesting story.7. Environmental storytelling.8. Good replayability.9. Enjoyable gameplay.10. Big variety of weapons and armor.11. Good optimization.Even almost 7 years after its release, Dark Souls 3 is still worth buying for the full price of 60 euros.The best singleplayer game I've played. 10/10"

Positive,"If you're looking for a challenge this is absolutely the game for you, i've played trough it for about 4 times now and i'm still in love with it. The world design is absolutely gorgeous, the enemies are relentless and frustrating, but so satisfying to parry, and the bosses, ooh the bosses are just too damn cool. It's also really fun to play together with your friends. If you're doubting to buy this game i should definently check it out, it's worth the shot :)"
Positive,"You unearth at the graveyard among ash and bones. No rest for the undead again. Or you can use the fancy The Ashen One as your new Maiden in Black calls you, or unkindled as everyone else does. There’s a nitpicking explanation for the difference between unkindled and undead. The short version is: you tried to link the fire like Gwyn did in the first game, but was found unworthy of the task. You’ve turned into ash and not into cinder like those who were capable of performing the task. Now you rise again because those who unlike you were good enough as a kindling (Lords of Cinder) have abandoned their thrones. The massive boulders shaped into armchairs that are left in the Firelink Shrine look like distant relatives of tombstones in Hunter’s Dream from Bloodborne. Or rather even archstones from Demon’s Souls since Firelink Shrine now looks a lot more like Nexus (but has a secret dark counterpart like Hunter’s Dream did). The only thing in common (besides the obligatory bonfire) between the old and new location is the complaining knight. This ever present character of hub locations for the series gives you riddled insights on what to do next and reminds you that any hope for success is futile. In the first game he’s greeted you when you got out of the introductory zone. Now he’s at the end of it. He’s at the borderline between abstract time-space of your base of operations and that real fight that begins according to the messages left by other players.The funniest joke of Dark Souls III is how it reverses the common trope of video games. Your usual path is upwards, from the faubourgs, forests and bogs to the final castle of the ultimate evil. Here you start in it and slowly descend to the foothill and further into the depths where more dangers lurk. That makes you question who you are. And that is the right question for the series, but as usual this mystery is open to interpretation (and largely depends on your actions and choices). It’s easy to miss even though you’re told directly about it by the NPC. Details like this tend to not be the focus of your attention, which usually is centered on how to deal with the hordes of dangerous enemies trying to stab you on your way to the next bonfire.http://coub.com/view/d6m2vIn the transition from one zone to the other there will be time to just admire the view.Dark Souls III is like a happy marriage: the tricks aren’t really new, but it still is titillating and enjoyable. And most importantly you don’t wanna trade this comfort for something new because you’re convinced that nothing can be better.In a way this game is more accessible than ever, more robust and fluent. No more riddles about starting gifts; access to the multiplayer is not so far behind the tricky boss fight and AN incredibly punishing (for a beginner) zone. Now you just purchase your white sign soapstone from a vendor in Firelink Shrine. You don’t even have to find and rescue this seller of marvelous goods, handmaiden. She’s just there. But then again, you have to know what it is you’re buying. You have to know if it’s better to stock up poison-reducing items or packs for arrows for sneaky dragon-killing. You have to be a veteran of the series for that particular pricy key in her stock to immediately catch your attention. Yes, Dark Souls III is a tad easier, but only if you’ve already come prepared with the knowledge and loaded with nostalgia. Only then the silhouette of a blacksmith sitting further in the underground cave besides the handmaiden will make your heart beat faster.Self-quoting and straight-up repetition of elements from previous titles is yesterday’s news about FromSoftware games. If anything, that’s admirable how essentially doing the same very hardcore and niché thing again and again they’ve gained such a widespread acknowledgment. It’s still a far cry from your typical AAA experience, but for a long-time fan it looks more like a remix, like a fevered dream filled with all those memories blended together than a new adventure. The series are at the point of calling exciting new feature a re-introduction of mana bar which wasn’t present in the series since Demon’s Souls. Well, it’s blue and shows you the amount of mana you spend to cast spells, which isn’t that exciting. What’s more interesting is that you also use it for special 2-handed weapon attacks. This introduces you to the new mechanic of balancing two types of estus-flasks if you use spells or goes completely unnoticed if you only use these special attacks occasionally and stick to the old ways. This is how it goes: a bit of this, a touch of that, familiar NPC making a return, a poisonous bog, an underground cavern, a jail with an NPC trapped behind a locked door. Everything is chopped, sliced and added to the brew.There’s NPC that kills other NPC and revenge invasion, though implications are far less dramatic. There is a simplistic puzzle with the two elevators far less decorated than in Bloodborne. You do things the same way, look for familiar clues. You jump off the elevators when you see those platforms you can jump off to. If you get bored, the ability to choose a new playstyle is there. It’s worth noting though that attributes’ reallocation is accessible way far into the game as opposed to Dark Souls II. You can easily miss it altogether or discover it at the point when there’s just four bosses left, and all of them are just pathetic wankers. Anyway you’re free to choose from melee to magic to bow to something even more exotic. And when you fail with your build optimisation you can always just throw toxic feces at enemy knights. Dozens of armor sets, weapons and rings — enough to justify a replay. You were curious to try out that mechanic that you’ve missed on previous playthrough anyway.Second playthrough with the comfort of coming prepared. Now you know which chests are mimics and have time to chuckle at “Regret!” message at the dead end. The structure of the world comes back into focus. Vertically stretched layout with intersections, connections, elevators, traps, closed doors and completely cut-off zones. Geography makes sense now.Even two bonfires mere few dozens of steps away from each other actually make sense when you consider the shortcut you discover later. The story of Dark Souls series revolves around endless cycles of misery and futility of any attempts to overcome it. You’re not even sure if that is the irony or the prophecy of some kind for the company and its games."
Positive,"There is a worrying number of overly biased reviews for this game - as is the case with steam reviews in general.The single player is an experience that sums up the souls series in a very climactic way. It's definitely the most fine-tuned and visually striking souls game to date. The base-game is superb, there are a few secret area's that are rather large and diverse, and the items and weapons are sharp, interesting, and nicely balanced... for the most part (ESTOC-BESTOC). Armors are varied and tend to mix well together, I would have to say, fashion souls is now better than ever. The bosses are amazing, all of them. The first boss is a great introduction to the games difficulty and mechanics. A specific optional boss is honestly one of the best souls fights of all time, and one of the most challenging. Lore is one of my favorite aspects of a souls game, and this game has some very very interesting characters and bosses, my particular favorite being Aldrich, the devourer of gods, he's a total scumbag.pvp is definitely the thing that needs to change the most. There are hackers who are causing concern for players, but before you post a negative review, might I recommend a counter-measure, or at least, a fail-safe to prevent irreversible damage. Backup your saves !!! It's as simple as that. Sure, it's a nuisance, but it's more preferable than losing your character completely. I can assure you, from is not ignoring it.I'd like to remind you, pvp was pretty bad in Dark souls 2 when it came out. Only after many updates did it become balanced and fun - give dark souls 3 the same patience, there are new mechanics and changed concepts -- it'll take some time, but it'll be fixed.This game is not as bugged or as laggy as so many people seem to claim. I run a 960 on high and get 60 in all areas of the game - note, I do run a higher end processor, so your fps may vary. I don't know if From is offering a fix for other, less optimized cards, but I can assure you, this is not a half-assed effort for a port, the devs have discussed with the community the problems and bugs people are experiencing within the game, and their acknowledgement alone means they're willing to work on fixing these problems. This game is worth your time, Fromsoft is a pretty good developer - if you don't want to risk buying due to the lag or PvP problems, give it some time, it'll fix itself out over time."

Positive,"This review will be more of an essay about how this game has helped me cope with a lot of things in life. INFJ-T is what defines me, through and through. Anxiety-induced-insomnia (not diagnosed, I should add, because I've never been to therapy) might just be synonymous with life for me, at the depths (or height?) of which I have even been up for days at end, the longest duration of which was something around 75 hours; hours, days, months... all getting muddled up into a big splotch of nothingness. This was the first of the souls games I've played and I can, in no way, do justice to the help the game has given me by writing this review.Repetition/Pattern:The more you play the game, the more you get into the intricate patterns the game throws at you. Repetition and keeping a level mind is of utmost importance. Patience is key and this game exemplifies teaching that to the players, a virtue that is as relevant in real life as it is in the game, a quality that will never go out of fashion.Exploring the unknown:The game, or any game for that matter, brings with it an element of anxiety in that you need to move about in an unknown area and interact with things and find out more about them in order to understand how they work and how you can use them to your advantage. This game has helped me a lot in getting over the unsettling feeling of exploring the unknown. Again, here as well, the game excels in giving it's players a life-long and potentially life-changing lesson in staying calm.The significance of a bonfire:This might just be the most important part of this review for me. Being able to write this and express what I feel brings me a lot of joy, the concept of which is immensely subjective and difficult to understand. In the game, a bonfire is a place where you can rest after all the exploring and fighting and you get healed and re-filled. This spoke to me. The bonfires gave me the mental peace almost nothing else could. The best sleep I have ever gotten was after resting at a bonfire after a 5-hour-long fight and repeat session. The bonfire is a light in the darkness. It represents a tranquility that can be achieved just beyond what looks impossible to defeat. It symbolizes hope. It signifies the fact that no matter how big the obstacle you are facing is, you innately have the necessary skills to overcome it, and if not innately, it will just be a matter of time for you to find a way of going around it, if not over it.As for the recommendation regarding the game: YES, YES and again YES!"

Positive,"ok, this is epic"
Positive,Not Dark souls 2
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is a fantastic addition to the series that improves upon the previous formula very well. If you were to compare this to Dark Souls 1, it has better bosses, the same (epic) quality of music, incredibly fun weapons, and cool looking armor. The only thing I would say DS1 has over DS3 is a better world. If you're new to the series, DS3 is a fine place to start. It references the past 3 games but given that all of these games have implicit story, you're not going to feel lost or anything; you may just not recognize certain references/items from old games. As this is a souls game, it is of course very difficult. There are a few areas that admittedly feel a bit unfair, but most of the game's difficulty is a proper challenge where you know where you went wrong. Overall, if you're curious about the souls series, definitely play DS3."

Positive,"Solaire Bro's attempt to review every game in his Steam Library continues -Link to Curator Reviews: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/37485611/Link to Curator Page to Join: https://steamcommunity.com/groups/constantdiversionCheck out my youtube review page: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx6ZcQm_YvJ7Anv_lru3h6w There seems to be fundamental disconnect between all Dark Souls fans. What slowly grew out of, I believe, the inherent differences that existed in Dark Souls 2 versus Dark Souls, have now spread like wildfire across From Software games and inevitably the entire medium they did so much to influence. Dark Souls 3 in many ways is the most troubling entry in the series. It sought to be both a sequel to Dark Souls, but also entertain the growing fan group that has since been attracted to the series. As an actual sequel, the game actually does a pretty poor job of recreating what works so well in Dark Souls - from a story perspective, not gameplay-wise. You see, I didn’t just play these games because of the gameplay. And based on the cult following of some Dark Souls lore masters online, I’m not the only one. If you’re like me, the gameplay difficulty of Dark Souls is something that has never really daunted you. I honestly never paid too much attention to it. Are they difficult? Yes. But the series originally justified its difficulty by leveraging it with the story. Originally, as the chosen undead, it is impressed upon you that you will die often. The more you die, the more you hollow. It’s great meta storytelling that uses the frustration that other players experience (by dying often) and eventually quitting (going hollow) for storytelling purposes. The lore lays it out in Dark Souls by telling you that “you’re not the first,” many people come and many people go. Not everyone will or can beat this game or, story-wise, not everyone will complete this quest. In 2011, it was elegant and novel. In Dark Souls 3… the game is just hard. And without the same justification it feels like it’s lost its reasons other than its own reputation. We live in a different world now and we can’t deny that some people are attracted to the game precisely because of the difficulty. It’s a selling point as much as anything. Does this keep the game as an exhilarating experience? Certainly. But aren’t we sacrificing a bit of the game’s “soul” in that pursuit?This is what I was getting at by saying “fundamental disconnect” at the beginning. If the difficulty, to you, is solely what the Dark Souls experience is about - then that is fine. This is completely worth your time and money. It’s the best at what it does.For some of us, Dark Souls was so much more. It was about a changing world. It was about the cycles and seasons of life. The pursuit of knowledge at all costs (Logan), blind faith going unrewarded (Solaire), the fear of dying keeping us from living (Siegmeyer), and countless other concepts that have the potential to shape worldviews. Dark Souls sought the type of catharsis that only a video game could provide. You are the player. You are in control. You are either the next hollow I kill, or you are the chosen undead. Can you do it?Dark Souls II understood these concepts, but it didn’t know how to articulate them. They understood that it was best to keep things open-ended so the player could award themselves through discovery. The issue was that, aside from not being as good from a gameplay standpoint, the stories being told in Dark Souls II simply weren’t as compelling as what came before. In Dark Souls II there was such a distance (both philosophically and geographically) between the events that occurred in it and the ones that came before, that the “II” in the title “Dark Souls,” felt nearly completely promotional. And the ending informed this. The whole quest is just a cycle – great. So what was the point in this sequel again?Dark Souls III had the incredible challenge of accommodating newcomers, making good on their “git gud” marketing, and fixing the story-telling issues and dissonance that was created in Dark Souls II. The result is a mixed bag from From Software. Dark Souls III set off to eliminate the story issues in Dark Souls II by bringing back previous characters, locations, and story-beats. This felt like an overcorrection and a bit emotionally manipulative. Don’t bring back these things and just expect me to care. Either create something new that can stand on its own, or don’t bother with it. Or, at the very least, try to have it make sense. Don’t just say kingdoms are colliding – what kind of catch-all is this? It comes off as lazy, random, or both. There is simply no logical reason for people like Andre of Astora to be here – for instance. I’d conjecture that this type of thing was done to make those that felt jaded by Dark Souls II’s distance from the original feel like their complaints were heard and remediated. But the warm and fuzzy feelings, while good, are fleeting by the time we’re introduced to Siegward, which is just Seigmeyer from Dark Souls – but in reverse or something? I don’t know. It’s fun and it’s fine, but it’s also redundant. It’s nice that Dark Souls III cared about answering open-ended questions remaining from its progenitor, but it’s also a shame some of them feel tacked on unnecessarily– I liked my own version of who Gwyn’s firstborn was, for instance. I didn’t need an answer to that.At least Dark Souls II tried at something and failed. Dark Souls III is retreading. Dark Souls III also doesn’t feel like it exists logically in any part of the timeline. Dark Souls II feels millennia after Dark Souls (“Many kingdoms have risen and fallen on this spot”). In Dark Souls III, many of the kingdoms that were present in Dark Souls (Caterina, Astora, Etc.) still exist here. Everything feels like it’s appearing anachronistically.  This can likely be explained away by lore masters out there, but it shouldn’t have to be.From an actual gameplay perspective, Dark Souls III takes what are already the best combat mechanics in gaming and adds more tweaks instead of overhauls. It is difficult to master, even as a pro to From Software games, but any Dark Souls fan should inevitably be comfortable here after a few hours in. I’ve had some of my favorite Souls memories testing myself against others in the game’s fantastic PVP. It’s not for everyone, but can be a lot of fun if you’re matched up with good people. Most of the fellow players observe a certain amount of respect for each other. I’ve found (outside of “git gud”) Dark Souls III to be one of the better communities in gaming. The game is, of course, hard. But most competent gamers will eventually find a way to make progress. And when you do, you’ll feel elated. Deaths usually don’t feel cheap in Dark Souls. It’s not trial and error – it’s usually “Dammit, I could have planned that better.” And that exchange between the player and the game make the experience rewarding. You own victory. You own defeat. You didn’t get lucky. You got good. You, as the player, level up just as much as your character. In the end, it was a rocky road for me. I can’t deny the imperfect brilliance that exists here. The game does an incredible job for the newcomer at the expense at some of those that came before. Apparently, it’s not a perfect world after all.7/10(Two complete playthroughs. One on PS4. One on PC)"

Positive,"EDIT 4/19/2017:  Dark Souls III has received a lot of patches, and had two DLC drops since my original review was written, and I just want to say that having clocked a few hundred hours in the game, my recommendation stands strong.  I had loads of fun with PvP, ultimately, and found that that any gap in balance could be overcome with grit and determination.  They've brought poise into the game as a hyper armor mechanic that is only active during certain frames, an interesting change, and not necessarily a step in either direction, but one that shows they are open to community feed back, and really eager to make a game we can all enjoy. The game still has some pretty harsh balancing issues, don't get me wrong, but there is so much to love. The PvE experience is god damn incredible.  A lot of my favorite souls bosses are found in this installment, the areas are gorgeous, and I just generally enjoyed the hell out of this game.  The lore is interesting, and I grew to love the PvP, even with its balancing issues.  And the secrets hidden throughout it! My first time discovering Archdragon Peak, fighting Darkeater Midir, and so many other things, will always stick with me.  If you have the opportunity to play this game, and have any love for Action RPGs at all, take it and give it a chance. (Original Review Below)TL;DR: Dark Souls III is a great game definitely worth playing, but not perfect.  I'm a long-term Souls fan, so I'm a bit passionate about this, and my negative comments should definitely be taken with a grain of salt, as they're fairly specific (and from a place of love).Dark Souls III has by far the most beautiful visuals in the series, in the same wonderfully dark theming Souls games always have, the same fantastic gameplay beloved in the other installments of the Souls series, and adds another massive time sink for Souls fans needing a fix to sink their teeth into.And it has some incredibly enjoyable lore! I really loved the story elements in this one.  Not only that, it has some of the best cinematic moments in the series, by far.  The addition of weapon arts really gives this game its own unique signature in the series, although power stancing has, sadly, been removed.   This game is much more of a direct sequel to Dark Souls I, and plays off of it in many ways, so those who didn't like the changes in Dark Souls II will be more comforted in this installment.Now for my brief rant on what let me downThese are by no means deal breakers, but with how much I love this series, I'd be remiss not to mention what felt like steps backwards.  It's fairly well publicised that poise is just gone in this game.  Not altered, like Dark Souls II, completely removed.  Basically every weapon will stun for two hits in PvP (unless it's some broken combo) and stun endlessly on most enemies in PvE.  The combat as a whole has been just a tad simplified; its new speed has reduced complexity, and many of its weapon classes are objectively inferior.  Between the removal of poise and the unbalanced weapon classes, a lot of player choice feels as though its been removed.  Most of all, casting has been more or less eradicated as a viable PvP aspect.  Every spell can be dodged, Focus Points limit their ability to sustainably battle, and even when they do hit, spells just aren't as significant as a good straight sword two-hit R1/Right Bumper combo.I could go on about a few more negatives, all of them equally nitpicky Souls geek things, but the point is that the game is just feels a little less deep than Dark Souls I or II, specifically in the PvP.  It's still incredibly enjoyabale, especially outside of the multiplayer, but if you're anything like me, the reduction of viability of using axes or spells (or whatever you want to use that day) will irk you.  I just feel that the loss of viable build diversity is very sad.I do love this game, and strongly recommend it.  But it lost a few things that I really enjoyed in previous installments."
Positive,"The saga concludesWith Dark Souls III FromSoftware completes its epic trilogy in the franchise by keeping things familiar but allowing the combat to open up a bit more and not feel so stifled as the first two in the series. The introduction of weapon arts really helps with build versatility and replay value for those inclined to invest in the games combat through its robust PVP. It's clear from the get go that Dark Souls III combat, while retaining that familiar feel of the first two, has been somewhat influenced by the faster and more frenetic action of its predecessor, Bloodborne, and truth be told it's all the better for it. While Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin slowed things down to a bit of a crawl, Dark Souls III thankfully notches things up a few gears.If it's nostalgia you are looking for then the final in the chapter is clearly a love letter to all the fans who helped grow the series into what it is today and laid the groundwork for what was to come , the natural evolution of the franchise into what has become their most ambitious and successful title yet - Elden Ring.All the classic hallmark FromSoftware features are here from its brilliant interconnected level design, beautiful dark fantasy art direction, a soaring orchestral soundtrack, challenging enemies and equally terrifying bosses that require agility and attack pattern memorisation. With Dark Souls III, Miyazaki and his team have successfully brought about a fitting end to the franchise which amounts to a fantastic send off for the fans. Those entrenched in the series are bound to have a jolly good time and for those just discovering this style of gameplay through Elden Ring, I actively encourage you to play the franchise from the beginning. If Elden Ring has taught newcomers anything it's that ""soulslikes"" are actually not that hard if you invest some time into levelling your character and understanding your enemies attack patterns and combos, when to strike and when to defend.More of the same, but it's the same we fans love.The game on PC does suffer from some microstutters the last time I played which were not there on the original release. It seems this got added post launch through one of the many patches. It is slightly annoying but it doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the game.Elden Ring, Lords of the Fallen, Remnant: From the Ashes"
Positive,"Tongue Required Ahead, Ashen one!"
Positive,"Your role within the world now serves a different purpose, the map design has your character initially descending into the depths of the world instead of ascending higher. Non-player character roles are subverted with initially kind, friendly characters not quite what they seem. From the start, Dark Souls 3 is all about lulling you into a false sense of security.This is carried through in the way the maps are designed. Initial areas are fairly straightforward to walk through, and the game kicks off relatively linear, with your character warping from a Demon’s Souls-like hub. However, once you venture from the simplicity and ease of the first few areas, the game starts to branch out with unprecedented depth and complexity.While Dark Souls 3’s changes in map design and difficulty spikes play with your expectations, the boss phase system in some fights seem incredibly unfair. In the latter portions of the game, the difficulty in some bosses stops coming from pattern recognition and instead from regenerating health and resurrections. Thankfully this is limited to just a few bosses in the game rather than the majority, which are brilliantly designed. While the original Dark Souls remains a legendary game, Dark Souls 3 is a worthy successor to the name.THE GOOD- Rich lore- Excellent exploration- Rewarding challenge- Great level design- Thrilling combatTHE BAD- Framerate- Inconsistent lock-onDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE"
Positive,"The best game of the Dark Souls series. After revisiting this game having played Elden Ring (which I love), I was amazed to find how much of the latter's gameplay refinements have come directly from this game. If you like Elden Ring and are waiting for the DLC, do yourself a favor and play/replay this. If you have never played a FromSoft game, this is probably a very good introduction, although the story may be a bit obscure for new comers. The only downsides are some buggy achievements unlocking (never had this issue with other FromSoft titles) and the grinding required for some Covenant rewards, if you wish to play this offline."
Positive,"Here we arrive, preparing to die for the third time. I've only played a few hours so far, but I've been nothing but amazed. It seems that these games just keep getting better: it has the fluidity of Bloodborne and Dark Souls 2 but it also offers a beautiful and breathtaking environment which surpasses Souls 2. Every angle, every corner, every room, offers a multitude of objects and atmosphere to look at and feel. The combat feels incredibly smooth and just right. Backstabs don't feel stiff anymore, parries are executed seamlessly, boss fights are action packed and of course-- will kill you multiple times. Every area has satisfying combat and looks stunning enough to take multiple screenshots of!As someone with a fair amount of experience with souls 1 and 2, this game has surpassed the two and has not disappointed me yet at all, and I don't believe it will at any point throughout it. Praise the sun!10/10 would die again."

Positive,Great game best game ive ever played... like ever. No fucking joke like i love getting fucking fisted by bosses that i should be killing first try. like  fucking wolnonk or whatever cause dont you just love getting forced to the top of the boss arena then he spits his fucking gunky juice shit all over the area its amazing. It was this point in the game i realised that i didnt care if  i beat him because i was summoned into my friends world and it meant more to him than me so instead i just caved my skull in and threw my pc out my window and finally i was in peace... like i could just die in peace go to heaven but realise heaven doesnt exist so i went back to the wolnir boss arena and i will forever get fisted by his gassy juice getting poured into  my blood stream and poured into my fucking arsehole. at this point i realised i only had to break his stupid gucci bracelets made by fucking lil pump i then easily killed him and killed myself. best game 10/10 i just wish i could fight High lord wolnir for the rest of my puny existance on this god forsaken planet(I have like 600 hours on dark souls 3 and like 500 on dark souls 1 on console so this review is the most valid thing you will ever read about a game ever)

Positive,"do not need to be discussed again, you must be ready to die quickly at the beginning of the game and even die many times. Don't be frustrated, just enjoy it (even though it's always emotional every time you play at the beginning and sometimes almost throwing the controller at the monitor), the point is always being patient in playing is enough to give the impression to always be patient in every moment"
Positive,"Video Version:Dark Souls 3 is an excellent if almost somewhat nostalgic ending to the Souls series of games. My experience with it was a nearly perfect one from the perspective of performance and stability.  I had no crashes and maintained a solid 60 frames per second throughout essentially the whole game.  Controller support is functional right out of the box without needing to go to Durante for a fix and you just need something like DS4Windows to use a Dual Shock 4 controller.The weapon, monster and boss variety is great but the zone visual variety is a bit lacking when compared to the other souls games.  Most zones are tied together nicely and the ones that aren’t can be easily teleported to with short load times, at least on the PC version which is what I played.All in all, this is a game that is absolutely worth playing.  It’s worth buying at full price and is a must have in the game library if you enjoy 3rd person action games.  It’s also pretty damn good for working on your hand eye coordination.  And with any luck, From Software will give us some great DLC content in between now and whatever their next dystopian psychologically horrific game happens to be."

Positive,"This is some of the most fun I’ve had playing a video game. Dark Souls 3 is my favourite in the series. It feels like they took what they learned from all the previous games and made this game the most refined experience out of them all.  It feels streamlined but in a good way, it’s missing the interconnected feeling from Dark Souls 1 where every area connects with each other which I kind of miss but on the other hand I wasn’t getting stuck as to where I needed to go next every few hours like I did in Dark Souls 1. In Dark Souls 3 you always know your path ahead and it’s a good feeling and you can feel the the progression you are making which is nice. It’s the most atmospheric souls game too, it does a great job immersing you in its amazingly crafted environments. The level design is terrific, a lot of awesome and memorable areas and much less frustrating and annoying ones like the crystal cave in Dark Souls 1 or the shrine of amana in Dark Souls 2, there is nothing close on that level of annoyance in Dark Souls 3.  The combat and movement is the best it’s ever been, I like how its more fast paced which you can tell they’ve taken from Bloodborne and it’s a welcome addition. It was by far the easiest game in the series but I think that’s mainly because I have a lot of experience from the franchise rather than the game itself being easy because I can see some areas and boss fights being really difficult for newcomers in particular. I think this game is a masterpiece in design and execution. 10/10 (Masterpiece)"
Positive,"I really don't know where to start but let me try. First of all, this is not just a game, it is a lifestyle, includes meaning and purpose of the life, grants you strength to keep going when you wanna give up, brings out the best in people, make everyday worth living and the list goes on and on...All kidding aside, to me Dark Souls III is one of the best of  the bests in the whole gaming industry, it compels you to think twice before you take an action for your first playthrough, but it is not that cruel and ruthless since if you really give it a chance to understand it's mechanic (like knowing and calculating the right time when you should dodge/block/parry/attack/get back/wait and so :) ) this game is very very rewarding and amusing. My recommendation for who ll play this game for the first time is that just be patient till you really get good eventually (git gud in other sayings), i said eventually because you have it deep down inside you and you can accomplish it like the ones who did it before you. So, give it a try and just enjoy beating  wonderfull bosses this game has. Finally, if I was given just one chance to play a game it would be this masterpiece without doubt.10/10 Recommended."
Positive,"I love to hate this game, I love raging at it, hating it for punishing me. I loath how you can miss a tell and get utterly wrecked for a single stupid mistake. I hate how the AI can some times change it up creating a new pattern of attacks that I wasn't expecting and thus wreck my face.  I hate how even the littlest of foes can murder you in a blink if you're not paying attention... This game is the personification of a dungeon crawl, when you're tired, weak, bleeding. It knows, and it's hungry.Still... I keep going, I keep beating myface against the brick wall untill I finally kill that Onyx weilding monster and lay claim to a greatsword I'm elated to have, will even use for a while as my character was a pyromancer to begin with. I love to hate this game... it's my cathartic rage dump. It's well done, plays beautifully, punishes me for my huberous, and forces me to retreat, train up, and try a different tactic.I'm not the best at this game, I can't waltz through and call it easy, the idea of a no death playthrough is an alien concept in my eyes. Still I've enjoyed every single hour I've dumped into this hate monster, and cannot wait to finally close my undead paws around the next bit of DLC loot."
Positive,"Compared to the first Dark Souls game, DS3 is ""young and good-looking"" with a slightly shallow background story, so well-prepared veterans may find this sequel more like an adventure game instead of a souls game. But any wording saying this game is not a masterpiece is a lie. Dark Souls III is hard than Dark Souls II, but much easier than the original Dark Souls game. Unlike the original game's connecting-as-a-whole map, some of DS3's maps are separated  and only teleport can access, with Firelink shrine being the most typic one. That's a disappointment, since the surprise of opening a door to find a super shortcut is gone. However, I believe that the Dev. put all their efforts in designing bosses and builidngs. Irithyll (still don't get its pronounciation) and Anor Londo are straightly perfect. Sometimes I even feel that the city has the ability to grab my soul, then throw it into an oil painting. Well when my friend was playing this game for the first time, on the stairs between Dancer and Vordt, I told him, ""Do you wanna feel Dark Souls ? Then turn left and kill the man sitting on a chair. You'll see."" No doubt he was ripped by Dancer, but he then knew what makes a pretty boss fight. Being the last game of the series, Dark Souls III answered lots of questions and also suggested us endings of some NPCs, no matter you are wondering or not. One is the laddersmith being dead in profond city, right next to the bonfire, who also appeared in Dark Souls II. This story tells us, 15,000 souls for a ladder is too much. Greed will cost your life. Also, is Gywnevere (or Gywndolin) related to Aldrich ? Is Andre related to Gywn ? The fire keeper, is she really blind (even after you gave her the eyes) ? Why is Patches ""Unbreakable"" ? I was super into lores of DS for a while and some of those questions really bothered me. There are Youtube channels making videos stating their own opinions. Check them !      The pros+Bosses are more agile and harder (My circus needs a dancer. Anybody ? )+ Lots of endings (Yes and for achievements you have to proceed to NG++)+ Best DLC of the series + Beautiful weapons and magics + Princesses are always gay (?)The cons- Battle mechanism stays the same, especially for mages. - Too many bonfires (lowers the difficulty)- Dislikable blue bar -Where's my Dark Souls III The Fire Fades Edition ????  (Now I know that only PS4 gets it. What a pity.)-Why is there an Anri ? I need Solaire."

Positive,"Dark Souls III review ‘base game’                                                                 configuration test: i5 6600 / gtx1060Dark souls III is the third chapter of the series: the Age of Fire is running out, the First Flame is dying and you are The Ashen One, an Undead who has the duty to bring Lords of Cinder back on their thrones in the Firelink Shrine in order to link the flame and save the world once again, or not. . .; as well as the other souls games, trama will be hidden and must be reconstructed by the entire lore of the game, reading the descriptions of the objects and speaking to npcs in the game The game takes all goods seen in Bloodborne but it inherits lot of defects from previous installmentsGAMEPLAY 8,5/10The gameplay is the main focus of the game series, solid, beautiful, complex to master: one precision must be done primarly, it is not the hardest game of the three, but, speaking of Bloodborne elements, it is clear you can’t just go straight against the enemy, sometimes shield yourself it is not a valid option, you must learn to dodge enemies.About the defects, main concerns are the hitbox; they aren't perfect, the main problem of the previous games is present, so, enemies can hit you through the walls, a problem we would like to see fixed in a 2016 gameLevel design is mostly like Dark Souls 1, there are lot of shortcuts and the entire game develops itself a lot in vertical; also present some macro areas as we have seen in Dark Souls 2; The only thing that clashes with the level design is the placement of the bonefires, in fact, it is not difficult to find two, or even three different bonefires very close to each other, according to the pattern: area closure, area start, central bonefire for shortcutsNew element of the series, taken from Bloodborne, is the ability of bosses to change appearance, acquire new abilities and consequently be much more dangerous; Additionally, there is also the presence of bosses ‘Zelda-like’, against which the brute force is not enough, but you must first devise a careful strategy to understand well how to actAnother element that could be included among the defects is the camera; in some situation, especially in narrow zones or against certain bosses, it is not perfect: let's say, during the whole run, we have encountered this problem in five or six situations, certainly not a large number, but that causes many problems in a punitive game like Dark Soul, it will lead you to certain death.One of the concern of the community was the poise, the ability to sustain hits by enemies before you can be staggered out; It seemed to be broken or it did not work as expected, but as Dark Souls 3 reports:‘The value was 'off' by default. It was later discovered by other people that this value was only turned on during what was thought to be hyperarmor frames at the time, and that poise damage is constantly being calculated at all times but you are only able to resist stagger during attacks or actions with hyperarmor frames’ (source: http://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/poise)Another problem encountered during the run is that the game sometimes freezes for few seconds, or completely, which seems to be related in a bug with nvidia drivers; in fact, rolling back drivers and changing some option in control panel helped to reduce a lot this problem   it is always present the possibility to play co op or pvp by placing signs with dedicated stones or using red eye orbs for the invasionsGRAPHICS 8/10The game is a big step ahead; it looks very beautiful, even if the particle details aren’t the best out there Some game zones will make you keep your breath and will be easy to get screenshot for your desktopSome assets are taken from Bloodborne, for the player, this time, is a good thingIt is also well optimized: with the configuration test we have a solid 1080p@60fpsSOUNDS 9/10Sound is almost perfect in every situation, in particular during boss fight where every appearance change is accompanied by sounds change.The sound of the environment is well recreated while some sounds of the undead will freeze your blood in veins             PROS                                                                                           -Gameplay                                                                                 -Graphics                                                                               -Sounds CONS-      Atavistic defects of the series-      Camera in certain situationsFINAL VOTE: 8,5/10"
Positive,"In 2011, my journey began. And in 2017, that journey ended. The original Dark Souls (2011) kindled a relationship with a video game that I had never experienced before. That relationship is stronger than ever, having morphed and strengthened over time across the series’ three iterations. The first game caught my attention, enthralling me in an imaginary universe I had never experienced before, but also tested my metal. The second game continued on the first game’s strengths, but never captivated me like DS1. And now we have the third.In all honesty, I had my reservations about the latest, and final Souls game. Before the game’s release I felt that From Software, the developer of the Soulbourne series, had exhausted their creativity and originality with the first and second games, and thus the third would end up a mere imitation of the series previous outings. But alas, my cynicism was proven wrong. Spoilers aside, this third outing in the series sees players take control of the ‘Ashen One’, a being tasked with bringing a bunch of ‘Lords of Cinder’ to task, thus ending, or beginning anew, the age of fire – a daunting task, as in DS1 & DS2, you yourself became a Lord of Cinder at each game’s conclusion. The game functions and plays exactly as the previous two games. “If the formula aint broke, then no point trying to fix it!” Over +-35 hours you will explore a wide array of environments, defeat enemies, collect souls, consume said souls, and kit out your character with increasingly more powerful items, outfits and weapons, so that you can go and explore more dangerous locales,  defeat even bigger enemies and consume more plentiful souls. This formula is repetitive, but maintains the player’s attention through continuously presenting him/her with increasingly more challenging encounters that require skill, learning, knowledge and, for me at least, pure dumb luck.For some, the Souls games may prove difficult, but I believe the better term is ‘challenging’. Once you have learned the ins and outs of the game’s combat and rpg mechanics you should be good to go. Of the three souls games DS3 does a good job of presenting the player with challenging encounters that never enter the realm of feeling impossible. The only boss that disproves this is Midir, an optional DLC encounter who functions much like other bosses, but has a ridiculous amount of health that can take what feels like eons to whittle down. Moreover, the challenges the bosses present are, arguably, made easier by offering the player options to summon npc characters to help fight most of the games many bosses. On the other hand, your journey is complicated by numerous invasions, whereby npc characters will invade your world and try their damndest to end your life. However, the AI of these invaders leaves a lot to be desired. Most can be easily defeated by stepping backwards after the invader attacks, then darting back in to deliver some damage; rinse and repeat and you’ll destroy any invader. Overall, the choreographed invasions are pretty poor in comparison to what would occur in previous Souls games. Boss fights are the highlight of this game, and they rise to the high expectations set by both DS1 and DS2. DS3 provides a plethora of diverse bosses that range from humanoid warriors to hulking behemoth tree-giants. Each have their own style and atmosphere that never come too close to seeming akin to each other. A major boon for DS3 is that every boss has at least two different phases which force players to often alter their strategy mid-fight in order to compensate for a new phase of attacks or even environment. However, DS3 is quite conservative with regards to the kind of bosses it presents to the player. DS3 does not provide anything close to the alien and strange creatures that can be found in DS1 or Bloodborne; rather most bosses stick to having a humanoid form whilst wielding a large sword- or club-like weapon.To fight these big badass bosses, one needs good equipment. DS3 does a great job at providing a magnificent array of armor sets, weapons and spells. Importantly, the game plays on the nostalgia factor by providing items from past souls games. At one point I was able to kit out my character almost exactly as once done in DS1, as well as DS2. One complaint that I do have with regards to weapons is that the game has a tendency to force the straight and great sword options on the player due to them being so common, prevalent and effective. Both DLCs added much variety to the weapons arsenal, as well as special attacks that can be quite mesmerizing on first sight. Moreover, if arcane warfare is your thing, then DS3 has it covered. Faith, pyromancy and mage builds are supported by a multitude of spells for each school of magic, and are devastating in both PvE and PvP. An integral component of the Souls games is exploration. The DS3 adventure occurs across many well designed environments, each having their very own particular atmosphere and context-specific encounters. From dark dungeons to sky-high castles, putrefying swamps to forgotten caverns, the games does a great job at proving a wide array of areas to explore. Apart from the challenging enemy encounters, the player will interact with several npc characters, some of which will help you out, while others will attempt to hinder your progress. These npc’s are far more expressive than those in previous Souls iterations, with many doing more than just standing around looking glum as in past Souls games. Some of these encounters reveal lengthy questlines, that once completed, have major influence on the overall main story line as well as on a variety of events. This is a welcome advent to the Souls series.Leading from this, we have the lore of the game. Like previous Souls games, little of the game’s overarching narrative is told through direct story telling methods. Rather, the bulk of interesting and enigmatic lore and story comes from item descriptions and thorough inspection and observations within the game world. By just paying extra attention to one’s surroundings, major plot points and supporting content can be uncovered. For those gamers that prefer story flung into their faces through lengthy cut scenes and detailed in-game codex’s, be aware! DS3, as well as all other Souls games, takes a more active rather than passive approach to storytelling.With regards to presentation, DS3 is a beautiful game that successfully brings life to a dark fantasy world. Characters models are well designed and textures are good enough to seem realistic. However, some areas lack the intricate details afforded to others, making for an uneven experience from region to region. Adding to the aesthetic of the game, is the music and sound. DS3 sticks much to what has been done in past Souls games. Adventuring across the game’s world is mostly done in absence of any music score. This and the environmental noise and sound do well to capture the feelings of isolation, loss and entropy. Once a major encounter begins then only does the typical Souls score commence.Overall, Dark Souls 3 is a fantastic entry and end to the Souls series. It may not experiment or adjust the Souls formula as much as some may have hoped for, but it does present a daunting adventure that will challenge anyone willing to take the chance. Personally, I find Dark Souls 3 to be a great Souls game; not quite as good as its older brother Dark Souls 1, or even its demented cousin Bloodborne. But it is a damn fine game in its own right.Score: 9/10"

Positive,"I was initially skeptical as Dark Souls III seemed too easy and linear compared to the first and the second part. Also, I was not too fond of the fact that there's now a lot more fast-paced action instead of slower, methodical, and more tactical combat. Fortunately, I quickly got humbled by my cocky attitude and I found the challenge I was looking for.The game is slightly different from its previous parts, just like DS2 was different from DS1. It's indeed faster and more linear, maybe even more casual, but it doesn't affect the fun that DS3 generously provides. There are quite a few challenging and memorable bosses, the same goes for the areas you visit. I'm not the best at From Software's side quests and I think I haven't finished a single one in this part, but they're definitely there as well.While this is probably my least favorite Souls title from the original trilogy,  it's still one of the best games I have ever played."
Positive,"Awesome game, probably the best out of the Souls series but... I wouldn't recommend it. Atleast not right now. For you see, the devs went overzealous with their anti-cheat system, so much that it bans legit players for no reason. Of course some might think that it is a small price to pay for getting rid of cheaters and hackers, right?WRONG!This does nothing. In fact players have been using hacked weapons to softban legitimate players by giving them more souls than they should have, thus the anti-cheat system labeling them as cheating. All it took was a few slashes and poof, you're banned. Hard to believe, right? Well, go ahead and google it and see for yourself. The one responsible even streamed the whole thing for a couple of hours, soft banning lots of innocent players. Also, lets not mention the other dozen of possible reasons why you might get banned, such as: crashing due to the game's lightning effect bug, going offline advancing in the story and coming back online only for the game to think that you cheated and got more soules than you had before going offline, using a controller program so you can use your favorite controller, just to name a few from the stop of my head.So yes, as awesome as the game is... don't buy it. Not yet, not until the devs fix the shitty anti-cheat system they made and start unbanning all the legitimate players.EDITED: 5/8/2016I felt like I should correct one of my mistakes, in my anger I failed to explain properly that getting softbanned by a hacker isn't instant and for that I apologies for the misinformation. When you get hit by the hacked weapon you can get rid of the surplus souls by suiciding twice which seems to work and might give some measure of relief for those that might fall victim to such people.Even so I can't and won't recommend the game, not until they fix this.EDITED: 30/9/2016Right, now that they solved some of the issues and unbanned players that didn't deserve it I can actually recommend the game."
Positive,"The multiplayer, a core part of this $60 game, is missing and has been missing for months now with absolutely no update on when or if it's coming back.EDIT: Online is back, good game :)"
Positive,try tongue but hole. be wary of of invasions
Positive,"If u had played  previous dark souls ( especially 1/remastered) :  Get the game. It serves as a proper closure to the series and still delivers what makes this series so great . Just go and get it , you will love it . If u haven't play any soulsborne game : Highly recommend you to play Dark souls 1 / Remastered first , if else you will miss certain references and callbacks to previous lore and locations.  I know dark souls games have a bad rep for being overly difficult . That was the factor that turned me away from this series . However when i gave it a try , I think the difficulty is perfectly fine. The game is challenging , without a doubt , but it is designed as such to create a sense of tension. It is similar to how combats in real life usually turns out : a bad decision in a split second / hesitate and distracted in combat would cause death. ( That being said , the game gives you 2 or 3 chances to act for your survival , ""One Hit Kill"" usually does not happen. )The adrenaline rush and the amount of sheer FOCUS you experience throughout the boss fights is one of the two best things this game offers. This game heavily relies of quick decision making and reflex, If you spend too much time lost in the thoughts of your tactics or worrying about the consequences of losing the duel , you already lost the fight.  The second best thing this game offers is the sense of accomplishment that none other game could provide. That is the main appeal of SoulsBorne game , in my opinion.  Never had I jumped out of my chair yelling "" I WON "" and hyperventilate due to adrenaline even the battle has already settled for 15 minutes , Not until I played this Dark Souls 1 and this game , Dark Souls 3 .tl;dr : If you like fighting big dudes and overcoming all odds to achieve victory          If you like the thrill of combat where your actions could result in a victory or defeat in the matter of seconds         If you like epic orchestral music and chants cheering you on when you face off against your enemies          Buy This Game ."

Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is the first Dark Souls game with an actually good PC release.Unlike Dark Souls 1 ans 2 the game is playable with KB+M, you don't need a bunch of fixes and mods to make the game playable, achievements are working, there are Steam cards, it's easy to play with your friends and you don't need to make a pact with the devil to make the online work.I've heard some people are having problems with crashes, stuttering and stuff, but after I changed my lightning to low in the options menu all my problems were fixed.So yeah, it's worth it in my opinion."
Positive,"I am a newcomer to the Dark Souls franchise.From time to time I would stumble upon video or gif of Dark Souls games, But I didn't understand anything. Only thing that I knew is that games are hard. Well I bought Dark Souls 3 and I see why others are hooked. So many secrets, hidden areas and mistery lore that even the biggest Dark Souls fans still try to figure it out. You will be hungry for more and more. Which area is next? What will it bring to you? Which boss is there? What is the lore of this area/monsters/boss? A loot in the distance, how to get to it? Is it maybe rubbish or some cool armor? So many questions.Do yourself a favor and play Dark Souls 3. Play it blind, try not to look at wikis maybe even avoid the CO-OP for your first time through. It'll make victory all the sweeter. <3I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! 10/10"
Positive,"Coming back to Dark Souls 3 after hundreds of hours in Elden Ring has been quite an experience. Originally I played about 65 hours worth of Dark Souls 3 before I dropped it for other things. It was my introduction into the Souls-like genre and it left a decent impression on me, but for one reason or another, I never gave it a second thought. 5 playthroughs of Elden Ring and at least 2 playthroughs of the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC later left me craving something similar, thus we return.Dark Souls 3 represents a key point of growth in the FromSoft catalog, in which we see a much more refined product than its 2 predecessors. That said, it suffers from caveats that FromSoft polished even further for the release of Elden Ring, but I don't believe this lack of polish is a bad thing. If anything it offers a different challenge from Elden Ring. I believe Dark Souls 3 deserves to be played and judged on its own merits because it has been a good experience thus far. 4/5 starsMay the Flames guide thee, Ashen One."
Positive,"at first i thought it was just some hard game set in a boring world, even the graphics didn't seem so appealing back then and i really started to feel regret buying itBut i decided i should give it a fair shot & after playing it for a little bit longer and right after i passed the first few little areas i started to feel some weird attraction to the game in a magical way, and the way i looked at it started changing for the better it was almost like ascending a staircase, a bit hard but really satisfying with every stepthe gameplay feels so smooth & variated, thanks to the ability to use magic & the wide variety of weapons selection making it even more fun and engagingand i also love the way items and secrets are scattered around the map, since it makes you so eager to explore every little corner of the map looking for them, especially since it's filled with all sorts of cool stuff & secrets and even some cool hidden bosses making it impossible for you to ever get bored with the gameand i must say bosses really impressed me here, they are so well crafted and programed, and even though they're so hard to beat, fighting them (and beating them) is fun as hell & really rewarding and satisfyingand what seemes like poor graphics at first turned into some breathtaking scenery later in the game, almost as if they are not from the same game you was playing at the beginning, trully remarcable!also the story & the lore are so interesting, and you also get 4 different endings for iti finished this game 5 times already and it was fun & enjoyable every signle one of them, almost as if i'm playing it for the first time, and i'm still looking forward to play it and finish it even more timesi don't think i'll ever get bored of it because for me at least this game has became the best game i have ever had the pleasure to try in my life                 9,8/10"

Positive,"Dark Soul 1 was gifted by a friend and when we start playing that I already enjoyed it so much, sadly the multiplayer summon option wasnt working that well back than..Ive never seen Dark Souls 2 so far, but probably will soon, and, went on with Dark Souls 3, the game is pretty, a lot of fun and the multiplayer is working better as ever! Good job on that one, the MP is so much more enjoyable.The only thing I do not really like is the level capping since the game has a build in difficulty system for when you go NG+ or higher so it would be pretty do-able to change difficulties when summoning verry high leveled players, but this could be an endless discussion caus there are always down and up sides.I also saw some environments and models back from DS1, which was a nice feeling back to thoose days but I did expect more new models/bosses to be around but I aint complaining at all.The game doesnt feel that long either but this can be on the fact that I summon a lot of friends, progress goes way faster that way.Currently I am in NG+ almost at the end and I will replay it again on NG++, that should say enough on how much I like this game :-)I do recommend it for others to buy aswell and enjoy this game!Be aware if you loose a couple times from a boss, it can become annoying or irritating, taking a break is that best thing I could recommend and try again another time. Eventually you will beat him!Also playing with friends makes the game way more fun and interesting compared as playing alone.Thats all, thanks!"

Positive,"What a journey, it is indeed a beautiful, difficult game. It challenges you since the beginning, but its rewarding and it grow on you, a couple deaths in and you are already hooked up, It has one of the most well designed and hardest Bosses of the series. The story its there for you to find, you must read items and read dialogs to find pieces of information, I think this add to the grueling world of darksouls. This game its a masterpiece, whenever you are fighting a boss, dodging a giant arrow on anor londo or simply invading someone on multiplayer it will leave a memorable moment.Praise the Sun!"
Positive,"[SPOILERS ALERT!!!]""Perhaps, what is the most saddest thing of all is, if you skipped the first Dark Souls to the 3rd to keep ""up to date"", you're not going to feel the same emotional gut-punch that many of us are feeling now.You're not going to feel the seizing of the heart that comes with seeing Anor Londo again. Your not going  to feel the confused emotions seeing Gwyndolins corpse being used as a puppet and finding the corpse of Quelaan; our efforts to save her for naught.The mix of nostalgia seeing the Black Knights again. The Strange curiosity of seeing once fearful demons now left but pile of corpses. Seeing a giant use Gough's bow and the return of the Dark-Wraiths. And of course, the feeling that comes with not only facing our beloved chosen undead, but the feeling of knowing that this, is indeedThe Last Dark Souls.﻿"""
Positive,"A classic from FromSoftware, please give it a shot! A beautifully crafted world with well written lore if you dig into it online. Completed the game & all DLCs and frankly, I'm tempted to start NG+.Although Dark Souls has a reputation for being hard, it's extremely rewarding and is satisfying once everything clicks. Boss fights are intimidating but really fun and there's a huge variety of enemies. Multiplayer is largely well implemented as well, and if it's too hard, there's also co-op available where you could summon a friend so fret not.PS; Buy the DLCs!"

Positive,"Finally, after 110 hours, I have completed my first souls game, taking all the time in the world to truly immerse myself in the world of Dark Souls. This game has done something for me that barely any other game has been capable of doing: making me feel genuinely powerful emotions. This is a game about life and death. If you, like me back in April 2016 on my Xbox, had never played a Souls game before, you'll learn very quickly that death is a frequent occurance. But this game is still  fair . Something that Hidetaka Miyazaki (genius who was the director of DS1 and DS3) said in an interview that has stuck with me is that he doesn't see the game as difficult, but moreso challenging. This way of thinking really changed the way I see games no, and now it's hard for me to go back to other games because of the challenge and sense of accomplishment gained from overcoming a challenge in this game. And that's where the the emotions come into the picture. The intense feelings that I have gotten while fighting (Boss spoilers)  the Nameless King  is something I haven't felt in a boss fight or a fight in any game really. I died so repeatedly while fighting this boss and when I finally slew the bane of mine and many other player's existances [spoilers] (completely optional boss too) [/spoiler] I realized that my hands were shaking, my breaths were fast and shallow, and I was sweating. That 7+ minutes fight made me truly appreciate how amazing this game is. Around this point, which is very late game, is when I really got into the lore of the game, buying Dark Souls 2: SOTFS, and I'm going to pick up the remaster of the original for more stability than the original. This game got me into now one of my favourite series in gaming, as I'm a sucker for good stories and depp lore, this game's world really enthralled me. All in all, this has been such an incredible journey for me, about 2 years down the line, from console to PC to a new Chosen Ash. This game will always have a special place in my heart, and I hope it can do the same for you. This game is so deep and complex it can make some of the most incredible things happen, things that you will remember for years. The way the combat is weighty and slow but still fast-paced and exhilarating is the perfect way to make thrilling gameplay that always has you on the edge of your seat, deciding whether to press on and risk death or to head back to the bonfire to spend your hard-earned souls. This game is phenomenal, and something that I believe is a masterpiece of indirect storytelling, RPG mechanics akin to D&D, and gameplay that makes you feel like you truly accomplished something meaningful. I would recommend this game and the DLC (get them together though, they work so much better together than separate) any day, at full price. This game is amazing."
Positive,"Dark Souls; Greatest Hits Vol 1nah for real, holy moly is this a great game. The art design is absolutely jaw dropping. I don't think anything  could really measure up to how beautiful this game looks. The gameplay, specifically the combat is genius. it just feels right. Every animation is fluid in 60 fps. Trust me, there isn't much to compare to the feeling of beating this game. IMHO this is one of the greatest games ever made."
Positive,I don't even know where to begin with this game. Its AMAZING. Everything is so polished and seamless. I've played this games 6 times over by myself and with friends. It has Skyrim replayability and the online works really well. I cant even explain how much I love it. 10000000000000/10

Positive,"nearly as good as dark souls 1 and absolutely the best bosses in the souls series and its not even close, sully and dancer are immaculate, abyss watchers are an absolute blast, irythill is the most gorgeous zone from has ever made and the gameplay is snappy and flashy. got banned because I used a boss rush mod but it was totally worth it"
Positive,Is this game worth it? yes! Is this game worth it without multiplayer enabled? Some say yes some say no. I would say it is but I highly enjoy multiplayer and the fact that the servers have been offline for what 5 months now? for an RCE exploit that a modder fixed within a couple days and servers are still not back is inexcusable at this point and I feel obligated to give them a negative review. Bring back all the souls games Jolly Cooperation the fix is out just implement it already.Edit*** still not happy with how long it took to restore online services but they have been restored so back to thumbs up
Positive,"I don't usually write reviews because most people couldn't even bother to read them. Despite this, I would say that this is an amazing game that is surprisingly dead for how good it is. The soundtrack is beautiful, each enemy has its own moveset, strengths, and weaknesses. Bosses are even harder versions of the enemies but don't let the bosses fool you, the normal enemies are just as tough. I've died more to enemies before the boss than the bosses themselves. I've beaten this game about 20 times now with a new build each time. That should give you some insight on the replayability. When it comes to mulitplayer it boils down to two things, you either get ganked the moment you spawn in by three players, or you ""git gud"" and kill them. Usually you don't get a straight up 1v1 fight, when you do it is glorious, but most of the time you are getting ganked. The reason behind this is the game has a dedicated community, but isn't really growing. Dark Souls multiplayer is great, in my opinion, being able to fight alongside or against randoms is awesome but yet there is only around 7-10k people playing this game on the WEEKENDS. This is a game that came out 2 years ago? So often during invasions you will have to wait 5-10 mins for a fight only to get ganked. Its a vicious cycle. Graphically its beautiful, simple, not top of the line graphics but good enough to make you appreciate it. The weapons and armor designs are beautiful and mostly practical with a few whacky armor and weapons for those who like ridiculous proportions. Lookin at you STR builds >_> All and all, buy, play, git gud. Dark Souls is intimidating for some but trust me, by your 2nd-3rd playthrough you will be beating the bosses in your sleep. 10/10 game."
Positive,"(English)Well, I can only say this game it's a masterpiece, the  bad thing about DS3, poise it's a pointless thing (weapons with perseverance for a tank it's more useful than a armor itself) and many areas of the game are locked so you have a linear progression ""sort of"" DS1 & DS2 you can take some different paths to progress.The PVE of this game it's the best, IA/hitbox are really well made, although it's more fast paced.The PVP well the PVP can be ""JOLLY GOOD"" or can be a ""Pa!n in hole"", I myself feel disgust to gank ""squats"" specially it's very common to the host quit with ""alt+f4"" when they die, still when u put your summon in Pontiff Sullyvah Arena, i met some really nice bunch of gladiators, so rejoice! Obs: i don't blame host when it's a invasion with invader/s who run around mobs  instead of fight (this too it's shameful).Music of the game are amazing! I really love Soul of Cinder/Introduction theme /Vordt/Abyss Watchers songs it's superb!Weapons/spell balance, arguibly u can beat the game at SL1 using a broadsword without tempering it...Still after you try some weapons out most of the mainstream/good weapons. Have a similar pattern of attack and this can become  a monotonous thing, one good way to avoid this it's making a Mundane build or creating another character(playing another game too). Nevertheless the're some useless thing in the game and you only need to search for them to get achievements.Worth it? Definetely yes. (Português)O jogo é uma obra prima, única coisa ruim é que ele não tem mais a classe de tanque, logo o uso de armas com ""perseverança"" são melhores que armaduras pesadas. O mundo de DS3 é bloqueado se comparado ao mundo de DS1 e DS2 que você podia ter uma progessão não linear da história.Na minha opinião o PVE de DS3 é o melhor da franquia, o hitbox/IA dos inimigos é a melhor, porém ele é fast paced e você pode ter dificuldade de adaptação vindo de um DS antigo.PVP ele pode ser ""jolly good"" com honra e afins, ou pode ser um pvp estilo o patches sem honra e com desgosto, geralmente gankers utilizam disso, não esqueçam de usar o cristal negro de retorno. Pra invasões tmb não é legal invadir um host que ta sofrendo na área, coloque seu sinal em Pontiff Sullyvah/Lothric High Wall e participe de arenas de forma honrada! Já encontrei uns gladiadores muito gente fina tmb.Eu realmente gosto das música desse jogo  Soul of Cinder/Introduction theme/Vordt/Abyss Watchers songs são incriveis. Bom você pode terminar o jogo em SL 1 e usando armas fracas e nao temperadas...Mas, tem algumas armas nesse jogo que não são nada balanceadas e são bem ruins, feitiços também, única ocasião que tu vai precisar de pegar alguma delas, é  pra platinar o jogo.Vale a pena comprar? Sim! Demais, especialmente se tiver uma conexão boa+amigos pra jogar, e também da pra se divertir bastante no solo."
Positive,"This game will make you grind your teeth, and yet you will enjoy every minute of torture it inflicts on you. Every time you die to a boss, you will feel an equal amount of determination as dread. This game has a wonderful balance of Difficulty and pay off. I definatly recommend giving it a try, but be warned; this is not your kingdom hearts."
Positive,"Dark Souls lll:Oh where do i start? As of writing the review i have 171 deaths and have completed the game 5 times to be precise. (Because i am one who writes everything important or stupid down). Now im going to state a few things i found DS3 to be (good and bad) at.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Start: I find the tutorial area to be much more user friendly than DS1. DS2's tutorial area was much like an arena and had a nice feeling when u were doing it. In DS1 there wasn't really a tutorial area at all. They threw u right into the fray even with the small tutorial writings. DS3's tutorial area feels much easier than the first game.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Combat (PVE): While the combat is satisfying when u manage to land a parry and get a riposte. I feel like the AI got slower from the last game. The hitboxes are perfectly in sync and i have never managed to miss a swing at close range on my own world that is. Other than that the PVE is excellent and manages to **** you up at every opportunity you give it. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Difficulty (and Controls): In my opinion the game feels alot easier than the first and second game. Everything is much easier to do now. Now u can perform certain actions like parrying by clicking CTRL in the corner of your keyboard. And jumping is now easier. All u have to do is hold the SPACEBAR and press it again quickly when u want to jump. In DS2 u had to hold the SPACEBAR and sprint while clicking the SCROLL button and SPACEBAR at the same time. (Like seriously who came up with that?) and i do know that u can change the keybindings for the keyboard in the menu. U can not change it for the controller however if u decide to connect one to your computer that is.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Combat (PVP): Just like in the beginning of my review i will say. Where do i start? The absurdly weird and extremely long ranges on some weapons makes me wanna puke in PVP. Yes sadly as far as i know. Every single weapon has reach longer than the weapon itself in PVP. Secondly everyone who invades will get to use estus. Yes ESTUS the one drink who we all love and hate at the same time has returned to the invaders hands. In DS1 invaders had estus and they could drink it but u could easily punish players who heal often. In DS2 invaders had no estus to drink and had to heal using other means (spells or blessings). Also in DS1 and DS2 u had to stand still to drink estus which made it easy to punish. In DS3 u don't stop when drinking but your movement gets down to crawl for a moment but it's easy to drink when out of range even with the weird weapon ranges. One thing they've done right was make it so anyone who invades or gets summoned always have HALF of their estus and not max. And one last thing players who invade or are summoned will always scale to your SOUL level if your SOUL level is below theirs. So be prepared to atleast invest a few points into Vitality so u can atleast survive a hit in PVP on higher levels. Weapons also scale to the host's maximum upgraded weapon. So keep that in mind.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall Rating: 9 / 10 The game was alot of fun. Especially if u can get a friend to play with you. Now to anyone that plans on buying this game for the first time. Prepare to smash keyboards. Alot. Im sure that by the end of this game u will have replaced atleast one or two keyboards if it is your first time playing a SOULS game. Also just give up if u feel like getting frustrated. Walk away and take a break, 30 minutes atleast and then come back to try again. First time i played DS1 i broke several keyboards and at the start of DS2 i was still mildly annoyed. At the beginning of DS3 i came back into a series that i had bad experiences with and remained calmed. Because what i learned from the first and second game was that patience is most rewarding for those who wait.Now should u get the game? If your answer is YES then prepare for JOLLY CO-OPERATION. If your answer is NO then i have nothing to say to that actually and respect your decision.Also thanks alot to  This Fucker  who helped me translate since apparently i ******* **** at english. Give that guy like (dislike) for his nice work."

Positive,"I just played this game because of research purpose, I never play any souls-like genre anymore after PS2-era but I have experience in some hardcore action games and I think I'll like and able to beat this game.But, after playing for 3-4 days, I found that I am not the ""target player"" because it makes me so tired. I like to do an exploration in many games, but here, it is very punishing, even more than the boss fights, especially when you dropped much souls in the middle of your journey.I tried playing it again until I managed to kill several bosses, because I still like the storyline, and ""research purpose"" of course. Then, the more I tried it, the more curious I became, I also thought that I had learned about how to beat this game and it turned out to be fun for me, like a rhythm games that I really love. I got the intention of this game that sometimes you have to lose because you need to know the enemy patterns more, while you still feel the enemy is beatable if you try more.What I also like here is there are lots of interesting hidden things, when you find them you will be even more interested. The lore itself is told indirectly which is cool for me. The consequences of your actions are also something I've never encountered in other games, like you can lose NPCs and their features for the entire session if you like, to kill them for example, or not do something before.I want to play previous Dark Souls series to know the whole story but I'm afraid that I won't be able to enjoy the controls, based on my friend's story and it's a very old game. Maybe I'll try Elden Ring next (which I think is also good for my next research), whose controls (or perhaps difficulty level) have been ""made easier"" from this DS3 and also makes me more confident that I can beat it easily compared to DS3. XD"
Positive,"From what I've played so far (3 hours in), this game is looking to be pretty amazing. It's Dark Souls, for sure. It seems to take the best of each game and then combine them into one super-game. I love it, personally. Now there are drops in framerate that seem ridiculous considering my system specs, but I'm sure that will be fixed."

Positive,One of the Best games i have ever played ... Dark souls 3 is immersive with a dark story ... Difficult and unforgiving gives the players specialy the new comers a tough chalange that most can't handle . Persistance and adaptation is the key here ... Anyway this game was a great atmospheare with a rich hidden lore .. everything happens  for a reason .  I would like to thank a friend for buying this one for me ... enjoyed it as Jolly co-op and as pvp . Great game with a lot of variety. Must have for tryhards!!!I would Praise the Sun till the fire fades !! 10/10
Positive,"Personally, Dark Souls 3 has the best story and second best level design in the series after the original one. The game really doubles down on weapon and armor variety that leaves you satisfied. Anyone can find a playstyle that suits them better. Compact level design pushes players into various events in each area that needs you to carefully dissect otherwise seemingly impossible challenges. Gameplay revolves around more dodging and favors offensive playstyle as enemies are much more aggressive and fast compared to previous titles. The base game is well crafted and executed but I can't say the same for the DLCs. DLCs feel like they don't want you to engage in the combat and just run through everything. The game encourages you to react strategically and use your brain but DLC pushes you so much that after dying in some areas, you don't want to kill those 40 enemies that take 15 mins to go through again. They clearly went overboard here. It was fun for me to kill em all in the first run and then I sprinted past them. So be wary about this.But the good part about the DLC is that the bosses are particularly well done and does the game favor greatly. Extremely hard bosses that requires strict management and knowledge of the game's mechanics that makes you fully use everything to get past. Almost every major encounter in the DLCs are memorable, so at the end, downsides are forgivable.Possibly the best pvp mechanics of the series here. Multiple factions attacking and defending each other, it's total chaos that always ends up as an exhilarating experience through and through. Absolutely brilliant soundtrack as icing on the cake. Definitely recommended and a must play of the souls genre."
Positive,"DS3 is definitely the toughest among the 3 in the series. Devs took the best parts from DS1 and DS2 and merged them in DS3. The normal enemies are quite tough but on the contrary most bosses are easy. A lot of things from DS1 are mentioned here and that makes the journey quite reminiscing.  This makes DS3 a true successor of Dark Souls 1. The created world is beautiful and at the same time full of evil.Loved both the DLCs. The transition of difficulty from the base game to the DLCs are very much noticeable. Ringed City is the hardest as well as the most entertaining part in the entire game. Kept getting squashed by Midir and Gael again and again until cooking up some strategies and having some luck.The graphics, tone of the world, and music are top class. Also the occasional ambushes are enjoyable. Loved every moment of this game as I completed it thrice :)"
Positive,"Live. Die. Repeat. Curse some, but never stop playing.I finished this game on PS4 and I got it as a gift (fitting, I must say) on steam. Superb gameplay, which borrows some of its characteristics from Bloodborne.However, be mindful of its multiplayer. After Elden Ring launched earlier this year, the servers suffered. Also, steam removed multiplayer as its characteristics, and online play is not available, which is a bummer, while also being very important in a souls game.With that setback in mind, I must say that Dark Souls III is a superb game. But if you want to play multiplayer, maybe now is not the time for that..."

Positive,One of the greatest games i ever played. It is the best Dark Souls game ever. A really good finale to the series. It's got some of the most immersive and graphically impressive enviroments. The art design and sound are top notch. Enemy & the bosses variety is well done. Masterpiece ♥️
Positive,"- It's the third Dark Souls game.- It feels like a steady progression in game play from 1 to 3, with the exception of Dual Wielding which was far more open in using (nearly) any two weapons rather than Dual Sets.- The interconnected maps and shortcuts of DS1 have made somewhat of a comeback after their absence in DS2, and there is genuinely a return to beautiful architecture.- Co-operative play through summons is the easiest it's been in the series, and 4 to 6 player PvP is not unusual- There are a HUGE number of NPC questlines and AI invaders.- The game is GORGEOUS. giant vistas, surprisingly colorful.- Shield Blocking multiple attacks makes a huge comeback after DS2's Block & Roll paradigm- DS3 Poise is unlike Poise in previous games; it is still being researched in the forums. - Dual Wielding, while still viable in DS3, had far superior options in DS2.- It feels like a decent combination of the world/lore/layout of Dark Souls 1 with the mechanics/combat/builds of Dark Souls 2- Note: DS3 runs considerably worse on my system than DX11 DS2 SotFS.Update1: the first DLC, while fun, felt short, especially compared to DS2 DLC.Update2: the second DLC makes up for the length of the first, with around 1.5 areas, and 4+ bossesUpdate3: in 2018 this is still the best PLAYING of the various Souls-esque games. I haven't played Bloodbourn but I'm still including it."
Positive,"I didn’t finish Dark Souls 2 because of the weird controls and no support for controller remapping (a big deal for me). So, I jumped straight from Dark Souls 1 to 3, and found Dark Souls 3 to be a major step up from an already solid game.The level design in Dark Souls 3 is much more refined compared to Dark Souls 1, where some areas felt utterly unfair. While the map is more linear in Dark Souls 3, it still offers great interconnectivity without being overly complicated. This makes exploration and navigation a lot more enjoyable. More importantly, though the map is not as sophisticated as Dark Souls 1, it gives players a clearer idea of where to start, helping them avoid accidentally stumbling into high-difficulty areas. Plus, the boss arenas are closer to bonfires, so no more long, annoying runs back after dying.I wasn’t a fan of the final boss in the first DLC - I found the second phase unnecessary and a bit messy. However, Dark Souls 3 features very solid boss design, even surpassing Elden Ring in overall quality. While Dark Souls 1 undeniably has the best opening of any From Software game, I really enjoy the lore in Dark Souls 3, which expands the world and has tons of callbacks to the first game. These references either continue or conclude some of the original lore, making it my favorite part of the game.In my opinion, Dark Souls 3 is nearly perfect, but the ridiculous enemy spam in the DLCs can ruin the experience. In DLC 1, it feels like the developer forgot about balance and just crammed enemies into every corner. DLC 2 is slightly better, but the enemy encounters from the Ringed Inner Wall to the next bonfire are frustrating and over the top. The camera tracking can also get messy and disorienting at times, and the short lock-on range can often disappear mid-fight, leading to serious frustration.And why the hell doesn’t this game have cloud save?Despite those issues, Dark Souls 3 is a must-play for anyone interested in the genre, blending challenging yet fair gameplay, refined level and map design, and captivating lore. It is the textbook example of a souls-like game, where the core features of the genre come into their own."

Positive,"Ignore my lack of achievements and low play time. I played this to death on ps4 back when it came out. When i switched to PC a few years ago i was lycky to pick this game ylup on sale. Dark Souls 3 is worth your money if you like Dark Souls 1. Or just a fan of souls in general. Game is easily the most accessible of the trilogy, but still very challenging,  despite the abundance of bonfires. You literally get on after beating a boss, and then get another one after taking ten steps. Still game is fantastic,  Fromsoft are goated. Bandai kind of sucks for not lowering the price of this game or the rest of the series. They should not be $60 at this point. And they don't offer as good of sales from when i bought them. Even if the games are worth it, still kind of scummy."
Positive,"Allright, this game is great. The world might not be as good and interconnected as DS1, but that's one of the only gripes I have about this game.The combat is way better with more options, more tension, and way better balanced than the older games. It just works more as intended which feels amazing.The levels are really well designed with shortcuts and good enemy placementsThe areas look cool and have good enemy varietyThe bosses are amazing to fight with a few exceptions, like the wyvernsThe music is the best in the series, imoI will talk about the dlc on its own:Ashes of ariandel:I love this dlc, it might just be a single area, it is a damn good one. The enemies are cool, it tells a real story, it looks great.I love the end boss too, very cool fight even with how hard it is. Truely amazing dlc. Some people say it's too short, but I'd say it's worth it.Ringed City:I feel a bit more mixed about this dlc, While I really like the new enemies, the lore, the areas and the bosses, all amazingI had some problems with some of the enemy placements, where it felt like they just threw a whole bunch of strong/annoying enemies in one place, fuck you deal with it. This is the only problem I have with it however, so if you can deal with a tiny bit of that, this dlc is still amazing."
Positive,"I bought this game with all its DLCs for about 5 Dollar (approximately 3 years ago). It was a great misfortune for my first close combat game to start with the Dark Souls series because when I first started the game, I couldn't really muster the patience. One day, at the insistence of a friend, I tried installing the Cinders mod, which makes the game a bit easier, and I played the game for about 5 hours in one sitting. The game had started to addict me. I quickly finished the game with Cinders; I deleted the mod and started playing vanilla. The game had started to draw me in more; both in terms of story and gameplay. I finished the game once, it wasn't enough, I finished it a second time, it still wasn't enough, and so on. I finished the game with vanilla version 4 times playing with Cinders once, and it still wasn't enough. Right now, I'm playing the Convergence mod. This review will be for the Vanilla version.As you all know, the Dark Souls series is a straightforward melee combat game, in other words, a pure fighting game. What was present in the previous games holds true for Dark Souls 3 as well, but there are some changes in certain aspects. 1-  The most noticeable point while playing is that the Estus drinking animation is shorter compared to Dark Souls 2, and we can move while doing it. 2-  The roll mechanic works much smoother than Dark Souls 2, and the hitboxes are much more precise. 3-  I don't know if I need to mention this, but the visual effects of the bosses are truly amazing. 4-  The gameplay of bosses like Soul of Cinder, Pontiff Sulyvahn, Sister Friede, Abyss Watchers, and many others is truly beyond amazing and provides incredible satisfaction. 5-  The feeling of landing hits is much better than Dark Souls 2. (You don't feel like you're hitting a boss with butter anymore.) 1-  As everyone would agree, not being able to use some boss weapons or mimic their moves. 2-  Farron Keep (I don't need to say anything else, those who have played it understand what I mean, and those who will play it will understand when they get here.) 3-  Playing as a sorcerer in this game is a real struggle.The Dark Souls series focuses on three main themes:-What fire is, as in ""Dark Souls 1""-Hollows, as in ""Dark Souls 2""-The fading of fire, as in ""Dark Souls 3""This game revolves around the fading of fire, and it accomplishes this exceptionally well. It's a classic move by our brother Miyazaki; he tells stories in an understated manner. It's easy to do that, but it's hard to engage the audience and stoke their curiosity to this extent. Normally, I would never finish a story-driven game five times or even attempt a sixth, but this game arouses so much curiosity in you that you find yourself thinking, ""What if I play like this?/How fast can I finish it with this build?/I think I missed something, let me check again/The fight with this boss was so amazing..."" Just like me, it captivates many of my friends, and if you've played and finished this game with enthusiasm, it captivated you too, my friend. There's no point in empty fanboying here; the game is genuinely great. Although some parts - especially the dogs - are extremely frustrating, the game somehow manages to keep you glued to the screen.On the other hand, the game is moddable. The mods created by modders allow you to experience this game. Now you might say, ""But you're basing this review on mods too."" I'm not talking about how great the mods are, otherwise I'd go and write this under the mods made by those modders. What I mean is that the depth and beauty of the themes, NPC designs, level designs, story, bosses, and many other possibilities provided by mods make them deeper and more beautifully themed.This review covers both modding and the general aspects of the game. I compared it to previous games in some aspects, and you can clearly see the huge improvements. The game's dark theme, its exceptional depiction of the final leg of the Dark Souls story adventure, unique boss battles, fantastic/smooth gameplay, the ability to instill such a deep sense of curiosity, and the extensive and beautiful modding possibilities. In my opinion, this game deserves a 9 out of 10. I strongly recommend it to those considering buying it. When you get the game, lean back and savor the spirit of challenge and the joy you'll feel when you finally defeat that boss despite the difficulties.Note: I wish they'd explain the controls of this game with keyboard icons rather than Xbox ones..."
Positive,Praise the Sun!
Positive,who made dogs huh?
Positive,"So nice I bought it twice. Imported it for the Xbox One, played through it about four times. Beautiful game, shitty Xbox version due to the 900p 30fps frame drops (yes, really). Absolutely a gem of a game, right up there for GOTY for me with Persona 5. The soundtrack is probably my favorite, but the best Souls game is easily Dark Souls. However, DS3's port is so much better that i'd have to recommend it over 1 or 2. Pros- Top tier music, as always- Summoning is at it's best, it's not off and on like in other Souls games- The max HP reduction from DS2 is gone. That was and will always be a horrible idea. Dark Souls is about skill first, then trial and error. To punish a player for dying and trying to learn from mistakes was a fuck up on FromSoft team B's part. - The landscapes. Jesus. It's really so beautiful, especially at the throwback location (won't spoil it) after the chapel. Cons - Gimmicky boss fights. Not saying they all are, but Yhorm? Really??? The deacons? Why even give them a boss health bar? Pointless fights, even if one was a reference to Demon's Souls. - Length. For the final game in the series, this game was not long enough. You could just tell they were going to release DLC, you could feel it after beating the game. Though the ending does tie everything up (kinda, not really) there's just not enough substance there for it to feel like a full game. - Continuity. Remember in DS1, how everything was connected? From firelink to anor londo, to practically anywhere, the game told you how you got there, and about 90% of the time, you could even see the places you were, or will be soon. It felt great, kind of reminded me of Ocarina of Time. This begs the question, why was DS1 the only game that had this? Dark Souls 2 was all kinds of fucked. They had a poison gas swamp below a volcanic dungeon, a castle that just leads into a dragon's den (how convinent), and the DLC doesn't explain how you get there. You kind of just warp. Plus the DLC is even cheaper than the base game. But that's irrelivant to the point. - Difficulty. Maybe it's playing and finishing all the Souls games, but this game was damn easy. No, not in the way Gwyn is supposed to be, I mean beating the abyss watchers on the second try, before any guides were even out for the game, in a blind run. Why is High Lord Wolnir, arguably one of the coolest fucking souls bosses ever, easier than the Capra Demon, a boss an hour into the first game??? The ancient dragon, pre-patch, was one of the hardest Souls bosses in DS2.  In this game, you kill a dragon with a plunge attack. A FUCKING PLUNGE ATTACK??? The only bosses I raged on was nameless king, because the camera was glitching out, an issue quickly fixed by fromsoft. The final boss whooped my ass too for about a dozen deaths or so. I didn't really rage at that though persay, it was actually the classic DS great feeling of being killed, but learning something each time about the boss' move set. Overall, Dark Souls III is lacking in some aspects, but to me, it's almost as good as the first because of the music, art style, and hours of enjoyment and satisfaction it did give. If I had to make a list of best to worst, it would go like this; DS> BB > DS3> DS2> DemonsSouls > DS2SOFS"
Positive,"Game: DARK SOULS IIIGenre: Fantasy Action RPGDeveloper: FromSoftwarePublisher: BANDAI NAMCOCopy supplied by GamestopDARK SOULS III is an action RPG and the last game in the Souls serie, developed by FromSoftware and published by BANDAI NAMCO. I can easily say that this is currently my GOTY.Dark Souls 3 takes place in a transitory place, revolving around the first flame and the cycle of fire and dark. You play as a protagonist whose goal is to find and return the five Lords of Cinder to their thrones at Firelink Shrine in order to link the flame again. The protagonist is known as an ""Unkindled,"" a being considered less of a being than an Undead who is made from the remains of an Undead warrior who failed to link the flame and, as a result, burned their bodies into ash.The game does not have direct storytelling: no one spills what is happening to you, there is no quest menu, and the few cutscenes that you watch do not usually feature any dialogue. If you want to understand the story, you must examine the environment, read the description of each item, and go on the Wikia page to comprehend the lore.I honestly love this type of apporach, since you can easily avoid any type of story and just focus on the gameplay. But I find it near impossible that a player doesn't care about the backstory of the places that he visits or the enemies that he fights.First of all: the game has frame drops that are always between 30 and 60FPS, but it never ruined the gameplay and it was barely noticable most of the times.The design of each area is gorgeous and rich of details: beautiful vistas, gothic cathedrals, burning villages, poisonous swaps... Exploring this decaying world is a joy, also thanks to the excellent enemy design inspired (mostly) by Bloodborne, without feeling derivative. The bosses that you fight are also intimidating and full of different movesets that change mid-way through the fight.Character creation has been improved, with basically the same editor of Bloodborne, but I recommend using the preset characters without many changes, unless you prefer to have an hilarious purple knight with green hair, red beard and a constant grin on his face.I highly recommend playing with a controller, even though the k/m controls have been improved. The gist hasn't changed: you can equip swords, spears, knives, shields, magic and many more in each hand, and you can use certain items. The Estus Flask recovers your HP, while the new Ashen Estus Flask recovers your FP (used for magic and special attacks), and the both fill each time you visit a bonfire, which works as Fast Travel and Respawn point.Each time you die, you lose your souls (that are both currency and XP), and you can recover them by going back to the place where you died, otherwise they'll be lost forever. There are Estus Shards and other items that can be used to improve your character's stats and items. You can go back to Firelink Shrine, which acts as your HUB, where you can talk to multiple NPCs and buy new items and upgrade weapons.There is also the multiplayer component which makes the game excellent: you can summon other players to help you fight bosses and get through difficult areas, or you can summon Dark Phantoms (who can also invade you while playing) to engage in some PvP.This is easily the perfect Souls game: everything has been improved, the combat is a bit faster (though not as fast as Bloodborne), and playing is just way more fun than in the other Souls games.The game is extremely challenging: every enemy that you encounter has the potential of killing you, and you must focus on each encounter to avoid getting hit. The boss fights are the hardest part of the game, but the true achievement of the developers is that they never feel impossible and unfair. If you die, it is your fault only: maybe you didn't dodge at the right moment, maybe you used too many Estus Flasks earlier, but it never is because a boss is designed to be nearly impossible (except for the Nameless King, screw him).The sound effects and the noises of the monsters are great as always. The voice acting is a bit over-the-top most of the times, with the famous sarcastic laughter at the end of almost every NPC conversation. The soundtrack that plays only during boss fights is top-notch: it makes each encounter feel epic, and at the same time it also scares you and makes you feel as if all hope is lost.The game is going to last you for a long time: there is PvP, coop, and multiple New Game+ modes that will keep you entertained, as well as secret areas and bosses to fight.Overall, DARK SOULS III is an excellent video game, and, in my opinion, the best game in the franchise. It is hard, fun, long, more accessible, and highly replayable. A must buy for every gamer out there, even at full price.Follow me on Twitter: @nickygra97Subscribe to my channelLike on Facebook[www.facebook.com]Join my Steam group"
Positive,"Yeah yeah, best Cockfight simulator i've ever played."
Positive,"Best game in the Souls series in many ways.  While the level design in 1 is superior, 3 comes close to that in quality.  As for combat, FROM has learned and taken the more responsive combat from 2 and improved upon that, making this the best technical experience in the series.  With months of support post-launch and a new DLC coming out next month, this is a finely tuned experience that is more than worthy of the Dark Souls franchise."

Positive,"I'm having a blast with this game. Even though I'm a bit late for the party, there are still players who invade, duel, gank, coop. So much joy invading or being invaded and always getting stuck in all sorts of funny situations, getting ganked, betrayed by the other invader, every now and then encountering some toxic player which spices things up, making me crack my knuckles and say something along the lines of ""Oh yeah..? Just you wait, I'll show you, you little **** or owning 3 phantoms and the host 1 by 1. Getting revenge and giving them all the point down.."
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 was the game I had been eager to play for a long time, even before I had a PC, and I was so glad to finally be able to play this masterpiece. The game boasts the best quality among the three, having the privilege of being the latest in the trilogy. The best part for me was undeniably the bosses, Dark souls 3 has the most enjoyable fights in the entire series. While I acknowledge that the game failed to surpass its predecessors in certain aspects, such as the masterfully crafted world design and atmospheric brilliance of Dark Souls 1 and the intricate lore of Dark Souls 2, I didn't mind the simplicity. Besides, the game has excellent level design. I just admire the game's aesthetics; the art direction just won me over, as expected from a FromSoftware game. Music in this game is simply iconic. The haunting melodies and intense orchestral pieces add depth to every encounter, making each moment very memorable. The DLCs just elevate the game's experience, which is a consistent trend throughout the entire series. And if you care, I want to say that I took (and finished) the 'Dark Swols' challenge, where you do push-ups when you die, and I am kind of proud of it. (lol) The game concluded the series in the best possible way, cementing Dark Souls as my favourite game trilogy of all time. Praise the Sun!"
Positive,"This game is brilliant. It takes all the parts of the original, mixes it with some ideas from Dark souls 2, and then takes the mastery of combat and atmosphere from Bloodborne and creates a masterpiece. I of course think there are a few problems with the game, especially because it's AAA game, but it is as close to perfect as I expect from a videogame.It's my favorite game to date, and it really feels like it's an improvement from Dark souls 1, mostly because of the bigger budget, better tech and more development time.The game looks great, even though it has some freezes here and there, which doesn't surprise me since this is a namco game. They are not known for good PC ports sadly, but this one feels more solid, which probably is because of the backlash from ports they have made in the past.All the different builds and classes have been balanced out. Now you can choose between how many Ashen Estus flasks (They restore mana) and how many Estus Flasks you want. This means that magic is a lot more useful.Weapons also have weapon arts, that basicly use up mana to do cool things like buffing you, penetrating shields and more! Shortbows can now also be good for long ranged combat and have special weapon arts so you can quickly do damage from a far with the cost of losing mana.This means that all builds use mana, and I even, who focused on DEX and Vigor, ended up using some pyromancies to give my sword fire damage and make me more resistant to fire. At the same time pyromancies are now scaled so the most awesome pyromancies require you to level up in intelligence and faith. In the original game, pyromancy was great for every build, which I honestly found irritating, since it made it so everyone used pyromancy. Something that i found got a litte repetitive.You can also speed up spellcasting with rings and putting points into dexterity which is great for sorcerers!This is great in my opinion! I love the fact that an armor is usefull to begin with. Even though taking care of your character and making them as powerful as you can is a great part of the game, having a new armor set and being able to just use it the minute you get is great!The locations in Dark Souls 3 are very diverse, though sometimes it seems like they are just trying to play with your nostalgia. I won't mention the locations, since spoiling it removes the fun, but just be sure to know that if you have played the original dark souls, you will be happy to see all the old locations, but also feel a little irritated. Though overall the locations are great and there are of course hidden areas with bosses and loot!The bosses are great! Some of they require a lot of skill, some of them not so much. Though generally I found them to way better than dark souls 2's bosses. Though in my opinion dark souls 2 was shit. I would say that they are about as good as dark souls 1's. They better fight in the technical department, but they a little less memorable. Luckily the bosses are all new, and are not just new versions of old bosses. They are a fun, challenging and satisfying. There is one boss in the game that comes up in the middle of the campaign that i found to be way too hard. Probably the only boss i can't without help.The game has a few issues though. This is mostly because of the mutiplayer. Firstly there is a bug that makes it so players lack animations. This normally also means that if you are invading or co-oping with another player, all the enemies in their world have no animations and won't be able to hurt you.I have recently seen it way less, so maybe they have fixes it.Another problem is that apparently you can't play mutiplayer if you have a VAC ban. I am not entirely sure how it works, since i experienced no problems in that field. Though if you have a VAC ban i would recommend not buying the game at it's current state, unless you are fine with not being able to player mutiplayer.A thing that i found was done surprisingly well were the warping bonfires. Normally shortcuts make you use older bonfires since they are all of sudden close to areas and bosses and I found that there are a lot of shortcuts compared to the original. The shortcuts are less about making the traveling time between areas shorter though and more about making the individual areas feel connected. It did feel like some areas got less used, but honestly it was not a big problem for me, and it felt like it was a thing that the development team wanted to get right.There are a lot of things to go into, but generally this game rocks! It's not as hard as people say, it just requires a little patients and being open to failing. If you don't fail you will never succeed. It has some problems that I find to be really irritating, but most of them will probably be fixed in patches.Enjoy dying, I know i did, and have fun exploring the world of dark souls!"
Positive,"This game is really fun but it's been months with the servers down which means all the multiplayer aspects of the game are simply gone, which is too bad because, by design, that's a significant part of the game. When servers are back up I'll give it a positive review.EDIT: The servers are back up after the better part of a year, but hey it's an amazing game and now with full functionality. I can fully recommend you get this game as long as you like a challenge."
Positive,Best game I ever owned for 3mins.
Positive,praise the sun
Positive,It's a nice game
Positive,"Since my pc sucks, this game is a nice alternative to Elden Ring."
Positive,i love this game because i hate myself
Positive,do you want to off yourself but you dont have enough of a reason?BOY DO I HAVE THE PRODUCT FOR YOU!
Positive,"I put in 125hrs within 2+ weeks of launch and 100%'ed the game with about 3.5 playthroughs (SL:111). So damn addictive and freaking good. Its almost as good as Dark Souls 1, which i consider to be the best game with the souls formula (including Bloodborne). PvP was a damn blast this time around. A+++ and A MUST BUY.Now bring on the DLC and hopefully it will be as awesome as Artorias of Abyss / Old Hunters."
Positive,"From a technical, graphical and mechanical standpoint, Dark Souls III is the most impressive in the trilogy. It's a fantastic game and just like the previous two, I love it.That being said..I had significantly more fun with Dark Souls II when PvP is taken into account, with better options for armour and weapons + power-stances, though Soul Memory sucked & phantom range was something else. When it comes to PvE, the original Dark Souls, even with all of it's faults taken into account and a clear-cut lack of budget in the second half, captivated me far more than Dark Souls III ever managed to do. From the music, to the NPCs / characters, to the sense and feeling of dread and despair and immersion, the world connectivity and more. The original felt like a ""world to get lost in"" whereas DSIII feels like ""levels to get through"" and the bonfires everywhere really did eliminate that sense of dread for me. Dark Souls II was guilty of this too as well, but it felt somewhat egregious in Dark Souls IIINone of this is to say that Dark Souls III is a bad game by any means, it's a wonderful experience that I feel everybody should have at least once. Ringed City was also a fantastic addition that sits right up there with the likes of Artorias of the Abyss and just above Crown of the Old Iron King. It also has an amazing OST and as I've said, it's the best looking and functioning game of the trilogy no doubt. I just prefer the prior two more, the original as mentioned for it's PvE & Dark Souls II for it's approach to PvP.It is absolutely worth experiencing, it will never not be worth the asking price, same can be said for all three games.For clarification, my Steam playtime is a drop in the ocean. Owned and played at launch on console and I own it on both the PS4 & Xbox One as well. My ownership on Steam is merely to enjoy it with some friends, thus smaller playtime. I've had my fill of DSIII already, significantly so.Edit - rewording - Thanks for the jesters, I love me some free points."
Positive,"If the first Dark Souls depicted a world gracefully drifting towards the apocalypse, Dark Souls 3 shows one on a spiraling feverish descent directly into it. It's a fierce and punishing behemoth of a game that dares you to take a step forward before knocking you back again, and again, and again. I always felt compelled to come back eager for that familiar thrill of overcoming even the most exacting challenges. Beyond a few disappointing boss fights Dark Souls 3's epic scale, aggressive obstacles and rich lore make it the grandest and fiercest Dark Souls adventure yet.Exploration is the cornerstone of this series and Dark Souls 3 does a lot to reward an inquisitive and thorough nature. You could spend hours in a single area diligently investigating every dark corner or side road and be consistently rewarded with some interesting story revelation, new gear, mini bosses and even entire secret areas. The Kingdom of Lothric and the lands that lie beyond also contains some of the most visually striking places developer From Software has ever created even if many of them do end up feeling like rehashes of familiar locales (spoiler) such as Anor Londo. Its world isn't as largely interconnected as that of Dark Souls 1 but individual areas still  weave their own branching paths together seamlessly creating twisting mazes of overlapping passages and shortcuts that were a joy to lose myself in. Art of the kill The brutality of Dark Souls 3’s worlds and the beasts that roam there are matched only by its vicious new weapon arts which add variety and style to an already strong combat system. One moment I'm crushing enemies with the devastating weight of my great sword and the next I'm turning the giant hunk of curved steel into a graceful propeller of destruction. Some of the most awesome looking weapon arts and one of the most impressive strides in Dark Souls 3’s combat in general come out of its dual wielded weapon sets. One great sword and dagger combo in particular lets you perform several wide sweeping slashes before delivering a final midair blow. You can also quickly lock onto new enemies mid chain prioritizing dangerous or vulnerable individuals in a mob to maximize the effect of your attacks. Having access to this versatile arsenal of destruction is handy because Dark Souls 3’s roster of relentless horrors hit harder and sometimes faster than ever. Enemies are unusually crowded and agile and AI invaders fight with the speed and aggression of a skilled PvPer. This added a new but welcomed layer of challenge as well as some great opportunities to make the most of my weapon arts. I found myself approaching combat situations with even more caution and planning than Dark Souls usually requires and I also kept several types of weapons reinforced for dealing with all manner of foe. The titanite I used to upgrade weapons is extremely plentiful in Dark Souls 3 so not much farming is necessary to keep those handy options ready. Lords of Cinder Dark Souls 3 experiments a lot more with the bossfight structure as well. Boss fights have multiple phases now in much the same way blood-borne does. New move sets and sometimes a brand new health bar halfway through boss fights kept the tension mounting and prevented me from getting lazy with my tactics. Some of these bosses have well placed weak spots that must be targeted to deal damage while other times they require a bit more puzzling to take down. Those were always interesting and concept but more often than not resulted in fights that felt underwhelming. Taking down a hulking giant in four hits is a waste of an awesome boss design even if the method is pretty cool. But overall the awe-inspiring designs, moves, music and lore implications make Dark Souls 3’ boss battles incredibly memorable and sometimes even surprising experiences. Verdict If Dark Souls 3 truly is the last in the series as we know it then it's a worthysend-off. Weapon arts allows stylish and versatile new moves without tarnishing the purity of the combat system. Lothrics awe-inspiring locations provide visually stunning arenas for rigorous exploration and fierce face offs with hosts of deadly enemies and even deadlier bosses. While not all the risky changes land as neatly as others, Dark Souls 3 is a powerful journey and the sequel the Dark Soul series truly deserves."
Positive,"DS3 feels like it was created to be, at the very least, an extended stopping point for the series.  With three games in less than five years, I imagine FromSoftware is going to let this series sleep for a while and DS3 serves an excellent stopping point, though there's still a couple of DLC left, and no developer does significant DLC better than FromSoft.I'll touch on some of the main aspects of the game.  As you already probably know, fast travel is in from the start, a la DS2.  Unfortunately, this means world connectivity is DS2-styled rather than DS1.  Fortunately, the level design is outstanding.  The levels are consistently smart with shortcuts, enemy layout and secrets and there's even a couple of cool optional areas.  There are very few signs of the time crunch that plagued later DS1 areas and there's a lack of the some of more uninspired area design choices of DS2. I've seen some complaints about the number of bonfires, though it didn't really feel like an issue while playing the game and is mostly inflated by each boss area getting a bonfire after beating them, so you end up with a few post-boss bonfires that are very close to the where the next section begins.  It feels like FromSoft decided to add bonfires for each defeated boss late in the process so the player never runs into a situation where they die before they can use their souls.  Still, there a number of bonfires that grouped close together, but they're more there for convenience sake rather than making areas easier.That ties into another aspect of the game, the return of the level-up mistress and area hub in the style of DS2.  Some people really like having everything in one place that's basically a ""safe"" zone, but I find it takes away from the game's atmosphere and a nuisance to have to fast travel to a hub to level-up or upgrade weapons.  For me, it hurts the sense of adventure and isolation of an area to have to return to the hub so often, especially mid-level.  The hub characters you interact with most also have extremely limited dialogue, so you don't get much from interacting with them.Next, bosses and enemy design is great both visually and mechanically.  Very little DS2-style large humanoid that rotates on its axis!  Most bosses have multiple phases and they're easily the best designed group in the series.  There's only a couple of duds and they're not nearly as poor as the weaker ones found in the first two games. DS3 is also much better at denying players from simply circling to the right against random enemies.  The first encounter with a knight will punish the player for doing this and force the player to adapt different tactics since the enemy AI is significantly improved at dealing with this type of behavior.  It's probably the most difficult game in a fair way in the series.  I probably died more in DS2 but that's largely because of some poor enemy layouts that favor extreme leashing and quantity of enemies rather than a ""true"" sense of difficulty.  I don't ever try to kite stuff in these types of games so maybe my experience in fighting large groups of enemies varies widely from yours, but DS3's multiple enemy challenges are very well-done and the best in the series.  It also has the best difficulty curve in the series, with each new area and boss being just a bit harder than the previous one and this lasts practically the entire game.Visually, enemy/boss design is outstanding.  There a number of times I was impressed with how even the most generic of enemies either looked or acted.  There are just some great looking enemies.  Environmental design looks amazing too, with a couple of vistas that are stunning to look at, with one reveal in particular probably serving as the most impressive looking intro to an area in the series.In short, DS3 is an great game, and while I don't think DS2 is bad (more disappointing than anything), this feels more like the type of sequel that the original deserved.  Though DS1 is one of my favorite games ever, if the the quality of DLC is up to par with the rest of FromSoft's games, I could see DS3 ranking right up there with it.  Definitely recommended to anyone slightly interested in the series, or to those that were kind of turned off by DS2."
Positive,"I have changed this review to a more serious one...Dark souls 3 overall in my eyes is one of the best games I have ever played.The game is extremely challenging, which is what I thrive; challenge.I will be doing a list of Pros and Cons to give you an indication on what the game is about and hopefully sway you to experience this brilliant game for yourself.Pros:- Depending on if you like a challenge, then you'll love this game.- The mechanics are much cleaner than Dark souls 1 and 2, although they could be improved.- You get what you pay for, there are mutliple endings to this game with a big story which takes a long time to complete if you're new to the game.- The game is gorgeous, there are many moments when you just run around to look at the scenery and the skylines this game offers.- The bosses themselves are unique, they're all diferent and have all unique in their own way varying in challenge.- If you are a collector, then this game is full of collectables for you to collect (Rings, Miracles, Pyromancies and Sorceries.)- The combat system is always tactical as there can be different ways you can take down enemies or even a boss, always stays fresh.- Great customisable characters, as you can choose the class you want to be but also what they look like which the Soulsbourne games do very well.- The DLC 1 and 2 are brilliant, although they are short, they're worth it. The pure challenge and skill you need to beat the DLC is incredible and it will not be an easy challenge.- Offers you a lot of variation with the classes you can do as you can go for a Magic or a Combat character.- The speedrunning community are lovely, if you ever wanted to go into this category.Cons:- With it being so challenging, it may be 'too much' as you could give up with the game entierly. (git gid)- The online play can be very annoying as if you don't have any friends who play this game it will be hard to fight off against multiple players online to beat them and get an offering.- If you're wanting to complete covenant by getting 30 offerings it can be a chore as I grinded for multiple hours to get the drops from specific enemies. (Unless you get them from online play.)- It can be very repetitive and boring if you keep doing the NG+ saves.Ultimately, I think this game is a 9/10 and is definitely worth buying (Even the DLC)"
Positive,"No game has both made me wanna rip my kidneys out and scream of joy and delight like Dark Souls 3. PvP is super cool too, so props for bringing it back FromSoft."
Positive,Praise the sun
Positive,I hated every second of the 171 hours I've spent playing this game. I'm going to put in another 300. Michael Zaki does it again.
Positive,"Tears of joy, Tears of sadness, Tears of pain.The moment you realize something in dark souls 3.The journey you made trough the souls games.It became my al time favourite franchise. Not becouse its better, not becouse its hard.But becouse it is unique, its something i did not see in a long time when we look at bigger games.thank you from software to give me back that old feeling of finding a world of wonder.A world of perfection. A world so full of lore i could keep on reading the discriptions, listning to the npc's.I prepared to die ones again. And it was an amazing ride. i will keep returning to the dark souls franchise over and over again. 1 - 2 - 3. None will be left out. From soft. thank you."
Positive,"Dark Souls 3Rating: 9/10Genre: RPG – Third PersonThe Good:+ This is the best looking Dark Souls both from a technical and artistic perspective. Many areas have beautiful vistas allowing you to take in the entire world and see many locations you previously visited, making you feel like you are part of something larger. + The level design is some of the best I have seen in a Dark Souls game. Every area feels amazing to explore and unlocking new shortcuts always feels satisfying.+ Every area has a very distinct atmosphere and level design. You can go from navigating deadly swamps to tight filled corridors and it all feels natural.   + Combat has been altered. Things feel a bit faster than other Dark Souls games. I also found rolling to be more effective at dodging attacks than previous titles. + Multiple way of developing your character. + Boss battles look amazing and require real strategy and skill to take down. The Average:+/- A minor gripe I have are bonfire placements are placed too close together. Bonfire’s in Dark Souls has always been a sense of relief, a place to regroup and go out and face new dangers. In this game I felt like I was running into a bonfire much more often than usual. The Bad:- NPC quest lines play a more prominent role, yet many of them require very specific things to do, and if you advance far into the game without completing a previous requirement you end up missing out. Even after reading a walkthrough, I thought to myself ‘How is anybody suppose to figure this out on their own?’ - Once again UI can be really improved upon. You would expect the third game would fix some of these issues. - No pause button  Conclusion:Easily my favorite Dark Souls game. Overall level design and mechanics seem to be refined and improved upon in most ways. I am not sure if I’m just getting better at these types of games or they are making things easier, either way Dark Soul games have become one of my favorite franchises."
Positive,"out of all of the racing car tycoon games i've played on roblox, this has to be one of the best. not only did it excel at making sandwiches, but it also gave me the same feeling i got when i sped through a school zone and the speed bumps were screaming for some reason. when i first played this, i got nausea, but now since i'm deaf i can smell so much better. honestly this game is insane, i would recommend especially to people with crippling cheese addictions. giving this great game a 1/10."
Positive,"As far as gameplay goes, this is the perfected iteration of the Dark Souls formula. I still appreciate some things in Demon's Souls better (ambiance, Tower of Latria, straightforward design), some things in Dark Souls 1 better (the ""Open"" world or the world design in general is better over there). Dark Souls 3 takes the speed of combat from Bloodborne in a Dark Souls context with a huge variety of weapons and playstyles. It takes a bit from every other Souls game that came before it and combines it to make a great game. The DLC really elevates the game from being a good one to being a legendary one. I love this game and love the DLC. I could talk about this game endlessly... the Berserk references, the references to other old anime movies as well as medieval mythology and it's own flavor. A true sequel to Dark Souls 1, almost to a flaw. Not going to overextend much about this game because chances are you already know all of this and have come to this game after trying other From Software games. This is the most polished gameplay wise from the trilogy+Demon's, the general structure of the game makes it easy to replay and the DLC is simply great.

Positive,"Dark Souls 3, the culmination of FromSoftware's renowned series, offers players a punishing yet rewarding journey through a dark and unforgiving world.Pros:• Challenging Gameplay: Dark Souls 3 maintains the series' trademark difficulty, providing players with intense combat encounters and formidable boss battles that demand skill, patience, and perseverance. The sense of accomplishment upon overcoming these challenges is unparalleled, rewarding players with a true sense of satisfaction.• Beautiful World Design: The game's hauntingly beautiful world is a testament to FromSoftware's mastery of environmental storytelling. From towering castles to decaying ruins, each area is intricately designed and brimming with atmospheric detail, creating a sense of immersion that draws players deeper into the game's dark fantasy universe.• Deep Combat System: Dark Souls 3 features a deep and nuanced combat system that rewards tactical thinking and precision timing. From mastering weapon arts to exploiting enemy weaknesses, players have a wealth of options at their disposal to overcome even the toughest foes, ensuring that every encounter feels both challenging and satisfying.• Multiplayer Integration: The game's multiplayer component adds an extra layer of depth to the experience, allowing players to engage in cooperative or competitive gameplay with others online. Whether summoning allies to aid in difficult battles or invading other players' worlds as a hostile phantom, multiplayer interactions add unpredictability and excitement to the game.Cons:• Ineffective Anti-Cheat System: Dark Souls 3's anti-cheat system has been criticized for its ineffectiveness in combating cheating and hacking during online play. Legitimate players may find themselves unfairly penalized or even banned due to encounters with malicious hackers, detracting from the overall multiplayer experience.• Complex Narrative: For newcomers to the Dark Souls series, the game's narrative can be difficult to decipher. With its cryptic lore and minimal exposition, piecing together the story and understanding its intricacies requires patience and exploration, which may alienate some players seeking a more accessible narrative experience.In conclusion, Dark Souls 3 offers a challenging and immersive experience that will test players' skills and determination to their limits. While its atmospheric world design, deep combat system, and multiplayer integration are commendable, the game is marred by issues such as the ineffective anti-cheat system and the narrative complexity that may deter newcomers. Despite these flaws, Dark Souls 3 earns a respectable score of 8.5/10, cementing its status as a must-play title for fans of challenging action RPGs."

Positive,"Welcome to Gank City. If you couldn't get good then we'll see ya with the Pontiffs rejects in the grimy toxic swamps. To all the SL120 sweaty lapps. Praise the sun!For real though the games Lor is very details and you could beat the game without even knowing the storyline. It's very passive and not thrown in your face. The bosses are hard the first gamethrough but after that you come back with vengeance!  Where this game really shines is the PVP. There are only so many weapons, spells, armor, tactics, buffs, whatever in the game an no matter how many times I run into people with the same stuff, EVERYONE fights differently and it's like fighting them for the first time, every time. You think this game may be easy, just casually killing every enemy with ease with your 2,3 or 4 phantoms and then you see ""you've been invaded"" and you all run! lmao This game reminds you that there is someone here to make you restart. And nobody wants to restart.For all though: It is a MUST to have the mods Watchdog OR Pyroprotecc. This game has no anti cheat (except a ban wave every Tuesday) and it's stupid easy to cheat with cheat engine. People can come into your worlds with god mode or insta kill you or inject items into your inventory that can get you banned or whatever. Cheat engine should be standard when you buy this game. I can't go into Gank City for 30 minutes without running into a cheater. And to all you people who think you're a god at pvp, put away your glitches. It's not a win for you, and when I kill you without using any glitches you will get the dung pie thrown on you."

Positive,"Dark Souls III is one hell of a game. It is the third entry and suppose to be the final one as well for the Dark Souls series. In contrast to the previous entries, the combat is now more fast-paced and dynamic, which makes room for the player to do some ludicrous stuff in regards to how they face enemies and bosses but at the same time it makes it so that those enemies and bosses will barely give you a break. Everything comes at you fast and hard, with the intention to kill you as fast as possible and without any concern for their own life. This makes this entry a very dynamic one because there is never a dull moment.In regards to bosses, I think this might be the best Dark Souls to play in co-op. I beat all prior Dark Souls game and co-op tends to be a black-white area. It either makes some of the harderst bosses a joke but without it some players get stuck. In this entry, bosses get adjusted to the number of players that are in the host session. This makes bosses more doable and at the same time the combat remains challenging and thrilling. The desing of bosses are also very good. While Dark Souls 1 has more unique fights in the way that every foe behaves and battles in their own special way, this game makes it so that all bosses are dangerous and agile, which leads to some moments of excitement and pressure in which your heart will beat fast trying to beat the boss before you are done for.The worlds are interesting but go more for a sort of different areas put together in a big zone. If an area is a castle, then the entirety of that zone will be composed of castles, walls, knights and so on. Like themed based. There is left variety but everything feels connected and like a sum of the parts, which in my opinion is a far more enjoyable experience for newcomers or long-returning fans.You get a lot of options for combat but this particular entry is more focused on swords. Particulary sword of Dexterity. Is such a shame to see magic and all other weapons be disminished. They are all still ok and more than able to beat the game, but Dexterity is just so much more powerful and will give you an easier time beating the game in most cases. If you come from prior entries you may feel either more adjusted to the fast-paced combat or disoriented. Either way, this is actually a pretty good game. Just play it at your pace and enjoy it for what it is. No one beats a boss on their first try (usually) so go ahead and explore, experience and have fun! Dark Souls isn't about difficulty or how hard it is, is about how real the world feels and how the game want you to treat it seriously. Not like a life-or-death matter but more like, try to think about your approach to things and how to deal with them.If you get stuck, don't be disheartened. Try different stuff, and if you really feel stuck, like there is nothing you can do except farm souls or stuff, just start a new. Read a guide if you need to or ask for tips and tricks. I had to start from 0 after getting stuck with a mage build which I ruined by accident, and while it was heartcrushing, I am glad I did it because I got to enjoy this game and felt like by learning from my mistakes, I was being rewarded by the game and became better at it."

Positive,"The strongest entry to end phenomenal trilogy. This time with more power and more lore love. FromSoftware games never stops you loving them. Kindle your first bonfire and cary your journey to the end. Try to be that hero or die trying. Everything is so well put in this title it blows my mind. From walking courpses to the flying giant dragons. So many of well designed and scary crafted enemies. Always asking what you gonna see next. The bosses gives you tippy toe challenge where they push you to the limits. Once again some of the most amazing and breahtaking of them are made it here. Yet alone The Nameless King, Sister Friede, Gael and Darkeater Midir will stuck in you mind for a long time. If you want to beat them you gonna learn how to dance with them. Its like walking in dark fantasy dream land. From giant castles to the frozen lands of forgotten tales. One of the best parts is trying to figure it out the story itself. If you know what you killing it gives you more meaning and perspective to the whole world surrounding of dark souls. Thanks to developers who made this game more acceptable in every way. Trying to get help from other players never felt so easy. Everyone is so helpfull and great. This title showed me that Dark Souls community is the most humble of them. Seeing so many people gathering near bonfire with so many different sets of armour makes you smile. One complaint I had with this title that it was the most hardest for me cause of one soul reason. They nerfed Sourcerer class to the ground. I hope they fix this mistake in Elden ring. This is it the journey ended. . .or maybe not yet. We will meet in Elden Ring once more to test our limits."
Positive,"Dark Souls has come full circle. From the niche beginnings with Demons’ Souls all the way up to today’s Dark Souls 3. What was once a game series reserved for the masochistic and patients players has grown to a brand that moves millions of games at the mere mention of its name. It has become mainstream. Is this bad? Maybe. Is this good? Maybe. Better production value and refinement are among the merits, but it is a Faustian embargo because the key element of a Souls game; its difficulty, is kind of lacking in Dark Souls 3.Booting DS3 sends you into familiar territory. A black screen, with the imposing letters once again awaits you as you slave for hours in character creation to avoid a complete farce. The introduction then sets the stage for this instalment’s cryptic story. The world as we left it after Dark Souls 2 has burnt out to nearly nothing by ashes and the time has come to once again rekindle the first flame. However, it takes five carcasses these days to stoke the fires so you are called from beyond the grave with the express purpose of dragging four of the five deadbeats back to the fire and casting their dried husks into it to give people an extension on their drab and dreary world.      It’s more of the same, and the lore and traditionally hidden plot development is leaning heavily on the original Dark Souls for its appeal. Frankly, the amount of DS1 pandering is so extreme that it makes the two or three concrete references in DS2 look tame. After having thoroughly established that kingdoms rise and fall in the sequel, part three throws all that plot development out of the window and returns to the source to bring alienated fans back. If you, like me, actually liked The Matrix Reloaded then you’ll understand why this is a bad thing. After establishing a rich world with details, mythology and lore they forgo most of it just to shoehorn some of the old stuff back in there. When you look past the story you’ll still find an incredibly solid and refined action role playing game that doesn’t compromise on a single thing. The starting area guides you past easy enemies, different terrain types, your first bonfire and an enemy only the truly gutsy can tackle at that point. It doesn’t take long before you meet your first boss which will either kick the living daylights out of you or you’ll triumphantly destroy it on your first pass. What follows is a short hike to a building on the cliff where you enter the hub of this game: Firelink Shrine. Here you’ll be given your purpose, a number of helpful NPCs and not a single proper hint that the bonfire in the centre will teleport you into the main game.       This first section is painstakingly crafted to teach you the fundamentals. Or not; if you’re a Demons’ Souls veteran and have played all the other games you’ll breeze through it like it was a different game. Unbeknownst to me, this had become the theme for my overall experience with DS3. After I went to the first area, a castle, I was greeted with hollows, knights, dogs and a dragon. However, none of them really presented an obstacle. Nor was the first boss, a quadrupedal knight with an ice club, much of a challenge if you’re used to playing a dodge build. This continued throughout the game. Most bosses only took me one or two tries to beat. If I used summons I didn’t even have to try. I hardly ever got killed. Sure I died a few times in the Dragon Keep, and Knightslayer Tsorig sure knows how to earn his name, but I never felt in any way triumphant or relieved to have passed an obstacle or have beaten a boss. Returning to the game with a different build did give me a challenge eventually, but when playing like I usually do the game was kind of a breeze. If death is your teacher in Dark Souls, then I didn’t learn much this time round. For all them memes and jokes made about its difficulty, DS3 doesn’t live up to its predecessors reputation.DS3 may have lost a notch in difficulty, but it certainly has gained props in its level of quality. DS 2 was mired at first for its lack of polish. Sloppy hitboxes, poor level design, bland graphics and enemy design. DS3 has got none of that; it is an amazing accomplishment in level of refinement, presentation and interface design. Hitboxes are now perfectly implemented. You can vault through two swooping swords and land on the other side unscathed. Firebreath stops exactly where it seems to stop and a giant’s foot only stomps where it lands. This is a colossal improvement over 2’s dingy detection. The improvements don’t end there. The game is gorgeous. Skyboxes create an amazing sense of scale while the miniscule details in the world make each area vibrant and alive (despite the fact that everything is dead). Capes and cloaks look absolutely gorgeous and you have all the options to make your character look truly stunning. The game runs excellently at 60fps at 1080p on a GTX970. FROM also made a considerable effort to make the regular enemies a lot more interesting. From your regular zombies to ravenous beasts, there are some incredibly creative designs. Some enemies are as challenging as bosses themselves, without being cheap like in DS2. Speaking of bosses, despite some of them being stupidly easy, a good number of them are still amazing. I’d have to say that they’re more cool than hard, but the hardest bosses in the game also happen to be the coolest. Imagine a pope with lightsabres, or an insanely intense fight against a dragon rider knight, without any gimmicks. These are the game’s highlights and the moments where I enjoyed the game most. Not everything is perfect though. While a lot of systems have seen significant polish, quite a few enhancements that were introduced in DS2 were dropped along with its lore. The power stance in gone, replaced with special dual weapons; reducing the creative weapon matching to almost zero. Poise is gone; the game did away with it entirely; enemies still hit you through walls; new game+ is severely lacking in features; NPC quests are more vague than ever before and often end without warning. None of these issues are game breaking. The overall whole is extremely solid and amazingly well engineered. It is just so perplexing that many of the systemic improvements from DS2 were removed. I guess streamlining is the keyword here, but that still doesn’t make up for the inability to wield two repeater crossbows.       Another massive gripe stems from PVP. The implementation of a password system to hook up with your friends is also extremely welcomes (seriously, this password system is the best thing since the white soapstone). However, the tweaks to PVP matchmaking are horrible. The game now biases invasions to intrude the world of a host with a phantom. That way, the invader has to face at least two, more powerful opponents, with a possible blue spirit joining the host to fend off the invader. Meanwhile, invaders can kill each other, despite pursuing the same goal. PVP is reserved to the truly committed invaders with the skill and ability to pull off these feats. After thirty hours the credits roll on what was to me the easiest Souls experience I had had up to that point. It was by no means a bad journey. It looks and runs amazingly, the combat is still fun and the online component runs like clockwork most of the time. It is refined to the point of perfection, but certain elements are up for debate in both terms of gameplay and plot. Without a doubt the best Dark Souls experience available on PC.This review was edited to fit the character count. Certain illustrations and elaborations were omitted. Feel free to ask questions."
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is the kind of game that makes you question your life choices, but in the most masochistically delightful way possible. It's a dance with death, and you'll stumble more times than you'll pirouette gracefully. But therein lies its twisted charm.Imagine a world where death is not a setback but a lesson, where every foe you face is a masterful choreographer of doom, and where you feel simultaneously frustrated and exhilarated. That's the essence of Dark Souls 3.The game greets you with open arms, then promptly kicks you into a pit of despair. The difficulty level is like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube blindfolded while balancing on a tightrope. It's not for the faint of heart or those with a fragile ego. But if you're the type who enjoys a challenge and finds solace in the feeling of achievement after countless deaths, then welcome to your personal torture chamber.Dark Souls 3 doesn't hold your hand; it holds your impending doom. It rewards patience, precision, and a hint of insanity. The meticulously crafted world is dark and brooding, with a twisted beauty that beckons you to explore its secrets.The boss battles are nothing short of epic. Each one is like a tango of death, demanding precise timing and strategy. And when you finally emerge victorious, you'll feel like you've conquered the universe (until the next boss stomps your soul into oblivion).The multiplayer aspect adds an extra layer of complexity, with invasions and co-op play that can either be your salvation or your undoing. It's a high-stakes game of hide-and-seek with swords.In summary, Dark Souls 3 is not a game for everyone. It's a dark, punishing, and relentlessly challenging experience. But for those who embrace the brutality, it's also an exhilarating journey that pushes your limits and rewards your perseverance. It's a game that, despite the numerous deaths, manages to make you feel more alive than ever. So grab your controller, steel your nerves, and  prepare to die – again and again. Even after a span of seven years since its launch, it continues to stand as an enduring masterpiece."

Positive,"First of all if you want a challenge this is not for you, i am not saying this game is easy actually it's hard but compared to other souls games it is not. The game is hard until you get powerful weapons.The Dark Souls III is the baby of the Bloodborne and Souls games: it has fast combat system and some areas looks like they are ripped from the Bloodborne and the other things are just Dark Souls things.If you loved Bloodborne's fighting mechanics this game is for you."
Positive,"Wow, What can't I say good about the game that has me hooked like wildfire. This was my first real playthrough of a souls game, of course after I played it I went out and beat the other 2, just to say I did and also because I fell in love with the Rich Lore of this game. Every item you pick up in the game has a description and most of them can be traced to something in the previous games. You can find subtle hints of things you've seen before in the game and hints about bosses and the purpose of the placements of items. And the gameplay in this one is far more polished than the previous two, (save for the low stamina costs, but to be honest with the way these bosses work, you need to dodge a ton.)From the Very beginning of the game they pit you against a tough boss if your new to the souls series, but don't let anything intimidate you in this game. Take the world of Lordran/Lothric by storm, head in without fear of dying because you probuly will die and there is nothing you can do about it. Just learn from every encounter and be sure to recover your souls. Your in for a wild ride, not for the faint of heart or for those weak in courage. The game has plenty to offer in terms of multiplayer as well. You can team up with 3 other friends to take on the challenges of the game which can be some of the most fun in the game, but beware you are also suseptable to being invaded by another player who wants to take your ass for a ride and then kill you. Then again you could turn to the same method and go invading yourself. The game also has a dueling community, aka a group of players who participate in friendly duels with one another. The latest DLC for the game has streamlined the whole dueling process by adding matchmaking to dueling. You can also do 2v2, 3v3, 4 and 6 man free for alls and more.Final Verdict: Dark Souls 3 is a challenging experience, with a ton of replay Value. The game will grow on you if you let yourself get hooked. Also a great game to play with some friends! BIG NOTICE: CONTROLLER HIGHLY RECCOMENDED.This Game is near impossible to play with Keybindings. Get a damn controller if you wanna play."

Positive,"This series is probably the only thing I could call it a masterpiece.For the ice-breaker, let’s talk about my first Dark Souls game, DS1. I still remember my first playthrough in DS1 where I was stuck at Gargoyle boss for 5 hours. All my hard work finally paid off in the end and got used to being in this ‘peaceful’ land. Although it’s an old game, you can still see people are still playing it, even it is a bad port with some issues. I am so glad that I started my journey from the first game so that I could save the best part for the last.DS3 may not be my first game in the series, but it’s the best souls game IMO. Miyazaki and FromSoft did a great job with DS3 for closing this series. Combining DeS, DS, and bloodbourne into one game was the best decision, making it more lively and vicious. As a PvE fan, I can say this is the hardest DS game. All enemies are really aggresive compared to other DSs. Yes, some of you may disagree with me, but everyone has their own taste, right? But still, DS1’s Tomb of giants is a pain in the ass.But it wasn’t the difficulty of the games that made me fell in love with this franchise; it was the world, characters, soundtrack and the lore. Thanks to the community, i could tell that Souls series is not just a difficult game for masochists. The games have a massive world with depth, well-written lore, but only few were told, which encorages players to find it themselves with all items’ descriptions and dialogues throughout the games. The characters with their own stories that can make me feel the feels; the atmospheric world that always give me an awe; and the soundtrack that send shivers up and down my spine; Those made me having the best moments in the games.I am both sad and glad that Souls series ended. It was a long journey for me and finally it reached the end. On the other hand, It gives FromSoft room to make another new games. I hope FromSoft is already making something fresh(I am looking forward to you, Code Vein).“So, is this game worth to play?” Hell yeah mah boi. “But I heard this game is hard and not for casual.” It is hard to get into it. When you get the basic, It will become less overwhelming. “Should I play the previous ones first before playing DS3?” You don’t have to, unless you want to know the world and all lore of DS series. Either way, you will get helluva ride of adventure.EDIT: Seems like FromSoft isn't the developer of Code Vein. My bad."
Positive,This game has taken over my life. Don't buy it. it will do the same to you.
Positive,It's ok i guess
Positive,"This game is one of the best games i've ever played. It has one of the best lores, extremely challenging, The experience becomes better if you talk about the story with your friends and have the volume on while playing :) and much much more <3 In my personal experience 70% percent of the people playing this game are using 3rd party program or cheat engine or at least around that percentage. Thats really unfortunate, So what i highly recommend you to do before activating "" Play online "" or going online in this game is > Back up your ds1, ds2 and ds3 file. How do you do that? Go to > This computer or This PC > Users > your computers name  > App Data > Roaming and click on ds3 or any of the ds games. So now you've got a folder thats  "" Users ID "" that folder has a file, That file is your in game progressing save. Please back up that file by manually copy and pasting it from time to time or even better everytime you close the game. Paste it into your other Hard Drive ( HHD) or anywhere you feel like it'll be safe in :)Why do you wanna do all of that? Is firstly because Steam Cloud doesn't support this or any ds games :) So it's not like Csgo, dota2 or many other games that save automatically in your steam account. So because some hackers with bad intentions not only kill people unfairly and gain little to no fun >.< But they also have bad ways to force a bugged or a hacked item into your inventory that can cause a soft ban or corrupt your files :/ or simply dropped hacked items for you to pick up if you are new to the game that will ruin your system.I lost my account twice first time i lost my level 210 character is because i formatted my computer and i didn't know that steam cloud doesn't support ds3 :< And the second time i lost my level 281 character is because i picked up a bugged or a hacked item that ruined my system so i decided to delete all my save files >.< and i've read later on that it's not needed to delete the account, but the character itself. and what i also read about the soft ban ( soft ban is a temporary that prevents you from playing online until you delete or remove the hacked bugged item that you picked up) So soft ban goes away after couple of weeks but i haven't experienced it myself and i hope i wont ever again >.< Thank you and i wish you the best of luck and a wonderful experience on your ds3 journey!"
Positive,"Please follow United Critics for quality reviewsA Dying World, swarming with the people who have lost it all or more so-referred to as “Hollows”, you an Undead “Ashen” one in this unforgiving world tasked with gathering the souls of the Lord of cinders to revert the great apocalypse, but then you meet this giant crocodile-like monster who tries to eat you up, and if you are a careless gamer like me he probably would oopsie! but then if you are a somewhat of a genius guy in the head, and if you try to riposte his attack that massive guy goes in a prayer stance, his tiny hands and Dejected face nothing but begging for mercy and that was the moment I went “awe, this whole game’s a melancholic mess of the greatest level”. Sure the difficulty is what allures players to this title but if you take a look around, DS3 ( the short form for Dark Souls III ) is truly an ingenious title whether it be one of the most challenging yet rewarding gameplay mechanics or the rich lore of the game. As fires fade and the world falls into ruin, journey into a universe filled with more colossal enemies and environments. Players will be immersed in a world of epic atmosphere and darkness through faster gameplay and amplified combat intensity. Fans and newcomers alike will get lost in the game hallmark rewarding gameplay and immersive graphics.Now only embers remain… Prepare yourself once more and Embrace The Darkness!the Final title to the highly coveted Dark souls franchise, having the creator  Hidetaka Miyazaki return for this final title was just the icing on the cake. With the same challenging gameplay, difficult yet fun bosses, the captivating world, and of course us being at the center of it all, is truly an epic experience. character creationAt the start of the game the player is given the full customizable ability to design his very own character, choices like your gender, burial gift which is essentially a bonus item of sorts nothing special but its better to have it and your online name, etc. the vital part here is that the player can choose between 10 classes, you can choose whoever depending on what you like.  KnightMercenaryWarriorHeraldThiefAssasinSorcererPyromancerClericDeprivedOut of these the Knight class is the face of the game and also the most balanced out of those and is recommended for new and returning players. I love the Mercenary class since I love my dex builds and that class has the highest damage output of those. Deprived class is meant for veterans, the difficulty spike in that one is terrifying, even for long-term veterans. Consider choosing that if you want yourself a challenge.CombatCombat is something that the franchise is known for to such an extent that it created a genre on its own. The term “souls-like” is no stranger to gamers new and old, which essentially implies a difficult game with various types of unsettling monsters if you may call them, with a satisfying gaming experience that includes you dying a tonne of times and respawning. Combat in DS3 is just a follow-up from the series predecessors. Some of the basic key combat actions are as follows.Light attack – Basic Light attack, doesn’t consume much stamina and essentially deals decent damage Heavy attack – uses a tonne of stamina which all depends upon the weapon of your choice, but deals tremendous damage.weapon arts – are essentially unique weapon skills assigned to particular weapons, they all vary depending upon the weapon of your choice. Soul level – soul level is essentially your in-game level, you can acquire souls by killing off the various bosses and enemies present in the game. And upgrade various stats, which will further help improve your character.  Parry – You can parry a lot of enemies in the game, timing is crucial following a riposte after a parry is quite deadly.Rolling – Rolling is considered one of the most important actions while in combat, rolling from your enemies helps in a slow sluggish game like DS3. Pyromancy – Pyromancy is the use of fire spells, fire being the weakness of 80% of monsters in the game works out quite well in your favor. Spells – Magic Spells are quite deadly and are considered game-breaking by many individuals, some spells deal tremendous damage while you stay out of harm’s way since they do not melee. Combat is very customizable, the game forces you to change your combat style very often, hence every enemy you face remains a fresh challenge, one given strategy is not 100% valid to work on the other enemy you face in different areas. You can always use shields, but be aware that shields drastically reduce your combat potential in dangerous situations. Staggering your enemies helps as well. StoryThe story is one of the most intriguing parts of the game. Most of the plot doesn’t reference the previous games directly, indirectly certain locations in the game scream of “ Heck yes, all of this did occur “. DS3 is largely based on player’s theories and assumptions hence there is no concrete, definite story whatsoever and that is good. Every little detail in the game points its fingers to a much larger picture, and that’s the beauty of this game. You don’t need lore timelines or extravagant very detailed world-building to make something beautiful. Set in Lothric, You an unkindled one, are given the task of returning the lords of cinder ( people who have been successful in the past to link the flames but now are hardly the remains of their past self) to their thrones in the fire link shrine. You do so by of course confronting the lords of cinder, and then beating the pulp out of them, on the surface you look like the chivalrous knight in shining armor yet when you face a boss who is waiting for his master who unfortunately has succumbed to illness, you look like the bad guy as you desperately try taking that poor dog down. In Dark Souls, nobody is the good guy, we are all sinners just that the protagonist’s purpose was jubilant enough to call others evil. Story-wise, dark souls 3 is gripping and is something to be enjoyed by every individual.Music The Music in DS3 is soul clenching from the awesome sound design they have used on enemies to the very gothic, yet elegant OSTs while fighting the series toughest bosses, simply magnificent. The music elevates your gaming experience, to unimaginable heights, will draw you at the moment and this harmonic pulse will run through your entire body whenever you take down a boss, that feeling of power, satisfaction is something I haven’t seen replicated in many so titles I have played.  Absolutely satisfying gameplay  Good difficulty spike turns of customization and mod support  can play with / vs friends  magnificent music  really good graphics  Online Pve / PvP infested with Hackers  Difficulty can be challenging for fresh gamers. Expensive, even after 6 years price is unchanged only recommended at sales. Dark souls 3 is a perfect souls-like experience for series veterans and beginners alike. The music, the graphics, the enemies, they nailed it. Boss is ingeniously designed both combat-wise and lore-wise. The game has a tonne of replayability and challenges the player every new game plus. Needless to say to me it certainly is one of the best games of all time, a genre-defining blockbuster, and the perfect game to end the much-renowned souls' franchise. I hope, the upcoming elden ring stays true to its predecessors and outperforms said expectations in a good way. Rating: 9.5/10"
Positive,"I've never played any game that had swordplay before or third person. I actually thought I would hate this game to its guts, but the hype from the fanbase was just too much. I decided to preorder and give it a shot. When I began playing the game on the first day, I struggled to use keyboard and mouse(A shame there is no kb/m overlay). As a result, I died many times and I kept struggling to actually attempt to enjoy the game. However, after many defeats and many dissatisfactions, I finally beat my first boss WITH A KEYBOARD AND MOUSE! Now, I don't usually get hyped after completing a tutorial level, but this game was totally different. It didn't just give me some mindless skeletons to fight, but it also gave me a boss to fight, which by the way, gave me a headache.Each level was more enormous than the one before it with enemies that were sometimes huge. When I finally beat the game, I couldn't believe it was finally over. I was actually sad that there no more remaining bosses that could give me suffering and frustration. In my opinion, this game turned me into a masochist. Though, what the hell is up with all this weird English poetic stuff? Did the writers just read Shakespeare and decide to write in whatever word they thought had a good ring to it?10/10"
Positive,"most polished souls-like game in your steam libraryits not perfect but its nice.I have great memories with this.People say Dark Souls saved their lives and more stuff. Good. Lives saved is nice.I'm here for the funny gameplay. I am an explorer who was on an adventure for no reason but 1 - I knew that someone had completed this and all the other souls-borne games without taking a single hit. That means the combat will not betray me if i'm smart and skillful enough. I felt powerful. And i did it. Slowly i move, i die i learn and i cheese i throw stuff, i talk and i run..I had fun. TL;DR - One of the Best Games to play with friends. Just don't give up on the tutorial, You can do it Ashen one. I believe in me who believes in you. You're going to succeedP.S. - I like the story's theme a lot too but i'd much rather praise DS1 for that, but yeah its good."
Positive,"About to finish my 7th(?) or so run for DS3 and jesus christ this game is excellent.The gameplay is a massive upgrade from DS2 which was more a downgrade on DS1 then an upgrade. It's very good if you're an Elden Ring player wanting to try souls, practically mirroring ER's combat.The narrative although vague is incredibly well done and is a great conclusion to a cyclical narrative that would've got boring very fast with a Dark souls 4. The bosses are the best they've ever been with no real stinkers in the bunch just gimmick fights which aren't too bad at all (looking at you Wolnir) The only issue really is the asking price of £40 and $60 US. Getting the game + DLC for something like £30 is far more reasonable but recently there's been a bit of a sales drought."
Positive,a must have for every Masochist
Positive,"Game was very fun, but I don't remember it as fondly as I remember the PVE of the first nor the PVP of the second.Probably still a good purchase if interested in ""roll and hit"" kinda games."
Positive,I used to have a life... then I died.
Positive,Dont know what to write here.People always say Dark souls is difficult. Dark Souls is hard. But it really isnt. Its challenging. It requires your attention.  Game is a 10/10I spend 20€ on this and I would do it again at any time! One of the only games that kept me up playing at an ungodly hour.
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is my favorite game in the entire series, I have played every Souls(Borne) game in the entire series, that includes Demon's Souls, Bloodborne.This game came out on top with the ton of references to the other games in the series, and it did a damn good job respecting the series, and might I say it... Going out with a BANG.The ending in Dark Souls 3 is incredible, it's super powerful for anyone who has played the previous entries in the series. I of course won't spoil it, that would be really stupid of me. (But seriously, I REALLY recommend playing Dark Souls 1/2 before even playing this, if you don't do that you won't get the references to the previous games and the ending sure as hell won't be as powerful... It's the perfect ending to a strong adventure of which I am so happy that I have partaken in during all these years)The Armors, the weapons, the characters, the music... Dark Souls 3 has some of the strongest music tracks in the series, from the main theme, to the final credits theme... The final music in the credits practially whispers to you in a soft way Finale And they completely nailed it.The amount of friends I have taken through the lands of Lordran, Drangleic and even all the way down to the lowest of the lowest of the Nexus in Demon's Souls... Playing this game with my friend who has kept me company during all the other Soul games was truly amazing. We decided to solo the final boss instead of coop, for obvious reasons... and it was so powerful.(I have played way more solo, rather than coop. I'm not a carried scrub, I do the carrying trust me)I'm not kidding, I think I have literally taken more than 15 people through the lands of Dark Souls, and every single adventure has been amazing...(As a matter of fact, as of writing this review I'm taking another friend of mine through Dark Souls 3, It's an amazing series and I have to show it to people...)Dark Souls is a franchise that will go all the way down through the years in gaming, and people will relish and remember this series. And people will remember the ending of Dark Souls 3 and say - ""That's how you end a franchise"" Writing all of this I realise how much of a nerd I am, but I am super proud of this series, and everyone who has stayed strong with this series. Thanks all of you, even the toxic Havel armor wearing scrublords, we love all of you.PRAISE THE SUN! \[T]/"
Positive,Great game with awesome levels design and really challenging bosses. Love the look and feel of this game. I still think the first dark souls is better but this is a true sequel to the first game. I'll give this game a 4.7/5 and I'll recommend this game to everyone.
Positive,"The sequel that the original Dark Souls deserved is a stunning game. The third is not only the most challenging part of the Souls series, but it's the most dynamic, fluid and deep in gameplay. The more linear design is founded in variety of challenges that force the player to adapt in their approach to combat, but there still is plenty of hidden areas and branching paths to keep you guessing, immersing yourself in exploration."
Positive,"In the first 10 minutes you encounter a boss fight, and I'm glad to say that I only died 5 times.9.5/10."
Positive,Great game even if you haven't played the others. Arguably the easiest souls game to do multiplayer if that's your thing.
Positive,I love sand
Positive,Update:The multiplayer servers for Dark Soul 3 have been reactivated.Official statement is that they are working on DS1R and DS2 as well.
Positive,"Dark Souls III is something truly incredible. It has managed to provide me with a gut-wrenching, arduous experience. I have never felt so convulsed while playing a video game. It has made me feel short of breath as I peered through every dark and narrow opening, hunting for each and every achievement in the game. Dark Souls III has managed to antagonise myself enough for me to be yelling at the computer screen and release unconventional anger. If by any chance, you ever feel as though you should be playing this game, or that you are missing out on something very enjoyable, please do not ruin your life for $60 and just go and entice yourself to GTA V for an extra $15. Type 'PAINKILLER' in the console and you will be smiling like a kid that just lost his virginity.11/10 EXTREMELY rewarding but requires an immense amount of time, patience and persistence.I LOVE you Dark Souls III !"
Positive,"Read this if you just want to hear what I think about the game.Dark Souls III does just enough to make the gameplay loop feel fresh, with refined combat mechanics as well as a couple of new features. Its bosses are all well-designed, and so are the many areas. It does feel a little too safe, leaning too much on the lore of the first game, resulting in a backstory not as engaging as that of the first Dark Souls.+ Well-designed bosses+ The overall selection of areas is very satisfying+ Lots of potential in terms of character builds-  Feels a bit safe, especially with the lore consisting mostly of references to the first game.- Inconsistent framerateSCORE: GreatClick here to see my rating chartRead this if you want all the details.The Dark Souls series is probably one of the most influential in gaming. Dark Souls 3 marks the end of a beloved series, but is it as good as it's predecessors?Let's start with probably the most important part of a Soulsborne game - the gameplay, and more specifically, the combat. At first, it might seem like there isn't anything new here, other than the combat feeling more refined and less clunky. But as you begin to acquire more weapons, you'll probably introduce yourself to one of the biggest changes to combat: Weapon Skills. Each weapon has a certain skill that can be used in combat. This could be something as simple as a flurry attack, or something as cool as setting the area around you on fire. I'm pretty sure these skills are inspired by the trick-weapons seen in Bloodborne, and while they aren't as fleshed out as those, they still help make the weapon selection feel a bit more varied. The way magic works have also been altered a bit. In the first game, each spell had a specific amount of times it could be cast before you weren't able to use it until you reached the next bonfire. In this game, From Software has introduced a new bar besides Health and Stamina, called Focus. Focus is used every time you cast magic or use a weapon skill, and can also be filled by consuming Ashen Estus Flasks or resting at a bonfire. I do feel like this system would've worked better if the bar would automatically regenerate, as the amount of times you can use magic feels very limited, and makes character builds focused on magic less powerful overall. One of the most iconic things in the Soulsborne series is, of course, the boss battles. In Dark Souls 3 there's not as many in total as in previous entries, but they do feel more varied, and some of them present some very cool ideas. Just like in Bloodborne, most bosses have multiple phases, each with their own moves. This is a good addition to the great boss design and makes each boss a lot more unpredictable. My biggest issue with the bosses in the game is that most of them don't feel very challenging compared to the ones the first game presented. There were only a few bosses where I really felt like one single mistake would be fatal, and most of these were found towards the latter half of the game. What helped me to accept this is how none of them felt like a bad boss. Even though the first game had some of the finest and most well-designed bosses in a game, it did also have a lot of bland and uninspired ones, such as the tedious Bed of Chaos. The same could be said for some of the game's areas - just take a look at Lost Izalith. This is another place where I feel like this game struck gold - out of the many areas, there wasn't a single one which outright irritated me. Sure, there were a couple of areas that were a bit bland, but the overall selection was very good. It did have your occasional poison swamps, but even those felt like a fair experience. This is mainly due to the fantastic level design. Everything seems so thoughtfully put together and results in an overall satisfying experience. The game was sometimes too generous with its bonfires, and there was even a time where two bonfires were pretty close to each other, with no enemies in between.  I do miss the interconnectivity of the first game, and I had really hoped that this would be something FromSoftware would try to do again with this game. It isn't a major complaint, but just something I would've liked to see.In terms of lore, the game leans heavily on references to the first game, and I would wish it had introduced a story on the level of that of Gwyn's from the first game, as many of the new characters simply doesn't feel as fleshed out as the ones found in Dark Souls 1. I can appreciate the fact that the game reintroduces an area from the first game, as well as a couple of well-known faces, but its lore leans too much towards this, resulting in everything feeling a bit safe. This is the biggest problem I have with the game overall - it plays a lot on nostalgia, instead of taking chances, like FromSoftware usually is known for.  I haven't seen all of the NPC quests through, but judging from the ones I did, I felt like most of them ended with the NPC invading me, forcing me to kill them. The game could've had a bit more variety here. I've always thought the Soulsborne games had some amazing sceneries, and this is also the case here. While the graphics aren't anything impressive upfront, the sceneries are what makes the game so beautiful. There's always been a charm in standing at the top of an area, looking down on everything you've just overcome, while also being able to see what the game has in store for you next. While the game ran pretty well on my mid-range PC, I did experience some stuttering at times, and somehow adjusting the graphics settings doesn't really do any noticeable difference. Just by doing a quick search online, it seems I'm not the only one with these problems, and it sounds like it's an issue regardless of how good your PC is. Also, the game really doesn't do a good job at hiding that it was made with consoles in mind. In fact, even while using keyboard and mouse, the game will still display controls as if you were playing with a controller, meaning that whenever you're in doubt what to press, you have to go into the options menu. I, of course, decided to play with a controller, as that tends to be the best for these kinds of games, and even then, I had problems with setting it up, since the official profile resulted in the mouse cursor moving whenever the game detected movement from your controller. After some adjusting though, everything worked fine, and just if I was playing on a regular console.If you liked this review, I would appreciate it if you took the time to check out some of my other reviews here. Also, feel free to leave a comment on this review if you want to discuss it or feel like I overlooked something."
Positive,I will try my best :/

Positive,"This game is just amazing, the lore is pretty tricky to follow but when you star to understand it and love it. the exploration is so deep and terrifying, the coop is amazing and the boss fight are always so intense and full of joy when you beat that damn boss who kicked your ass thousands of times.Thanks to all people that played with me online (even you invaders) you make the experience much better"
Positive,Hardest Game i ever played.I died in the loading screen.
Positive,Dark Souls 3 is quite alright.
Positive,"Very Fun especially with friends,both platforms keyboard and controller work Great Best game must buy Btw your gonna die <3"
Positive,"absolutely fantastic game, its a lot tougher than elden ring in some areas but overall a very good game with unique bosses and areas to explore."
Positive,Invasions are really fun in this game.  10/10 would reccommend to someone looking for a unique PVP experience.
Positive,finally finished the tutorial lets fucking gooooooo
Positive,Time for thrust but hole
Positive,FUGS can decimate anything in its way! ANYTHING!!!!!!
Positive,"Masterful architecture, stunning graphics, wonderful level design, full of shorcuts and the fights... The tactical side behind each fight leaves so spoiled that every other game fighting mechanic seems rather simplistic and boring in comparison.Definitely, the culmination of one of the most engrossing trilogies I've ever witnessed and an absolute, maddening joy to play and to master.10/10"
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is a pretty good, but certainly not great ending to the Souls series. Playing this game I never did got the same great vibe I got from Dark Souls 1 & 2. Some of the bosses on the game or nothing short of disappointing, the questlines to some characters have little payoff (though some are great), and the game leans very heavily on past nostalgia from Dark Souls 1, with improved combat mechanics.     Buuut.. Did I hate this game? Oh no. I loved it. It is a Souls game still, true and true. The lore is amazing, and still found through gameplay and not cutscenes. Combat is faster than ever, there are even more amazing boss weapons, and some areas are larger than before.  But there are aspects of it that will frustrate you.Pros: -Faster combat, and maneuverability -Some areas are definitely longer... -Still has the good old Souls feel -Lore is given to the interested players through very optional ways -PvP funner than ever -Co-op with friends is easier, with a password that allows you to summon only those with the same password Cons:-Wether the new weapon skill system was neccessary, is subjective. -Some areas are definitely longer... but there are fewer of them and some are very very annoying. -Summoning is sometimes a pain in the ass, as it fails if you summon more than 1 phantom simultaneously. -End bosses are mostly disappointing.. -A lot of unwarranted nostalgia from DS1 holds this game up -Seems a little too easy for some."
Positive,A peaceful autumn game...
Positive,Movement and fight mechanics +Great visuals +Challenging gameplay +Great community +Dank memes +
Positive,"TL;DR - The concept is good. I love how the game conveys that this is ‘Dark Souls 3’. The gritty atmosphere, and the lore behind it, is attractive and interesting. However, the overall gameplay is a bit of disappointment. IMHO, the game is good for only the ‘FIRST’ playthrough.PvP / Invading / Dueling is kind of nice, on paper, really, but it is actually kind of broken, when it comes to real thing.Be warned, your first playthough can takes from 10-60 hours depending on your playstyle, however, your following playthrough can be finished much faster. (3-5 hours)Feel likes more reading? Continue below:(I won’t be mentioning about what is good already, but the disappointments)I wouldn’t dare say that the game can be described as hard, nor challenging, but instead, imo, punishes those who blindly rush in thinking that they can slash their ways through the mobs.I am certain that you will be sent back to the bonfire for a few times in each ‘newly’ discovered areas/encounters, but once you learnt about each of them, you can easily control each encounter, then after that, comes down to how you perform for each fight.Despite what I mentioned above, here is a big ‘BUT’, they are all coming down to one single problem. The badly designed AI.Let’s say, you masked your approach with a spell (silencing your steps), you melee one mob from the group, the nearby members will notice you (if they are actually nearby). However, if you change your approach, getting close enough to shoot with arrows/bolts, and then pull it away from the group. Not a soul will notice that his/her friend is missing.Again, you are facing one trouble-some beast on the small bridge (for its size), you decided to pull back from the bridge area hoping to get away from the beast, then found out that it won’t follow you off the bridge area, and decided to stand and stare at you in the face, you then attempt to get into melee range, and bash away with your half-upgraded weapons, surprisingly, it stare back at you, doing nothing, but backing away until you get on the bridge again, allowing you free hits.Okay, you are on the narrow cliff, you saw a guy rushing down toward you at full speed, so you decided to dodge his attack. As he got close enough, he began charging toward you with his weapon at full-strength, you saw this opportunity, and rolled to the side, looking back to get ready for this guy. He’s not there anymore, but off the cliff into his own abyss.These are some examples. There are many cheap ways to end the tough encounters, that you will find out during your playthrough, which is kind of sad.Just for your knowledge with the right equipments/setups, you can run through the whole things (not a completed one, but met all critical paths) in just a few hours, as you can just dash past everything to reach the boss.It is kind of pointless, imo. It is nice on the paper, but the actual thing is not. I am not talking about the rule, nor the honor or that kind of stuff, but the design itself.During my playthrough, I can hardly find Invaders that are not lagging, these can be resulted as weird hitboxes, not correctly displayed weapon ranges, delayed reactions, warping, or even ranged critical attacks. Trust me, facing likes 10 of these in a row is not fun. It is good when it works though. It just that, imo, the devs seem to forget to put in the factor that, not everyone is in the perfect conditions for these thing. Let’s say, instead of the player invaders, it should be likes AI invaders, but takes the stats/equipments from other actual players, and make PvP into some kind of arena match. These would do a better job in handling smooth gameplay for more people than what it currently is, imo.I will be updating this later, If I feel right to do so.edit: typos"

Positive,"Ill be talking about the game, and both of the DLCs in this reviewDark Souls III, a game that'll drag you through locations you wouldn't want to be at, you'll experience dark dungeons, castles guarded by dragons and foggy swamps filled with horrors. I'll bring you both beautiful sights and lots of sorrow from failure.The Dark Souls games is a dark fantasy role-playing series known for its difficulty and unforgiving nature. The story is obscure and is gonna feel very disconnected as most of it is hidden in item descriptions however it is very much worth looking into if you're looking for a story, if you're not the reading type you'll be able to find most if not all of the story on youtube which is also worth a listen.After a lot of experience playing Dark souls, Dark souls II and Bloodborne, I'd say that Dark souls III does have the weakest combat entry in the series. Its somewhere in between Dark souls and Bloodborne, faster enemies which means that the game does favor faster characters and a harder time for those wanting to play as slow Tanky characters, Mages and Pyromancers since they have slow casting times.PROS:     Good and beautiful level design     Has both easy and hard bosses     Gameplay feels fluid     Lots of different armor and weapons     ""Hidden"" sidequests     Weapon Arts     Ash Estus Flasks     Fashion souls - Its great in this one.     Areas feel different.CONS:     Slow casting     Lack of new spells     binoculars casting (look it up if you dont know what it is)     Stamina usage when casting spells.     Player hub makes the game feel less connected.     NPC leveling, 2 loading screens to level up.     Somewhat linear progression.     Anti cheat is unreliable.Game is great even though it favors certain playstyles more than others.Death, death everywhere....Ashes of Ariandel is honestly a pretty short and disappointing DLC, while it excels at feeling like a natural extension to the main game, it lacks in content, interesting enemies and areas to explore. The DLC includes 2 bosses, new armor, weapons and a few spells. The few areas the DLC does include are beautiful snow filled mountain tops and vallys, and its recommend to explore.Please do note that hovering the mouse over the black bars in the text will reveal boss names, and could be considered as a spoiler in some cases.The first time I went through the DLC I missed the first boss fight, Champion's Grave Tender & Grave Tender Great Wolf but I later went back to it and I've got to say, its nothing but an average fight, set in a beautiful scene.The second boss fight, Sister Friede and Father Ariandel might be one of my favorites from the entire series, the fight will at times make you go ""Wait theres more?"", its difficult, its beautiful and its super fun.An old woman quips that she feels like a god, looking over all creation as it races toward the end, the end of everything.This is the end, the end of an era, the last piece of Dark Souls content we'll have... For now, I hope.This DLC features new armor, weapons, spells, regions and bosses, 4 of them.The Ringed City is falling upon itself as this world is coming closer to its end. Wether you found Ashes of Ariandel disappointing this is for you, its a must have.Please do note that hovering the mouse over the black bars in the text will reveal boss names, and could be considered as a spoiler in some cases.The first boss fight, The Demon Princes, one from below, one in pain., lets just start out by saying what an entrance, theres 2 bosses here, and depending on which one you kill first the 2nd phase of the fight will be different, the fight feels great and is very entertaining.The second boss fight, Halflight, Spear of the Church, this fight is kinda weird, if you're playing online another player might be summoned as the boss which brings something completely new to the table.The third boss fight, Darkeater Midir Holy hell, what a fight, this boss is a ""secret"" boss, I do believe that this is by far the hardest boss in the game, like the full game not just the DLC, this feels like a raid boss, bringing friends is advised... I'll just wait here until I get summoned...The fourth and final boss fight, Slave Knight Gael This might be one of my favorite boss fights in the game, it'll remind you of something you've seen before if you've played Dark souls: Prepare to die. Its fast and a very difficult fight, but lots of fun.The only downside to this was the fact that it wasn't connected to the main game..."
Positive,"So... after playing Dark Souls on Old Gen, Dark Souls 2 (which was also on Old Gen) and Dark Souls 2 Scholar of the First Sin, I finally was able to play Dark Souls 3 and this was my impression:I had a lot of fun with the old battle mechanics from Dark Souls mixed with the Engine of Bloodborne, which I couldn´t play sadly. I enjoyed the new Character Story Lines, the Weapons, the Bosses, and the PvP System! The possibility to delay attacks was a good move on the developers side. It really added some spice into it. I also played through every ending and they were great too and had their own satisfaction, even though they weren´t longer than 5 Minutes each. But if you played the other Dark Souls games, you are used to that. I also enjoyed almost all enemy types, and their unique attack patterns, which made each enemy a challenge, especially in a group.But now for the bad parts:- Since games like that depend on a good framerate to dodge attacks properly, I was severly disappointed in the frame     drops that happened while I was playing it. They did fix it now, but it still annoyed me pretty much.- The game´s co-op, which has a big impact on the online experience (like the old parts), was enjoyable, but only to some          extend. For example, many coveneants which let you spawn automatically in friends or foes world, were broken and   didn´t work, or at least on very few occasions.    On top of that, the game´s community is still one of the saltiest of all games. People healing in a summoned 1v1,   gankers, hunting for invaders that want to farm their coveneant, and even hackers. Yes, I know, the Community doesn´t   anything to do with the Gameplay, but it influenced my opinion on the package alltogether.- The Character Creation. There is a lot to customize from forehead to nose, but there where little things that annoyed me    like the incapability to make a special hair colour. You couldn´t make bright hair colours, like green or something like    that. It mostly looked bad, at least on my screen. What also annoys me is the low variety on Hair- and Beardstyles.But with all that apart, I had a lot of fun playing this game, alone and with friends, and I am looking forward to the DLCs and more deadly surprises. I would give this game a 9/10, with the addition, that new comers to the series also can play it without thinking: What´s going on here?, because this is what Dark Souls is about. You have to figure it out by yourself, while the prequels didn´t have a huge impact on DS 3, except references and backstory wise.WELL.I hope this review helped you on deciding whether to buy this game or not. I´d recommend it and leave you.Prepare to die."
Positive,"This game really does go beyond the previous two games. Dark Souls 3's combat system and mechanics are sound, function properly, and goddamn i wish I could say the same about the first one.Problem; AI. for some reason, when Embered and invaded by mad spirits/dark spirits, trying to parry them or even get a backstab is near impossible, and when you make consecutive hits, all of a sudden, magic parry, adn then your health dwindles down to nothing. So I guess it's all swish swish stab and back away...Still, it take everything into a blender, mashes it up and throws the odd pickle in it, to give it some zest I guess. Even though that ticks me, I thoroughly enjoy it and see it as a great game for new players to try."
Positive,"Returning under the direction of Hidetaka Miyazaki, Dark Souls (DkS) 3 focuses on lore, aiming to be a cohesive and concluding chapter, bringing answers and clarity about the world of these games, how they connect, and how our choices change it. This is a treat for long-time fans and students of the lore with everything taken into account and thoughtful additions. I still remember on my first playthrough, still in the tutorial, reading the description of an item dropped by a miniboss and feeling back home for its depth and connections to things that were speculated since the first game!Our protagonist is an ""ashen one"", a burnt-to-ash undead who failed to link the fire previously, raised again by the bell ring.We are not a champion, but by using burnt humanities - Braces, we attain that strength momentarily. Maximum HP increases by 30% and fully heals, but also enables online functionality. However, at a huge disadvantage, invaders and summons, can't be braced.DkS3's world and map are amazingly crafted and it gives a real sense of scale to the world with most areas always visible in the landscape, much like in DkS1.The game is stunning, with areas that regardless of angle belong in a painting. The world design suffers greatly from the linearity of the title but shines with its inner-area shortcuts and connections, rewarding exploration. An early map choice and DLCs do add some interesting crossroads and help break the linearity.NPCs quest lines have more interactions between them and interesting paths, often talking of not just their story, but the world around them. The voice acting is as usual top-notch and some unique animations have also been included to make some moments memorable. NPC merchants will now drop their inventory as a key item on their death.Compared to DkS1, some quality of life are added or brought forward from DkS2. For example, the removal of a mid-rolling slower animation under 70% equip load, equipment slots increased to 3 weapons and 3 shields, 4 rings, and 10 consumables. New are 5 belt slots accessible on the in-game start menu and 1 covenant slot to change it on the go and without committing a sin.Anti-aliasing is a basic FXAA, with a lot of jagged edges, especially on details. Thankfully, the game runs in DX11, so it's nothing Nvidia Control Panel's AA can't improve, and soon the mod DS3LE.The HUD is gorgeous, and the inventory stands out with the inclusion of bigger higher quality item artworks, just like in Bloodborne.The post-launch DLCs, although separate, are actually connected and I consider them integral to the experience.Ashes of Ariandel is dense and full of new additions, but alas, on the shorter end. Its length is in line with all the other Souls DLCs in terms of variety and content. It also had it has an amazing boss fight in the game. At the time, Bloodborne's The Old Hunter was being used as a comparison, which was actually two DLCs in one.The Ringed City is the show-stopper. It's stunning and varied, so much so that even my best expectations were not as good. The map, the additional lore, and the boss fights stand out, including one of the best Dragon boss fight in video games, imho. Years after, while translating and adapting my original review, it has finally been surpassed in Elden Ring's DLC, improving on these foundations.The DLC is a wonderful period, to the poetry made by all the Dark Souls games.Learning from the other games that came out before, DkS3 grows into a familiar yet faster gameplay compared to DkS1, but it's not as refined as it could be. Weapons' light attack movesets lose the 4-hit combo system of Bloodborne with a recovery window when finishing the combo; instead chain perfectly in a 1-2, leading to attack spam rather than clever swordplay. The only thing stopping you is how much stamina you have. Most bosses, while all amazing, suffer by having very consistent timings that allow for spam rolling to be viable without much consequence.Nothing will ever make me forget the lack of poise/stun protection and longsword permastunning in PVP at lunch. Balancement for the game was a learning curve, with bleeding so out-of-control-broken it bought a complete redesign of weapon paths and scaling along the last DLC, only for the better.Instead of spell usage, a mana bar and respective Flask have been introduced, needed for mages to cast, or warriors to use additional moves called weapon arts.The game features more than 200 weapons. Movesets and weapon arts are mixed and matched, and sometimes unique, especially for bosses, and DLC weapons.Each weapon has something different, and choosing a weapon for a minor difference finally returns to the series, be that a specific heavy attack, weapon art, etc. Great addition, especially after DkS2 had standardized movesets into weapon categories, with the choice falling only on the numbers.Outside the DLCs, weapon arts variety does suffer a bit, missing some great opportunities with abilities you see enemies with the same weapon use, but unobtainable.Enemies do not have limited spawn and are well-positioned, with tactics in mind, back to relying less on quantity or surprise. There is more thought, for example, a minor enemy throwing items to stop the usage of healing items during a fight with a knight.Tracking - the ability of an enemy to follow the player's movement even when motionless, essentially sliding -  while always present in these games, like in DkS1, it tracks until the enemy attacks, after which it no longer tracks the player, but instead moves in the chosen direction. The bosses are many and all different, and with the DLCs' additions, this is only improved upon. Even humanoids with a big weapon, fight very differently from one another. DkS3 is the first From Software title with all the bosses that are technically different. From more classic boss fights to others requiring a more thoughtful approach, not shying from gimmicky mechanics.Many bosses have multiple phases where the boss either adds new attacks or has an entire new movesets. There are no bosses that are a disgrace, like Bed of Chaos or Ancient Dragon from the previous titles.The reward for defeating bosses, their souls, have all different artwork adding more personality to their lore, and the descriptions are exhaustive with even more information to be found in the unlockable weapons and armor afterward.Just as their other titles, there are asynchronous mechanics for messages and death blood stains, plus a summon system.Passwords can be used to summon without any limits, scaling the stronger player down.Co-op covenants are the best they've ever been, while PVP ones suffer a bit from the matchmaking rules and some design choices. Where in DkS1 a Blade of the Darkmoon could actively benignly invade the world to help anyone being invaded, in DkS3 Blue Sentinels invade passively and rely on the player being invaded having a specific covenant equipped asking for help, decimating chances.An arena has been added post-launch and can be obtained with any of the two DLCs, and offers a one-stop place for PVP.At the moment of writing there are many cheats and exploits that won't get patched, so I would strongly suggest installing the mod Blue Sentinel from Nexus Mods, as it won't get you banned and will protect you better than the included anti-cheat.This game is not just worth the money, but the time, and effort. I think my hours on it are the definite proof I think so. It's both a great place to start and the most wonderful goodbye for long-time fans. A loving send-off to a series that shaped gaming, but also newfound freedom of an existing world's creative burden.One of the games that define me as a player, and for the hours I sunk in it with friends, as a person.10/10"

Positive,"Running this game on MSI GTX 960 4GB \Intel Core i5 4460 @3.20GHz - FPS on Max Settings: 45-60 (I have the game installed on my SSD btw)The ultimate Souls gameAfter playing all the previous games starting with my favorite (Demon's Souls), I feel like this game is the love child of all the things that made Bloodborne, DeS, and DaS great. From to the enviromental aesthetics to the great gameplay, I have really nothing to complain about in this game.Fast and fluid gameplay, beautiful visuals, decent level design, good bosses, EPIC soundtrack, and awesome character creator...in addition to couple of Berserk references here and there(because Berserk is love, Berserk is life) XDAs I stated at the beginning, I'm getting between 45 to 60fps on max settings (on MSI GTX 960 4GB). In order to get solid 60fps I had to lower the settings to medium and high (looks similar to the PS4 version, but still runs much better). I DO recommend this game, and NO... YOU DON'T HAVE TO PLAY THE PREVIOUS INSTALLMENTS to enjoy this. (^_^)b"
Positive,"Pre-Ordered the Deluxe Edition.Played until Aldrich, gave up.1,5 Years later, tried again, kicked his ass.Sitting in the corner now, crying because of Midir and Gael.10/10, would pre order again."
Positive,"Rollin, Rollin, Rollin"
Positive,"This game started off slow in all honesty, atleast until you beat the first 3 bosses, which should take like 1 - 2 hours, but this game after that threshold is absolutely amazing, the bosses are awesome, the level design is awesome, the game is just straight up awesome, I love this and don't regret buying it one bit, I almost like it as much as Elden Ring, but this game definitely has better overall bosses than Elden Ring, and is also (in my opinion) harder, especially the endgame bosses"
Positive,"Over the last few years, From Software has grown in reputation thanks to the series and being one of the most challenging on the market. The previous Dark Souls I felt stepped away from what made the series great and left From Software in a position to recover with Dark Souls III. With 3, we have a mix of old and new designed to push (and punish) players further.Undead Again:As with previous games in the Souls series, you are an undead being cursed to wander the land until you eventually become hollow or insane. Upon awakening, you are given a quest to return the lords of cinder to their throne; this entails wandering a very big land and dying a lot. Just like the other games, there is a deep story hidden behind the lore, but I'm going to leave that for someone more versed in it to talk about.The basics of the Souls are on full display here: Using a skill and timing-based combat system, you're going to be fighting enemies of all shapes and sizes while looking for shortcuts and the ever vital bonfires for checkpoints. As with Dark Souls 2, bonfires automatically allow you to teleport to them once found; allowing for quick travel to and from.Gone is the controversial adaptation stat that affected invincible frames, and the game is back to keeping them consistent across characters. There are a few new base changes to the gameplay to give players more options. The first is that your eastus flask which is your only source of healing is now split into two. You have one flask for healing and one flask for recovering flame points or FP. FP is used for using spells and special skills that are unique to each weapon type.The skills are a holdover from Bloodborne and are meant to give you more options in combat, and allow melee-focused characters a reason to boost their FP up.You can assign how many of your total charges to the different flasks, and of course upgrade your flasks to restore more with each swig.Previous games had a mechanic built around living and dying in the game: From the complex and level altering light/dark tendency in Demon's Souls, to a simple measurement in the previous Dark souls.In Dark Souls III, you can use ember to earn a flame which gives you a higher max health and puts you in a position to summon help or be invaded as long as you don't die.You'll need all of these, as Dark Souls III continues the difficult tradition of the series.Swinging a Sword:The Souls series is known for having very challenging and rewarding combat, thanks to diverse enemies and boss fights. Dark Souls III definitely takes things up a notch in both areas. Regular enemies are more varied and a lot more dangerous this time around.The reason is that enemies are faster, more aggressive and have been given more combo chains for their attacks. In previous games, an enemy would attack at most two or three swings in a single chain. Now, they will attack with more swings in a single string and their strings are more varied.For instance, enemies may perform three swings that look the same, but have two or more different combo endings to them. They also have more attacks, including those designed to punish players for using previously effective strategies.I've ran into enemies who knew how to get around circle strafing or attack you if you keep swinging too much.Bosses are also more varied and remind me of Dark Souls 1 in terms of variety and different solutions to beating them. Just like before, you can summon characters to help you or be summoned to recover your flame and get some souls in the process.From a moment-to-moment standpoint, Dark Souls III continues the greatness of the series, but there are some issues hiding under the surface.Hollowed Out:Dark Souls 3 has all the good elements of previous Souls games, but it also has all the bad as well. The camera continues to have trouble with not getting stuck while fighting larger enemies and the increased speed makes it hard for it to keep up.Of the three games and Demon's Souls (haven't played Bloodborne yet,) this one takes the cake for roughest start for new players. Unlike Demon's Souls that had a great beginning to run things by the player, you are thrust within minutes into your first boss fight and expected to learn or die.What makes Dark Souls different from Demon’s was the fact that the world was open-ended; allowing you to explore different sections that were still connected to the world's geography. Dark Souls 3 feels somewhat limited in this regard. The starting areas have a sameness to them and the connectivity between areas has been downplayed in favor of just shortcuts within each area. While this is better than the confusing world of Dark Souls 2, it doesn't beat Dark Souls 1 for world creation.All the problems that have been inherent in the Souls series is back: Unhelpful camera, enemies attacking and glitching thru certain obstacles and each other, camera still getting stuck when fighting large enemies and so on. While people may have gotten used to them, it's still a mark against the game by the fact that nothing has been done it seems to try and fix them.The new concern at the moment has to be the technical issues plaguing the game and some underlining mechanic issues. There is a bug going on that causes massive framerate lost, stuttering or simply game crashes due to the lighting.It happens at specific points in the game which makes it all the more frustrating that it wasn't caught. And of course, people have been having connectivity issues with joining games. There are also issues on the console versions as well; hopefully From Software will get those straighten out.Also, there are some points to discuss with the underlining mechanics and changes of Dark Souls III. The short version is that there are several mechanical changes that impact poise and armor, and their impact on both PvE and PvP. Unfortunately, they're way too big to get into detail about here, but that will be saved for a massive post coming to Game-Wisdom soon.Light the Fire:From Software continues to make subtle improvements to the moment-to-moment gameplay, but still is having trouble with the overall problems and concerns of the series. As with previous games, you're either going to love it or hate it for its ramped up difficulty and challenging fights.If you're new, I would still suggest either Demon's Souls or Dark Souls  to get your feet wet (maybe Bloodborne, but I haven't played it,) as Dark Souls III really feels like it was designed for someone with one of the games already under their belt. For me, I find the game at the moment lands too much on the side of being cheap with its mechanics to really enjoy fully. Just like with Dark Souls 2, expect a second post on Game-Wisdom talking explicitly about the gameplay to come soon.Anybody worried that this would be a continuation of Dark Souls II, fear not, Dark Souls III is clearly better in every aspect, but to compare it to one, well, I got a ""few"" words to say about that in another post.For more content on Dark Souls III, you can watch my depraved run on the Game-Wisdom YouTube channel.

Positive,"This game helps me realize that in order to face your fears, you must face them head on and keep trying and trying and trying until you've slain it. Dark Souls 3 is nothing but cope juice when the real world is against you and nothing is left but loneliness. At least for me, this game helps me forget the real world, this game allows me to adventure into the unknown alone and come out strong, this game aids in testing your limits in the right way possible. Besides sleep, this game offers nearly the same thing, peace. Peace is precious, something that needs to be held close, and to never be let loose. Mind goes blank as the game starts up, and the shift is reinstated as soon as the game closes. I cannot think much than praise. As of writing this review, I have ventured far beyond NG+7 and I am continuing to master this games' techniques. This is possibly one of the greatest games the 21st century has to offer, I cannot help but keep praising this game for everything it teaches through every error and victory. Life is Dark Souls"
Positive,"Ok so- this was my first Dark Souls game out of the entire series; and I was suggested it by a friend so I got it on a day that it was on sale. My husband was telling me ""You won't like it, it's going to be too hard for you."" over and over again, and you know what? While it is hard as heLL and I stILL get my butt kicked on a daILY BASIS it is still amazingly fun and addictive to play. This game is unforgiving and you wILL die over and over and over and over again. There's no avoiding this. The lore, while horriblly tragic is still beautiful in many ways and in general, I'm mad at myself for not buying this game any sooner; I would've passed up a rare gem of a game and game series."
Positive,"Hello...?Dark Souls 3, its pretty tricky. When people say it took 3 times to beat a boss, they actually mean 63 times. At least that's what I hope.

Especially to ones self."
Positive,"I have a love-hate thing for this game. It feels so, very well made, yet I feel like it missed so much potential. I hope they can make up for it in the future DLCs. It's a really fun game, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't feel quite as replayable as the other souls games. The story itself is really well made, the combat is really fun, there are many amazing weapons, and overall the game looks and plays amazingly.I just wish that the game didn't feel as if fromsoft wanted souls gone as fast as possible."
Positive,"Finally, after all DLCs and 100% achievements i'm finally done with Dark Souls 3!I played through all Souls and theis DLCs many times but my favourite one is definitly this DS3!Dark Souls 3 is an unforgiving, punishing and for starters insanely hard rpg with pvp elements.  Warning: Frustration level can be high! But no game satiesfies you like Dark Souls when you kill hat one boss after hours of unsuccessful tries.  Fight yourself through the destroyed lands of Lothric and rekindle the first flame!9,5/10PS: Anybody should play the sequels first!"

Positive,Amazing game! It is challenging and always a fun time to die over and over again. The diversity  of the areas and enemies are very unique. All of this together makes this a well thought out and great game to play if you don't break your controller first. 10/10 great gaming experience
Positive,"I recently noticed that after evey Dark Souls I play, any other game I play I have to have it on the hardest difficulty. The semi hardcore nature of this game is very addictive and it seems like so many games now a days cater to ""casual"" gamers and try to hold your hand as much as possible. Dont get me wrong thats not a bad thing, but its a nice feeling when a developer has a certain expectation of you in the game. When developers have that type of respect for gamers, it goes a long way.9/10...now pvp on the other hand.................."
Positive,"Back in the day, I sailed the seven seas to play the game and I probably had some 50 to 60 hours before I finally had the opportunity to buy it. Dark Souls is my favourite series of all time and DS3 is the best ending it could've gotten. From the evolution of gameplay to the lore, it is a masterpiece. It has its shortcomings but they aren't groundbreaking that ruins the experience. The final bossfights though, both of the main game and the ringed city are some of the greatest bossfights ever. Thank you Miyazaki sama"
Positive,"Good game, but still needs to be improved, a better optimization.Short GameplayMy first duels in PvP"
Positive,"To preface, this was played on both the PC and PS4. Impressions are from the PC versionVideo Review: (no spoilers!)Textual summary:While i condemn the issues with crash-bugs and instability i don't feel they should condemn a title that seems to run great otherwise, as i've also not experienced any of those issues myself.My main gripe with Dark souls 3 are the UI and PC (KB/M) controls. It was designed and built for a controller and you can tell. I haven't had issues in-game in terms of control, but the interface interaction is definitely sub par. Having said that... This is my favorite DS Game to date. Combat is faster (but not as fast as Bloodborne), fluid, precise and perfectly balanced between anticipation and quick thinking.  Also the introduction of mana in the game and weapon skills (""Weapon Arts"") adds another flavor and managed aspect to the title.They've taking a lot of lessons learned from DS1 and DS2 and applied them here: Big interconnected world... but not as maze-like complex as DS1. Great Netcode and PC Performance. The Art style and graphical quality is insanely good and really benefits from the new engine.Overall a VERY VERY good game. I've lost my first nights sleep on it, and im sure many other have."
Positive,"- Kept on dying for first full day playing DS3. - When I reached first boss I turned into a raging emo kid who found out their Fall Out Boy CD had been shat on by the dog- Lots of REEEEEEEEEE- Went back for more- Nearly broke my controller- Further into game, discover pvp- Some knob in a fat suit with an onion head ganked my pathetic beta nub arse- Determined to get revenge- Gitgud at game- Get some reet gudstuf- Procede to invade other worlds and merrily gank other pathetic beta nubs like myself to satiate my beta nubness- Invade worlds where 3 of them are waiting for me- Get ganked10/10"
Positive,"This game really feels like the culmination of everything From and Miyazaki have been doing with the series. It's incredibly tight, combat is sped up (albeit not to the level of Bloodborne) and the world is ALIVE. Early in the game, you come to a cliff side and below you stretches, literally, the whole game. You can see all the locations you will soon be visiting, its an awe inspiring moment, and really sets the tone. Meanwhile, if you're a lore hound, prepare to boggle at how much is packed in here. Everything around you tells a story and drips with history. This really is the continuation of Dark Souls. Oh, Covenants also are majorly improved upon, allowing switching on the fly and letting players really explore play styles until they find something that really is for them. It's incredible. As of right now, I have completed the game once, clocking in at 50 hours, and have already rolled up a new character to do it again.New Game+ will happen eventually, but I wanted to go through it again with new players first. There is also a way for players to re-spec later in the game, which is nice."
Positive,"I have started DS3 after I completed Sekiro 3 times and honestly it felt easier. Telegraphing enemy moves and dodge is a lot fun. This game doesn't let you combine different items to overcome your challenges but it does let you level up and get stronger. I did not find the game extremely difficult for that reason. There are few bosses and areas that will challenge you, thou (yes, Midir I am looking at you).Regardless, beating every boss fight and stage is epic and it satisfies you. Do not listen others that say the game is too difficult. It is challenging but  if you want, you can partner with your friend and others so they can also help you.  Apparently DS series has a deep lore but it is difficult to learn about it deeply by playing the game alone. You better go to forums and read for that."

Positive,"Oh boi ive been thinking about writing a review about this game.actually imma talk about all of fromsoftware products, they are masterpieces over 90 percent of people avoid these games have actual skill issue and 5 percent trying to convince themselves they dont like it; on other hand maybe 5 percent really dont like it.these games make the our gamer's destiny. why? because  we play and play to enjoy until we feel satisfied.This is the satisfaction,This is optimal joy. gaming industry is trash when you look from all aspects after you play an actual game of souls. The art, the war, the tactic, the ability to adapt and learn are all in these games.it started from demon souls and darksouls 1 and years ago i started to play these games but it remained unfinished due to compromised console. but finally i started and i am enjoying a real game.i have diminished my wishlist from over 100+ to around 24 games. and i have become strict in choosing a game to play. I never have said such a thing before but these fromsoftware games are worth complete price .see?only 6-8 games worth full price and are these. try to purchase in discounted price now tho.if u wanna enjoy your old games dont play these cause all will be trash to you as they are now to me.only few number left worthy to me.anyway praise the sun praise the fromsoftware hope the never disappoint us as they never did. and GIT GUDSo longDarkman"
Positive,"As I stepped into the dark and foreboding world of Dark Souls III, I knew I was in for a challenge. From the eerie opening cinematic to the oppressive atmosphere of the first area, everything about this game oozes a sense of dread and unease.But despite the difficulty, I couldn't stop playing. Every death felt like a learning opportunity, and every victory felt like a hard-earned triumph the combat system is deep and rewarding, with a wide range of weapons and spells to master(IM A Str FRIENDLY BTW), and the enemy design is top notch with each foe presenting its own unique challengesThe world of Dark Souls III is a masterclass in environmental storytelling, with every area dripping with lore and atmosphere. The level design is superb, with hidden paths and secrets around every corner, and the boss fights are some of the most epic and memorable I've ever experienced in a gameAnd yet, for all its challenges and frustrations, there's a sense of beauty to Dark Souls III. The haunting soundtrack, the gorgeous vistas, the intricate details of the armor and weapons - it all comes together to create a world that's as captivating as it is deadly.In short, Dark Souls III is a masterpiece of game design. It's not for the faint of heart, but for those who are willing to put in the time and effort, it's a journey that's well worth taking.(I didnt want to really talk about how port actually is and suffering from...)"
Positive,"I love the Dark Souls series, no other game envelops you in an atmosphere of medieval gloom quite like this. Im crap at the game however, recognising patterns has never been one of my strong points so i struggle particularly with the bosses who are heavily scripted... Still ive managed to finish the game after 70 odd hours of sheer determination and thats what makes the game so satisfying.The thrill you get after beating a boss is second to none, and even just finally navigating on of the games many beautiful areas (in a warped sort of way) is exhilarating after dozens of deaths.Theres nothing i can really say about Dark Souls 3 that hasnt been said already... it really is worth getting and sticking with if fantasy/ Rpg type games are your thing.."
Positive,"Best Dark Souls game of the serie so far(played 23 hours in two days). Optimization is really well made. I have never had any crash or FPS drop. My settings are currently on ""MAX"" and i am having constant 45 fps with a mid budged PC.PROS: Level design is incredible and you can easily get lost in the wast world. (always some hidden places to explore)Combat system is DA BEST! It is fast paced, balanced and unforgiving.AI is clever and i mean it. I always feel like i am fighting a player while fighting with a mob. Musics are masterpiece. You'll see.Oh boy and so many more things that i've lost count. CONS:YOU DIED"
Positive,"A worthy successor to the series and a very good RPG game regardless of the series.The Dark Souls franchise is very unique in it's implementations of gameplay, shadowed lore and story and artistic detail and direction of the design of it's worlds with an astounding level of quality commensurate for their size, scope and scale."

Positive,This game. Has absolutely. Ruined my. Life. 5-stars
Positive,"First off; I actually beat this game. (My achievements say otherwise) This frustrating, cheap, challenging masterpiece, is one of my recent favorites. I’m sad I didn’t get into the series sooner. The first 40 hours or so of this game was hard for me. Since I never played a Souls game before; I didn’t know how to approach combat nor how to manage my Estus. I died, a lot. However; once I got halfway through the game, I “got gud” as they say. Now almost to NG+ I’m excited to try the game all over again. :DMy love for this series and DS3 itself will forever hold a place is my heart. PSThe Nameless King and The Abyss Watchers are my favorite Boss fights."
Positive,"I am pathetic at this game and I have already died countless number of times just with the tutorial boss but I still want to play on and hopefully complete it before I die in reality.  A SUPER CHALLENGING GAME (I'm too scared to even think about the later bosses. :')Edit: currently at 87 hrs, and all i can say is that this game is a masterpiece and i'm so glad i decided to play it. This being my first souls-like game, it was a brilliant introduction to the genre! I am a gamer who doesn't replay games often directly after finishing it and rather, keep some time off in the middle before playing the game again but this game made me go through ng+ (playing the game twice) right after I finished the game for the first time and I'm right now planning to grab the achievements as well as to go ng++. LOOK at the change it has brought into me. AND all i can say is that, beating Gael solo made me git gud by at least even 5%. The multiple deaths and failures make you GET BETTER !! dont give up!Like hell, this game is surely difficult and is made for raging and despair but still, with every boss kill, or runthrough of an area, you will feel like you're on top of the world. Now, GO AND PLAYYYYY it!"
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 has both upsides and downsides compared to the previous titles.As it's own game, it is great, but still very rough on newcommers.Several game mechanics are once again not being explained and without help from other players or a guide, the avarage player is going to miss even entire areas with their own bosses and items on his/her first playthrough(s).However Souls-Veterans are also going to face a few new mechanics as well.The game's world is both beautiful and dark. Sometimes even both at the same time. There are countless different enemy designs and fighting through the areas was mostly challanging and fun.Especially the bosses later in the game are very tough, some even frustratingly hard. Dark Souls is known to be harsh but fair, this also applies to Dark Souls 3 for the most part. However there are also occasions, where I had to question, if that stunlock, gigantic hitbox or speed is really reasonable. Overall it is still fair, but some moments left a bitter taste. Dark Souls 3 plays in the same world as the other 2 titles, therefore many different weapons and items make a return and a couple of npcs are directly from the other games. However Dark Souls 3 also recycles/reuses many of the ideas, it goes so far that some of the moments already felt like fanservice for players that also played through the other games. It is not necessarily bad, but to me it seemed really forced sometimes.Something else that I missed were connections between areas. Unlike in Dark Souls 1, the world's areas all feel very seperated, even though they are technically very close to each other. Also the player does not have to look for cross-area connections, because he can teleport to other discovered areas right from the get go.Connecting to specific players got easier, now you can just use a password in the Menu's settings, instead of having to use a ring or even change your whole download region in the steam settings. This only applies to Summon Signs though, as long as you're online and you meet the conditions, you can end up being assaulted by other players.PvP exists in 2 ways, either random invasions, where one player appears in a different player's game to kill him, or as dueling, where players summon other players as enemy into their world on purpose via Red Summon Signs.Invasions prioritize hosts that have coop partners at their side, which helps PvE players, but makes the job difficult for those who want to ambush other players in their world.The online experience tends to suffer from latency issues, mostly relevant for PvP. A Region Lock exists, but it doesn't seem to do anything (similar to how it was in previous titles).I did not enjoy the PvP as much as in Dark Souls 2 for multiple reasons: - Most of my favorite weapons are bad for PvP in the current Patch, because of inferior damage and/or speed, which means I have to use something that I don't enjoy using, when I want to win. - A large number of weapon movesets got straight up copied from other weapons and there is a high number of weapon moves that are either situational or just completely outclassed/useless- Especially the strong attacks on many weapons are only useful, when the opponent is far away, because they are much slower than light attacks without giving much of an advantage, therefore the combat loses a lot of depthDark Souls 3 is still definitely worth playing for the PvE content already, but it is a shame that the PvP is lackluster. Hopefully things will change over the next months with the upcomming dlc content and further patches."
Positive,"I now put around 100 hours into this game and I can definetly recommend it. Long story short:+ graphics are really good. Most if not all locations look beautiful. The developers paid a lot of attention to details.+ sound is great and ""realistic"". Dark Souls 3 features by far the best soundtrack in the series. The theme of the Abyss Watchers is a prime example. The voice acting is also pretty good. + combat is fluid and faster as in Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2.+ a lot of armour, weapons, spells, miracles and pyromancies. + great multiplayer - yeah, it is basically the same as in 1 and 2 but this kind of multiplayer is unique compared to any other franchise (I include Demon's Souls and Bloodborne into the Souls franchise).+ really good quests which enrich the story and are not thrown into your face like in any other RPG.+ really good length. Doesn't matter if you include the DLC or not.- invasions or PVP in general can be annoying due to latency issues or lag. Only the arena (accessable while playing the DLC) features a server. The rest is P2P.- backtracking for additional armour doesn't make much sense - discover location A, 5 hours later, at location X, you kill a certrain unique enemy, armour can now be found at location A. I'm talking about Havel's armour to be specific.- the first DLC, Ashes of Ariandel, is pretty poor on it's own when it comes to length and variety. But since anybody who buys the game probably buys the complete edition anyway, this does not mean much. I just wanted to point that out. Especially since both DLC's belong together - literally. - some enemy types can be seen as a recycled version of an earlier enemy later on. It is not that obvious as in other games but still. Seems kinda lazy.I can definetly recommend the purchase of this game. It does not matter if it is on sale or not. In my opinion, it still is worth 60 bucks. Compare it to ""triple A"" trash from Activision or EA and you can pay 100€ without batting an eye."
Positive,"Even after playing though this game countless times I still find enjoyment in starting fresh with a new challenge or build idea in mind. If you're new to this sort of game I suggest choosing the knight class since it starts off with a long sword and a shield with decent stability and complete physical damage protection. With how well distributed its stats are, you'll be able to expand out to other playstyles a short time after starting the game (e.g an intellagence, fait or pyro build). I also suggest going solo as much as you can since this will allow you to learn enemy/boss attack patterns and where you'll be able to get your hits in. Take a look around yourself when you can, by the way. Even at 720p at the lowest settings, this game looks beautiful. Especially some of the far off views that are now a part of my folder I use for desktop backgrounds."
Positive,"The best example for  Love/Hate relationshipThis is the final game in the series for now and I am unsure if a new souls game will be released. The Ringed City DLC seems to be the last installment for the dark souls series. I am excited to see their new ip and hope it surpasses the souls series. What is DS3; If you are a fan of the Dark Souls series and completed the first two games a while back, you should purchase the third installment without delay, as I did. I believed I had experienced everything with Dark Souls, especially with Dark Souls 2, but when I purchased Dark Souls 3, I was surprised by the significant improvement from its predecessor. The difference between the two games is so vast that words cannot do it justice.It's similar to the dark souls experience we've been craving for ages.It also includes elements from previous Dark Souls games and even from Demon's Souls <3.Dark Souls 2 failed to meet my expectations, causing me to overlook Dark Souls 3. Don't repeat my mistake (even though Dark Souls 2 isn't awful and has its own charm, it didn't meet my expectations), try playing Dark Souls 3 instead. It's like a hidden gem, but in truth it holds more value than you think. I can't put my emotions into words ✍️(◔◡◔) haha :P. Good luck to everyone and enjoy playing dark souls 3 with a smile. Don't forget to remain patient and develop your own tactics to enhance your fun. DS3 differs from other Souls game series since it provides more clarity, allowing players to quickly understand their objectives, directions, and reasoning behind actions within the first 2-4 hours. However, I hold this belief because of how much our understanding of the game has grown since we first played Dark Souls 1 on the PS3/xbox360 with no prior knowledge. I could be correct or mistaken, but you should test out the game on your own. I immediately recommend that Dark Souls 3 boasts superior PvP compared to the rest of the series. I believe that, at a specific moment, it stands out as one of the greatest features in comparison to other Souls games. Examine the game to confirm or refute my assertion. I appreciate you reading my review. ____________________Be aware from :The online matching in the game is done through the process below:-Players who do not match with the same regulation versions are excluded ""u and ur friends needs to have the same update"".-Players who cannot connect with the network type (mainly NAT3) are excluded ""TL:DR same as console type 1,2,3 idea""=Players that are outside the host range parameter will be excluded.-Players who are from different regions are excluded=Based on the host, players who have out of ranged advanced weapon levels are excludedThe player level and the weapon level are less effective in the password matching.What does that mean?If you and your friend haven't set a password, and your character level is 140 while your friend is only level 40 and just starting the game, make sure to use a password in order to bypass these limitations and assist your friendIf you want calculation: (Keep in mind the margin of error here is +/-10If the host level is 40-Minimum phantom level you could summon is=26=Maximum phantom level you could summon is=54If the host level is 120-Minimum phantom level you could summon is=98=Maximum phantom level you could summon is=142If the host level is 140-Minimum phantom level you could summon is=116=Maximum phantom level you could summon is=164"

Positive,"A strong finish to the trilogy. Unfortunately a bit more linear compared to previous entries, but overall a much better and polished experience."
Positive,">>PART1/2<<Well after some time and patches passed, it is time to post my review for this game.I played it for roughly 150hrs, which enabled me to do almost 3 palythroughs, with 2 different characters (a quality dex/str build in ng+ and a pyromancer in ng, both level 120).To make a long story short, for anybody who wants a short review: It is the best DS Game I played from the series (DS:PtdE, DS2:Sotfs) with DS1 being a close place #2 and DS2 being the ""worst"" of the series (there is a 4th game, Demonsouls, I never played).I will try and focus this review for both kind of palyers, (Part 1) those familiar with the Souls-Series (I have about 500hrs combined throughout all titles) and (Part 2) those who are new the series.Let's start with a more ""newbie"" friendly part:I strongly recommend DS3 to be your first of the series! Storywise you will miss some things, but the gameplay and overall feeling is the best throughout all Souls-games. DS2 might be a bit complicated and overwhelming for newcomers, and DS1 is just too old and not as well ported from console, compared to DS3.List of Pros for upcoming Wanna-be-Ashen-Ones:Easy-to-learn Controls (even for me, who really struggles(-ed) with controllers, since DS1 was my first game of that kind)Very immersive (the overall mood is a bit dark, which fits my taste. Even though the NPCs don't have any dialogue options available, they feel very real and you can relate to them, and your character. Also music and sounds are beautifully woven into the mood of each map!)Challangeing and unforgiving gameplay (Don't belive everything the internet tells you: ""DARK SOULS ARE THE HARDEST GAMES EVER!!!!!!1111"" It is challenging, yes. It can be frustrating, yes. But nonetheless it never felt like undoable at any point. You don't need superfast reactions. All you do need is a good memory for boss attack patterns and until you figured all of them out, it can take a while. Sure good reactions can help you for a good portion of the game, but they are not THAT important overall. By that I mean, its not that important WHEN to dodge, its more like HAVING to dodge at some point during a specific attack. So I would state, the PvE part of the game is less about skill, then it is actually about patience/time investment.)In addition to the previous point I mentioned, I want to state that there is nonetheless  ALOT of room for skill in this game. (So if you like becomeing better and better over time and love having the feeling that there is still room for improvement, this is the game for you! You can perfect certain machnics, which sure make the game easier, without really needing them to beat a particular boss. See the negative section below for even more details!)Graphics: awesome for a game originally intended for console.Huge variaty of mobs/bosses and maps. (every boss feels unique in mechanics, aswell as in skin. Same goes for enemies, there are just a few you can find on every/most/multiple maps)(in my opinion/point of view) there is a unique Online-play/PvP System. (Which is a nice perk! You can have some epic PvP matches during PvEing, because there is an invasion system, which allows other players to come into your world and hunt you down. It might be frustrating at the beginning, but once you know the basic game mechanics it becomes more and more fun. Also the designers implemented thoughtfully a pretty nice support for new players (Blue Sentinels/Way of the Blue), so it's not too overwhelming for them and getting owned 24/7.)Very little bugs/glitches, I would even say none at all. (That I know of)Regular updates, which balance weapons and monsters. Also there will be DLCs, which are in my experience (from DS1&2) really worth to buy, since they offer alot of endgame content and unique bosses/storylines.No grinds. (You really don't have to grind at any point of the game, it's just not worth the effort. You can still do it, though, if you are the kind of person who likes grinding. There are some things you don't need for game progress, but are somehow worth the time)And only to round up the picture, I want to give some ""negative"" input aswell:About mechanics/skill that makes the game easier: I would've wished for some bosses to force you to use a specfic mechanic (like parrieing) or even build variation (only vulnerable by magic, for example). Even though every boss has it's own weaknesses against specfic damage-type, it feels like it does not actually matter which element you choose from.Do not expect a Skyrim-like RPG-adventure! (It's not like those kind of RPGs at all! There are way less quests/NPCs and a way smaller and more linear world to explore. To find every item in the game you can have in one single palythrough, took me roughly 60 Hours, for new players this time should be ~150 without any help and 100 with guides from web, I suppose.Also you character is much less costumizable (Still with a huge variation in builds, but without different background-stories or in-depth skilltrees).This is not really a fair point, since Dark Souls does not want to be a Skyrim at all, but I wanted to mention it anyway, since I found some people complaining about that! Some people might find this actually more positive, thats one reason why I used quotation marks on the word negative abovely,SO MANY TRIES. (As I said in the positive section, if you are not a natural, expect to die -alot-. Which is not really your lack of skill, I can assure you. It's more like you don't know the attack patterns, yet. Even me, who knew DS1 and DS2, struggeled with some foes so hard, I died at elast 20 times to them (try killing a fire demon with a pyromancer...). Also you will find yourself without any heals left and a pounding heart, not knowing the path to choose to the next checkpoint! Exihlerating, but discouraging, if you die over and over.)In my honest opinion there has to be a lot of work to be done in terms of netcode for PvP online play. (While PvE-Coop-play mostly works great, I experienced alot of lag, rubberbanding and random hits in PvP. To be honest, I suck at PvP, but thats mainly due to the fact, I suck at parrieing, which is because my LT-Key does not work properly. But I know the (PvE-) game mechanics well enough, to know when I shouldn't be hittable, and (in PvP) I still get hit during dodgerolls frequently. Or in other cases I get hit by a Shortsword (little range, on paper) while being out of range, and therefore missing the target with my Ultra Greatsword (huge range, on paper).That's the reason I usally avoid PvP. Of my overall 150 hours played, I engaged maybe 20% in active PvPing. I know there are palyers which PvP ALOT more, but thats my experience, so far.)You will sometimes feel ""lost"". (Either it's the storyline, which at some points just doesn't tell you where to go next. Or the lack of any quest log or descriptions. It actually fuels the imersiveness of the game, but at some point you just feel cheated by the game for not telling or just hinting you where to go/what to do next.)The maps could be a little less linear. (Well that says it all, doesn't it?)I wrote down more negative points, than positive ones. But as you read them, you will notice some of then can count as both, according to your own preference/likings.I have to split my review here, since I am running out of characters... Next Part (in the comment section of this review) will be for people, who know (parts of) the Souls-Series."
Positive,"Try tongue, but hole?"
Positive,"DARK SOULS III is a 3D action role-playing platformer that encapsulates the entertainment in the DARK SOULS franchise. From an outstanding and heartbreaking storyline to chaotic multiplayer sorties, prepare to die in the most wonderful and game-breaking way yet, in DS3! “Yes, indeed. It is called Lothric, where the transitory lands of the Lords of Cinder converge. In venturing north, the pilgrims discover the truth of the old words: ""The fire fades and the lords go without thrones."" When the link of fire is threatened, the bell tolls, unearthing the old Lords of Cinder from their graves… Aldrich, Saint of the Deep, Farron's Undead Legion... the Abyss Watchers, and the reclusive lord of the Profaned Capital, Yhorm the Giant. Only in truth, the Lords will abandon their thrones, and the Unkindled will rise. Nameless, accursed Undead, unfit even to be cinder. And so it is, that ash seeketh embers.” - opening cinematic and narration of Dark Souls III.DARK SOULS IIIs plot follows the Ashen One, an undead unfit to be a Lord of Cinder, as they try to fulfil their destiny to return the five defiant Lords of Cinder to their thrones, for a prolonged Age of Fire. What follows is a faithful adventure in impressive sequences at the transitory lands of the Lords of Cinder; most of the story’s structure is very similar to the first original game. If you have experienced the past DARK SOULS games, you’ll know what to expect from twists and themes. While I found the story is somewhat innovatively lacking compared to the past two games, the experience is still worth it thanks to the direction of Hidetaka Miyazaki and the lore-building behind different characters and items. Besides that, there isn’t much to say. It’s an 8/10 storyline in my opinion, with a ride that takes about 10-15 hours (or more including multiplayer interruptions.) The game captures the feeling of being an undead rather well. Gameplay focuses on reaching the end of a location and fighting whatever comes at you in the process. The enemies are dangerously aggressive, enticing you to fight rather than run. It's rather simple and repetitive at the same time. Your movement options consist of walking, backstepping, jogging, running, and rolling which allows a quick dodging mechanic while in combat. You have a decent rewarding system for weapons at your disposal; daggers. straight swords, greatswords. ultra greatswords, curved swords, curved greatswords, katanas, and thrusting swords. You have the usage of consumables which are used to receive temporary benefits, most important being the Estus Flask used for healing.In addition, combat mechanics allow you to target-lock, use standard attack or a charged up strong attack, parry (shout-out to all the “Parry Gods” out there, I worship you: doppio parry), kick, plunge, riposte, back-stab, etc. The most important addition to combat mechanics are weapon arts, otherwise known as skills, utilised with focus points. It's a variety of special moves that each weapon comes with, dealing great damage against all enemies. It consumes focus points, which is the blue bar stat below your health bar used for miracles, magic and said skills alongside your stamina, a completely new system to the DARK SOULS series. It requires an Ashen Estus Flask to regenerate, and can be levelled up. In the finale of gameplay mechanics, if you’re playing on keyboard & mouse, I’d personally suggest using a controller of some sort. I started out on keyboard & mouse and struggled a lot with certain gameplay mechanics. E.G. I learned I could block after using a controller months later. There is a surprising amount of main and optional bosses to visit in DARK SOULS III. Although you’re always killing, you get to take part in some of the most hype-inducing yet gut wrenching (in a good way) boss fights ever. There’s a balance of bosses that can quite literally beat the hell out of you, but it always interests you in the end. It’s that feeling of defeat that shows you how great victory will be. Many boss movesets can be frustrating and disturbing for most of the play-through, however, you learn and adapt after losing so much that you realise you achieved a lot afterwards… even if you didn’t win right away… or at all. To end this review, this game is really really good. It's worth it all the way. It has it's flaws sometimes, such as hitbox situations and performance issues, but everything about this game makes up for it. I can't wait for Elden Ring!"
Positive,You'll die a lot. Like really a lot. But you'll have a hella fun doing so.
Positive,PROS- You die a lotCONS- No pizza10/10Update:- Both DLCs do not have pizza as well- You die even moreStill 10/10
Positive,"Great game, but can be unfair at times if you're impatient (compared to Dark Souls 1, where you don't have to be patient and constantly wait for the enemy to strike for most of the game), or when the enemies decide to hit you through a wall resulting in you dropping off a cliff or something similar. The hitreg can also be horrible at times. If you're playing against another player, prepare for a lot of lag. You might not even hit someone but they will still take damage and vice versa.If you're new to the dark souls series, this is likely the best one to start off with, although Dark Souls 1 isn't bad to start off with either. Just don't touch Dark Souls 2 unless you're committed to finishing them all.Screw Darkeater Midir."

You start the game with terrifying music to play and keep getting your ass beaten over and over and over and over and over x10000 times again. Ah then you finally beat your tutorial first boss and feel the glory, power and feel the REAL satisfaction which you’ve never felt before! Now you take a break and watch videos, wiki etc and get to know Dark Souls Story and you’re like what the hell? This game has so much deep story, holy crap and then you dig deep into the story!!  then you shed some tears when you get to know about Knight Artorias and his Puppy Sif. I also think Nameless king and his Dragon has some special bond too. Every Single Bosses, Mini Bosses, Corrupted and EVEN EVERY DAMN BRICKS has their own emotional story :(  but someone will always remain close to us, It's Solaire of Astora or simply its the SUN BRO!! He is here to find his own sun! and then then then you just start to hear the soundtracks, animations, parody etc and that’s how you become Dark Soul’s Ultimate fan!Git Gud or Die Trying"

Positive,"A Cynical Review: Dark Souls 3   Is There A Plot?: Dark Souls 3 is the magnum opus of Fromsoftware's Souls series bringing it to an epic finale beyond our wildest expectations. As the Champion of Ash, you must save the realm in its darkest moment and bring the Lords of Cinder to their knees. But will you link the First Flame for the last time, or plunge the world into the Abyss and ascend the Throne of Londor as Lord of Hollows?  Is This Even Fun?: Inspired by the speed and finesse of Bloodborne, Dark Souls 3 is the fastest paced game in the series. For some it might seem impossible, for others… they would not have it any other way. It looks gorgeous, plays fantastically, and has the best soundtrack imaginable. The addition of the 2 DLC areas are incredible with some of the greatest and most challenging bosses yet.  100% Achievements?: Much like the other Souls games, you can 100% this game. It will require 3 playthroughs going from NG-NG++, collecting all the Spells can be grindy however due to the Covenant related items. But if it were easy, it would not be Dark Souls. Is It Worth Buying?: I do not know if I can talk this game up more, as a ""Prepare-to-Die Hard"" fan of this series I could not have hoped for a better send off. You would be crazy not owning this game, treat yourself to my favorite game of all time. (Baring Dark Souls 1… cause nostalgia.) 10/10 PRAISE THE SUN!!!"
Positive,Game: How many times do you want to die?me: Yes
Positive,"Brief: Score: 1000/100.  An absolutely amazing 3rd Person RPG. One of the best games I’ve ever played, and I recommend it to anyone looking to get into Dark Souls or continuing their adventures in Dark Souls.This game is one of the greatest games ever made. Heck, this game is one of the top three greatest artistic achievements ever made.  The only negative is it's probably one of the easiest games ever made. Despite the easy sauce covering this game, Dark Souls 3 fills you with a feel good story, a sense of optimism, and never say quit attitude. This game is a breath of fresh air in the current era where game designers spend way to much time making hard games that frustrate gamers. The story is straight forward and simple. There is no need to guess or speculate. In fact it puts the story codex right on the items. Finally, on the rare occasion that you die, the game will let you know just in case you missed it. BS aside, this is really the game of the year from 2016. It makes Dishonored 2 seem like a joke. It makes Titanfall 2 look like a a newspaper comic strip. And even Witcher 3, DLC included, fails to compare. I recommend this game. If I could get a hold of a FUMES great sword, and somehow figure out a way to lift it, I would force you to buy it (for your own good)."
Positive,The lovechild of Dark Souls 1 and Bloodborne.
Positive,oh i get it its dark souls 3 so they put 3 of every guy
Positive,"Had Dark Souls III on my PS4 and loved it so much I thought I'd get it on my PC as well. I've played through all of the games in the series and I have to say, this game is up there is up there in my all-time favorites. Would definitely recommend to anyone whos looking for a challenge with a whole lot of enjoyment throughout it."
Positive,"most people think of only how hard the game is or about how good they are at it but not all of them look at how it was made, the view is just amazing the way the story goes is just sad at how it ended, i love the story and the game itself 10/10 would miss the dark soul series."
Positive,"This was the first Fromsoft game I played and my introduction to the souls series. I've played through the  game three times and I think its overall the best in the trilogy. It does sacrifice the interconnected world design in favor of a more linear progression which I think is the main thing Dark Souls 1 did better. However the graphics, Ai, and combat are the best and most polished in the series. The combat system is much faster than its predecessors and I personally enjoy this play style even though Dark Souls 1 combat is solid in its own right. The level design is well done with enemies presenting the typical souls series challenge that maintains fairness. There are a healthy variety of enemies and varied level design that provide the player with unique challenges as they progress through the game. I love the bosses in this game as they are the best Fromsoft has created in my opinion. Bosses like Darkeater Midir, Slave Knight Gael, Sister Friede, and The Nameless King build upon previous installments to create the most polished and mechanically complex boss fights in the series. With more advanced Ai, more complex mechanics, and more diverse movesets many of the bosses are the most challenging yet fun in the series in my eyes. I also like how this game wrapped up the lore of the trilogy as this was a tall order but overall well done. I think the DLCs are a must-buy as they are an increased challenge compared to the base game and provide amazing levels, enemies, and bosses that make it well worth the price. The OST is also great much like all Fromsoft games. I'd personally give this game a 9.5/10."
Positive,"A fantastic end to the Dark Souls trilogy. This is a good game for both newcomers of the series, and veterans alike. The Linking the Fire ending gave me goosebumps, followed by the beautiful ending credits theme. Thank you Miyazaki and FromSoftware. <3"
Positive,"Better than Elden Ring. That's right, I said it."
Positive,Multiplayer is back. Praise the sun.

Positive,"🟦 Amazing souls-like game, simply one of the best🟦 Thank God it did not follow in the footsteps of DS2🟦 Numerous classes to play with🟦 Beating any bosses rewards you with achievement which feels so good, previous games lacked this feature🟦 Spell system is not limited by uses anymore, a big improvement🟦 Massive DLC content🟥 No cloud save, you've to backup savegame by yourself. Make sure to keep this in mind as it's extremely important, you don't want to lose your progress"
Positive,"I got a tatoo of the bonfire on me about a year ago. I feel like I have matured as a person and as a player with this game. I know my hours on PC are low but I played this game on console back then. Alot of people ask me what the tatoo is and why I would get something as odd as that on my body forever but it is so that when I awake each day, I can view the day as an Unkindled One. I know that no matter what will happen on this day I will get to my bonfire, whether it be the one ahead due to progress or the one before from failure. The lore and story is something you have to find, akin to the search for meaning in our day to day struggle. This game rewards patience and punishes rashness, hides beauty and wonder for those who do not take the road less traveled. Once you get in the feel for this game you grow doubtful and question everything, and have this need to learn more. There is no better feeling of accomplishment, joy, and satifcation in any game or experience like what this series has to offer. I have devoured an anthology of lore from the soulsbourne series and will forever hold this game dear. The hours spend reading wikis and watching lore videos allowed me to discover my love for learning and made me go back to school. I figured that if I could ""git gud"" and beat NG+, I ought to be able to put some hours in for a degree. Thank you guys for making this enfuriating, beautiful, simple, yet captivating experience."
Positive,"It's pretty neat, although I wouldn't consider it the best entry in the Souls games. I'm just going to list things that I enjoyed and things that I thought were done better in the previous games. So let's start with the graphics, which look very familiar if you played Bloodborne. It's definitely an upgrade to the previous Souls games and the locations are absolutely stunning so there is really nothing I could complain about in this departement. The combat is a bit faster now which is fine by me. There is also Weapons Art and the the addition of the Focus Points which I, as a UGS wielder never actually used. Perhaps it has its uses for some situations but I never encountered those. Poise is drastically changed now, I could wear full Havels and become staggered by some rat or a starved dog. I'm not sure what From was thinking when implemanting those changes. Other then that the PvE and PvP are very enjoyable and there are a lot more people to play with. The game difficulty swaps around a bit. For instance the only challenging area was Archdragon Peak for me. Maybe it's just me and after 3 games I already got used to the concept and gameplay so that's why I would consider Dark Souls 1 as the most challenging of them all. Game seems a lot shorter even for someone who has to ""100% every area available"".  Steam says that I spend aroung 120 hours on DS1, DS2 and Bloodborne yet I have ""only"" 50 on DS3 and I almost finished it. All in all the game has it flaws here and there but in the end it's very enjoyable and something that I would recommend on buying to someone who enjoyed the previous games. It's also probably the best game to start with if you want to play the Soulsborne games as it seems a bit more beginner friendly.Oh, I forgot to say that the music is ridiculously good which is really worth mentioning."
Positive,"Game is not hard like Dark Souls 1 or 2, is better for cassual players, but still have good story and dont exist soul memory and is playlable with friends becus exist password system :) But still is challenging and is beautifull. Still need xbox 360 controler. Have Funn :D"

Positive,"After 1000 hours, i'm ready to write my review, first of all i must say that this is my favorite game of all TIME, the amount of art and detail put into this game is overwhelming, Dark souls 3 is made with heart without a doubt from the soundtrack to the characters, jesus the worlds that miyazaki created in this game, i remember the first time i set foot in Irythill of the Boreal Valley i was left astonished, simply amazing.This game reminds me of the old days when i would go buy a game and get the FULL experience, no micro-transactions, only hard work to unlock all the weapons and costumes for my character, also the amount of customization for your character is amazing, there's probably more than 30+ sets to fully customize your character, you can use a single piece of each set, to create your own abomination.This is where i'm going to be a little pesimistic about the game if played on PC, the amount of cheaters is dreadful and FromSoftware doesn't give a flying duck if you were modified with GOD MODE by a hacker, you'll get banned too, i've had friends permanently banned from the online experience, just because a stupid hacker modified their account, sometimes they'll insta kill all the bosses in the map, which will cause invalid data registry in your account as well, however if you get banned you can fix this by making a family-sharing account and playing from there, still you'll have to start from 0 again and like i said FromSoftware won't give a damn if you were not cheating, they'll only see the invalid data and give you a warning to delete it or they'll perm ban, so be CAREFUL with what you pick from other players, other than that invading is AMAZING, it's hilarious to make riot in anothers ashen one's worlds.The game runs smooth if you meet the requirments 60+ fps no problems, the only problem i have encountered is if you use a DS4 with DS4WINDOWS, it can cause some crashes here and there.Dark souls 3 is worth every single penny you spend on it, it's by far the ultimate RPG adventure, if you have friends to play with, it's even better. 9/10"
Positive,*Lifetime Achievement Award: Hidetaka Miyazaki*
Positive,Finished the game on my PS4. One of the best fucking games ive ever played i cant wait to play it on PC :D
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is technically and design wise the strongest game in the trilogy, providing both a great start to newcomers to the series and also a fitting end (hopefully) to the game series. That said it does also lack some elements that made the original more memorable and takes a step back in some regards to how Dark Souls 2 functioned. Regardless the whole game acts as a coherent whole similar to the original, though not without caveats.If you step away from the rather nonsensical  ""git gud"" and ""HARDEST GAME EVA!"" style of buzzwording and advertising spiel focusing on Dark Souls' difficulty curve, an element I'm not going to plunge into too much as it has been focused on to death in other places, possibly the main draw to the Souls series has been its world building and combat. The original Dark Souls had one of the greatest world designs I've possibly ever seen in games, where everything functioned as a coherent whole with some lovely trickery to catch out players. Dark Souls 2 however seemed to fluff this up rather badly both with giving the player the ability to warp between fires from the get-go and rather uninspired and illogical level design: Hello lava coved plateau accessed by climbing a tower.Dark Souls 3 thankfully takes some steps back to the more coherent visions of DS1. From the early area in the High Wall of Lothric you can see the majority of locations stretching off into the distance below the high city, as you can also see the locations stretching back up from the bottom, including a rather fantastic deep trench from a place called Irathil. The world is laid out in a coherent manner and, like the original Dark Souls, if you could see something far off not only does that mean you can most likely go there, but it also will be in a roughly correct geographical location. Despite this nice move back to the coherent whole world of DS1 warping between bonfires from the start returns. The levels themselves spiral around and shortcuts appear in a rather wonderful way similar to how DS1 worked, especially in The Cathedral of the Deep (a single bonfire covers most of this area, and its great) and the afore mentioned Irathil, however they all feel like self contained ""levels"" so to speak, where each area feels like a shrunken version of DS2's DLC areas. There are no moments where you take an elevator from Darkroot and suddenly find yourself in the Valley of the Drakes, or even the link between there, Blightown and New Londo. Despite this the actual design of each of these areas is so well executed I don't think it matters so much, with tricks and traps everywhere, and enemies that scream of ""this is impossible!"" before you learn the trick and navigate the areas with ease later.Connected with the world building is the story and lore. In this Dark Souls 3 is a fine return to form, that being if you can fathom out the story and its purposeful obtuseness. Like the previous Souls games DS3 delivers a narrative that is very much unique to video games: this would not function as a book or a film. Everything is obtuse, covered in mystery and is very rarely explained. Enemy placement, item placement, item descriptions and the scant bits of info salvaged from NPCs fills in the holes of the ""Go get these blokes, kill that other bloke and set yourself on fire"" the game seems to give. Again, I will not plumb these depths as there are some rather fantastic explorations into DS's lore on YouTube. Suffice to say that the background for Dark Souls 3 is a fitting end to the series, if I am indeed correct.Combat wise the game has taken a step back to DS1 with its controls. Parrying is not as random as DS2 as well as guard breaks and leap attacks are not as difficult. It retains the way that breaking guards opens people up to ripostes like DS2, and that is welcome, and essentially makes the general combat feel as satisfactory as ever, if a little faster in the wake of Bloodborne. Some elements have taken a step back such as the way weapons only buff in the manner they did in DS1, where a lot of weapons could not buff or whatnot and also duel wielding items cannot be power stanced. Slightly annoying but not crippling.My main complaints mainly stem from the rather buggy nature DS3 seems to have. Of the 3 games in the trilogy DS3 has given me the most problems, with mobs clipping through the world (and me at times) to multiplayer elements glitching out (cannot enter boss fogs) and at least 4 of the PvP convents just flat out not working. Maybe these will be fixed with patches (provided he does not kick people off ledges), but right now there are a multitude of issues which makes the game hard to recommend right now. Net code is also as weird as it has always been, causing some players to hit you from large distances while doing PvP or sometimes character models, both enemies and human players, to loose all animations and being incapable of attacking. By this point though if I have come to expect one goofy thing via From Soft games, its wonky net play.A slight other complaint may be the somewhat lazy elements of recycled elements in the game. The degree of fan service in the games from the prior titles is a bit grating. Some may enjoy it, but when a person wearing a very familiar set of armour appeared with the mannerisms of a DS1 character appeared I rolled my eyes. As it is, this is all dependent on how much you can tolerate this stuff.At the end of the day I find it hard not to recommend DS3. It is the most polished and well thought out game in the series from a design stand point, though is slightly glitchy and buggy in spots. I still do not think it is as good as DS1, but it is leagues ahead of DS2. In this regard I imagine this may be remembered in a similar manner to how Final Fantasy IX was: FFVII was the classic everyone remembers, FFVIII was the awkward follow up and FFIX was the classic that ended up being the polished finality to that era, though ended up overlooked mainly due to the fact it was not FFVII. Give it a shot, it will certainly be worth it."
Positive,lol I got bammed cos I had a big ed
Positive,I died. Many times. Even Chuck Norris cannot beat this game without dying.Best game of all time.
Positive,"I have played all DS games and bloodborne (all on console). This game is EVERYTHING that DS2 should have been. The leveldesign from DS1 is back with ladders and connections between levels, and the whole feeling, atmosphere & lore of the game is much more in line with DS1. You basically get an improved DS1 with the bloodborne gfx-engine which looks beautiful on PC. I run it with a PS4 controller on 1080p maxed out and it has been amazing so far. 15 hours in. One big difference with the previous games is that the way/road to the bosses are tougher, but the bosses themselves seem to be a little bit easier overall. But overall, a harder journey since 90% of the gameplay is tougher. I LIKE IT!"

Positive,This is a baby game fortnite is much harder. How many deaths? ummm..... baby game very easy. Like I killed those fat guys first try. Good game tho.
Positive,"Dark souls 3 feels like a love letter to the community and fans who have played and been a part of this trilogy. It brings an epic conclusion to this intricate yet beautiful world of Dark Souls. The game has one of the strongest roaster of main bosses in the series. The bosses are challenging but very well balanced. Personally I felt the game is a bit easier as compared to the others in the series and that is because the game rewards the players who figure out and get used to the patterns and the mechanics the game has to offer. The game takes good amount of influence from Bloodborne, be it the faster combat or spooky areas with somewhat spooky enemies or lot of howling and shouting here and there etc. The game also has some really heart warming throwbacks to the OG Dark Souls and I loved how they picked up few interesting mechanics from DS2 as well. For me a really important aspect I look forward to in a souls game is the exploration bit. Going through the world, exploring secrets, finding shortcuts etc. This aspect in DS3 was somewhat weaker for me. Now there are secrets to uncover and shortcuts to find but the world felt a bit bland in terms of variety and it looks less vibrant. Having said that, I do understand that world is designed keeping in mind the context of the story and definitely the overall visual storytelling is very strong. The themes of decay and stagnation and very well depicted. An amazing game overall. PS: The DLCs are truly epic with some really memorable boss encounters. Ringed city is peak Dark Souls."
Positive,"One of the Best RPG games after Elder Scrolls V Skyrim.One of the Hardest Single Player Games as well.Great Story, Fantastic Visuals, Love this Game!"
Positive,"Игра просто супер, пажилой демон даёт зажигалочки с двух рук! Невообразимый уровень проработки"
Positive,"Hello! This is my review of Dark Souls 3. I have to say, this game has so many amazing aspects to it. The sound quality is top-notch, the story is rich in depth, and hidden lore adds layers throughout the game. Overall, I'd highly recommend it because there's a plethora of activities to dive into across its diverse areas, offering plenty of exploration opportunities.The gameplay is incredibly smooth, and the controls are reminiscent of the previous games, which enhances the overall experience. For me, Dark Souls 3 was fantastic, offering more content than its predecessors. The bosses are notably more challenging, making it the toughest Souls game I've played.The armor sets and weapons are exceptionally well-designed, surpassing even those in Dark Souls 1 & 2. The music and cutscenes are immersive and beautiful, adding depth to the experience. The detailed lore adds another layer, making it a must-play for fans of the series.Dark Souls 3 expands upon its predecessor and offers a continuation of the story, regardless of the ending chosen in Dark Souls 1. The locations are captivating, and it's especially exciting to see areas from the first game reintroduced. If you're a fan of Dark Souls or any FromSoftware RPGs, you're bound to love it. - Rikka :D Extremely Great Boss Fights. Great Combat, A lot of weapons to use. Amazing Soundtrack and good sound quality. Outstanding story and lore. AI & NPCS are improved from the older games."
Positive,"Latest installment to the series. Unlike DARK SOULS II, this game directed by the creator itself, Hidetaka Miyazaki. As you can see, game resemblances with other Miyazaki games like Demon's Souls, Bloodborne and the original DARK SOULS.If i need to give some examples, game speed is much like Bloodborne's, you have some gameplay elements from Demon's Souls like instead of counts of spells (which is implemented in DARK SOULS and DARK SOULS II) is gone and replaced by another bar that allows you to cast them, and game itself pretty look alike with DARK SOULS.DARK SOULS II has smooth animations, but in DARK SOULS III, they are gone and replaced with DARK SOULS ones, but improved. It's not a bad thing, but i want to mention that.My personally thoughts about this game, it's kinda feel Downgraded after DARK SOULS II. Why? I must admit that DARK SOULS II was good game, even it's not feels like it's predecessor, but somehow, it's evolved to another stage. It has nice elements like different covenant mechanics, new enemy placements on every Journey, expanded questlines...However, in DARK SOULS III everything gone simplier again. Covenants are pretty same of each other, questlines are too linear, there is only health and damage increase on new Journeys. It forgots everything that DARK SOULS II introducted. It pretty successor to DARK SOULS, not II. Probably Miyazaki wants to forgot the second game in series, because he wasn't directed it. He was busy with Bloodborne.Another thing is which bothers me a lot, this game has nice gestures, they have even looping. But hell, why did popular ones are missing?! Yeah, i am talking about Well! What is it! and Decapitate, why they are missing!Why can't we revive bosses? Hell, again, DARK SOULS II has this feature. It comes handy on lots of situations, like you want to get invades, revive the boss, and wait. It's simple as square.Last, but not least, poise. Poise is still in the game, but no one knows what it's for. Unlike his big brothers in this game, poise is replaced by Hyper Armour, which is only affects with big weapons.Well, i think i mentioned every possible comparision, so let's disscuss about game itself.Game wasn't balanced on it's first release, but developers are still trying to make game balanced. It's a nice thing because this game turns 1 year old and they still support it.Invading system, which is a core mechanic, is kinda broken at this game. It's nice to have passwords on this and connect every player/friend is a nice improvement but it mess up invading system. While host is unupgraded itself, even with downgrades, overlevel phantoms do a lot of trouble like spamming spells, having late-game weapons.. It gives me cancer. Another thing is, game has open areas and sometimes, finding host is kinda impossible. Concord covenants has system that marks invader's place, why does invaders doesn't have one?I'll not going in to story and lore, because i don't exactly know it. Storytelling on every Soulslike FROM SOFTWARE is obscuring. Some parts are empty and you need to full them with your imaginaration, item descriptions and predictions.Cencorships are bullshit. You can't even name your character Knight properly. If you need to write Knight, you need to make it like;KNightKnIghtKniGhtSeriously, you can't even make cosplay of characters, like Holy Knight Hodrick. Well, if you want, it'll look like **ly K***ht **drick. Well done, well done.One last thing before posting, why the hell we do backstab animations if we miss it?I am whining. Yes, i am. Because this game can be better. But however, it's still an excellent game. Even with it's mistakes. But after it's slowly losing players, i don't recommend this game at it's full price. Wait a discount, discounts makes this game more popular, player count raises a lot."
Positive,10/10 would not sleep ever again.
Positive,"Quite unforgiving yet thoroughly rewarding, plus one hell of a convoluted lore to dive into"
Positive,If U d0nT lik DanKsoULS........Git GUD!!!! (Then you'll like it)
Positive,Storyline is trying to seduce the firekeeper but she is blind so there is no storyline.
Positive,"Lives up to the hype. Have to say it's a better sequel to the original Dark Souls than DS2 was, even though I loved that game as well."
Positive,"Now that the online issues have finally been resolved for this game, I now feel comfortable giving this game the glowing recommendation it deserves. Dark Souls III is an incredible game that I highly encourage anyone to play. While difficult, those with the patience to persevere in the face of the challenges the game presents you will walk away with an unforgettable experience and a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction that few other games can rival."
Positive,"Great game, worth it in every way EXCEPT the fact that it doesnt have keyboard icons. i know its minor after you play a lot but that made me refund the game first time I tried and if I hadnt been pushed by a friend to give it another chance I would have missed the incredible experience. it really is amazing and super fun"
Positive,"I'd like to clarify one thing before I get anywhere, and that is there is a huge difference between ""hard"" and ""harsh"". ""Hard"" implies a great challenge and test of skill, power, and patience. ""Harsh"" implies accountability for our actions, that mistakes will be punished and good decisions will be rewarded. This game isn't hard, it's harsh. I've died plenty of times while playing and not a single one was because ""I'm not good enough"". Every time, there was a bad decision I made, a fight I picked badly or shouldn't have picked, a trap I handled badly, or a giant skeleton king I fought while emotionally compromised from work.Skill is a factor, skill is rewarded, but this is a game anyone can play and that anyone can conquer. This game has a lot of depth, lore, challenges and intrigue that make it a work of art in itself and in that regard it's nothing short of incredible. I highly recommend this game, it's very well made and executed, and it doesn't have that stupid mouse input delay the second has."
Positive,"What to say about this game? Where to start?I am a newcomer to the Dark Souls. From time to time I would stumble upon video or gif of Dark Souls games, but I didn't understand anything. Only thing that I knew is that these games are hard. Well I bought Dark Souls 3 and I see why others are hooked. So many secrets, hidden areas and mistery lore that even the biggest Dark Souls fans still try to figure it out. You will be hungry for more and more. Which area is next? What will it bring to you? Which boss is there? What is the lore of this area/monsters/boss? A loot in the distance, how to get to it? Is it maybe rubbish or some cool armor? So many questions.Creatures are interesting and well designed. Each area has unique feeling and the combat system is top-notch. Just amazing.If you are a newcomer to this game, don't be afraid. It is challenging and sometimes hard, but if you get stuck remember to Google some info about the boss fights or some tips for hard areas. Also, I am playing with mouse + keyboard so controller is not essential.And after you beat the game you will be happy and content. But what about other classes? What about hidden quests that you missed during the first playthrough? Or that cool weapon that you didn't use? This game has an amazing replay value. I wouldn't even call this a replay value, because you will learn something new each playthrough.Oh and PvP? Yes there it is, but I'll leave it to you ;)As for problems, there are still some performance issues, mostly crashes that can be frustrating. I hope they fix this in future patches.No more performance issues.This is really a GOTY. Must buy!9.5/10"

Positive,"*Spoiler free.Since there are plenty of other reviews out there showcasing the general facts and accurately depicting the game's strengths and flaws, this will be nothing more than me sharing what I personally did and did not like about the game.Keep in mind, this is all just my opinion. I will keep it brief, and stick to only the major strengths and weaknesses.Strengths:- The bosses are the first thing that pop into my mind when I think of the game's strengths. The bosses are one of the major parts in the series, infamous for their difficulty and rewarding defeats. When I first entered the game, I can honestly say that I had a lot of fun fighting the first boss. The mechanics were fair and rewarded learning and well-timed dodging, and this continued to be something in most of the other bosses. They are also quite diverse and memorable, with a good balance of being difficult and fun-- something I was afraid would be overlooked in this game.- The level design is well done. Not in the Dark-Souls-1 sense where you would memorize every nook and cranny due to the inability to teleport until later into the game, but (for one) in the sense that the positioning and balance of regular mobs is nearly perfect to the point where it is not rage-inducing (I'm looking at you, Dark Souls 2) but still maintaining the necessary difficulty. Furthermore, bonfires seem to be at appropriate distances (as usual) and it is otherwise quite decent. It has made me memorize many areas in the game, but I don't think anything could quite compare to Dark Souls 1 anyway.- The combat is enjoyable. I don't have much PvP experience besides a few dozens instances, so I'm not expert in that aspect, but from what I found, it was quite standard in your typical souls game (which is still pretty good.) The movesets on most enemies (I said most, chain snakes.) made for fun and engaging combat. Furthermore, from what I could tell, almost all builds are viable and provide interesting and unique gameplay individually. - The scenery is my personal favorite in any souls game. I was amazed sometimes at just how beautiful the game was. Most areas are very atmospheric and fitting to the fantasy-role that they suggest, which is something I personally look for in art.- NPCs, quests, dialogue, old faces-- they are all very well done and voiced from what I have seen, and make for some very engaging and enjoyable gameplay. I cannot put much here, as I would like this review to be as spoiler-free as possible.- Co-op is easier than in any other souls game. Many people believe this is a bad thing, but I think that it is ridiculous that this has not been considered and done until this game. I believe that it is a great feature to be able to co-op with friends and have a jolly ol' time, for that is what kept me from playing Dark Souls 1 any further.I have not covered every positive aspect of this game, but hopefully I have covered some of the more major ones. Let us proceed to the negative aspects of the game. (Keep in mind, this is all my opinion).Weaknesses:- Poise is currently not enabled. What this essentially means is that whenever you are hit by an enemy, even while wearing the heaviest armor, you will still be staggered atleast a little bit. This prevents many fun builds from being viable in both PvE and PvP.- PvP has hackers that attempt to soft-ban and ruin the game for others. Dark Souls 3 is no exception to the hackers that every online game has. The good news is that being soft banned can be prevented by backing up your game with external software.- This game requires a somewhat capable machine in order to run it. I wouldn't count this specficially as a weakness, because the reason for this are the amazing graphics and gameplay that make Dark Souls 3 the great game that it is. However, it is listed as a weakness since many people are unable to even complete the first boss because of unbearable lag.- Chain snakes. Chain snakes are evil. (I'm joking around.)----In summary: Dark Souls 3 is the next installment of the Souls(borne) series. Although it has its (in my opinion) minor flaws, the good significantly outweighs the bad. To anyone with a capable PC looking for an equally fun and challenging game, I would definitely recommend Dark Souls 3."
Positive,"The newest edition of Fashion Souls is great. It has some bosses or something and they're alright I guess, but the Fashion is very good,"
Positive,Dark souls and any game made by from software are the best games made in the modern era. My children will be playing every game made by them in time. These games and their story are equal in value to the highest valued art.
Positive,"Cock and ball torture (CBT), occasionally known as penis torture, dick torture, or male genitorture, is a sexual activity involving application of pain or constriction to the penis or testicles. This may involve directly painful activities, such as genital piercing, wax play, genital spanking, squeezing, ball-busting, genital flogging, urethral play, tickle torture, erotic electrostimulation, kneeing or kicking.[1] The recipient of such BDSM activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism, or emotional pleasure through erotic humiliation, or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant.

Positive,"Yes Indeed.. how i waited for this game!. Ever since i first digged into dark souls and later ds2, i realized that Dark Souls was the ultimate game for me. i find no other games as rewarding and satisfying as the dark souls series and the atmosphere of these games are so unique that you cant compare it to anything else. each of the games in the DS series has its pro's and cons and it the same with ds3. Sooo. i could review this in many ways , comparing it to previous games etc,etc, but i think i will rather say it like this : If you are new to the ds series i would actually recomend you start with ds3. its the easiest one of the 3 games, it gives you a good idea about the universe of dark souls, how things work in here etc. its also the most active when it comes to online players, so if you are into pvp and co-op, meeting new players and so on, then ds3 should be your favorite choice. you can play this game in so many ways, and even though its not the toughest ds game its still a good challenge if you like hard games or are an completionist that likes to go for all achievements. trust me you will log into ds3 again and again even when you have completed it 100%. the music, the graphic details and the atmosphere is inmy opinion not beaten by any other game"
Positive,"Overall, the community is easy going and the players are kind to one another. You will find yourself being helped throughout the game with powerful npc’s and fair mechanics. Other players will also be available to summon and will protect you from harm. This is a game for people who want to take it easy and enjoy themselves. One might say that the land is peaceful, its inhabitants kind.With that being said, be sure to check out Dark Souls III if you enjoy games that:are easy to learndon’t have steep learning curvestell you where to godon’t screw you over with unfair 1-hit comboshave a story you don’t have to find out on your own"
Positive,"This game is amazing. It is great for both first timers and people returning to the series. And don't let the rumors put you off. The game isn't as hard as you think. And trust me, when you find yourself in the intricate dance that is one of the boss fights, you just might find your heart pounding as you roll through the bosses attacks and counter with one of your own. It is a rush that few games can make you feel.The gameplay is fast and tight. Mistakes can be made, but you will pay for each and every one of them. The world, scenery and music are the most beautiful in the series. More than once you will find yourself gazing at an incredible view. The bosses and enemies are well designed and a joy to fight. The story stands on its own, but it also has quite a few callbacks to the earlier games. I can only think of nice things to say about this game. It is a well designed, albeit sometimes frustrating game, with a world and gameplay that few other games can match. Do yourself a favor and try it sometime."

Positive,"DS3 is what i would call the most consistent of the soulsborne titles, the quality and overall polish of the entire game is just good. Small hiccups with some bosses and areas, but mostly just good.Some could come with a complaint that DS3 compared to Elden Ring is boring, which i can see the argument in, the spectacle of the game itself is not as great as elden ring, but this is the art/game direction Fromsoft chose for this title. It is supposed to feel lifeless and gray.I would recommend DS3 as everybody's first fromsoft game."
Positive,"Huzzah! Online play is back. In honour of it taking 6 months to fix it, I too will wait 6 months to fix this review.Edit: Game is solid and was a ton of fun with different builds. I highly recommend playing this over Elden Ring if you want to enjoy something other than the Frost + Bleed build that trivialises most of Elden Ring."

Positive,"Dark Souls III is currently the latest game in the Dark Souls series. If this is your first Dark Souls game, you need to know that Dark Souls is well-known for its extremely hard difficulty, frustrating deaths, and slow grinding progress (because you'll lose everything if you fail to retrieve your dropped souls - or 'money'). In short, it's just completely merciless to the player. If you're a hardcore gamer that loves challenges, I heavily recommend this for you. Dark Souls is the type of game where the difficulty overwhelms the fun, so if you're a casual gamer looking to rekt some AIs easily and be a hero that saves the universe - don't buy this game. Know that your character will die a lot in this game. I mean, A LOT. So if you're the type of person that crushes things around you when you're frustrated, I also don't recommend this game for you to save your stuff.GameplayYou'll start with creating your character and choosing a class. And then, the slaughtering will start. Arguably overpowered enemies - usually in the form of monsters - will start popping out as you progress through the map and you'll gain 'souls' when you defeat them. You can spend your collected souls as soon as you find some kind of a 'checkpoint', usually in the form of a large area that consists of a blacksmith, a store, a bonfire (respawn point), and an NPC to upgrade your stats. You'll get to purchase weapons, armors, power-ups, stats, etc. in these checkpoints to give you a better fighting chance against the enemies. Each time you die, you'll drop ALL of your collected souls and you'll have to retrieve it the next time you respawn. If you die again, then you'll not be able to retrieve the souls you collected the first time you died. Only the last pack of souls will be dropped and retrievable. When you successfully dominates an 'area', you'll have to beat a boss fight to gain access to the next 'area'. Usually, the bosses are extremely overpowered and it'll take more than 10 retries to beat them. This is basically what you'll do the whole game. Walk - kill enemies - die - grind souls - die - purchase stuff - fight bosses - die - repeat.AdvantagesGraphics are way better than Dark Souls II. It's really nice to look at and overall, it's great. The main advantage of the game is the difficulty. Some of you, like me, may think ""What? Who finds getting killed over and over again, getting frustrated, punching stuff around you, or even throwing your CPU out of the window because you are p*ssed off as 'fun'?"". Well, people have different ideas of 'fun'. There are hundreds of thousands or even millions of players that loves the Dark Souls franchise. The overwhelming difficulty is what makes Dark Souls unique. Its PS4-only cousin, Bloodborne, also gained huge attention from gamers due to similar gameplay style. I personally don't find getting killed over and over again or fighting against overpowered enemies as 'fun' but I find the game greatly trains my mentality - it desensitized me from failure, which will be important in my pursue of success. But know this: this game is not all about death and failures. You'll learn how to fight with your brain instead of blindly slashing everywhere. Yes, Dark Souls is skill-based. You'll have to get used on using the roll, heavy slash, light slash, shields, bows, utiliteies, etc. if you want to be able to progress through the game. They are not easy at all to master.DisadvantagesStoryline is confusing. It's best not to put your hope on the story-driven part. The game lacks explanation about the previous installment stories. You can always look at YouTube to catch up with the stories but IMHO, it's not a nicely written story. It's short, lacks details, lacks plot twists, and it's just way too 'mainstream and predictable'. As for the soundtrack, it's empty as usual. I expected epic songs for these kinds of games but apparently, they still think almost-no-soundtracks is good. The overwhelming difficulty itself is NOT a disdvantage - it is purely based on your gaming style preference. The second noticable disadvantage is the lack of new weapons in the shops. I may not have progressed far but when I meet a 'checkpoint',  I couldn't find anything useful in there. I might have to enchant weapons and all but I haven't quite understood the mechanism. Should it be a disadvantage? I don't know. I might be too stupid to understand the whole mechanism in 5 hours or maybe the game itself lacks tutorials for new players that are not familiar with Dark Souls.Final VerdictIt all depends on your gaming preference. Some people enjoy Dark Souls, some people don't. Make sure you look at the gameplay first on YouTube or whatever before purchasing this game just to make sure you won't waste your money. I personally like this game and recommend it for everyone regardless of your gaming preference because everyone needs to be desensitized from failures. But you might think it's not necessary because you already have a super safe life and a tremendous amount of parent's money. Just make sure you watch the gameplay first before purchasing it."
Positive,"Excepting for the poise stuff, everything is perfect in this game.9,5/10"
Positive,YOU DIED AGAIN.
Positive,"If you want to be an epic hero, who fought his way to end a badass boss in the end, and you are not afraid of retrying, die and repeat everything... this is your game. I also recommend buy the DLCs when it's on sale, gives lot of fun, around 20 hours I think. That was my first soul game, and I will try the other, too.P.S.: If you want to do all the achivements, like I did... good luck buddy. I wasted around 120 hours to do that :)"
Positive,"Gonna commit one of my regularly scheduled blasphemies real quick.Dark souls 3 is the worst dark souls.If you are interested in hearing why and maybe are the 1% of people who never played it, read along. (And if you don't mind massive text walls)To begin, I have to show a statistic. Dark souls 2 sold 2 million copies. Dark souls 3 sold 10 million copies. There really is no question dark souls three sold VASTLY more copies than both of the previous games combined (before the remasters) Why is this important?Simple. The vast majority of the people who played (And praised) Dark souls 3 never played a dark souls before it. This leads to them having no basis as to what the game should be. Surf any forum on the game and you will find that every flaw the game has is construed as an intended feature by a legion of people who think they are experts on the souls series for playing the most popular game. This is not an irregular occurence either, super popular sequels suffer from this kind of self-affirming echo chamber pretty regularly. Even super successful games with no sequels such as say, Cruelty squad, get this problem.To put the problem in words, ""Armor is bad because you arent supposed to use it"" ""Magic is bad because its a melee game bro"" ""You were meant to play the game naked""Continuing the cruelty squad analogy, that game recieved a patch that broke armor values. They simply dont work. It has not been fixed. Ask why, and people will spew out this idea that it was on purpose, a sort of symbol that armor is not how you are SUPPOSED to play. This same echo chamber mentality exists with the community of people who only played Dark souls 3. Every flaw in the game is interpreted as an artistic design decision meant to punish players for wrongthink.Now, if you can step outside of this box for a second, ask yourself, if you played say, a CoD title and picked up an AK, and upon firing it, found it did no damage at all. Would you consider it a screw up, a balance issue, or the incredible manifestation of some genius dev's artistic vision?...Duh, right? But because so many people played DS3 first and wanted to be in the know about a popular game (Gotta be up to date with the fad) You couldnt say anything wrong about it. Same as the initial launch of say, Fallout 4. People wanted it, people got it, new people thought it was the best thing ever because they had no comparison point, now it's generally recognized as the modern series worst entry. Couple this with ideas such as the concept that getting turned invincible for dodging is somehow more skillful than trying to use a shield and stamina effectively (And everyone wants to be skilled, of course) and you get what we have now.I have babbled a lot on why this game is often heralded as the best souls game, but I haven't yet talked about what is wrong with it. Put it simple, outside of the fact the game is gorgeous, Dark souls 3 is incredibly shallow.Magic, heavy armor, great weapons, bows/crossbows, any non-medium/light build has been nerfed with a sledgehammer compared to its dark souls 1/2 iterations. People complained about magic, and they got what they wanted. Dark souls 3 introduced limited non-regenerating mana, that you have to sacrifice your health source for, and magic as a whole might as well be useless outside of specific PvE encounters where it can help to cheese stuff. Heavy armor and poise do almost literally nothing other than make you fatroll, and since rolling grants you total invincibility for multiple frames, and lighter rolls more of them, you can see why any build that harms the ability to roll cannot be used seriously.The devs seem to have decided at some point that they wanted to do bosses more like bloodborne which reward you for being aggressive with your dodges, but at the same time did not give the players the same boosts bloodborne did to allow that. The camera when you press up to a boss makes it nearly impossible to predict their next move so you can time a dodge, but you have to be aggressive because the devs wanted you to because it earned Bloodborne praise (For reference, in older souls titles the battle premise was usually to attack then dodge AWAY, not INTO the targets) This system being forced onto enemies that are reused from games not meant to have it causes an enormous amount of pain to players who are trying to fight a reskin of the first boss from dark souls (Asylum demon) in a game that has forcefully taught them to be very aggressive. This works poorly because that same boss, which uses its same moveset from dark souls 1, was designed to PUNISH players for being too aggressive. See the issue?The total focus on one playstyle coupled with the aggressive lean leads to a very shallow gameplay loop. Attack, dodge dodge, attack, if you mistime a dodge or misinterpret the attack the foe is doing (cuz yer camera is usually up their rectum and that makes it hard to see) then you dodge away to heal, then dodge in. Dodge, attack, heal, repeat. It is as shallow as it gets. That is not to say that the previous titles didnt include that, but build variety allowed players to add their own steps to the loop. In 3 doing so is almost always only going to reduce your efficiency.The NPC character interactions are extremely easy to break, which can screw the whole run just by talking to a character before you open a specific door. The game is hyper linear, whereas the first two were very open. Enemy AI is still pitifully dumb, glitches and exploits that have never been fixed abound and make common shows in PVE. The game is literally in a state where its servers are offline because the weird punish-you-for-coop invasion system is literally so unchecked that people were able to join your game and reset you to the beginning of the playthrough. Modders have made anticheat for this game, From soft. will not do it.For all of that ranting, I concede that dark souls 3 is a gorgeous game. The art direction and the work behind it show through in every enemy, every area, and every piece of equipment. It is fantastic. But that being said, dark souls 3 is a souls game telling the same story that has been told for 2 games now, you need to go light the magic fire for reasons. Takes place in the same environments, with many of the same foes. So at the end of the day, you end up playing a Very pretty, but linear dark souls 1 that has no build variety outside of medium/light armor and melee weapons. Standing alone, dark souls three would have been an absolutely fantastic first entry in the series, and since it was that first entry for many people, it was well received. But for those who did play the first two before it, everything outside of graphics feels like a pretty heavy downgrade.As players we have got to realize that if we praise bad game design, howl at people who point out flaws, and hold up flawed games as icons of perfection, that we are going to get more flawed, bad games because we are giving positive feedback to negative things. We are the positive reinforcement for teams of developers, if we give a thumbs up to mistakes, oversights, or whatever, they cannot be blamed for repeating those errors. It is our fault."

Com a maior confiança, tirei a espada do titã ajoelhado e prontamente voltei à realidade. Morri várias vezes. Tantas vezes que devolvi o jogo naquela noite dizendo que ""não era minha preferência"".Mas uma pequena voz vivia na minha cabeça. Isso me chamou de desistente. Os desistentes nunca vencem.Resumindo, comprei o jogo novamente na mesma noite e joguei até vencê-lo.

If only the game had dedicated servers for pvp it would be perfect.
Positive,"Great game, very challenging at first but once you get hang of it, it becomes quite satisfying to outmaneuver bosses and any other NPC that's like a mini boss.It took me under 50 hours to beat the game but that's with whole exploring aspect, i really took time to explore each corner and find whatever i could stumble across around each corner. If you don't care about that, you could manage it way faster, as i even beat optional bosses but that for me is a big bonus and which i really liked about this game as this has so much variety. More stuff to do, more fun. There's still things i missed during my playthrough, which i have to go and finish that before i'll go into my Journey 2 game.About the story side, i still really don't know what it was about even though i beat the game, only some parts. Maybe it's because i haven't played DS1 and DS2? Don't know but all the cinematic i got from the game, even though it was very small portion, it still was really nice. It's not the story that got me interested anyway, but the gameplay.Overall, if you looking to buy this. You won't regret it, i didn't even notice hours pass by while playing this game. Even when i was irritated by losing over and over again, i was still always looking forward to advance to the next boss."
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is my first Dark Souls (I have commited a sin for not playing the others I'm sorry)You will feel pain, you will cry, you will suffer, every time you die.The game has great combat and punishes you for your errors. Timing your blocks, parries, rolls, etc. is your key to victory. As well as being constantly aware of your surroudings as death lurks at you every corner. It also has a very unique atmosphere I've ever seen in games before and it's cool. The characters, the creatures you encounter, the boss fights, soundtrack,etc. It's a phenomenal game and to me I felt confident in playing through it after defeating the 1st boss. It just gives you satisfaction defeating large enemies for souls.I would definitely reccommend Dark Souls III whether you are a veteran (you probably have it already anyway) or new to the series like me."
Positive,it's dark souls 3 baby
Positive,An incredible game start to finish - an extremley worthy successor to Dark Souls. Highly Reccomended.

Positive,"Slave Knight Gael  Even though he is ranked by many as the hardest boss in Dark Souls III or perhaps even the Souls  series, I didn't find him all too challenging and  managed  to beat  him on my 3rd or 4th try. His attacks are highly telegraphed, leaving moderate windows of attack after every combo. Gael is by no means  an easy fight, but his flashy moves and the breathtaking open arena makes it one of the best fights in this game. It's safe to say that if you can roll through Gael, you can roll through any boss in the game.The fight against Slave Knight Gael marks the end of the Souls series. Gael is no god, no legend, but a slave born for the sole purpose of sacrificing himself in battle. Gael is nothing more but an undead with a solemn duty and nothing left to lose, much like the player. He fulfills his duty one last time by consuming the dark soul. An Ashen One and a slave knight, two most insignificant figures in the universe, dueling it out at the end of time, at fate's crossroad and the endpoint of their destinies. As the fight begins, Gael uses what’s left of his dwindling sanity to drag his broken body towards you like a dying beast, carrying his broken sword, striking with devastating power and incredible precision, using his most humble body to perform the flashiest moves. As you beat down on this broken, worn-out husk, blood of the dark soul begins dripping down from his wounded chest onto his sword, he feels a sense of relief that all his work has finally paid off. Gael’s sanity then gets completely consumed by the power of the Dark Soul, transforming into a wild beast whose only desire is to kill. His ragged cape and broken sword become imbued with a dark red flame, allowing the cape to perform long range attacks and wide sweeps after Gael’s sword moves. As the cape attacks, it leaves behind trails of red skulls, blocking your vision. These skulls perhaps hint at the countless humanities consumed by the Dark Soul, and the immense power it has built up. When phase 3 begins, numerous thunderbolts strike the battlefield, the red glow beneath his feet is shrouded by blood and fire. Gael then starts trembling, unleashing the humanities stored within the Dark Soul.He leaps up from afar, charging towards you with all his power, his cape turning his vicinity into a living hell. In this battle, the flashiest of moves often acts as distraction as they are extremely easy to dodge, the true difficulty of the fight comes from Gael’s seemingly ordinary swings and slashes. At the very end of the story, we deliver the blood to the hands of the Painter, the little girl begins to paint a brand new world, where she intends to be Gael’s new home and final resting place. Gael is the true hero of the story, sacrificing his flesh to create a new world; sacrificing his soul to plant seeds of hope for the new world. The final chapter of the story is written with blood and fire, despite it being the end of Souls as a series, it marks the birth of a brand new world.""I wonder when Uncle Gael intends his return. I hope the new painting will be to him a gentle home. My thanks, Ashen One. I will assuredly finish the painting.Of a cold, dark, and very gentle place. One day, it will make someone a goodly home."""
Positive,"I'm a new player- mostly play FPS, I have tried to play Dark souls I with keyboard and mouse it was a nightmare to play, after some time i started playing Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin and absolutely fall in love with the game, first tried to play with a controller but I was having a hard time becuse im not a controller type of a guy then i ""GiT GuD"" with keyboard and mouse and now started my voyage in Dark souls III. So far its beautiful and challenging at the same time. I don't have trouble defending myself from invaders, beating bosses or anything else but cliffs are OP, most of my deaths were falling of a cliff or trying to do some cheeky jump.  I someone tells you ""Git GuT m8"" tell them to fuck off, praise the sun and just enjoy this lovely game series."
Positive,"Well, well, well....I never loved this game before.I just wanted to buy a co-op game with my buddy, and he told me that this game will be a good choice.I said ""ok why not"".After a few hour, i felt i need to play more with this game. After a 10-15 hour, i felt that i need to complete this game.After i completed the game, i felt i need to complete this game again, and locate all the secrets and lore.After i completed the game twice, i felt that i need to buy the dlc's coz i didnt get enough from this game(from the positive side ofc).After this monologe you can realize that how much i love this game now.Just to be fair!Positive thing:- Wonderful graphics- Nice combat system- So many different enemies with different combat style- Epic boss battle's- Good lore- Great co-op experience (even if the co-op system is not working at all the time for me)- Very-very good rpg system- Beutiful musicThere is no negative. Maybe the only one, that you getting brain cancer sometimes, but thats it.Go fucking buy it!"
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is by far my favorite installment of the Dark Souls universe. Dark Souls 1 is obviously the pioneer of the saga and is the sole reason the series was a wild success(which is why it should have been remade like Demon Souls was instead of ""remastered""). Dark Souls 2 was the experimental aspect of the series allowing for more creative choices to be made with a rich world to explore. Ultimately it deviated too far from the nucleus of the Souls-Verse/game. However, Dark Souls 3 returns back to the roots of the first game (albeit with some alterations) while learning from the shortfalls of Dark Souls 2. What Dark Souls 3 becomes is arguably the best Dark Souls game for a multitude of reasons but mainly: story/lore/themes, gameplay (both single-player and pvp), and level design. In fact I would say that Dark Souls 3 is the best installment to ease new players into the series as it is more streamlined from all the learned lessons from From Software. Which is why I suggest a machete order to be 3,1,2. 3 eases them into the series, 1 punishes them/shows them their roots, 2 allows for more exploration of the universe. All of these games are great in their own right."
Positive,This has become by far my favorite game. The joy of finally killing a boss after countless tries is the greatest <3
Positive,Dark souls  III optimization killer detected editionNote that dont buy this game with gt635m or 900m series9/10
Positive,Hands down best game ever.
Positive,"Welcome home, ashen one."
Positive,"I've played through the trilogy two times before and this is my third time going through Dark Souls III. Everytime I replay, I learn something new, see something new and I get as excited every single time. This is a beautiful game with a big dark world to explore. I would highly recommend buying the whole trilogy and going through them from the start if this is your first time.Dark Souls is an immersive feeling than will take you on the journey of your life, filled with choices, challenges and rage."
Positive,"Dark Souls is back! From the initial cutscene you can just feel that it's gonna be more like Dark Souls and less like Dark Souls 2, which is a fantastic thing. It's faster than any Souls game before it, but not quite as fast as Bloodborne, making it it's own unique beast. The graphics are stunning and the game runs like an absolute dream on my machine, although I've heard a few people are experiencing crashes, so take my experience with a grain of salt. To me, it's 50% Dark Souls, 20% Bloodborne, 20% Demon's Souls and 10% Dark Souls 2. If that's how you'd rank the Souls Series, then you should definitely get Dark Souls 3, assuming you haven't already."
Positive,"I'm going to start and say, I love Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, and even Bloodborne. I recommend this game, I do.But this review addresses everything wrong with the game as a sequel. This is a review for fellow Souls fans.Dark Souls 3 is, straight up, the easiest Souls game created. Anyone can beat it. Even the most inept of players won't hit a wall, they'll eventually tear through it. The difficulty of this game pales in comparison to Demon's Souls, to Dark Souls, to Dark Souls 2, and to Bloodborne by a massive amount. It's possible even some casual players will find themselves never losing their souls to a second death.Many enemies, from across the series, come up as a huge wall to players. You learn their movements, and tear through them after putting in the time and work. Trying to work around them can even end in great disaster. The only enemy that really puts up a fight can be the Lotrhic Knights, but not because of their difficulty, because of their damage and that is all. They are defeated without effort: spamming light attacks will keep them staggered. And after that, there are no more hard enemies. Not one in the game. You are set on by nothing but hollows who sluggishly move, and the very rare semi-competent skeletons. Anything much harder.. is solved by a gimmick.A giant worm that would otherwise be a horrible fight can be killed using a giant ballista. One of the bosses has a weapon specifically for him to kill him fairly quickly, much like the Storm Ruler from Demon's Souls. The hardest bosses (The Dancer, Champion Gundyr) are dispatched with not even well timed rolling and a few hits to their backside.But worse than that, the levels are not just short, but there's very few.. and most are very, very bland. While Dark Souls 1 was applauded for having a fantastically designed map, all of it interconnected and much of it unique, Dark Souls 2 was somewhat more traditional though still had some connections but was given far more unique locations, such as mining operations, a lava flooded castle, a castle drowned in rain, a quiet lake littered with fireflies and glowing fauna, dark labs, dragon's nests, and then the DLC areas were astounding. Dark Souls 3 is purely linear and only about half the total size of Dark Souls 2, every area was more bland. A somewhat interesting cemetery, a bland not-so-special castle aside from hollows who could only half way become pilgrim butterflies, bland forest with set pieces from DS1 for nostalgia, dull catacombs, a completely dull poison swamp, a lousy prison, a boring revist of Oolacile, a mostly uninteresting library... The most interesting areas of Dark Souls 3 are far from unique, capturing very little of the creativity of DS1 and DS2 with areas like Blighttown, the Painted World of Ariamas, New Londo Ruins, The Gutter, Majula, Shrine of Amana, Dark Chasm of Old, Brume Tower, Eleum Loyce... This isn't even half of the unique locales that were indeed quite enjoyable to look at, and the most unique location Dark Souls 3 has to offer is Kiln of the First Flame, an area that takes all of fifteen seconds to cross.And part of the world is the characters. While Greirat and Siegward are at least nice to talk to, everyone else is all but forgettable, and you rarely see them still. You don't talk to and regret meeting Lautrec, you don't feel as if you're following along on a grand journey like you did with Solaire (though you do stumble into Siegward just like before), you don't meet a character who asks you to kill -everyone- else, you don't meet some old king who tells you all of his regrets... You just meet people who are interested in selling stuff to you, and the obligatory Patches encounter.And then there's weapon balance. Much like other games, some weapons are better than others, but this time around, some weapons are leagues better than others compounded by the fact Poise is purely a disabled stat this time around (read again if you need to, Poise does nothing in Dark Souls 3 and has been confirmed as intentional). The Dark Sword, for instance, is a low weight of 4.5, and does a damage per second that completely outclasses nearly every weapon in the game with the correct build. The Spiked Mace can be built in a way that it will one shot players without any sort of parry. And Tower Shields are practically impossible to counter in PvP, and can attack while blocking far more effectively than a spear and shield torgether would be.On top of the poor weapon balance and Poise removed, invading players are at an extreme disadvantage: with reduced health, halved Estus rounded down, and primarily only invading players with phantoms, each invasion results in one of a few ways: the invader gets greedy and goes to them, and gets stuck fighting two players at once, the invader sits and waits by monsters for the next half hour because the host is too afraid for the odds to be evened despite still having more Estus, the invader finds a gank squad just for killing players already at a disadvantage, or the host doesn't know what they're doing and just runs out wildly and gets himself killed not even by you but some accident or monster.Or, if you're particularly unlucky, you'll run into a hacker. They take far less damage than they should at their level? They're modded their stats to be much higher without raising their level. They kill you in one hit? A hacker. There is even the ability to turn completely invisible, or fly, alter weapons to work how they want... This is nothing new to Souls, oh no. In DS1, hackers had the ability to instantly curse others with one hit of their weapon, even crash their game or rapid fire Firebombs. This time around, hackers can actually hit you with something that rapidly gives you souls and gets you, the invader, or even the host, banned out of nowhere. The solution to this: manual save backups because there are no cloud saves. The only solution currently. And the hacker problem is much worse than DS2, as Soul Memory made it hard to peg down for hackers where to be in that total to appropriately fuck over others.. but could get banned if they had more souls than soul memory as a counter.In short: Dark Souls 3 is the worst game of the Souls series. While people ripped on DS2 for a long time being worse than DS1, DS3 is worse than DS2 by a long shot in size, balance, quality of level design, PvP, and most importantly, difficulty.It's just too damn easy."

Positive,"Three hours in, already rage quit, I'll come back after I've calmed down and a bottle of tequila... 11/10"
Positive,"I spent my time playing the game and forgot to review it. Welp.For non-fans: If you want to get into the souls games, this isn't a bad place to start, as much as I'd like to say start with Demon's Souls or Dark Souls. Dark Souls 3 is a more accessible title and if you think it's your jam in the first two hours, it's probably going to be your jam for the next 300 hours. So, I am a longtime Souls fan. I love these games more than I should. I love the lore, the world-building, the combat, the ambience, the chracters, the story delivery, the bosses, etc. My opinion is biased. However, maybe not the way it would seem. On the first week of release, I f**king Hated this game. It was boring, easy, and the lore was redundant, or so it seemed. I was obviously awstruck by some events. (I would name them but fans who've yet to play this one will kill me...however, at this point, what souls nerd hasn't played 3?) It took about a month long break after my second time beating it for me to really appreciate it. The first time was on ps4 in which some bosses seemed to have the awesome ability of tanking your framerate. I did complete it, though. Then again on pc. I had hoped it would spark an interest but it didn't. And then I started connecting the game with the previous game(s) (honestly, just DkS 1 because Miyazaki seems to want to forget DkS 2) and then, only then, did my love respark. The Gameplay: It's basically the same as Dark Souls but with omni-directional rolling and weapon arts that diversify your movesets and increase the already skyscraper level skill cap. I don't have any complaints.The Bosses: So, I am biased here. Dark Souls was a game basically about you killing gods. It was so satisfying. In Dark Souls 3, you're killing lords; previous kindlers of the flame. The whole idea is awesome but it does show in the scale of some of the boss fights. Some are far easier than I would like. Luckily, From noticed this and have since then upped the HP of some of the fights to make them feel more challenging or to elongate some very fun fights. (The Dancer needed it and I love her again) Favorite in the game; Pontiff Sulyvahn/ Nameless King. Level Design: Some areas are just fantastically designed. Some stand-outs for me are Lothric Castle, the ever amazing Untended Graves and The-Place-That-Shan't-Be-Named because it's so f**king cool to get there. Unfortunately, there are places that just aren't nearly as interesting such as the Crucifixion Woods and Farron Keep. The game as a whole never quite reaches Bloodborne levels of wonderful level design but it gets quite close. The areas don't diversify in as much of an interesting way as they did in Dark Souls but far more than Bloodborne. The Lore: Wonderful... If you were a fan of Dark Souls lore, you will love digging into DkS 3's lore. Conclusion: It doesn't feel as special as Dark Souls at times but you have to take it as a place in the series. It does well to be the true successor to Dark Souls. It really is the Dark Souls II that we (mainly me) truly were hoping for."
Positive,"The word ""Knight"" as a character name is censored as ""K***ht""10/10."
Positive,9/10 needs more girls and funny hats
Positive,"This game is having me hooked, i was a huge DS1 fan with alot of play thrus and DS3 is definetly amazing aswell. I bought it 4 weeks ago and have almost 100 hours already."
Positive,DARK SOULS IIIPros:+ Released+ No longer crashes+ It's okay I guessCons:- RIP Poise- EstocDarkSwordRapier Souls- Blue Sentinels/Darkmoon covenants are pointless- Pure magic isn't viable
Positive,"Oh Dark Souls 3, you are generally a joy to play. The mechanics are good. Punishing you for playing poorly and rewarding you for playing well. The difficulty scaling is decent (Despite the DLC making the final boss feel like a victory lap). And the DLC itself is very fun! I had so many moments going through the game where it surprised me, in both good and ""bad"" ways. Now onto the Pros and Cons:Things Dark Souls 3 Got Right:Just difficult enoughBoss VarietyEnemy VarietyMap Zone VarietyTeleportation To Any BondfireInteresting NPCs and Unique Quest-linesSecret BossesSecret Covenants Easy Co-Op Password (Joining a friend is extremely easy in this game, as it should be)Things I wish were in Dark Souls 3:More weapons for each weapon type (I played majority of the game with a scythe, but there weren't many scythes to choose from)Secret Boss Weapons (Tail Weapons/Limb Weapons)DS2's NG+ Bond Fire Mechanic (Its one of the few things DS2 did right)Make certain NPCs easier to find, I very easily ran past a few of them (very minor gripe)Armor with unique mechanics/effects and variety in stats... (DS3 feels somewhat fashion souls-y)Final Boss Scaling in accordance with completion of the DLC (After the DLC bosses, the ""Final"" Boss was slapped down within 2-3 minutes, maybe even less...)Most of the gripes I have with DS3 can be summed up with me saying ""Man this game is great but I would love more [BLANK]"". With that being said, I'm somewhat sad to have gotten through Dark Souls 3 as quickly as I have (it could be related to running through all of the FromSoft games back to back). However, NG+ is also a part of DS3 that I know I'll be doing for another play-through.If this is your first Souls game, I would highly recommend it! It is fun, accessible, and polished. If you are a fan of the Souls series already, this game is a large improvement over DS2, and a great send off for Dark Souls!"
Positive,"I had concerns about this game, mostly because I was not satisfied with Dark Souls 2 and my computer barely hits minimum specifications- I have a GT 750M, 8GB RAM, and I'm running the game on an external hard drive, which are all bad combinations for a game that's intensive. I was pleasantly surprised. The game felt very natural to me as someone who adored the first Dark Souls, and the combat feels like a return to the proper formula. The first couple of bosses are perhaps a bit easy, and I haven't had a chance to do much real PvP (but the one match that didn't turn into a gank fest was fun and exciting, a good sign so far).The game is beautiful, even on the minimum settings I have to use to keep the game from setting my toaster on fire. There is quite a bit of graphical pop-in on these settings, but the game still looks beautiful and is well playable with only the occasional stuttering and bad area (mind you, my graphics card is below the minimum required) and the optimization is not bad at all- I'd say that it runs better than the first Dark Souls without DSfix and looks much nicer. The world building is back, and the game has the rich ambiguous lore that made the first game great. Talking to NPCs reveals things, but you still need to piece together the dialogue into a tapestry- who is a reliable narrator, and what are they talking about all the time? I don't know, but so far it's been enthralling. Ultimately, I've only just begun, but I look forward to sinking a lot more time into the game and moving ahead and fighting more interesting enemies and bosses."
Positive,If I had to choose to play only one game for the rest of my life this will be it.
Positive,"Good game hut they should fix the ""you are dead"" message that appears every minute"
Positive,2 hours in and i'm already crying!10/10 would cry over a game again.
Positive,"Well the game is great. You get to challenge yourself with new battles and fight hard bosses, play PVP... Wait! Servers for online are down? The new game launches so then they kill the servers and say ""we love our souls community, we will have the servers back ASAP."" Now passing 2 months and the online servers are still down. I love fromsoft games but this really put bad rep on them I can't recommend this game till they fix the issue with online.*UPDATE*Online is back up the game gets put back on the good list with me."
Positive,"Nothing you can write here will do it justice.  Its hard, play it. Just do it. Look up guides, play it through. Learn to love the process. You are going to die. Often just quit. Just play it through and thank me later. Your future gaming self will thank you. 10/10"
Positive,"Having finished all three Dark Souls games including all DLC (AoA and TRC included), I still affirm that this is the weakest in the trilogy, and that includes the DLC, which is among the worst Souls content I've played, period.""But, you disgusting weeaboo, you hit recommend by accident, you dumbshit!""That's right! Because just on virtue of this game being a Dark Souls title, it's still entirely above average compared to most AAA releases and it's still a joy to play in general. I had fun with it. The world design and lore is completely nonexistent compared to DS1 and the weapon balance, PVP, and DLC quality (entirely) is nowhere near DS2's level. It's an inferior game to each of its contemporaries (subjectivity!) but hey, it's still fun to play.Pick it up, blow 80 hours on it, play the others if you haven't. It's good."
Positive,"[Do Mind my English iz badzor]9/10 , I would rate this game 10/10 if it wasn't for the PC issue Me and others players having issue with.The game is fantastic, better that DS1/DS2 IMHO. At first I thought this game will be just like DS2, I look at the trailer and I saw the graphic doesn't seem improve from DS2 (yes i like seeing Graphic lel) but that was just my eyes problem, after I take alook again, It remind me of Bloodborn. Maybe DS3 inspired from bloodborn? who knows but I'am happy with new animation and new graphic looking :DThe gameplay is amazingly done, I don't have any problem so far with the battle mechanic like bugs.Now let's talk about the issues that me and other PC user having problem with. For some reason I cannot turn everything max setting (my PC can handle ultra setting for GTA5 and other games I have on steam and non steam such as BF4, Star Wars battlefront etc) So its Impossible for me not to run this game max setting. I had to turn off Lighting and motion blur. Everytime I turn my lighting on, my game would freeze, most of the time it will crashed my pc! GG!But after you turn down your lighting setting to Low, It should fixed the crashing. I'am not sure with other PC user, they say they crashed when they were nearby first bonfire, some crashed at start up. Bandai/Software give us patch NOW! So far the game succesfully makes me angry with few bosses and MINI Bosses! dafuq xD. For me, this game is harder than DS1/DS2. Do I recomend to buy this game? yup! GIVE EM MONEH! lol jk but yeah I enjoyed alot!"

Positive,"Dark Souls III is the third title of the Dark Souls trilogy, it is as well made as the previous ones, while also enhancing a lot of aspects from the series. It maintains the dark gothic fantasy thematics which encompass the whole soulslike concept and it actually incorporates that more deeply in the storyline and the appearance of the characters and regions. The combat mechanics are the same with the rest of the soulslike titles, the regions are well designed and have become easier to navigate, while the teleportation system with the bonfires is also more friendly. The customization has also been expanded, with more hairstyles and other details. One unique aspect of Dark Souls 3 which makes it special is the iconic Fire Keeper maiden with the silver hair which became kind of a cultural icon and also one of the main symbols of the soulslike concept, as she is imagined to be awaiting in the bonfire and works as the guidance."
Positive,honestly i almost never bought this  but im glad i did  worth every penny. the   community is very nice too suprisingly
Positive,"Easier than previous games(probably because i'm acustommed to it by now), PvP needs some fine tuning, best covenants ever, great design and sound, probably the best story out of all 3."
Positive,"9/10The good:no more Soul Memory from DS2 and the game follows the Soul Level system from DS1;multiplayer matching is seamless and now incorporates weapon upgrade tiers;closure to the many memorable characters from DS1;  (Yes, this includes Gwyn's First Born)most of the maps are well designed.  A few do feel like it's dragging the game on but luckily they ain't big maps;music, environment and atmosphere are wonderful as usual;four different endings (be sure to check out the secret ending as it's probably the canon one);you can respec your characters up to five times per playthrough;four ring slots (upgraded from two ring slots in previous entries).The bad:ranking up Covenants feel like grinding.  Some of them are actually faster to grind offline.  The Rank 2 Covenant rewards are  pretty niche.  You might still want to level up your Covenants for achievement;Luck stat seems like an after thought;Faith build is a bit OP but you can prepare for it;each boss has some weakness you can exploit (which is fine).  But some bosses (including the DLC bosses) could die ridiculously easy if you exploit their weakness in a certain way;The ugly:bugs.  Sometimes you can't enter fog door as helper phantom;final boss to Soul series.  It's fitting but it's not to everyone's liking.  YMMV;spell casting in general is not as good as melee.  Consider mixing some melee into your mage build;ganking,  hackers, etc;what happens to Dragon Form??Bottom line:as at the time of the writing, you can probably buy the game with DLC for $15-20.  The content is well worth the price;if you are new to Soul series, it may actually not such a bad idea to play DS3 as your first Soul game.  If you do, consider DS1 to be the prequel.  This way you will appreciate DS3 more.  There are a few ties in to DS2 but you can always read about them;I still rank DS1 higher than DS3, but DS3 is definitely the more polished game."
Positive,😊It's a pretty good game to try.
Positive,"Dark Souls at it's finest.This is the best game From Software has put out to date. They've improved the mechanics from the other Souls games to create a more fluid, visceral combat by taking pages out of their Bloodborne playbook. The level design and locales are better designed than ever before. There's a lot less ""artificial difficulty"" in this game when compared to previous games. Almost everything in the game can be countered with skill, even if unexpected. Not nearly as many treacherous ledges, or enemies hiding somewhere you cannot see them no matter how much you turn the camera, while they wait to strike and one-shot you. Don't get me wrong, these things still happen. Just not as much. Art direction is superb, and the atmosphere is wonderful. I really like the boss fights as well. Not many gimmick fights. Just one, really. Cons for this game are pretty limited. Camera does the player a disservice in some instances, but it's probably intentional. Music is not nearly as engaging as previous entries, but I suppose that's not necessarily a bad thing to some, even if it all sounds relatively alike. The plot is still mostly non-existant, and hidden behind a few sentences on some items that you may or may not find as you progress. It's taken three full games (two really, since they mostly ignore DS2) to build up to a half-formed idea of a story. What's there is pretty cool, but even with what's given crafting some idea of the story will only lead you with half answers or ideas, and you're often left filling in blanks with whatever you come up with in your head. On PC, the online is bad. There are a lot of cheaters out there now. Wasn't the case when I started playing, but it's only getting worse, so beware. Honestly though, I feel like those complaints aren't really a big deal, outside of the MP. The story is very obviously an afterthought, as it's not a story driven game. The camera doesn't bug me so much because it's pretty rare for it to really get bad, and these games are mostly trial and error anyway. The music I had to listen to after I played the game on the soundtrack, because I was so engrossed in the experience I couldn't even think of the tunes. It's a very finely crafted game, and I think everyone should give it a go, and not be discouraged by dying here and there.It earns a very hearty recommendation from me."
Positive,"""Potentially the best game I've ever played, however I can't bring myself to leave a positive review until FromSoftware brings back the multiplayer. There is no excuse for it to have been down for this long."" That was my original review. FromSoft has since fixed the multiplayer; I stand by my statement that Dark Souls 3 is potentially the best game I've ever played. Buy this game."
Positive,i wanna have passionate sex with this game
Positive,THIS GAME IS DANK AF
Positive,YOU ARE DEAD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Positive,PRAISIN' AIN'T EAZY SO GIT GUD
Positive,It's probably the best game ever made tbh
Positive,"The game seems to be a little bit easier unlike to the classic Dark Souls 1 & 2. The optimalisation is good comparing other PC tittles. I haven't got any crucial FPS drop. Expect from one location when you light the bonfire and game may crush :(In Dark Souls 3 developers finally fixed mouse and keyboard controls. You are able to play without using controller. Game maybe annoying in some stages but it's normal. Take into account a lot of deaths, frustration moments, boss stucks, broken peripherals :) and patience of course. Music and graphic are flawless, specially graphic has been improved."
Positive,"My first game of this awesome title, my friends said the first game is harder than the other, but i didnt try yet!So as a noob, i dare to say that this game is absolutly hard, i spent 4 hours soloing the dancer (those who played will know!), this is a challenge, for real, to everyone, even for those who likes these genre.I lost my insanity playing, trying and achieved 100% of the game.This game defines who are the man among the kids."
Positive,"Took me 26 Hours, making it the shortest souls game so far. Even though the actual graphics aren't that impressive, the atmoshere still is hella amazing. (Environmental spoilers)http://imgur.com/a/hP6U5The bossfights were mostly really well done and definitely harder than in DSII and BB. Whereas i've beaten the majority of bosses first try in those two, it took me an average of 3 tries per boss in DSIII. The hardest one was King of the Storm.Generally, the bossfights had some really cool ideas, even if a handful weren't that well executed. The designs themselfs are all amazing tho. I thought the environments were a bit too samey for the most part but coming back to Anor Londo was really cool. The leveldesign seemed to be a bit more linear than the other games (Altho souls games never have been truly open natured), Soundtrack was top notch too. I hope that it is really going to be the last Dark Souls game, after three (or rather four if you count DeS), i'm a bit sick of the middleage setting. There is just so much you can do with it."
Positive,"Solid varied endings, good stoy, amazing gameplay, fun pvp/co op, if you're looking for a game to come back to even after the ending, this is it."
Positive,can't beat first boss10/10
Positive,"There's no point in reading reviews for a souls game, just buy it already."
Positive,"Less replayability value than previous souls titles, a little bit more linear, but still a great experience.Would recommend 9/10"
Positive,"As of 3 hours ago the vulnerability has been patched and online services have been restored.--- UPDATE ---Currently has a remote code execution vulnerability which has yet to have been patched as of this writing.Don't buy until this issue is resolved.Issue is confirmed to affect Dark Souls 1 Remastered, Dark Souls 2, Dark Souls 3, and Elden Ring."
Positive,"Do you enjoy a Franchise/Game that absolutely breaks your spine, and is ruthless in punishing you for your mistakes, but is HIGHLY rewarding to those who can adapt, dodge, and learn the mechanics of a game fast? This is the franchise for you. Dodge. Dip. Duck. Dive. and Dodge again. You need to learn how to dodge, Or, maybe how to parry. Dodging is far more successful and the safer route. This game takes place in a wrecked, post apocalyptic world, where people are all slowly becoming undead, or worse. You, as the ashen one, need to conquer everything in your way, destroy the bosses of this world ( beings that FAILED to protect it. ) and offer their souls up to the primal flame to restore the world. ( or...do other things to it). Along the way, you can use the co-operative functionalities, and summon friends by password locking your summons. you will also be invaded by enemies, out to steal souls from you. Its not safe to go alone, Take friends with you. Not a game for the feint of heart. Dodging is a core mechanism to this game. upgrading armor, decaying/repairable weapons is another part. Not to mention, the fashion aspect to the game. you can make your character look absolutely incredible. 5 out of 5. Love getting wrecked by this game. would also recommend Dark Souls: Remastered & Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First sin."
Positive,"Boy howdy, they made a 3rd one.The apparent Bastard Child of Demon Souls, Dark Souls 1, Dark Soul 2 and Bloodborne incestuious lust, with all the sticky goodness. Imagine a strong mix of Demon Souls and Dark Souls 1 with that weird Bloodborne look and combat speed, with Dark Souls 2 drooling in the corner.  I forget my point, anyway:I'm gonna compare 3's aspects to the other two Dark Souls games because Fuck You, Okay?PC Port/Performance: Trash, but playable, and better that DS1's Port (Just barely). A real shame after DS2/SotFS's port was so good. With low/Medium setting; Framerate flutters between 45-60 constantly, lowest I've seen it was about 30 during the Dancer's 2nd phase when she sets shit on fire and starts spinning like an Autistic Child.(DS2 > DS3 > DS1)Difficulty/Challange:This feels like the Hardest, but thats because the combat speed is faster and all enemys are super aggressive for some reason. Basicly, imagine a DS1 enemy, but he's on Cocaine and injected adrenaline into his Penis, oh, and he thinks you stole his Waifu Body Pillow. Real foaming at the mouth shit. Anyway, they also have very fast, hard hitting attacks with like 12 attacks in a combo, and they take a 3 meter step forward during each attack. Basicly: Fuck. Bosses do this too, I'm looking at you Pontiff Sperglord and Booty of the Boreal Valley. Like seriously guys, chill the fuck out.(DS3 > DS1 > DS2)PvP/Cancer: First of all, invasions are fucked. Invading is basicly asking for a 1v4, were you have -25% of your health, half your Estus Flasks (Yes, everyone gets Estus Flasks, its much worse than you think.), and any of the Gank Squad you injure will run away to heal. 'But Walrus, I can heal too?' You have a max of 7 Flasks, they have (5+x3) + 10+. In short, if you don't OHK the Host, you're Dead.'What about Poise?' Poise? What is that?'What about Weapon Balance?' Working as Intended - From's offical statment 2016The meta is Estoc and Dark Sword R1 spam, how fun. 80% of people also seem to have a Ceastus offhanded and a Hornet Ring hidden in their Vagoo (I equip it too to OHK Estus Chugging Hosts, sue me). (DS2 > DS1 > DS3)Weapon Arts:Some are okay, like the Longswords Guard Break. Others... Looks at Farron Greatsword make you spin around the floor like a Downy Orangutang having a sugar induced stroke. They're meh.Lore: It's okay as far as souls games go but the amount of Fanservice and DS1 Dick Riding is stupidly prevelent. Hell, I made fun of DS2 for making not so subtle refrences to 1, but fuck me, 3 doesn't even try to hide it or be subtle. Oh, HERE'S FUCKING ANDRE FROM DS1. He should be long dead, why is he here? BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU WET. Thats true, but I need a real reason. Silence Okay...(DS1 > DS3 > DS2)Waifus/Boobs:I feel like there's little choice here. The Firekeeper is okay, but a cheap knockoff of Bloodbornes Doll Waifu. Not many Boobs ethier other than maybe Rosaria almost Nip Slip. The clear winner here is the Dancer of thr Boreal Valley, because of her butt. Rated D for Dayum. I'll stop now. (DS1 > DS2 > DS3)Anyway, 'Is Dank Souls 3 good Papa Walrus?' Its okay, probably the Hardest, worth a try."
Positive,"Having played Dark Souls 1, the tiniest amount of Dark Souls 2, and Elden Ring, this is definitely the best one out of the 4. The bosses so far are really fun, mechanics are good, movement is smooth, and the areas are beautiful. This is a good first souls game if you're getting into the series.also getting cursed doesnt permanently remove half of your health, and then making you go and buy an item on the other side of the world, im looking at you dark souls 1"
Positive,"by someone who thinks they know how to criticise gamesDisclaimer: I haven't bought either DLCs and neither intend to.as of the three games of what fans call ""souls"" series I've played, that being the three dark souls games(four if you count II and Scholar as separate games) this one has the best combat by far, not the most strategy based or complicated one, but the most exciting by far, it's fast and action packed with a lot of items/spell management mid-combat, rolling is thankfully back to dark souls 1 style, as in: there's a lot more frames of invincibility and even better you can use up to 70% of your carrying capacity and still roll with full invincibility frames, there are a satisfiable number of weapons in the game and they're now made unique by an ability system wich defines a special move each can use when you're holding 'em with both hands. Enemies now are WAAAAY more fun to battle against, there are a ton of different enemies each with their own moves and it doesn't feel like you're battling the same guy with different armor each time, that also goes for the bosses wich are really different from each other and are always a good challenge. That all said it is still to difficult, and it's a shame the game does not let you play it on an easier difficulty, there is so much to see and experience on the game that is locked behind an motor coordination barrier and it's a bummer, same goes for a pause button if you're not playing online, doesn't hurt and I hate to have to dies just because I've received an important message that must be replied to asapI played the game on windowed mode, resolution of 800x450 and the other options on the lowest setting possible(so I could run 60fps stable) and even then, I couldn't bring myself to kill one of the bosses ([spolier]Nameless king[/spolier]) because its area ran like shit, two or three places were awful to get trough because they ran at 15 fps max.The level design, although not as well planned as the first game is at least not as inconsistent as the second game, mostly all areas of the game are connected(but sadly not interconnected) and do a great job to move you from point A to B without getting you lost or confused on where to go, on every level/board/stage there is a lot to look out too, across the map there will be hints about the world and character sprinkled across, that's what makes the level design so great, the first game had huge areas that were mostly empty, but with the powerhouse of consoles nowadays from can fill that empty with a lot more thing to do and find.although boss themes are far from dull there is no music on most parts of the game, some could say that the decision was made so it would no affect the immersion, but they're wrong, well crafted music can only enhance the experience, that said the few tracks there are on the game are all awesome, bosses have distant music and they feel unique compared to the other games."
Positive,friede feet 🤤🤤
Positive,Great game. Players are helpful. Story lines cool. Bosses are meant to be challaging but very cool. Graphics are awsome.
Positive,Worth to buy this games!!!Rate 10/10....Its make me take a lot of times to complete whole storyline!!Highly recommend to buy this game <3
Positive,DANK < 3
Positive,10/10 died like a apple
Positive,One of the greatest game experiences beating this game. Already have it on a different console but still bought it on pc and it still feels as good as the first time playing it. The confusing and mysterious story and lore is incredible. Definitely buy this and the other Soulsborne games if you get the chance.
Positive,"I already had this game on Xbox and played through it already. But I bought this version too, so that I could play this with my PCbros. Then the servers got shut downEdit:Fromsoft must have sympathized with my tragic story because a week after I posted this (half a year after the servers were shut down) the servers were reopened.Good game you can play multiplayer in it 10/10"
Positive,"On my first playthrough, I had some reservations. It speaks to the vision and depth of Dark Souls III that on subsequent playthroughs, those reservations largely faded away. A game of rare ambition that manages to tie together all the previous Souls games - as well as Bloodborne - without compromising the breadth of its experience or dulling the deep satisfaction found in mastery of its mechanics. It is a fantastic experience, and the most impressively designed game I have ever played."
Positive,Praise the Sun!
Positive,Step 1. Stand near edge.Step 2. Enemy charges at you.Step 3. Roll sideways.Step 4. Enemy falls.Step 5. ??Step 6. Profit.
Positive,"That game rocks!!!!!!So, I hited Dark Souls 2 first time, than finished it at NG+ and few times more... I was so excited doing it! And I tought like ""Hey! That is so awesome and nothing could beat that gr8 feeling!""...I was soooo wrong... Fom the 1st time that game was shown I had a feeling I need it... Need it badly! Need it! Just NEED!That waiting time till release was horrible! So long, time was ticking so slow... And I finally got it! From the first bonfire till the last boss (no spoilers) that game got you in so strong addiction, like massive iron hands hold you... So many emotions! Such an interesting story! Sooooo beautifull world! Such a cute firekeeper :3 <3 <3 <3I strongly recommend that game! It is 1000000000000000/10! Really!If you every  tryed Souls franchise, any souls universe games  - I am sure you'll become a huge fan of it!""Welcome Home, ashen one""!!! <3"
Positive,"This is my first experience with any Dark Souls game.I expected it to be massively underwhelming, with how hyped up all the other games were, but as I put more and more hours into it, I could see why people were so crazy about it. This is genuinely one of the best RPGs I have ever played.If you're like me though and haven't played any of the other games, then be warned that you will not understand a lot of things and you will have to look many things up on the internet. So many references and areas are so awesome to most people, but not to me, and I'm just incredibly confused at everything that's going on.It is still a damn fun game though, and that's why it gets my recommendation."
Positive,"First I'll say that Dark Souls franchise is one of the greatest thing ever happened to me. Now let's review. Yes the game is challenging at some times but not nearly as the ""game journalists"" portrays as. THE GAME IS FAIR. Combat, level design, graphics, music are great. Combat is based on block, dodge, light/heavey attack and magic. DS has multiple charecter classes with each having correspondence attributes that you can change few times. Dark Souls III has the best boss design after Dark souls I. DS always had the grim, dark, medival theme which I always liked. If you've come here for a walking or button smashing  simulator this game is not for you. You have to explore, fight and earn your own shit for yourself.DS franchise has a very subtle way of story telling and from the lore perspective this game is second to none. This game has the best looking armor sets and wepons. Every weapon has some special move set that requires certain attributes.Invading and duel is half the fun of DS. Few of the npc will give you side quest and these quests are not like ""do it later"" quests. These had to be done in a cartain way to get certain things/ending.And finally Thank you Dark Souls.Praise the sun and remember ""Try tounge but hole"""

Positive,"Dark Souls III is an Action RPG developed by From Software and published by Bandai Namco. I have played Both Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition and Dark Souls II: Sins of the First Scholar and have posted reviews of those too. This review is coming from a fan of the Dark Souls games. Again, like the previous games a controller is preferred. Keyboard/mouse controls in these games is a mess.  Be warned, a lot of people using Nvidia cards have had problems with crashes and framerate, check the discussion topics if you have those issues. There's a couple of new starting classes this time and the Pyromancer is back! There are starting gifts to choose from and most of them are useless, there's no awesome master key like in the first game. I'd recommend starting with a Fire Gem for early fire weapon enchantment, Sovereignless soul for an easy 2000 souls or a rusted coin for better loot drops early on. It keeps the same bonfire rules as the first game, monsters will not despawn if you kill them too many times and they will always come back when resting at a bonfire (with the exception of some elite enemies). A huge step up in this game is the main Hub, Firelink Shrine. This is a place you will want to go back and visit often to talk to new NPCs, purchase goods from vendors and more importantly, level up. Progression seems balanced, the bosses feel just right for their point in time in the game and not unfair. If you get frustrated you can use an Ember, which is this game's version of Humanity and Effigy, to go online and summon phantoms to help you.Some more new things are spell charges have been swapped out in favor of a magic point (Focus Point) system which can be increased by leveling up Attunement. Gone is the agility stat from Dark Souls 2 and now we get a Luck stat that increases item discovery from slain enemies. Combat itself is a lot faster than previous Souls entries and dodge rolling must be mastered to survive, blocking and Poise do not help that much in this game unless you have extremely high levels of stamina or poise. Each weapon and shield now has a special weapon skill that uses Focus Points. Magic is also not as powerful as it used to be and now plays more of a supportive or supplemental role. You're allowed to change your appearance and respec your stats 5 times per playthrough. Once you join a covenant you can select to be in it by equipping its' symbol via equipment menu.My only complaints is the lackluster color palette and the world is very linear (although each area is huge). Bonfires feel more like checkpoints rather than a well earned respite like in Dark Souls 1 . I'm not huge into PvP so I don't have much to say about that. This is my 2nd favorite souls game right now with DS1 being 1st and DS2 being a distant 3rd. If you're familiar with the Souls games but on the fence about getting this one, I say go for it. But be prepared to die a lot, that hasn't changed."
Positive,"First Time playing DS3 and even if its slightly different from Elden Ring, its still a very good game!"
Positive,It's an good game for noobs
Positive,If only I had a- proof of a concord kept
Positive,fckin casual players
Positive,"Fear not, the dark, my friend.And let the feast begin."
Positive,this is a game for friends and friendly people
Positive,"Come on, if you've played Dark Souls, you know this game is a masterpiece.  If you haven't, don't even worry about the other two, just play this one.  It's the pinnacle of Dark Souls games.  You have a ton of freedom as far as what your character looks and plays like.  A gazillion different sorceries, miracles, pyromancies, weapons, armors, shields.  Don't let the reputation for difficulty turn you off.  This game is fun as hell."
Positive,"Where is my 5 free level, beef jerky skin squad at? Love everything about this game, including DLC. You could honestly get away with not playing Ashes of Ariandel, but to fully understand the story, you MUST play the Ringed City, as it ends the series completely. It has an amazing replayability value akin to all souls games (and bloodborne to a lesser extent), combat is nice and fluid, and atmosphere is stunning. As with all games, there are a few flaws (if you can call them that). I'm under the impression that most games aren't stupid hard, the gamer is just trash, and this game is a perfect example of that. The first boss is a good intro to the game. He says, ""Shields don't do shit to me, so learn to dodge my attacks or get rekt."". This new combat system heavily encourages dodging over turtling (sorry for shield/spear builds), which may turn some people away. Parrying, as it's always been, is a massive risk/reward. If you nail that parry, you pretty much get a one shot kill. If you miss, all your stamina is gone and lots of chip damage goes through. Enemy placements and bonfire locations can be pretty unforgiving, (not on the level of ds2), but with the proper path and the right timing, it's a cakewalk. I don't play much pvp so I can't critique it, (mainly because i'm a scrub and suck at it), but i've heard it's pretty nice, especially the fight clubs outside pontiff's bonfire. Overall, the game is MUCH more fast-paced when compared to previous titles, especially the boss fights. Strength, Dexterity, and Quality builds are very good and very plentiful with lots of good scaling weapons, magic (sorcery, pyromancy) shreds through enemies but is relatively useless in pvp, miracle builds are useless for pvp but can be a massive relief off of the pve player's shoulders, and to top it all off for magic users, spells are much easier to achieve. Find the merchant, give them a book, and bam, tier 2 spells. Timing is EVERYTHING in this game. Mess up once, and you are a goner, not so much early-game, but absolutely in late-game, just like in Sekiro, From's newest title. This forces you to play strategically, figuring out the patterns of bosses, figuring out their weaknesses, exploiting those weaknesses, all while having a level of finesse; It makes the boss battles feel more like a elegant dance with swords. 10/10 would engage in jolly cooperation again."
Positive,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is."
Positive,"PROS:GamesLadsGearCONS:A disturbing lack of laddersAs a result of the aformentioned lacking of ladders, there's also a lack of ladder based gameplayNot a single NPC in the game sells ladders or holds up their own big fucking gigantic gut[i.imgur.com] with both handsAll in all, if you like games, lads, and/or gear then this is a good game for you.

Positive,"Dark Souls III was my first FromSoftware experience and it was an amazing choice for a casual player like me who was looking for a challange. It's mechanics are easily understable, gameplay is challenging and fun. I recommend it to everyone who whants to start their Souls-like expirience!"
Positive,"PROS:- Very fun to play, especially with the new engine which bring along a whole array of game mechanics- Functional crafting systems that is completely fleshed out and provides a feeling of satisfaction when upgrading your weapon so it kills beasties quicker!- Larger array of mobs than just humanoids, I felt that in dark souls II that most of the jobs were inevitably humanoid, if not with a slight twist, for example look at the mobs of the Shrine of Amana and Heides Tower of Flame for reference here- More NPCS! I love the stories of the NPCS and i feel it contributes to a more fleshed out game that is believable and I can immerse myself in.- Amazing Firelink Shrine, again i feel this is significantly better than Dark Souls 2 dispite not being attatched to the main world, very very similar to Demon Souls.- Plenty of weapons and armour sets to choose from, which makes reading all of the information linked with each item all the more funCONS:- Admintantly I have played around 17 hours as of writing this review, but Thus far I have only found 1 Illusory wall, dispite I feel like I have slapped every wall since the firelink shrine with a tree branch at least once.- Unfortunately I feel that a few attacks were unfair, such as having full tracking for attacks that should most definitely not have tracking (like jump attacks! gotta enjoy 90 degree pivots for a pancake attack, for a follow up, leaving a bad taste in my mouth and just a general feeling of dissapointment).- Elevator shortcuts, pls FromSoft why?! The first time is a shortcut, but I may need to oil the chain or something the amount of times I have died 15 seconds upon leaving that elevator, which I just spent 20 seconds waiting for.- I dislike the change made so that armour is no longer upgradable, it just doesnt sit well with me, but im not entirely sure why, maybe I just liked the option?- again as of this review I have only 17 hours in teh game and future patches may fix this, but I encounter some micro-stuttering in certain areas in the game, but this may be down to my personal rig, but I wouldnt say it isnt on the low end.- I also felt that the PVP was lacking response and hit detection, spears still on phantom range? I thought that was Dark Souls II material? as well as lacking response, almost comparable to attempting to punch smoke.OVERALL:I feel this is a very solid game that both veterans and Newcomers will enjoy, if not just for the outright adrenaline fueled fun from killing that annoying boss, and you most likely cant get that kick from many games on the market, however I feel that some of the bugs currently in the game (1.03) need to be slowly and methodically ironed out, leaving behind an amazing game that I would recommend to anyone to buy full price, you needent wait for that steam sale, this game is worth every penny, Enjoy and keep Soulsin' everyone!TLDR: Amazing game, as well as me personally having slight issue with some of the game, but overall worth every penny (or Cent?)."
Positive,"Not having any of the crashing issues reported by others, Performance is fine with 60 fps even in the places people reported slow downs.Noticed the player count for this game was up to 120K+ So I'm not surprised a small minority are having issues as it's the nature of PC Gaming, No game is released perfect.A lot of people seem to be complaining about performance issues that are either using low end hardware or laptops because they are able to run Dark Souls II at silky smooth frame rates.Something to remember about this is Dark Souls II was built for and designed around the limitations of the hardware inside the PS3 and XBOX360. Dark Souls III was designed from the ground up to run on the current generation consoles the PS4 and XBOXONE, These consoles while still being under powered compared to a modest gaming desktop are still substantially more powerful than their predecessors and benefit from being static hardware making it easier to optimize for.But even so, BloodBorne and Dark Souls III both run at 30fps with drops down into the 20's on these consoles.So it shouldn't come as a shock to people that they can't run Dark Souls III at 60fps in MAX settings like they could in Dark Souls II with the same hardware. These games are a generation apart in terms of graphical power requirements.Dark Souls III uses much more complicated geometry,Better lighting effects, Higher texture resolution, Higher shadow resolution, Improved enemy AI and more.+Great graphics and art design, Attention to detail is as good as ever and really helps to captivate and immerse you into the gameplay. Mobs are also very detailed and feel like they belong in their respective area.+Some of the best boss designs/Fights of the series.+Amazing soundtrack, Boss music is epic.+Rewarding gameplay, Tougher and smarter mobs.+Seemingly infinite replayability from the sheer amount of equipment and build variety the game offers. Co-op gameplay and PVP with many covenants designed around it.+Possibility of 6 players total in online play.-Network lag and online hit detection needs some work.-Game kicks to the main menu if the online connection is lost regardless of what you're doing.-Poise system could use some rebalancing as it's almost irrelevant in it's current form.-No steam cloud support-No current known anti-cheat in placeOverall I see this as a great addition to the Souls Series and an excellent game in general.Highly recommendedEDIT: Also something I would just like to put to rest is the illogical argument people put forward about this game being like Bloodborne as a bad thing.First of all Sony asked From Software for a new game as they needed an exclusive IP for their console the PS4 and thus Bloodborne was.....born (kek).So it really isn't suprising that Bloodborne shared a lot of simmilarities with the souls series, Considering it was made by the same developers and directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki.It's a shame that Bloodborne is exclusive to the PS4, But it's still an excellent game from the guys at From Software.So saying ""This game sucks, It's too much like Bloodborne"" is a completely illogical thing to say  because both games are great. And if both games are great, Saying one is bad because it's too much like the other is an absolute nonsensical argument."
Positive,"Re-Written Review!Hi guys, I'm here to tell you about Dark Souls 3. This review is slightly more applicable for those who have played through the previous souls games, but is basic enough for people to get the jist if they haven't. Dark souls is a mesh between a horror/survival/adventure game. It's a game with an extremely visceral combat system that is extremely fair and true to hitboxes. If you swing your sword and it clips past their shoulder, it wont do jack. Weapons and movement within the game is tight, and your trusty sword and shield are your best friends.So, what's so special about Dark Souls 3? Well, Dark souls 3 has a fantastic world filled with delight, obscurities, and a variety of locations, creatures and bosses that will have you thinking ""Holy shit"". The game is built around the notion of a single goal, which is to acquire the souls of the Lords of Cinder, by slaying them. You aren't given a whole lot of direction, and there is definately no hand holding. If you like using your intuition, this is gonna be up your alley (As well as the other souls games!)So. What are the Pro's and Con's of the title?Pros+Detailed world, surprising amount of indirect lore and depth.+Runs great. Some people have issues, which is a shame, but it's a minority. It sucks, but this is launch. It's gonna happen. Smooth 60fps with the option for 4K textures makes this game a pretty one!+FANTASTIC sound design, from gurgling death sounds to boss music, the ambient and orchestral sounds are superb.+Swordplay, and general combat is tight as ever. You are making full use of the controller, with a huge amount of dynamic situations and variety.+Replayability. It's a souls game, and the souls games are renound for their replayability.+Interesting Characters and Questlines. NPC's are very memorable, even if their interactions are breif (yet very concise)Neutral points, here goes!/ The world is linear. Not as linear as Dark souls 2, but not as interconnected as Dark souls 1. This isn't a bad thing, Dark souls 1 was interconnected, but gave the impression that everything was tightly packed and squashed together. Dark souls 2 tried to give the sense of you travelling throughout a whole land, instead of a small chunk - however the levels often lacked. The variety was their, but the complex nature of dark souls 1 individual areas was lacking. Dark souls 3 makes a very nice mix of the two. There are many branching paths and a huge amount of verticality in the game, whilst still giving you a sense of direction./Covenants, which are the games factions, seem to be as niche as ever. They are ever more accessable, but still provide not a whole lot of content by themselves./Early game tends to favor the Knight class A LOT, and while there are many viable early game weapons, many will stick with the longsword for a while. Not a problem, but doesnt create a huge amount of variety.Cons--While more accessable, this game is still hard to get into (if you're new.) It's worth the try, but many simply dont understand it. It's like marmite, if you love it, you REALLY LOVE IT, but some simply just don't like it. That's fine.-Netcode issues. This is a pretty fucking big one right now. Dark souls matchmaking uses a dedicated server system to initiate the multiplayer, but multiplayer itself is P2P. It's a fantastic system that in dark souls 3, works very well (You can also password sessions!) But the netcode of the game has trouble handling packet loss, and its quite a big con. Enemy invaders or even your coop friends can be stuck in a limbo t-pose, showing no animations whatsoever. They are sometimes able to be invincible, or see the world in a completely different way. Many times i have invaded or helped with a boss and they just phase right through me, but i can still do damage. It's a huge problem right now for only the multiplayer portion of the game.Definately worth the price, and you will enjoy every minute of it if you are a fan of the dark souls games. There is a lot of homage to the series as it is rumored to be the last game (dark souls, not -souls- game).Buy it!"
Positive,"Yes Indeed, This is the best Dark souls game.It's very easy to control more than DS , DS2. and I really like the community of this game, every invasion carry its own story there is a troller, cheater, lagger , noop, parry god. If you are interested in the story , I recommend you to watch the dark souls lore videos that's made by  VaatiVidya   Farewell, Ashen one...تحسن كبير في سلاسة الحركة واللعب بينها وبين الاجزاء السابقة, اللعبه صعبة على الجدد والعكس صحيح. نظام القتال فيها اعتبره مثل السهل الممتنع ولكل سلاح نقطة قوة وضعف. اذا انت مهتم بالقصه شيك على قناة اليوتيوب بالاعلى"
Positive,"Dark souls 3 is the game that got me in to the seriesIve got it from a humble monthly after wanting to play the game for a long timeI remember my frist experiance being trying to beat gundyr for the first time,and man was he kicking my ass. I remember when i have beaten him that i jumped out of my chair and screamed ""SUCK MY FUCKING DICK YOU DUMB MOTHERFUCKER TAKE THAT"". Now when i play the game i beat gundyr without taking any damage. And thats the beauty of the dark souls for me overcoming the challanges and making them your bi*ch,and feling fucking great when you do that. Dark souls 3 is the best in the series by my opinion. I have played dark souls 1 and 2 too but i dont enjoy them as much as i enjoy dark souls 3. Level design is best in dark souls 1 but where dark souls 3 shines the most is in combat. Its fast and the dodging feels reliable unlike dark souls 2 where there is input lag and im scared when i need to dodge because it sucks dick in dark souls 2, no longer you need to use a shield because of that and that makes for some great action. So in conclusion combat is best in the series.Thank you dark souls 3"
Positive,Would HIGHLY recommend to those who are into Games that give you a challenge. If you are new to Dark Souls then go knight class most fun and gives you an OP Shield and gear that will last awhile into the game.
Positive,"I've played through Dark Salad's first two installments, though I'm not a massive fan of the series. That being said, here's my spiel on the third installment:From is one of those publishers who apparently really like to reuse their formula for gameplay. This is by no means a bad thing, especially since it works here. Overall, the movement for the player and for the varying sizes of flesh in this installment feels way less stiff from previous games. Movements feel faster and more fluid, allowing for combat to be way more intimate over previous installments where the stratagem was usally just to wait for Bigbritches McBossalot to do a heavy attack so you have time to peck at his ankles. The one place this falters, and feel free to tell me I'm wrong about this, is with shields that have 100% physical block. In my opinion, these things make Dark Sutra games way too easy, as only a handful of enemies have alternate means of damage.The enviornment of this game is something to behold. Many of the areas (save for some out of bounds nonsense, as per usual) are marvelously crafted and mind-bendingly interwoven. It's truly something to visit the other half of a destroyed bridge hours of meandering around later. Something I kind of hated about Dark Souls One was the amount of depressing caves and dark areas that were visually akin to hard pudding. There's a lot less of that here, and environments of that sort are better crafted this time around. All I can really say about PvP from my lack of expecience in prior games and lack of a pretentious state of mind is that it's a lot easier to have fun with it if you're new to the series. Being bad is totally fine, because odds are you'll have like 3+ dudes with you engaged in jolly cooperation anyway. Class rebalancing is pretty solid. Weapon stances are a welcome change to make melee combat seem less mundane. The same can be said for spells. Good God there are a lot of magic and faith options this time around--both in gear and in heathen spellcasting. There's so many that I'd even say that the devs clearly favored all classes having at least a bit of every category, because as Strength BigCubberhousen I feel that I'm missing out on quite a lot.Lastly, and this can be a good thing or a bad thing, Dark Souls Tres really, REALLY wants you to remember the first two games. There are so damn many references through bosses, enemies, equipment, areas, and everything else that are about the first two games, mostly Dark Souls One. I honestly feel that they overdid it a bit, because the game feels less like its own thing and more like a reimagining of the first installment. To this end, you might actually enjoy the game more if you haven't played previous installments.Overall, I'd say this game is worth your time if adventure games are your thing, casual or not. Given the game's resources for the player, these games really aren't as hard as they're infamously said to be. In fact, I'd say they do difficulty extraordinarily well, as encounters are engaging and require you to think quite a lot more than most other modern games, at least that I have played. Murdering those big bosses for the first time really feels like an achievement, and to me that makes the game well worth what I paid for it.In summary:"
Positive,Long may the sun shine!
Positive,"Peak gameplay, peak music, peak characters. Absolute art. Also Firekeeper :3"
Positive,"I want to make this apparent for everyone reading: Not everybody will be able to get into this. I enjoy it greatly, and hope others will. I don't want to glorify this in the wrong way, as it means different things to many.I feel that before I get into this review, I should give some elaboration on hardware. I can run things at a consistent 50-60 frames at low/medium settings (Textures and effects high, lighting low because of several bugs). This is what I'm running with -Graphics Card (GPU): AMD Radeon HD 7750Processor: Intel Core i7-3770 CPU @ 3.40 GHz16 GB of RAMBought this as a pre-built PC before I knew much about building; it's 4-5 years old at least.Now, that's out of the way, on to the review.I like this game. I like it because it reminds me vastly of Dark Souls 1, and moreso, Demon's Souls. Not in a bad way; rather, in a way that seems refreshing, and breathes a feel that is nostalgic and unique into everything. Mood, design, it's all a wonderful balance, in my opinion. It's paced a bit faster, but still begs the patience you'd expect from the franchise.That probably makes a bit more sense if you're a fan of the series already. If not, then whatever's below is for you.The Souls series, as it stands, is probably among my favorites. It's not for everybody, which is absolutely understandable. It's grim fantasy, and the gameplay, while being difficult, is not done justice by being described merely as such. It's difficult for the sake of making the player learn and overcome, as opposed to just making the experience more tedious or grueling. It's got a learning curve, and a more-than-competitive online aspect to it.That being said, each entry in the series is unique in it's own way. I'll avoid discussion of the other titles here, for the sake of keeping this a concise review. One could start with this being the first Souls game they play, and they'd be fine. Although, there's many references and lore implications in this game that allude to other games of the series. And speaking of lore, there's plenty of it to these games. It's rather vague at first, and much of it is in item descriptions, or the environment you explore, as well as characters you encounter. Personally, that makes it charming and intrigung to many, whereas for some, it makes it seem irritating and lazy. This is where it's up to the player to decide whether they want this, because again, it's not for everyone.So in the end, I've not played much of this entry in the series yet, regrettably. Though, of my 23.2 hours, most of it is probably PVP, which is without a doubt much more accessible in this game. I'd fully recommend this to anyone who's willing, because there's much to be experienced here. it's something I'd hope for many to enjoy."

Positive,"A great game with or without mods, if you like ARPGs then you will probably like this game."
Positive,"If you play smart you can beat enemies and not rage. I'm not far into the game but I have already had a lot of fun, and it's also my first souls game ever. It makes me feel like an epic gamer after killing a boss I've died 10+ times to, and I always soil my diaper when I see some enemy transform into one of those giant black snake monster things with red eyes, Very epic game."
Positive,"Hi, just no start I would like to say that this was my first game from FromSoftware.  So yeah, i think in past years games get to easy, thats why i bought Dark Souls, after 10 hours of dying and throwing pad through the window i starded to love this game with every death even more. If You are Bored with easy games and if u can bay new pad just in case if You would destroy first one, just buy it."

Positive,"The “Game of the Year” AwardMaybe it was its immersive gameplay, or its gripping story... its well-crafted characters, immaculate design, or addictive multiplayer. Whatever the reason, the winner of 2018's Game of the Year Award is an instant classic.Copy and paste GGWP."
Positive,"Rather fitting with the lore and themes of the game, Dark Souls III feels like a culmination of everything FromSoft has learned over making the entire souls series. Well, sort of.Does it capture the interconnected level design of the original Dark Souls? No, not at all. Does it have the exceptionally fair PVP of the second game? No, in fact in some ways they made it worse.But what it does take is the inspiration from the faster combat of Bloodborne, the level design and worldbuilding of Dark Souls, adds in an array of interesting and exciting bosses, and serves it up in a comprehensive Souls™ experience that's both interesting to veterans and accessible for newcomers.Sure the environments may feel a little unrefined and linear, and the throwbacks a little strange and overdone, but the sendoff (for now) to the Souls series is well worth your time, with a community that is still very much alive. Spam roll onwards, Ashen One."
Positive,"Dark Souls III is an easy recommendation for fans of the “Soulsborne” games. Virtually every aspect of the combat and gameplay has been refined from its predecessors, and the story provides a great bookend to the Dark Souls trilogy. For those of you who have never played a “Soulsborne” game before, I still suggest giving Dark Souls III a shot. Your first playthrough will be the toughest, but also the most memorable and rewarding. There will be many times when you want to quit, but keep going skeleton! Your first playthrough will easily take between fifty and sixty hours. Upon completion, you will be given the opportunity to continue in New Game Plus (NG+), which restarts the game from the beginning. The enemies are stronger and award more souls (experience and currency), but you get to keep your current level, weapons, gear, and spells. You will also be given the opportunity to make different decisions this time around concerning any NPCs and quests. There are three (technically four) different endings based on your actions, adding even more replayability to the experience.I was a little disappointed with Ashes of Ariandel my first time through. I completed it in its entirety in under five hours, and the new bosses were very lackluster, with the exception of Sister Friede. I developed a deeper appreciation for the lore of the DLC on my second playthrough, after completing The Ringed City DLC as well. The DLC did add a new PvP arena, and a PvP ranking system. Your rank (honor) nets you a badge that is displayed next to your name when summoned for co-op or PvP. A cool incentive for PvP focused players. The Ringed City delivered in every way that I could have hoped. Tough but fair enemies, powerful gear to be earned, some of the best boss fights in the entire game, and arguably the hardest boss in the entire series: Dark Eater Midir. From a lore perspective, The Ringed City answered a lot of questions the community and fans have had for three games now, and is the perfect swan song to the series.Dark Souls 3 is a masterful 9 out of 10 providing over 100 hours of gameplay. Dark Souls 3 is normally priced at $59.99, and the season pass will run you another $24.99. Try to grab the base game for under $25 for a great deal. The season pass can normally be found on sale for $19.99, but has been as low as $12.49 on Humble Bundle.Check out this link[isthereanydeal.com] to compare price and price history of Dark Souls III from your favorite retailers."

Positive,"One of my favorite games by now °^° the gameplay and mechanics are very enjoyable, especially the dodge roll ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) the bosses are difficult (in the first try), but with a bit of experience about the mechanics and some cool weapons, the bosses will be smashed in the ground and all that remains is satisfaction.I recommend to use a controller. It´s possible to play without a controller (i did), but it´s better to use one."
Positive,"Dark soul is a game which you can always trun back to it. Dramatic story and background hide inside every single dialogue and monologue, even description of every items. The difficulity of this game is in a tremendous high level, not only those boss could give you the nightmare, but also those creeps could kick your ass so hard. People suffered, but still whilling to play this game over and over again. A masterpiece of game, worth a shot."
Positive,"SPOILER FREE REVIEWDark Souls 3 is the third and most likely final installment of the Dark Souls series. It's a beautifully crafted goodbye letter to the fans. The game is set in the land of Lothric, presumably hundreds of years after the events of Dark Souls 1 & 2. The world is enormous and very diverse, albeit more linear than the land of Lordran from Dark Souls 1. The areas are quite large,  filled with multiple pathways to explore. Fans of the first game will be pleased to see the return of shortcuts, a vital feature of the world design largely missing from Dark Souls 2. Both of these characteristics make the world of Lothric more like its DS1 predecessor, and personally, I quickly forgot about the linearity. The areas are fun to explore, their geographical positioning makes sense, and they follow the rule ""if you can see it, you can probably go there.""The story is written really well. It's full of mysteries and interesting things for the player to uncover. There are plenty of NPCs, most of them likeable, and their questlines are intriguing. As always, a lot of them are hard to find, and difficult to complete on your own during the first playthrough. The game contains a lot of references to both DS1 and DS2. Fans of the lore will surely get some answers. A few of the throwbacks serve merely as fan service, but the vast majority of them have purpose, and will make more sense after your first playthrough. There's a valid reason for their existence, but it's a spoiler free review. It is a sequel after all, probably the ending of the series, so no wonder plenty of things make a comeback.When it comes to graphical fidelity, Dark Souls 3 is the most beautiful souls game. It is largely thanks to using the same engine as Bloodborne, a game equally as stunning. The graphical options are nicely customizable, and you can notice the changes right away, without having to reload. The game's maximum framerate is 60fps. At launch, many players experienced crashes and poor performance, but most of these problems were fixed. While it's still not perfect, the game runs well, even on older hardware.Visual design is as always, top-notch. The world feels very believable, atmospheric, every single element looks amazing. The clothing in particular is the best in the series. Cloth and capes actually move, and your entire set gets more and more bloody as you progress through an area. There is plenty of armor and weapon sets to choose from, both old and new. Dark Souls 3 contains 100+ weapons, 80+ spells/miracles/pyromancies, and over 60 full armor sets. All of them look and feel great. There's plenty to choose from. You can build your character any way you want to. There are 19 bosses, with small exceptions, all of them are epic, and the fights are memorable.  The game itself is full of secrets, secret areas. Illusionary walls work the same way they did in DS1. You have to hit it or roll through it, either's fine. It's definitely more intuitive than pressing buttons against every wall like in DS2. Gameplay is now more refined, and a bit faster than DS1 & 2. Enemies are more aggressive, and tanking hits is much harder now, especially in early game. Dark Souls 3 introduces a new mechanic called ""weapon arts."" Besides a normal moveset, each weapon has a unique ability/alternate 2-handed moveset. The addition of ""weapon arts"" gives even more flexibility to the way you play. Every weapon feels viable, and great to use. Spells, miracles, and pyromancies look awesome. Thanks to the return of the mana system from Demon's Souls (now called focus points or FP), magic users no longer have limited uses on their spells. A new item, Ashen Estus Flask allows you to regain your FP points. You can now split your number of Estus Flasks in any way you want to. For example, if your current maximum flasks number is 8, you can assign 6 of them for healing, and 2 for FP restoration. It is a neat little system, and makes magic even more viable and fun to play with.The online component is the best in the series. There are 8 covenants you can join, each with its own purpose, and backstory. The password system known from Bloodborne makes a return. You can now create a password, and share it with your friends. Then you will only be able to summon and play with people who use the same password. This makes co-op and online play with friends much more pleasant and easier to set up. Maximum of 6 player can be at once in a session. Due to the lack of a designated arena, many players use specific locations to create so-called ""fight clubs."" The host summons phantoms and invaders to battle each other with a specified set of rules, made up by all parties involved. The overall player count is extremely large, and you will definitely have no problem either invading or helping people/cooperating.Finally, let's talk about the soundtrack. As usual, very few areas have their specific themes. That's the nature of the souls games, you need full awareness of your surroundings. Boss themes is where the sound aspect of the game shines. The music is epic, and contains some of the best themes in the series. If you are super sensitive to spoilers, avoid listening to the OST outside the game. Song titles spoil the names of bosses.To me, personally, Dark Souls 3 is the best game in the series. It combines the best elements from all games, and makes them even better. Every game has its flaws and this one's no different. NG+ does not have too many changes, and one or two bosses weren't that great. Otherwise, there is not a lot to complain about. FROM Software still has its magic touch, and made a true masterpiece. Thankfully, that's not the end. There's still DLC to come, first one planned for fall. Judging by the level of quality of Bloodborne's DLC, I'm sure the additional content for Dark Souls 3 will be phenomenal. I strongly recommend this game. Now it's time for me to get all achievements and make plenty of new characters. See you in Lothric, and don't forget to Praise The Sun! \o/"
Positive,"I Have played every Soul's/Borne (Platinated all except Demon Soul's) game and this one between my 2 favorites(Together with Demon's) . After 2 weeks i have finally managed to complete all the achievements in this game and while doing so i have loved every single moment of this game. Loved the design of the bosses ( even tough they're all pretty easy compared to all other soul's games (Except Nameless King that guy is one tough modafucka)The Pros of the game:The Design of all of the level's: Every single map in this game is awesome in it's own form ( tough i didn't like High Wall all that much)The Enemies are now alot harder: Normally the challenge of a game is it's bosses right? Wrong. in this one the bosses are easy and what stand's between you and them is the real challenge.The Co-Op: I had a fking level 280 character and still managed to find some guys to help me out in Nameless in NG ++ and could find some PVP in Anor Londo still.The Invasion's : Damn i never liked this part of the Soul's games before. guys hella stronger than you stalking around the boss area to cap your ass when you finally get there. But now everything is kind of balanced (Kind of) i managed to fight off 4 guys while on my way to one of the lords of cinder and some of then instead of ganking on you actually help when they think 3x1 is unfair.Now the flaws i saw in this game( only 1 actually)CONS: COVENANTSHoly Hell. I have no words to describe it. With the exception of Mound Maker's (favorite of mine), Warrior of Sunlight and Rosaria's Finger's ( Invading so obviously) all other covenants are dead useless. DEAD.Blade of the Darkmoon: Can only help Way of Blue. (Waited 3 hours in anor londo while i played on my PS4 to have a single invasion.Blue Sentinel's: Ditto as the aboveWay of Blue: only has players until the second or third area of the game and some rare ones later making the other 2 dead as hell.Watchdogs of Farron : did a run on the game with this one on all the time untill abyss watchers (literally went through the whole area's gathering all items at level 35 waiting for an invasion ( Yes i was at Sacrifice Road) never had a single invasion.(Tough i was invaded so kudos for that not as dead)Aldrich Faithful: Literally can only do it's thing in like 1% of game's area(from the area of a boss to the other wich is like 20 minutes of walk if you kill everything in your way and explore) but amazingly it is alive because of the pitfight's in the area( Power goes way up the head of some people i've seen some hot's using a whip and hitting the guys that didn't want to fight literally like he was the owner of the world).CON 2: COVENANT'S PART 2.Yeah.Covenant's again.Problem: as the 2 covenant's wich are to help way of blue are dead and dead as dead and dead( that's alot of dead) after the initial area's of the game you literally can't get rank's in those 2 without some HEAVY FARMING(BORING AS HELL) I Almost went into a Boringness induced coma farming the Proof of Concordt Kept to get the miracle and the ring.And some people really think it's the fault of the players for not getting the damn 30 things before you get to level 40.(Nuts i know)Apart from that farming of the other 2 went smooth ( Mound Maker's and Watchdog's of Farron) Mound Maker's i farmed at level 180 and still found people easily and Watchdog's is really easy to get the 30 killing some mobs in the swamp.Aldrich Faithful is easy too.So why the hell they did the hardest one and most boring one be the one that's the hardest one to find matches? Pure Evil? Satan advised those japanese to do it? probably but let's not get into that.All in All i really liked this game. But if those 2 covenant's ( Blue Sentinel's and Darkmoon) actually worked without depending of a single covenant ( Like making Darkmoon work just like in Dark Soul's 1 wich would be the dream)I would have been done with the 100% in about 30 hour's earlier ( I Just like to make 100% in soul's game's and i won't stop playing even now( i play dark soul's 1, 2 and Bloodborne all the time even to this day.But even with that this game get's about 99% of my love so this review will be a positive one."
Positive,this game is like mathyou fail it one time two times tree times four  timesfive timessix times you get sad give up then wow you  get the trick to do it so start over and fail because this is Dark soul not math
Positive,"If you're a Souls fan, looking forward to THE Souls-type-experience, you've come to the right place. Weapon Arts is a great addition to the gameplay, it doesnt just add an extra move, but it changes everything. You have 2 attacks (slow and light) and each weapon would have its own moveset, also you'd meet enemies who use it (NPCs or players). All and all, it brings a big change to the gameplay, while still remaining pretty familiar, if u're a Souls-fan.The music is exactly what you'd expect it to be for a Souls game, epic, right for the current moment, memorable and just simply enjoyable.To give a final conclusion, DS3 is a combination of Demon / Dark Souls and Bloodborne, bringing the best from those games --  the art-design from Demon / Dark Souls, with some gameplay elements from BB, mixed up with typical Souls-gameplay with some new additions, like Weapon Arts. This cocktail brings us the best game which Miyazaki has made."
Positive,"I didn't like this game from the first try, got to lothric castle and couldn't kill prince there. Should have bail on the game for real. Multiplayer in this game is faster than ds2, seems even 2 fast if someone asks me. Mouse settings are the worst since camera move like 3 times faster than in scholar, stupid how it's worse while ds3 is newer game.  From bosses i like only champion gundyr, locations are cool and some armor pieces. DLC is  challenging and on some parts rly dumb level to increase difficulty. Getting back to ds3 from ER is very dissapointing. I jump instead of running and rolling 80% of times and often get hit or die bc of that. Why it's not like in ds2 where i can get 2 separate keys for rolling and jumping??? I rly have enough of this game. Don't want to play this no more."
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is more of what you love from the Dark Souls series (assuming you love it), but with vastly-improved visuals and a fluid framerate--provided you have a decent machine.  Overall it's a damn fine finale for the series, and you won't hear any complaints about the gameworld being tacked together like Dark Souls 2--this one feels quite interconnected.Pros:-----------------------Graphics-Boss music-Atmosphere-Battle system-Bosses: they're big, bad and take a real beatingCons:-----------------------Aggravatingly obscure NPC quest lines (this is the only real frustrating and unfair part of Dark Souls III)-PVP: cheating and hacking are beginning to rear their collective head-Bosses: some are waaaaaay too easy (Wolnir), while some are going to have you ready to summon help (Abyss Watchers) after getting your ass handed to you repeatedly"

Positive,"This is really the best game in the franchise. We can see in real-time as FromSoftware gained experience and knowledge over the years to evolve their unique franchise to keep up with constantly changing gaming standards. The combat and general movement system is much more fluid whereas in the previous titles, it was rather clunky and slow at times. Overall, Dark Souls 3 is just more refined and polished and also allows for faster paced action compared to Dark Souls 1 and Dark Souls 2. In 2024 and beyond, you can't even replay those older Dark Souls titles because of it lacking fluidity and modern features that now make video games great. The games are just too old now that it has become obsolete. DS3 can still be enjoyed, thankfully.The biggest issue is that, by the time Dark Souls 3 released, you already had a number of other video games of this idea by FromSoftware but also every other developer wanting to cash in on the design philosophy of making something that was very challenging to play, resulting in much of its criticism coming from people who were excited for another Dark Souls title but didn't yet realize that they had actually grown tired of the genre from overplaying DS1, DS2, Bloodborne, Armored Core, etc. Their failure to properly acknowledge DS3 as the best Dark Souls title mostly comes from nostalgia and rose-tinted glasses that prevents them from seeing beyond what they consider the best thing about DS1: its interconnected map. And that's about it. Because DS1 and DS3 are really the same two video games in terms of a bleak atmosphere and feelings of hopelessness, but DS3 is done better thanks to more polish. Even the argument that it is a ""rehash"" is not completely true, as these are games that are deeply invested in explorations of the ways in which histories and memories change with time, how experience with another or the unknown can alter or displace life from within the spaces it inhabits. DS3 isn't blindly copying its forebearers, it's very intentionally bringing spaces and experiences that the players themselves have seen into its vision of its own world. It would be weird if the game series that's about corrupted, degraded histories and memories didn't revisit and recycle its own settings.When it comes to the linearity of DS3, FromSoftware didn't implement the same interconnected map design of DS1 in future titles simply because it was, well, too convoluted. It was akin to a metroidvania and you could easily get lost and stuck and having to backtrack because you actually did go down the wrong path. What makes FromSoftware a great studio is that they learn from their mistakes. Where DS3 does it well is through its multi-layered and diverse levels such as Cathedral of the Deep or Irithyll or the Undead Settlement. You don't see anything like that in DS1 as its design is more focused on the overall world to deliver better replayability, but NG+ in DS3 is still good regardless.DS3 remains a consistent high 9/10 rating throughout while DS1 drops in quality after Anor Lando. There's great moment-to-moment gameplay in DS3 that is unmatched, it has the best level design in the trilogy (not to be confused with world design), and the best bosses in the series, where the bosses are also much more mechanically diverse.I'd really just recommend skipping out on Dark Souls 1 + 2 and just playing Dark Souls 3."
Positive,"Hi, in this review I will talk about how I appreciate the game and how you too could possibly find yourself some fun into the game.First comes my personal opinion on the first aspect of the game, despite the fact that most of the people leaves the game for their very first hours, fact relevent about if you are gonna appreciate the game or not. It may happen that people keep aside a certain pain coming from the game and focus about the lore, graphics, mechanisms and many other characteristics. In my opinion, that is the way for a true gamer to enjoy the game. Don't misunderstood something, their is good pain in this game, the one that make you gain something in result of your efforts. ( no pain no gain ) The next part is about ""noobs"" and the online aspect of the game.But sometime you may just not be able to beat a boss, that's totally understandable, the game has no ""easy"" option in his settings, well yes but, there is an online option in the settings. When you've enable online, you'll be able to co-op with else your friends or else randoms people, for understand well how online works I advise you to check the wiki of the game or else ask for some help for your issues on community servers such as discord or even Reddit. (because yes the game can be shitty about the proper functioning of online mode)And there are rewards for helping people so you can be sure that people will help you.Personally there were boring moments,  I remember farming for many hours  on some items but I did it and I was happy when it was done. Do what you gotta do, even if it's not satisfying in the beginning but as I said, no pain no gain.I hope this review was helpful to you."
Positive,"I've never played the first and the second game simply because I was intimidate by the Dark Souls franchise.It's a franchise that is well known to be hard, unforgiven and that only a a human with godly reflexes can beat but . . . obviously that's not quite the truth.The game is not actually hard, the only thing that is hard is that it's complicated at first for the player to understand that he isn't an overpowered human that can cut through an army of demon with a chainsaw or a semi-god that can kill gods with his bare hand, you are just a nobody that has to fight his/her way through a dark/corrupted world. You have to learn how to fight against giants, knights and a whole bunch of other creatures that are much more skilled than you.You will have to understand that to progress in this game, as well as any other From Software / any game in general, you will have to take some hit to learn how to dodge them, you will have to miss your attacks to know when to attack, you will have to lose to know how to win.The most important thing is to stay determined no matter what, if you are dying against a boss over and over again just stop playing for the day and come back the next one, it worked for me so maybe it will for you After more than twenty hours I finished the game and yes it wasn't easy, I died 104 times and yet I haven't fought against every single boss (I think that I am missing like 2 or 3, maybe 4) and I think that I will start on NG+ to see everything that the game has to offer.This game is worth your time if you are willing to let it teach you how to play it."
Positive,"What an amazing journey, an exciting adventure through strange and moody environments, with a variety of enemies (and friends!), a huge number of bosses, tonnes of weapons and armor to choose from, an just, ah, the best homage to DS1. I loved it through and through.PS Make sure to get both DLCs, they are great."
Positive,"The Best of the Dark souls series... go from Dark souls 1 to Dark souls 3, cause they are so much alike.. Thanks Miyazaki!"
Positive,"Servers are back, life is now a beach"
Positive,"The deep, discoverable lore. The intense, controlled combat. The massive, well designed bosses. The creepy and beautiful monsters. The large selection of weapons and armor. The subtle story telling and amazing atmosphere. Everything Dark Souls One had which made it great is found here, with better graphics, cool new bosses and more engaging questlines and choices. It may lack the genius connectivity that the original game had, but it also references bloodborne and Demon's Souls, so that's a plus. Way, way better than Dark Souls 2, I think this is the true sequel to One, and the proper ending the series needed. I'm really looking forward to seeing what From Software makes next, but I hope they do something very different. I would love to see where their twisted animation and beautiful designs could bring us."
Positive,HEBLO AND WHALE COME TO MY REVIEW OF DARK SCROLLS 3 THE PHANTOM MENACEwow what a gate game this is lots of laughs and funt imes especial when yiou paly with ur frend @frotsy523 we like to summon each other in their cool 2 player system and paly threw the game lots of times i highly recomend this if u are good at games and like cool dark faantasy thing but READERS/GAMERS/FRIENDS B E W A R E. IT. IS. DIFFICULT. but well worth to learn and patient and play this game tought me pashience and therefore saved my relationship thanks from softwear and thanks bungie ok and thanks friends for doing a readong ob my rebiew!!!Have a nice night :-)
Positive,"This is, in my personal opinion, the best game ever made.The bosses are amazing, the game's areas are detailed, the graphics are beautiful and the PVP is hilarious. You can be going through an area and a guy with only a loincloth and a torch could whip you into shape, or maybe a guy comes in with heavy armor and a huge sword and he dies in one hit. It's up to chance.Additionally, the game has just this right amount of challenge. It's not impossible, but it isn't going to hold your hand either. The first boss seems impossible when you first see it, but then you learn his moveset and pattern. After getting to NG+5 or so, you can go in with no armor or weapons and parry him backwards to death. The game has traps and things you wouldn't know from your first playthrough. If you play the game through twice, you already know most of the game by heart because you have to. It forces itself into your memory and makes itself unforgettable. All of the experiences you've ever had in the game will be with you until you die.I recommend this game and all of its DLC. Get it on sale if you want, though it is definitely worth the full price I paid."
Positive,"Dark Souls III is everything I could have wished for as a hardcore fan, and a perfect conclusion to one of my favourite game franchises of all time. Thanks for everything, From Software."
Positive,It's hard but GOOD.
Positive,"This game is one of the best I have ever played, this was my first Soulsborne game and I had an extremely difficult time adapting to the combat mechanics. But in the end it was worth it, everyone should've played this at least once in their lifetime."
Positive,"I figured my original review, which just stated ""Dope and dank"", needed an update. To put it simply, This game is a masterpiece. Demon Souls and Dark Souls are both fantastic games, but are quite dated, especially gameplay-wise, with their four-directional rolling. Dark Souls II is a pretty good game, my first Dark Souls game, and it improved upon Dark Souls in many ways, but was still worse than its predecesor. I have yet to beat Bloodborne, but I love it's atmosphere and it has a lot in common with Dark Souls III in terms of gameplay. Dark Souls III mastered combat in the Souls franchise. PvP feels extremely fluent and skill-based most of the time. The bosses are creative and fighting them doesn't feel like a chore, unless you get stuck, in which case, there's no harm in getting help from a phantom. Normal enemies feel pleasant to fight, they're put in okay places and when there's way too many, there's usually another way to deal with them.The visuals are incredible, the effects, enemies, and NPC's all come to life in Lothric, the fantasy world the game is set in. The bosses all have a menacing atmosphere, even  The Deacons of the Deep  which is jokingly easy, even if it was just a normal enemy.The DLC is nothing to complain about, it adds to the game and it is definitely worth the purchase.The soundtrack is one of the few video game soundtracks I listen to outside of the game, it's wonderful. It adds to the atmosphere incredibly well, and there's not a single song in the game that seems out of place.Overall, I give this game a 9.5/10, I feel like it's a modern classic, and it almost never feels boring. My only gripes are that the anti-cheat system is awful, it's somewhat short (but it doesn't bother me too much, as its replayablity value is off the charts)."
Positive,"Farewell Lothric, Farewell Drangleic,Farewell Lordran...We have all spent so much time in your presence, explored every nook and cranny, laughed, cried, and cheered as we ventured forth through your unforgiving landscapes.After countless trails and obstacles, it's more than worth it to sit beside you and watch the fire finally take it's last breath.Even in the darkest of times, even the shadows cast by mere embers can shape how we see our surroundings, and Dark souls has cast shadows that we will all remember long after the fire has gone out.Thank you Miyazaki, for showing me the world you envisioned.And thank you, to the community, for allowing Dark Souls to become a respected roaring bonfire that can be seen across the gaming landscape."

Positive,Died almost 10 times at the first boss so far...
Positive,"I struggled so much with this game in the beggining, sometimes i felt like not playing. But now i consider it one of my favourite games and i revisit it once in a while everytime one of my friends gets the game, just so i can play the game with them"
Positive,"It's Dark Souls. If you like Dark Souls you'll probably be fine with this. It's a weird mish-mash of Demon Souls, Dark Souls 1 & 2, and Bloodborne with a few new things, but it's Dark Souls.Because of it not fully having it's own identity it feels like less of a cogent experience, but it's Dark Souls.It's not very well optimised, but it's Dark Souls.Keyboard & mouse are pain, but it's Dark Souls.It still has bugged/laggy hitboxes in PvE AND PvP, but it's Dark Souls.There's plenty of cheating & hacking in multiplayer, but it's Dark Souls.Some things have been dumbed down or made easier, but it's still Dark Souls.90% of the messages you read will say ""Try finger/tongue but hole,"" But it's still Dark Souls.Almost nothing is explained in any meaningful way so better get that google search ready, because it's still Dark Souls.Welcome to Dark Souls."
Positive,"This game never care about player whining on how hard it is, this game juz go all the way to challenge the player who plays it.The best game everEventhough there are any other game that try to challenge the casual player, this is still the best game that gives the adrenaline rushp/s: if you still dont feel this game is not hard enough as it is, try play with calamity ring"

Positive,"Dark Souls III is by far the most epic dark fantasy out there, until we get Bloodborne port that is..."
Positive,The perfect game for whenever my wife has her bf over!
Positive,"4 hours: Roll is kinda weird after ds2 but looks amazing and it's fun.12 hours: Musics are awesome, especially boss musics. Combat is really good. Better than ds2.(I really love ds2 combat and this is way better.)20 hours: I just finished the game and I loved this game. I liked most of the bosses and places. You should definitely play it."
Positive,"Game is amazing, its very polished and has great immersive world.Combat gives a lot of fun, its fluid and responsive.Game has some best bosses and arenas in entire trilogy, especially endgame bosses.Soundtrack rocks.For me its little too easy, but im ok with that.Overall super solid game for everybody."
Positive,"First time i played it i was not impressed, but after putting in some time into it to see the zones and the bosses i got to say this comes close to the enjoyment i got out of the second game.Bosses are fun, some are hard for no reason, some have too much hp and you have to keep whacking them in the head over and over.There are a lot of armors and weapons in this game, like a lot. Which is a good thing since you have a chance to find something you like to wear and look cool."
Positive,"What, Still here? Hand it over, that thing, your dark soul."
Positive,Harder than my dick after porn.
Positive,"Don't go with my hours on steam, It's always been a gem for me."
Positive,"10/10; it is not on occasion when one views a video game as a piece of art, but I roamed the enchanting universe of Dark Souls as if it were a mesmerizing dream, where beauty and darkness coalided to form something better. I thoroughly enjoyed the environment and characters beset in Dark Souls III, delighted to see that this release did not refrain from exploiting this franchises primary assets. In terms of game mechanics there is not much new, except for the behemoth-esque bosses to which you can utilize the familiar souls fighting scheme on. All in all, a fantastic installment that will force you to perservere through the infamous YOU DIED screen to which many fans are already accustomed to seeing."
Positive,Just got past the tutorial but so far pretty fun 10/10
Positive,mmm....possible the best RPG game out there.at least for me every one should at least try few hours of the master pieceand don't forget the story and the LORE it is the best story i've every heard and the Lore make you question every possible deteal so yeah it deserve it price :)
Positive,"At first game seems hard and some may say impossible, but after few tries (and deaths) you start to understand that world of Dark Souls is brutal and not forgiving. Everything has its own attack patterns and you need to learn them by method of trying. The satisfaction you get after defeating hard boss is glorious. Storyline is ominous and hard to learn. You can't simply say that it's the hardest of the franchise because as wise people on reddit say: First souls game is the hardest."
Positive,"After playing (and loving) all three Dark Souls games, this is absolutely my favorite.IF YOU HAVE NOT PLAYED ANY DARK SOULS BEFORE:Please do not be scared by what you may have heard of difficulty level of Dark Souls.  It’s difficult, but it’s designed around that.  Don't be afraid if you are the kind of player (like me) who sets Skyrim to the easiest difficulty.  In most games, I do not like very much of a challenge.  But there is something that sets Dark Souls games apart.  And that something makes the challenge tons of fun even for someone like me.IF YOU HAVE ALREADY PLAYED DS1 OR DS2:Have no fear, for Dark Souls 3 is wonderful.  It has its quirks and flaws, but on the whole I have to say that it is the best of the three games.  I could go on about all the little differences, but most of them are fairly insignificant.The biggest difference is that the bosses are BETTER.  Now, I realize that this is highly subjective, but I enjoy the boss fights in this game more than those in Dark Souls 1 or 2.  And I love those games.CONCLUSION:Dark Souls 3 is my absolute favorite video game, period.  You should play it, because there’s a fair chance that it will earn the same spot for you.Oh!  One other thing I have to mention is what it's like to play the game with a mouse and keyboard.  I can gladly say that it works perfectly fine!  (Although I do recommend rebinding left/right on the d-pad to “1” and “3”.)"
Positive,I wish i could play the entire series for the first time again.Thank you Darksouls.
Positive,Praise the Fu*king sun
Positive,it's good game for chilling
Positive,they fixed the servers
Positive,"Well I think I'm not allowed to speak because I didn't play Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2 but I played(and finished) bloodbourne.Lets make a review like everybody else.Pros:-Good optimization-Very very very good gameplay-Not so hard(At least for me IDK)-Good enough graphics-THE MUSIC IS FUCKING AMAZING-The skybox(Just plain awesome)-The exploration is intriguing and rewardingCons:-Controls on keyboard(Are not that bad but enough to have you go mad,at least for me)So yeah just IDK,buy it if you want a very good hard game"
Positive,"When you get old in life,you start to think that u have seen everything. I mean,i played a lot of games,and i know that in the majority of them,after 10 minutes of gridding i'm able to defeat that boss and continue the game. I know that after some hours i will master that game,and will finish it without problems. Now just forget all this.To beat this game YOU have to be better every moment.Equips and level are just a detail,its your strategy of exploring your quality and the enemy weekness that will decide the fight.You will lose that line of thinking ""Thats impossible"" and ""I will never be able to do that"", and start to say ""And if i try that diferent way"" or ""I will try it 1000 times,but if in the 1001 i suceed,then will be worth it""."
Positive,"I have a full access to say anything about this game after this screen i did.Okay, so far:You know? I didnt have ANY problems in FPS/etc., yet i have a laptop. And also, i enjoyed the game so far!Yes, it's way faster just like bloorborne, but still has own features. The first boss as you all know is a pain in butt for some people, but still enjoyable and interesting.And hey, that's the stuff to which you have to be prepared! This ia a HARD game!Anyway, i still didnt finish the game, and just want to say that i RECOMMEND this game.Yeah, you might have problems, but it's only some chance. And it's Dark souls. If you played previous parts, prepare to lose pretty much there.Good luck, stranger! Praise the Sun!"

Positive,"This game is amazing, been waiting for it for the past few months and it didn't disappoint me one bit, truly beautiful, great soundtracks, well thought out level design and bosses.I've heard from people it has technical issues but I didn't experience any, no glitches, no frame drops, didn't crash once. I'm sure people experienced these things but give it a shot, its really new, its not that surprising it has a few bugs. Highly recommended"

Positive,this game sucks
Positive,"You have 50% progress to complete the game. But in middle of story, you accidentaly kill a notable character that lead you to the good ending. No problem, you can back to restart....with new gameyou git you gud"
Positive,"out of all the games in from software's soul-series, dark souls 3 has to be their greatest, most defined and functionally stable success.this game has an eventful campaign, an outstanding replayability, a satisfying multiplayer gameplay and, most surely, represents a ""breath of fresh air"" of a continuation to the two predecessors (especially compared to the second installment), featuring combat mechanics that are much more dynamic, unlike in the first game, and player-friendly adjustments that make sure the game isn't just known for ""being hard"".absolutely recommended, this along its DLCs, also extending the experience by a great chunk."
Positive,"My specs: Gtx 970, 8gb ram, i7.If you'll check how many hours I have on this game you'll know I'm either insane or this game is so good I couldn't put it down.I'd recommend this game for anyone, don't believe people when they say this game is the hardest because it's far from that.about the story:story is simple yet deep. the detailed world of this game tells you the story, don't expect a narrator to explain to you what's going on.characters:amazing loveable characters that will make you cry and laugh.replayability:infinite. there are so many things you can try to do different in this game wether it's with the character you create or the path you take in the game there's no end to the options.pluse, this game offers online features that will keep you coming back.gameplay: best gameplay in an rpg you will ever find. you'd need to learn how to avoid attacks and how to master combat in order to take on bosses and other players. combat is really satisfying.music:not much to say other than amazing. if you don't believe that just google dark souls 3 soundtrack. you'll see :)sound:on the spot. staisfying combat sounds!graphics:although not exceptionally impressive, graphics are solid. the game looks great and breathtaking at times.I'm giving dark souls 3: 9/10Amazing game."
Positive,"Review by UnamDark Souls 3 is a fantastic game that is definitely worth your time. By far the strongest asset this game has are the bosses, out of the entire trilogy this game has the most memorable and challenging bosses that are a true test of your skills. The soundtrack is also fantastic and atmospheric, all of the tunes and songs just click together like a puzzle piece. Something that is very important is that Dark Souls 3 takes a different approach to difficulty, compared to Dark Souls 1 and 2 that had some bullsh*t moments where you didn't know where to go and keep dying to the same enemies, whereas Dark Souls 3 has a more linear and focused method of challenging the player, but this, by all means, does not mean that the game is not hard, Dark Souls 3 will whip your ass until you ""git gud"".Where the game falls short is in the world. Where Dark Souls 1 had an interconnected world that naturally flowed together and Dark Souls 2 had a non-linear world, Dark Souls 3 has a world that feels very linear, with not as many directions that the player can go through, which may make multiple playthroughs feel repetitive.Apart from a minor hiccup, Dark Souls 3 is still the best that the franchise has to offer, and is worth your time. I give Dark Souls 3 a... More Reviews here!"
Positive,"This game is pretty good, however, there is a feature that bogs this 8/10 game to a 6/10The main issue is that magic is too hard to use.. As a big fan of bethesda titles such as skyrim, morrowind, and oblivion, I enjoy myself some wizardry.However, this game FORCES you into this weird 2.5d camrea, which is fine and all.. BUT.. if your like me and is accustomed to a from a rich competitive environment your used to aiming in the first person POv.. this game however seems to made for concol plebs who can't shoot a gun or control recoil if there life depended on it. Now this would be fine if this game had some sort of autoaim feature, such as the one in games like fortnite or gta V (concol versions of course). Also, this game is NOT keyboard friendly, as all of the controls are explained in the context of using a controller. It is a shame that such a potentially e-sports ready game have so many obvious flaws, I hope ubisoft fixes these issues ASAP.Now I'm not one to lie, this game series has a LOT of fun to be had, I recommend it for more casual players, now if your like me and you're a hard/core gamer (like me) then you might not have a lot of fun with it.I give this game 6 popcorns out of 10 :-)."
Positive,"Best of the Souls series. arguably the most inspirational series of the generation came to a conclusion with Dark Souls 3 and it is a great conclusion the world may be linear and not stacked onto itself like the first half of dark souls 1 but where that game falls short in the second half, this game has the best second half of the series with god tier boss fights and locations seeing the first view of the Irithyll of the Boreal Valley was Jawdropping and it never gets old Every time you visit and the Ringed City DLC could arguably be the best dlc in the series aswell with an unforgettable boss fight. this game was worth every penny when it first came out and nowadays with a sale its a no-brainer to get.Rise Ashen One and Link the Fire once again."
Positive,"In Europe, or maybe South America, they say that football is 'the beautiful game' - I believe that this series is the football of video games.DS3 is no exception."
Positive,I died and my dad wouldn't help me beat the boss :((
Positive,This game's alright.
Positive,"Best game I've ever played. Would definitely recommend. They fixed pvp connection pretty well compared to Dark Souls 1. Honestly I can't think of anything they could have done better.The lore is amazing, I'd say watch Vaati's videos on Youtube. Perhaps after you've finished the game at least once.11/10"
Positive,"this game is actually one of the masterpieces that i have ever played, the game contains good details and awesome boss fights, and about me im actually new to the souls series andi finished dark souls remastered about 3 times, so yeahi recommend it alot, don't miss this awesome experience"
Positive,first run = u want bury ur gamepad somewhere deep in ur screenfollowing runs = develop deep love for this game and try any possible variety of kickin da bosses asses

Positive,Best game I have ever played.
Positive,Git Gut you casual
Positive,"It's a fantastic but atm the soapstone is unconnectable and need to be fixed, BUT ITS AN AMAZING! Lack of counter terrorist and AWPs... this upsets me. I appriciate the tribute towards muhammed Ali within champion Gundyr. Thank you for reading! 14/0.5 too many zucchinis"
Positive,"One of the few games where you can invade someone's game, a move known to show hostile intent,  sheathe your weapons, and have a toast at their bonfire before having a fist fight with the phantom with them for a few minutes without a single hint of mistrust from either side. 10/10 I only invade to make toasts now.EDIT: Thank you for the edgy scythe and dagger, FromSoft"
Positive,"+ easiest dark souls ever played+ crafting first bonfire+ You can make archer cosplay with brigand twin daggers+ gurl tells that You should put Your sword in and consume her inner souls+ must protecc this woman- YOUR F*CKING COAT IS BURNING YO1/10, would not recommend it to local tailors!"
Positive,"One of my favorite games of all time, but I would have never been able to get into it without multiplayer. I can't recommend it until the ability to play with others is restored.Edit: Servers are (finally) back up. Review changed to recommended."
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 was the first Souls game I found myself truly enjoying. While the hard slog through the trials and tribulations of Dark Souls 1 was appealing on paper, in reality, the low production values, low impact combat, and technical issues left me uninterested, and Dark Souls 2 is Dark Souls 2, so yeah.Where DS3 succeeds is in broadening the appeal of the franchise without diluting what makes it special - at least not too much. Purists will rightfully complain about the more linear, simplified experience, and while DS3 is clearly nowhere near as masterfully designed as DS1, as a game it performs much better. The technical competency is miles beyond DS1 and DS2. Combat is incredibly meaty, each blow translating a hugely satisfying sense of weight and impact. The audio that accompanies the combat may as well be ten generations apart; it's that good, and the boss fights music is often extraordinary. I tend to be quite hyperbolic when I find something I like, but in the case of DS3, it's no hyperbole - the music is really damned good. In fact, most of the game is.There is a clear feeling of progression - this is very much a journey, moreso than the somewhat stagnant, inter-connecting affair of DS1. New areas present new enemies, fortunately without much recycling, and these enemies have more diverse tactics than in previous games. The combination of different threats and larger groups of foes makes the faster, more tactile combat feel significantly more exciting and demanding, without being overly challenging.The addition of the Weapon Art mechanic gives each weapon a special skill, and though many weapons share movesets and WAs, the added depth is a pleasant touch that creates some interesting opportunities, though expect to rely on them in PvP more than PvE.Once you start joining the dots together - weapon arts, big groups of enemies, increased speed, the new animations and more - it all comes together to form a rather special game. DS3 is fast, and it's intense, and it rewards involvement and risk with great satisfaction. I would often hold my breath during encounters, especially in PvP; exhaling after surviving another grueling fight with only a sliver of health remaining. What it does is manipulate you to an almost hilarious degree: impeding navigation with poison, placing enemy ambushes around corners, having horrible Cthulu-esque monsters drop down on you from above, spikes, death pits and more - it's all there to scare you, to make you feel tiny and insignificant. And when you learn where enemies are, and where the threats lie, and you gradually master each area - that satisfaction is unbeatable. DS3 doesn't have the deepest combat around, it's not a particularly difficult game once you get used to it, and it's not going to kill you unfairly; instead, it presents challenges which are designed to intimidate you while also offering a small glimmer of hope, and once you pull through, you feel amazing.That satisfaction extends to the boss fights, which at times can be reduced to a simple gimmick, but are mostly solid, and occasionally fantastic. One of the more memorable bosses is actually the first one you encounter; at first you're fighting a big guy in big armour, and suddenly he transforms into this nightmarish, draconic beast. This idea of transformations or ""phases"" extends to all of the fights, meaning that unlike the previous Souls games, every boss in DS3 will have a certain line of progression in each fight. It's not unfair, either - they may regain health, use a new weapon or become more aggressive, but it always feels like you have a chance, and if not, there tend to be shortcuts straight to the boss arenas to minimise frustration.Unfortunately not everything is sunshine and rainbows, because the game does have its problems. I've only touched on some of the positive aspects because there's a lot to cover - a hugely improved UI, some great lore, fantastic looking equipment and so on - but the game does have downsides.The elephant in the room is PvP, specifically, invasions. Invaders are at a huge disadvantage in DS3; not only do you get less than half the estus that the host has, but the host can also summon up to four phantoms, turning it into a 5 v 1; they can also use a special item that makes all of the area's enemies hostile to invaders; they also have a habit of instantly re-summoning phantoms when you kill them, which means that it essentially becomes a battle of attrition that's impossible to win. Stamina usage is also inexplicably unbalanced in DS3. Every action costs stamina, and you can roll to avoid attacks. You used to be able to roll at most around 7-9 times in DS1; now, you can roll 14-15 times, and stamina recovery is faster, too. This means that builds that focus on fast attacks are simply impossible to beat if you're good enough. You can roll 10 times, attack once, and then roll some more and avoid ever being hit. These issues are exacerbated by certain items that boost rolling, and if you watch any DS3 PvP video, you'll see that 99% of the action are rolls. Previous games in the series promoted the use of defense with shields, parries and heavy armour, but DS3 basically asks you to just roll all the time. It's boring, it's ridiculous and it trivialises PvP combat.Somewhat related to PvP, but many weapons also have identical movesets among their classes. This isn't too much of an issue, but it's a shame to see a tiny axe having the exact same moveset as a huge, 30 kilo, two-sided magical war axe. The existing movesets are also rather unbalanced, too. Fast weapons are objectively better than slower ones in almost every scenario, and like I said before, fast builds will always beat slow builds if both players are equally skilled, and it's a shame. Poise has been re-implemented in an interesting way, but the importance of armour and defensive play is still very much diminished compared to the previous games. Oh, and magic is borderline useless in PvP because you can just walk to the left and/or roll once and never be hit.Covenants are also hugely simplified, with no entry requirements, special missions or structures. It's basically ""Do you want to join? Okay, now kill 10 people for reward 1, then kill 20 more for reward 2"". That's all there is to it. Sure, you have to kill different kinds of people, but there's no complexity to it. They're boring and unoriginal.The linearity of the game is an issue. The series prides itself on its interconnected level design, and while it's still there, there are moments in which you're basically running in a well disguised straight line. Apart from not being particularly interesting, the simplicity of the world's layout lowers the skill barrier, makes the rest of game's relative lack of complexity more evident, and reduces replayability. It's a shame, because DS3 capitalises on some extraordinary artwork (in spite of the ancient graphics technology) to create some breathtaking scenes, but it never quite reaches the highs found in DS1.Speaking of DS1: DS3 suffers from déjà vu. Some areas, enemies, animations and items are copied wholesale from the first entry in the trilogy. Upgraded graphics and small cosmetic changes don't hide the fact that DS3 at times feels like a spin-off of the first game. In fact, it's not even limited to copying previous Soulsborne titles; there is an entire area around half way through the game that is literally cloned and re-decorated later on.There are other issues, but suffice to say that DS3 isn't perfect. However, I found myself absorbed in the game. Regardless of its shortcomings, it's an exciting adventure and one of the most satisfying games I've played. It's both the best and the worst entry in the series in many ways, and that inconsistency may disappoint those expecting another Dark Souls 1. DS3 doesn't reinvent the genre, but while it occasionally lags behind, it's also capable of soaring ahead."
Positive,"At the time of writing, I am totally new to the genre and in the space of around 14-15 hours I have died around 60 times. This game is a treat to play, a difficult and fair learning curve which rewards patience and punishes recklessness. The music and visuals are superb and I cannot wait to see what more is on offer. Will update when I have finished, whenever that may be.Update:Having finished Dark Souls III, my first ever game in the Souls series and can say without doubt that it is easily one of the most unique gaming experiences out there. It’s an understatement to say that the series redefined the RPG genre in its own way, as the Souls series (through my experience playing DS3) fortified itself as a paragon within the industry.  I understand this now. But onto the game itself. As I mentioned before, it is a brutal learning experience which will absolutely waste anybody who intends to hack and slash their way through the intricate, lore-steeped world. Likewise, if you take the time to carefully think about your next move, to learn when to strike, when to dodge and when to avoid a conflict altogether – the game rewards you generously. You must be willing to learn from your mistakes to succeed and in doing so, Dark Souls III returns the favour by offering one of the most cathartic and fulfilling experiences in videogames. The tension in trying to reach that next bonfire, not knowing what awaits you around the corner, is palpable – yet once you reach that safe-point, it feels well earned and you can take a breather knowing that you have done well to get that far. This constant feeling of tension and relief, whether it is a boss, a bottleneck of tough enemies, a desperate attempt to find that next bonfire knowing your souls are constantly at stake, is a wonderful formula. The gameplay itself features a tight and crisp combat system. Many of the enemies you will meet are unique and have their own attack patterns which can be countered and taken advantage of provided you take the time to properly learn their patterns. This applies to all enemies, from the lowliest Hollows, to the mightiest of the lore’s Gods. Any mistakes which are made are on you – and no amount of frustration will change that. When you do overcome that one challenging enemy, the reward stays with you – and you channel that energy into the next challenge you meet. That is the beauty of the niche gameplay mechanics of the game, and Dark Souls III teaches you this very quickly by introducing you to a boss within the first 5 minutes of gameplay – followed by one of the most challenging areas in the entire game for newcomers. Continue to persevere even more and you will have the pleasure of witnessing some of the finest boss fights put to play. Some are better than others, but for the most part they leave an imposing impression either through their design, their fight, their story – or all of those factors. The aesthetic design of the world of Dark Souls III is grim, gritty, morbid and genius. Much of the lore of the game is presented to you through the design of the game itself, like an artist trying to convey a story through their canvas. As the Unkindled, you feel loosely tied to this world where much of the story has already been told from ages past, but is now in decay and you must decide what will become of it. There is no true happy ending – only fleeting outcomes which may or may not make a difference in the future. In short, this game is nihilism made flesh. The soundtrack is masterful, for the majority of the game. Every single boss has their own unique orchestrated theme. Like the boss fights themselves, some can be lacklustre, but when there is a boss which means business – the soundtrack is there to back it up. Truly a feast for the ears. All in all, if you have never played a Souls game – start with this one. Take it from another first timer when I say that Dark Souls III is an incredible genre-defining experience which has endured the test of time. You owe it to yourself to try it out – if this game clicks for you as it has me, it will leave a remarkable impression. The reputation the Souls series has gathered for itself truly cannot be overstated. 9/10As a side note: There are a few issues with online play. Invasions and co-op play can generally be riddled with lag and latency issues, but this is a minor one. A larger one is the growing presence of hackers, some of which have the potential to corrupt save files from what I have heard. Remember to back up your saves regularly if you intend to play online or use a mod designed to protect you (such as Blue Sentinel)."
Positive,"It might be little bit on the easier side, still harder than ds1. fight me"
Positive,"i used to love anor londo.. but that silver knights, that proof of concords, that damn covenant farm things.anyways peak game peak music peak maiden peak bosses"
Positive,"It would be better if I bought WinRAR, it would be more useful =)"
Positive,"This game is painful, but fun if you take your time."
Positive,Sequel to the much appreciated YOU DIED simulator where you will die in the most unimaginable ways possible although falling foolishly to your death from a cliff thanks to gravity still takes the cake.The game offers way more bonfires compared to the previous installments of the git gud series but still offers quite a challenge in terms of creative enemies(except r**k l****ds they can go and f themselves ) and bosses.The satisfaction on defeating difficult bosses pretty much remains the same. Last but not the least the game offers some of the most beautiful screenshot worthy landscapes.
Positive,"It's beautiful. Amazing game, with outstanding graphics, all bundled up in a series of meticulously designed zones, bosses and NPCs. My favorite game yet. Has:- Online co-op and pvp- Soul destroying deaths- pain.Good luck!"
Positive,"fighting the demon princes with 3 other friends, we certainly put down the two demons and then the prince rised up.he screamed at us, lunch into the air and throw some flaming boulders, one friend was hit directly and ended up as a smoking corpse on the ground.then he landed and started firing a beam of demonic energy around all the arena, it hit another friend and he went down like it was nothing.i stood there shocked at what just happened in less than 20 seconds, just to be sniped by another beam and with full health and got vaporized.while my screen was fading i saw our last warrior stood up to the beast with his eyes filled with courage and determination.then the demon sweept throught the ground with its claws and killed him too.never laught so hard after a massive failure."
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is a great balance between the first game and the second. It has all the amazing moments and subtle coherency and cohesiveness of the first game while also bringing with it some gameplay improvements from the second. I appreciate the balance, especially leaning a bit more towards Dark Souls 1. I do miss the powerstancing from Dark Souls 2, but I'm happy that they left the other mechanics behind. For some people it comes down to what you were introduced to, and I started with Demon's Souls. After playing Dark Souls 1 it became my favorite and remained that way. Dark Souls 3 being a close second. Those of you introduced to Dark Souls 2 first may have entirely different feelings towards Dark Souls 3, understandably so. Even if it may not rank highly on your favorite list, we all know each and every Souls game is an amazing experience."
Positive,"Wow... just wow.Before this game I only played and finished Dark souls II in the souls series (and tried a bit of Bloodborne), but I can say Dark Souls III is a huge upgrade.The graphics are incredible, it is easier to pick up the story and lore aspects than DS2 (while remaining hard to undersatnd like in the other souls games), the combat feels tighter and quicker, the levels are dense and well-built, the monsters and the bosses (that I encountered so far) are well-crafted and well-balanced,And of course the challange - it is harder than DS2 (I understood from reviews that it resembles DS1 in it's difficulty) - and I love it!I do have some FPS drops here and there, but nothing that would ruin my experiece.overall, this is a must buy in my opinion for someone who loves well-crafted RPG fantasy games with tons of lore that challange you in every step of the game.Praise the sun, and good luck - because you're going to need it :)"
Positive,"The most accessible introduction to Dark Souls. Dark Souls is extremely rewarding to 'git gud' at because the world makes no pretensions about being fair. Your character is often times, and especially on NG+, not stronger or tankier than any of the enemies. Hell, often times you're not even faster and you're susceptible to more hit stuns than they are. So your only choice is to outwit, outspace and outplay the AI which feels utterly amazing."
Positive,>Start The Game>First Boss>Die 19 TimeGG
Positive,big sword haha
Positive,"DSIII has the worst atmosphere, in my opinion, out of the 3 mainline Souls titles. The two biggest draws to the series for me are 1) The atmosphere, and 2) How good the games feel mechanically to play - DSIII *feels* the best, mechanically, to play. Everything from rolling, blocking, parrying, R1/R2, weapon arts (though new to this entry) feel the best they've felt in any of the main 3. I recently went back and beat 1's Remaster, and I'd forgotten just how bad it felt to have to come to a full stop to drink Estus. It's painful. DSIII is mechanically one of the most rewarding games to play, well, ever. The (viable) build variety is at an all time high in DSIII as well. There's SO many different weapons/magic/pyro/miracle combinations that are viable to put together that it makes the game extremely rewarding to replay. Voice acting is as good as it ever gets in FromSoft titles - some of the line delivery gives me goosebumps still even after hearing it for the 100th time. The bosses are mostly quite fun, though some are kind of more RNG heavy-feeling even than they felt in DSI/DSII, in that some runs, I'll absolutely easily WRECK a boss, 1st try, in a minute or less, then in another run, the boss will happen to do a totally different set of moves, and feel 1,000% harder because of it. Partly just the nature of the beast, I think.Although I don't think the atmosphere feels as oppressive, depressing, and... mournful as it often does in I and II, it's not without its moments - Irithyll comes to mind immediately. That + its Dungeon are two of my favorites in the entire series. The art design of III is an absolute high point - there's so much loving detail in every single area, room, corners of rooms. If you've ever been curious at all about the Souls series, but haven't jumped in, DSIII is a good place to start. The mechanics feel more player-friendly than I or II ever did. If you keep a guide handy, even if you're a total noob, you'll be able to beat this game with patience and dedication to it, and it's worth it IMO. Although, I wouldn't go into expecting the ending itself to be *the* point of playing the game. The endings are... serviceable, but they're very similar to the other entries in the series, and they're kind of not the point of it, in a weird way. This is a game that definitely actually deserved its full price tag, and if it's ever $40 or $50, it's worth that too."
Positive,"Not as hard as people say, still a really fun game. Now the DLCs, oooh! those are evil. Hard af."
Positive,"You will die, a lot. You will die by a slash of a sword, by a slice-and-dice axe, by a bonecrushing hammer, or by a piercing spear; you will be poisoned, eaten, stabbed, assassinated and pushed off cliffs. Death is everything in Dark Souls III. It is education, it is progress, it is the recurring stylistic and thematic motif that runs through all of its spectacularly varied, decaying and depraved environments. The first thing that you have to understand about this game is that survival is in itself a tremendous accomplishment. It can be punishing, cruel, sadistic and uncompromising. It can also be the purest, most thrilling adrenaline rush in your gaming experience since forever – it can take over your life and reward you like nothing else can. Because your chances of success seem so slim when first starting up a new game, each victory feels monumental and self-gratifying. The DLCs' are also great and thrilling to play through, and in my honest opinion also have some of the greatest and most arduous boss fights you will ever encounter in the Dark Souls series, but i'll let you decide on that matter. One of the most memorable experiences that I've ever been blessed by, therefore I shall rate this game 10 out of 10 finger but holes!"

Positive,"My rating - 4.5/5.The game starts of difficult but gets easier as you progress through the game as you get more weapons and options to take on your enemies. A proper strategy and execution can make the game a lot easier. Pros :1. Large arsenal of weapons and shields2. Different forms of infusions to weapons and shields.3. Large amount of spells and buffs.4. Fluid movement as compared to dark souls 15. Rich Lore.Cons : 1. Enemies hitting through the wall.2. Fucking poison and toxic swamps.Overall, a really good game if you want to challenge yourself."
Positive,"Only two endings to go, all the ugly grinding is done, one of the few games worthy to be 100-percented. But be aware - there are NO CLOUD-SAVES! A fresh windows-install ""mid-session"" might be crippling and could harm your personal growth.Maybe some other day . .  ."
Positive,Pure and deep dark atmosphere with incredible hidden lore. Pretty awesome to play with friends more than one playthrough. Seems difficult and yes it is. So you need nothing but straight hands and a friend to fight those freaking phantoms. And its lore... amazing
Positive,This game makes me smile in real life :)
Positive,bro I would shove needles under my eyelids if it meant I would get bloodborne on pc
Positive,it's good i guess
Positive,Good ending to the series. Thank you Dark Souls! Now on to Elden Ring!
Positive,The game has been out 3 days and I already put 30+ hours into it.Need I say more ;)
Positive,"A fantastic game that you'll have a love-hate relationship with. The game is the abusive one, and you just submit to it and you can't stop. But you'll like it. If you don't enjoy it at first, you'll grow into it. Trust me. If not, git gud."
Positive,"Done the game and both DLC, that was a great pleasure to play this game.I’ve came here after I’ve done Sekiro (my first From Software game), DS Remastered and Scholar. First thing I’ve noticed that it’s much faster game than Remastered and Scholar, more closer to Sekiro in terms of pace, if I can say so. Mostly I’ve done game pretty much ok mostly in Offline mode, all bosses I’ve done without help of other players (though I’ve used NPC’s from time to time, few of them were useless btw). I think I’ve lost more attempts to Nameless King and Sister Friede (around 40 combined) than to every other boss in the game combined. Dancer took me around 10 attempts, Lord of Cinder 3-4, Slave Knight also 3-4 same goes for Midir. About DLC’s, try to buy Season Pass on Sales, they’re not worth full price for them. Especially after so many years. Better buy Elden Ring at this point.  DLC Ashes of Ariandel  Really cool looking DLC, I’ve liked visuals of this one more than Ringed City, but it’s shorter, took me around 4.5 hours. There are some cool weapons and enemies in this DLC. DLC The Ringed City  It’s a bit longer than the first one, I’ve found this one more difficult, there are a lot of strong enemies there. Bosses in this DLC are great, don’t miss dragon though, you can get cool katana off his soul. Now, I will wait for Elden Ring."
Positive,"Dark Souls III is a masterful conclusion to the beloved action RPG series, offering a harrowing yet captivating journey through a world on the brink of apocalypse. The game strikes an impressive balance between familiarity and innovation, refining the core mechanics that fans have come to love while introducing new elements that enhance the overall experience.The Kingdom of Lothric and its surrounding lands are visually stunning, showcasing From Software's most impressive environmental design to date. Each area is meticulously crafted, offering breathtaking vistas and a strong sense of place that draws players into the game's rich, melancholic atmosphere. The interconnected world design remains a hallmark of the series, though the ability to teleport between bonfires from the start alters the traversal dynamics somewhat.Combat in Dark Souls III is fierce and punishing, yet deeply rewarding. The introduction of Weapon Arts adds a new layer of depth and flexibility to the already robust combat system, allowing for more varied and stylish approaches to encounters. Boss fights are particularly memorable, often featuring multiple phases that keep players on their toes and require careful strategy to overcome.The game's narrative and lore are as cryptic and engaging as ever, with plenty of interesting characters to meet and questlines to unravel. Dark Souls III cleverly weaves elements from previous games into its story, creating a sense of nostalgia for longtime fans while still offering a fresh experience.Technically, the game is a visual masterpiece, with stunning environments and detailed character models. However, some players have reported performance issues, particularly on PC, which may detract from the experience for some.Despite minor flaws, Dark Souls III stands as a triumphant finale to the series, offering a challenging, immersive, and deeply satisfying experience that will captivate both newcomers and seasoned veterans alike. Its meticulous attention to detail, refined gameplay mechanics, and rich world-building make it a standout title in the action RPG genre and a fitting send-off for one of gaming's most influential franchises."
Positive,its like dark souls
Positive,This game is supposed to be RPG in which you're only forced to play the role of victim.
Positive,"people say bad, no listen people, good."
Positive,"I'm a long time player whose played on multiple accounts, and the game is amazing, its perfect. Amazing lore, amazing gameplay, I love everything about the game itself. But.. don't buy this game. It's not fun anymore. The Dark Souls 3 Hayday of summon signs everywhere and constant good invasions is over. It's all 4v1s against the singled out you invader of 4 tryharding nerds who for whatever reason are pulling off a str/dex/int/fth build at sl 125 or youre a lone host against 2 glitch and exploit using invaders. YYou either have to be an expert, or just enjoy playing offline. I would have recommended this game 3 years ago, but this.. no. This game is not worth the multiplayer.EDIT - A 2024 UPDATE TO MY OPINIONExcellent game the origin of my Soulslike addiction, and for good reason. Solid combat and exploration, ungodly replay value, and PvP like no other. I absolutely love this game, and will be playing it until the day the servers are shut down."
Positive,"This is the best game ever.From software combined what was good in DS1, DS2, and Bloodborne, and made this beautiful and challenging game.If you are a souls veteran, it's a must, you can see so much references from the older games. You will be full of ""hm, wait I know that! Oh yes that was in DS1! Cool!"" moments.Pros:- Amazing graphics- Usual darksouls gameplay. A bit faster tho- Hella lot of secrets, and places to explore- Lot of references from the older gamesCons:- Some fights may be unfair. Or at least you can feel so.- Lot of reused materials - doesn't bother me, but could bother others."

Positive,"Ashen one, hearest thou my voice, still?"
Positive,"This review comes from a player who have never got banned or came across a hacker after more than 150h playtime Overall Dark Souls ExperienceMy name is Gal and I am a huge fan of the   Dark Souls game searies. I strated playing the first game out of the three in 2013 and finished it twice (on PC and on XBOX 360). While playing  Dark Souls 1 I became obsessed with the game and loved every single thing about it. Then, in 2014  Dark Souls 2 was born and a new saga began to the  Dark Souls searies. I have played the second game the second it came out and I finished it a week after, and to be honest, it wasn't a blast. I had fun time playing it, but it was just not like the first game.And then, Dark Souls 3 showed himself to the world in 2016........... Current State in Dark Souls 3Finished the game about 4 times. Have 3 PvP players. Playing a lot of PvP, and trying to get more characters to level 120 (PvP Meta). First CutceneWhen I launched the game for the first time I was so happy to go back into the world of  Dark Souls, the menu screen, the sounds, everything was exactly like good old  Dark Souls. Then, the first cutscene started (and with it the goosebumps ^^) and god.... oh god the voice acting in this game is just... SO GODDAMN GOOD! Already in the first cutscene you hear an old woman's voice telling you about the history of a place called  Lothric and while hearing the woman's voice you see characters and lords that you know, you are going to meet and probably fight. First Gameplay and Boss ImpressionThe gameplay starts, and you pick up your Ashen Flask after killing a bunch of dudes and then you light the first bonefire, wasn't so hard right? Meeting the first boss 2 second later gives you that breathtaking feeling that you are fighting against a gigantic armored guy that got some cool moves. After few tries you manage to take him down to half health and you see  phase 2, and oh god, that is just terrifying!  Some dark creature is just cracking his way up from that guy and you need to fight against it! After managing to take that thing down you fully walk into.... the world of Dark Souls 3! 40 Hours Into the GameYou are geared up, got your own playstyle with unique swords and spells and you crawl deeper into the dark lore meeting up glorious and scary bosses. In your journey you get to choose things that will affect the end that you will get (  there are 3 endings to the game and another special end ) and to be honest, on my first playthrough, I didn't knew what I was actualy picking (Blind playthrough) but at the end I figured it out. Story: 8/10 -  I realy love the  Dark Souls franchise lore (the things I know about it...) but I didn't like it so much how the developers delivered it in the third game. there are a lot of NPC questline that you most likely missed on your first playthrough and how the lore is being told... it is too foggy in my opinion. Sounds (Music and Voice Acting) : 10/10 -  The music in this game just matches so good into some situations and the voice acting is amazing. Gameplay and Mechanics  (Xbox 360 Controller) : 9/10 - I realy enjoyed how the game is being played and the new weapon arts is just great. I was sad to see that they took down the dual wielding stance and some of the mechanics are just hiddin inside the game and you only realise them when watching a toutorial or by accident. PvP and Online Matchmaking: 8/10 -  Dark Souls 3 is the first Dark Souls game I started playing PvP and I having super fun with it. The problem is that some of the weapons are just not balanced enough and the hitbox can be a pain in the ass sometimes. Graphics and Sceneries: 10/10 - The game looks great and most of the sceneries are so amazingly good (  Irithyll of the boreal valley was just so beautiful ).This was my first review, hope you guys liked it :)"
Positive,"One of the best games i've played ever, completed NG today unlocking one of the three endings and there is still plenty left for me to do. The boss fights were both challenging and rewarding, The PVP was intense, and the lore was great. It combines all the best elements of the Soulsborne games into one super game essentially. There are glitches and bugs here and there which I hope FROMSOFT fixes like the no animation summons/invaders as well as lack of summons for Sentinel/Darkmoon covenant members, but other than that, I enjoyed the game a lot and will continue playing for a long time :D! Thanks FROMSOFT!!!9/10 (10/10 with ember)"
Positive,"I remember seeing a trailer for Demon's souls on gametrailers back when it was about to release in north america. Now I've always been a big fan of monster hunter so when I saw the main character run around in 3rd person perspective, wielding an enormous demon killing sword, I just had to get my finger in it. Even though it wasn't clear whether it would even release in the EU.Two games followed which indeed was memorable, but still was lacking something.Then this finally came along. The third and supposedly final installation of the series.There is something here for new players as well as for old. It's basically like if you combined all the four games into one.The thing I really love about this game is the atmosphere and if you're into gory, dark fantasy, worlds shrouded in fog with bosses way stronger than you then this is the game for you.Just be prepared to die... a lot. :)"
Positive,"I might review this game very late. Especially when sekiro is already launched. I see  some people got over hyped by sekiro and thinking it's good for someone very new to souls like series. But i rather recommend this game compared to sekiro which need more skills in my opinion since i rely on poise and spells in dark souls 3 so i am positive that sekiro is not my play style. Either way i recommend this game to anyone who might not be familiar to souls game if you are scared with invaders play  offline mode or just ask your friend to accompany you.Community is cancer :D even when playing with friends. There are so many cheaters on low level you might wanna play offline untill reach level 200+ even though it doesn't guarantee there will be no cheater on that level. The cheaters can ruin your game, your save and might get you banned check discussions for details it is quite annoying. You can report them but they just gonna do familly sharing and make a new account , which was reenabled? as far as i know. Didn't experience being hacked my self, but i believe i got invaded by hacker once? i am helping my lower level friend in high wall of lothric, 1st map of the game after the tutorial. An invader came and make me and my friend got ""Cursed"" status, i believe there are no spell that gives this status from  players, also we are  near the boreal boss. also encounter a ""no clip"" invader where he straight just blink to my friend who is far away even though he was infront of me a second ago. Got no proof so you might not want to believe me, but i do believe you don't want to experience this. So becareful when you are playing online. I just remembered, something does goes wrong with my account, i think some hacker did it or it's  a game bug? I can no longer use dark hand or the pyromancy that fist the enemy and then burning finger them as an offensive weapon. i mean i can grab them sometimes, but not damage anyone with it. well most of the time i use dark hand as a shield bcs it barely has any weight, still annoying when you want to screw arround your friend and ended up doing nothing at all.I hope ELDEN RING won't have this kind of problem. but that's too hopeful of me for a PC game"
Positive,It hurts and I like it
Positive,Time for crab
Positive,"this ds1,ds2,bb have wrecked all other games for me.they all feel very empty and unrewarding compared to the souls games,sekiro is also a amazing game ."
Positive,"Quite simply, one of the best games I have ever played. Beautiful, masterful, captivating - pure genius."
Positive,Fantastic game. Love coming back to it.
Positive,"I feel like a lot of people who don't play Dark Souls come to it for the wrong reasons. The series has become this symbol of difficulty and challenge but the funny thing is it's not that difficult, but it's hard to believe that when you get slapped around by the tutorial boss like you're a cheap whore. Still, once you figure the series out its smooth sailing from there. When I originally pirated DS3 in 2016 (forgive me Lord Gaben), I'm pretty sure it must have taken me at least 60-100 hours to beat. The game felt impossible but when I beat it I felt rewarded and that feeling pushed me to play the other souls games. And now years later, after beating many soulslike games from From Soft and other studios, I've realised that these games aren't that difficult, you just have to think a little differently to play them and that the main attraction of these games isn't the difficulty but the world around you.When you start Dark Souls 3 , you're surrounded by graves. There's an unsettling feeling that this game is different from other games and that you're not in a happy hopeful world. Even the boss fight against Gundyr makes you wonder, this huge man-like statue impaled by a sword. Who is he? Why is he stabbed? And is he gonna slap me around like a cheap whore (yes)? For a game this bleak and dark, it induces so much wonder. I will never not awe when you open the door to the High Wall of Lothric. That's what Dark Souls is about, this feeling of ""Oh shit! I am here!"".Since getting this game on steam I have played this game twice, first playthrough lasting about 10 hours and second around 6. This game is not as difficult as people say it is, the original Super Mario is harder than this game, actually any Mario game is harder than this game and yet it never gets boring. In a lot of other games when you get used to a game and it starts getting easier, it becomes boring but here the enemies and levels are designed in a way that no matter how good you get, you still have to think and pay attention. It's never mindless and mashy. I say it's easy but at the same time I know that one second of not thinking about what I do could lead to death. If you're struggling to beat this game, here's a tip, it's not about how much damage you do or how much you grind your stats, you have to learn the patterns of your enemies. Trust me, the game becomes wayyyyy easier once you start paying attention to that.I played this game so many times back when it first came out and even now I keep going back to it once in a while and this time I paid for this shit. And after so many playthroughs I can say that this is one of my favourite games of all time and you'd be crazy to not give this a go."
Positive,"Here is my opinion about Dark Souls III after almost 200h on this game. (Still playing)Combat: 9.5/10 The combat formula still works and it is super addictive. After getting used to it, for a new player, you will find your self ""dancing"" around mobs which makes the game feel like an arcade hack & slash experience.Kinda punishing at some points (not even close to dark souls 1) and very rewarding.Atmosphere: 8/10The atmosphere of the game is pretty good, dark, eerie, pretty much what you expect from a game of the series.Cannot compare it to Dark Souls 1's atmosphere which was a fatigue visceral world of death but you feel pretty ""lonely"" here also so worry not.Bosses: 9/10The bosses are excellent! Amazing design (even for 2021), You don't need something like 50 wipes to memorize the move set, extremely rewarding and very well placed on the locations of the game lore-wise.Npc's: 9/10They are all brilliantly voiced, lines are ominous and dark with no small-talk or extras. They also add to the atmosphere, the mystery and the ""why am i here"" of the game.Music: 9/10Intense music as the previous of the series. Top notch placement decision.Builds & Items: 8.5/10Most people I' ve seen use the same starting setup BUT the game has to offer so many items you can choose from and almost none of those unplayable or non enjoyable.You want a super strength tanky build? You got it! A stealthy dexterity agile build to sneak up on enemies and backstab them? Mages with a LOT of sorceries, miracles etc? All there!Plus this game has the BEST armor sets/fashion of that medieval dark setting period. (also a good chunk of the armor sets seem to be inspired by Bloodborne)Level Design: 8.5/10No comparison to DS1 or Bloodborne but oh man, that was nice!Multiplayer: -/10Haven't played more than an hour so I don't have anything to say about the PvP aspect of the game :(Overall: 9/10If you want a Zelda type experience, on a dark fantasy world & try to find out why are all these things happening, with excellent steady super accurate combat mechanics, I strongly recommend to give this gem a try and by try I mean play it more than 5h.IMO a good game should have you captivated and be self-explanatory way earlier but this is a part of the story of the game plus a ""mechanic"" and you will not be disappointed in the end that's for sure."
Positive,"After hearing a lot about the series, and my friend spamming me every day to buy Dark Souls III, I gave in. I bought it. I expected pain, struggle, and a refund after the first five minutes.. However, that's not what I got. I'll admit, I have a lot of experience in RPG games as I have over 300h in The Witcher 3, but this took quite some time to get used to. You'll constantly get destroyed by mob enemies, and even when you think you're safe, you'll get a giant tree that smacks you down. However, once you get the hang of it, this game is going to be one of the most enjoyable games you've played. There is no minimap, there is no saving and loading (there are checkpoints, though). There's not a single indicator of what you're supposed to do. The game has a lot of sidequests, but you'll have no idea how to actually complete them, so the wiki will probably be your best friend in the game. Multiplayer is a big thing in this game. You can either summon a white phantom, who can help you kill a boss (even though you should fight the bosses all by yourself, or you'll find the game too easy), or a red phantom, who will absolutely destroy you with his +10 Ultra Greatsword that he bought from Tesco. I'm currently going through my NG+ and I don't plan to stop playing any time soon, so I definitely recommend this game to you."
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is another high quality Souls game with some minor flaws. The game is most impressive technically - the controls are very smooth and responsive - certainly the best out of the 3 Dark Souls games, and the graphics are a visible upgrade from DS2. The world looks gorgeous, expansive, and detailed, while still maintaining that dark, desolate Souls feeling. The gameplay is very fast-paced compared to DS/DS2, with attacks landing faster and monsters overwhelming you very quickly. Whether you'll like this or not depends on personal preference, but I enjoy the slower combat of DS/DS2. I'm also not a big fan of the travel system which is pretty much the same as Dark Souls 2, and makes the world feel more disconnected. Dark Souls is still the best in the series, but that's simply because any Souls game is such a unique experience that you can never reproduce it after playing it once. Overall though, DS3 successfully brings back the familiar core of the Souls gameplay and setting, while adding enough new things to keep it fresh"
Positive,"Edit: I now retract my previous review, which is listed below. Currently, I recommend the game. It's a great game with lots of replayability, and has been going strong since 2016. I'm glad to see Bamco reinstate family share once again, which is why I gave the game a negative review, seen below.   ""Don't buy this game now. Bandai removed family sharing 4 YEARS after launch to force those who got banned to re purchase the game. Hackers have gotten myself, and others banned btw, by dropping things in your world/running scripts. If they made the ban system ACTUALLY work, i'd say, why not? But as it currently stands, it's just a greedy move on their part to force the community to buy the game again, KNOWING the ban system is flawed. Review bomb the game into oblivion. They don't care about the community, or the people who've been screwed by the way bans work. They just want your $$. And $59 for a 4 year old game that receives zero updates? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAH!"""
Positive,Back when fromsoft could make bosses both hard and fun.
Positive,As someone who played Dark souls 1 and 2 before this one i gotta say... This is A LOT better than the second one i would say this is on level with the first one. Definitely recommended.

Positive,if u havent played darksouls 3 ur fat :^)
Positive,"I've played through all of these games. Dark Souls 3 is a great addition to the franchise. Has the most polish, a very good variety of bosses, classic souls lvling system, and updated visuals. This is the crown jewel on the head of fromsoft. Ds 1 might still be my fav. but it's hard to not have this as a CLOSE second. Well done 9/10"
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is an incredible game and a true hardcore masterpiece. It is a perfect example of inderect storytelling, with a rich and haunting game world, expert voice acting and a beautiful soundtrack to accompany you while you journey through this dark, dieing world. The controls are smooth as silk, and the weapon arts add many new strategies and ways to combat the terrible foes you face. Of the Souls games I have played (not including BloodBorne) I would have to say thatthis one is technically the smoothest, with very helpful features like homeward bones having extra options and many other things. Multiplayer is amazing, and once you get the hang of how the elaborate system works, many awesome experiences await you (except for point down). The game also has amazing replayability and alternate endings to achieve, as well as NPC story lines which all intertwine and that can change how the story will go. Overall, I would recommend this game to Souls fans, lovers of a challenge, and newcomers alike who want to experience the hauntingly beautiful, decaying world of Lothric."

Positive,You can make evil dooers
Positive,"They fixed the servers! Positive review. This is my favorite souls game, and i've played all of them (Including Elden ring). I reccomend it!"
Positive,"This is the end of an amazing trilogy. Each person prefer a different game, but one thing everyone agree is the quality of this one. It's a really well made game that deserves to be played, regardless if you played the other games of the trilogy. If you played the other ones, it's even better. Highly recommend it."
Positive,"My first time playing a dark souls game, I'm a huge fan of RPGs and when dark souls 3 got released I decided to try it out.It's different than other RPGs and sometimes god damn infuriating if you die on a boss you have to run a long way back up to it. there are no checkpoints there is something called ""bonfires"" they serve as some checkpoints but everything respawns when you die or visit a bonfire. The reason I haven't tried the game before is that it has a reputation for being insanely hard and unforgiving. That is mostly true, it is pretty hard yes but if you struggle with a boss or an area you can just grind souls ( souls is the currency in this game you get an x amount of souls each enemy you kill) and level up and then try again. If you still have difficulty with a boss you can summon phantoms to help you out (other players online). Dark Souls is different than most traditional RPGs, gear in this game don't give you extra stats or is upgradeable which for me I personally did not like. But you can upgrade your weapons and infuse them ( infuse is sort of like enchant) One thing that I really didn't like is the lack of story, what I enjoy most in RPGs is the story, the sidequests or if you stumble upon a book which tells another story if you stumble upon a sword hidden deep in the water then finding out why it was there. It does have sidequests but it is impossible to figure out them yourself when you are first playing, you have maybe 3 or 4 sidequests and the story was short and thin I mean really short. I had to do 2 playthroughs to get all the sidequests done and it left me really unsatisfied. The reason I had to do 2 playthroughs is that if you do one action they might leave and you have no idea why. You have to look it up there is no way of knowing when first playing. The music during the boss fights are really cool and amazing, and the boss fights are really satisfying killing a boss for yourself after your 10th try and then seeing them go down is really satisfying. The ending to this game was a short 1-minute cutscene and that's it, there are 3 endings to the game and they are just as short I completed them all every single one of them left me unsatisfied. But despite all that I still like the game very much, the areas are nicely designed and the bosses are really cool I didn't find the game that hard but at times I did struggle. But I do have to admit I do like the more traditional RPGs like the Witcher series."
Positive,"It is a Dark Souls game, and it is more of it. It is more like Dark Souls 1 in its mechanics than Dark Souls 2. Not only that, but there are very memorable moments in the game already, and I have only played 10 hours in. there is also far more lore to this than Dark Souls 2 presented.With that said, there are a lot of reports of game crashes and bugs. So far, I have not encountered any (thankfully) and thus my experience has been free of such issues. I suspect it has something to do with me not upgrading my graphics drivers for some time now.If you have a strong computer that meets the recommended requirements, it is suggested you get this game."
Positive,"Faster paced than the first two games, kind of like Bloodborne gameplay-wise. The level design is more linear than the first game but it still has it's share of optional areas, bosses and items you reach by exploring.The graphics look gorgeous in my opinion and i found myself taking a lot of screenshots, which i never do. I would say the game is kind of easier than the first two games but that's probably because i played them first and gained some experience. However i would not advise people to play this first because then the first two games would feel very clunky and that may turn some people off from them.I really have not much to say about it because the points i made in the review for the first game are mostly valid in this game as well. It's still the good old amazing Dark Souls experience. (Though i would say that i like the first game a lot more)."
Positive,"My friend and I starting playing this a today, and everything was going well, then I summed him into my world, what he hadn't know is that I dry fingered. So in about 30 seconds we had two phantoms ontop of us. The first one was a so called ""Mad pahntom"" and the other was a red. The mad phantom toyed around with us but we did kill them and the red invader. After about 45 minutes, the same ""mad phantom"" invaded us again, this time we left them alone, soon another red invader came into my world and my friend died from him, so I was alone with the mad phantom and the red invader, the mad phantom that I killed previously walked infront of me and blocked the red invader from attacking me. That mad phantom saved my life today, and I will never forget.10/10 I got the one nice mad phantom in Dark Souls 3"

The game feels great and is really immersive with great lore that's fun to try and dig into. Despite that the rating was put down a little bit due to quite a bit of reused textures and some areas felt (just a little) half-assed, though not many felt that way. Great game though, I highly reccomend it; especially if you're souls a fan."
Positive,"Dark Souls III es el tercer y último título de la franquicia emblema de acción cuasi-dungeon crawler en tercera persona de FromSoftware, publicado en 2016 por Bandai Namco y adoptando un ritmo ligeramente más veloz que en títulos anteriores, posiblemente gracias a lo aprendido desarrollando Bloodborne.Es un juego muy reiterativo, otra vez. A grandes rasgos no se diferencia de Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2 y Bloodborne, por tanto vas volver a ver las mismas animaciones, combate metódico, kinestesia, dinámica jugable (relativo a escenarios y enemy placement), multijugador y, en términos generales, el mismo planteamiento. Y esto es importante criticarlo.Sin embargo lo hace todo tan bien que cuesta quejarse. La mística de su fantasía oscura es fascinante y los combates (salvo un par) son un examen de lo aprendido por el camino. Nada de esto es nuevo, ni siquiera los méritos de la ejecución de estos planteamientos, pero eso no le resta valor.Ah, y los DLCs son excelentes, en especial The Ringed City. Muy por encima del juego base.¿En conclusión? Su mayor defecto es ser un derivado y no un juego propio, pero no puedo ignorar la belleza de sus escenarios o la extravagancia de la música o de sus jefes."
Positive,"This game is one of the most intersting ang thoughtfully crafted games out right now that offers you a variety of playstyles that are actually effective and fun to play as. The combat is the closest a game has gotten to recreating the raw emotions and fear one would feel while in a sword fight to the death, it's great. The game world is just as well made, every corner offers new enimies in varied groups, and a fair share of ambushes and traps, and boss battles that make you learn enemy movesets and call on phantom summons to help you fight. It is hard as shit, but if you learn the layout and enemy moves it becomes a task that is more doable and rewardiung to complete. This is a perfect game if you wanna just burn weeks away at a time."
Positive,the best souls after bloodborn
Positive,It's like bloodborne with shields
Positive,"If Dark Souls 2 wasnt fast enough for you maybe Dark Souls 3 is - its like baby between bloodborne & DS2 cutting itself out of the womb with a greatsword enchanted with dark magic essentially. It has fixed lot of the issues i had with Dark Souls 2, such as lack of shops to sell items to, better hub zone, faster combat, better graphics and better multiplayer system, without stupid soul memory system.Dark Souls 3 is actually still rather hard game, but i slightly feel there is more casual elements (Or perhaps the word is convenient) to it like making the game more linear rather than this giant hub where you try to decide where you start (Like in DS2). Playing in multiplayer will drop the difficulty quite much and make it easier for you, if you can´t do it on your own. Also i have to praise the things that they improved on the character creator.    Lot of cool different weapons with different playstyles    Game offers atleast +40h of gameplay along with NewGame+ you probably are bound to get around 100h    Bunch of sidebosses and secrets to unveil    Unforgiving game and offers real challenge    Multiplayer aspect is great and fun    Level design is rather great and you can see the castles and places from highground and the world is connected well in geographical level    The game doesn´t really tell you how to complete the side quests and what decisions to do at certain stages, which forces you to look wiki or google for answers and guides.    You still cant compare the gear you buy from merchants to ones you are wearing right now, its not that hard to do guys :/    Story exists, but its rather hidden on item descriptions, the game does little to nothing to tell you about it and even bosses dont really give any dialogue (With exception of two). However the game really isn´t about the story, atleast not for me    Some Internet issues exist on the PC side of the servers"
Positive,"The finale in the best trilogy you’ll ever play.If you're checking in to see if Dark Souls in general is the kind of game you'd like, you're better off reading the far more comprehensive review of Dark Souls 1, which can be found here: https://steamcommunity.com/id/ninthbelief/recommended/211420/As with the other Dark Souls games, there’s two things that need prefacing before you hop right in to DS3.First, make sure you have a controller available to play on – at the point of writing, between Windows 10 and steam, any last gen and current gen controller can be plugged and played on without any additional setup (unless you’ve messed with controller drivers before). The game is much more enjoyable on a controller and is designed to be played with one.Second, yes, this is one of those trilogies you’re going to want to have played the previous games on. Thankfully, with Dark Souls 1’s remaster and Dark Souls 2’s Scholar of the First Sin release, it’s never been easier to play through the trilogy, and it’s worth every second of your time. Now, on with the review, avoiding story spoilers. As you should have played through the other two games, this one’ll be pretty short, you know what you’re expecting from a Souls game by now.Dark Souls 3 is the final game in the Dark Souls trilogy; it is intended to be the last Dark Souls game, and as a result a lot of the things you see and play through in the game are a result of thousands of years of history culminating at a key point, the time of the Ashen One.Gameplay, in a similar sort of way, is the culmination of all the lessons FromSoftware learned from Demon’s Souls, Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 2, and Bloodborne. An obscene amount of care has been put into making the game feel great to play, and with 2 other in-universe games of content to draw from, there’s tons of familiar and no-so-familiar enemies, friends, weapons, armor, spells, and locations you’ll be visiting throughout your journey. Many of the playstyles people choose for the Dark Souls games have been thoroughly enhanced for Dark Souls 3 – there’s flash sorcery for defending yourself with a blade of pure magic, pyromancy for shoving a flame into someone’s chest and watching them explode, miracles to make your greathammer a Blessed Weapon. The game’s RPG elements are absolutely nuts. All weapons have accompanying “weapon art”, which adds an insane amount of diversity to what is already a mountain of viable options for both PvE and PvP.Dark Souls has never been prettier, partly due to the improvements made to the original DS1 engine for DS3, and also majorly because the locations chosen for DS3 are simply jaw-dropping. Bosses now all have two phases, accompanied by a soundtrack for each – the music as a whole has never been stronger. Motifs across all 3 games are used, leading to some truly awe-inspiring moments, especially during phase changes.Dark Souls 3 treats most of DS2 like the red-headed step child, so there are, I would say, intentional steps away from some design decisions of DS2. Powerstancing is gone and is probably the one most will miss. A more visible change, as you’ll see right from the very start, is that the story is much, much more intertwined with DS1. I personally feel that this is a flaw of the game, but if you’re part of that popular bandwagon that DS2 was literally Hitler and DS1 was the second coming of Christ, you’ll feel pretty at home in DS3.The PvP in this game is my favorite, although there are some long-standing issues that remain systematically even for DS3. Twinking is just as bad as ever, hacking isn’t any more halted than it was in DS2, there’s no reason for a host to progress through a level you’re invading, and running straight away from smeone has absurd power. The arena itself is a blast, I’d say fighting premades with premades in the arenas is some of the most fun I’ve ever had.DLC (and thus the Deluxe Edition) is absolutely worth it, but both are separate from the main story so if you want to complete the base game before you buy it that’s an option available to you.The game is worth your money and time. I’d recommend it to anyone."
Positive,My first souls game and i love it!
Positive,11/10 would be a Warrior of Sunlight again. Praise the sun my dudes.
Positive,"My game of the year, amazingly challenging without being bullshit (Unless you're in the Irithyll dungeon)Great soundtrack, great level design, well written lore, loved it, and im looking forward to the DLC."
Positive,"So the current entry into the souls series. I played Dark Souls before playing Dark Souls III. Let look at how this game and see how it stack up. Story: For those of you new to the series, do not fear that you'll be the only one lost in the lore and story of the game. Most people are. Just know that you are an immortal being destine to die 100s of times. It is you job to hunt down the Lords of Cinder. Just leave it at that, it easier that way...Gameplay: You can use magic, shields, swords, spears, scythes, clubs, crossbows, bows, fists, and etc to fight the various monsters that appear. Use dodge rolls to avoid attacks, shields to try block attacks, or parries to deflect attack and leave enemies open for counters. The way you play is up to you. But you better be prepared to die a lot. Dark Souls have always been notorious causing many deaths to players. In each level you are given bonfires which act as checkpoints and Etus Flask (health/magic potions). You'll find yourself running from bonfire to bonfire, and then going back to explore the area for items and secrets. The enemies are tough and even when you return to past areas with an high level character, those low level enemies can still be a threat. One thing I admire about this game is how enemies can still kill you not matter what level your character is at. As you defeat enemies you earn souls which is the currency for the game, you'll use souls from buying items to leveling up your character stats. But the second you die, you'll lose all the souls your have on you at that point and restart at the last bonfire you found. So heaven help you if you missed a bonfire and had several 100,000s souls on you. This is where the misery of Dark Souls come from. But it's a good misery, it's like being a gambling addict and on a winning streak and letting it ride. Only to lose it all on and say ""I can win it back"". If that wasn't bad enough, you got players who can ""invade"" your game with the only objective of killing you. Not to mention you could go to other players games to defend them from hostile players or assist them in an area or boss fight. What I'm saying is that this game can be tough and leave you pulling your hair out, but FromSoftware have mastered the art of making a game hard, addictive, and satisfying.Final Comments: Dark Souls is an addictive and hard game. The scenery is beautiful and the music perfectly fit the atmosphere of each area. Bosses are epic to look at and present a unique challenge defeat. With players entering your game to help you or kill you; or just leaving trolling messages to make you go to your death. This game is guaranteed hours of fun and heartache.Praise the Sun!"

Positive,Not too hard but still very challenging.
Positive,"build a character, enter the boss, die, respawn, grind souls, leve up, die again, die again on the way, respawn, upgrade weapons, find armor, go to the boss again, kill the boss, continue forward, come to the boss again, die, repeat..."
Positive,Honestly i don't make alot of reviews. And i'm not a hardcore Souls player. But this game is turning me into one its that good! It's so exciting too kill a boss you died so many times on and progress further in this AMAZING dark fantasy game.Honestly give it a go you can even play with friends and fight other players its lots of fun!!
Positive,"A difficult game for new commers and difficult in general with little help to make it easier. However, it is not as complicated as what it looks like from the outside and if a player can beat the difficult entry what you get is a deep, emersive, beautiful game that I would recomend to anyone and nearly everyone. I can say that this is one of my faverouite games and as a newcommer to the series I deeply enjoy it. I highly recommend you get this game especially if you enjoy open world games and RPGs."

Positive,"I will sum up this game by telling you my first Dark Souls experience...I got dark souls 3 and played it yesterday because it was on sale. Never have played a Dark Souls game before, I was vastly under-prepared.I considered picking deprived for my class at first thinking it would be an easy game and that it would make it a bit more challenging, in hindsight it’s a good thing I ended up going with assassin.My friend got the game too and we wanted to play with each other but found out we had to solo the first level to be able to summon another player so I go at that.Going through it the game seems really easy and I consider restarting with a harder class. That didn’t last long as I came up to the boss for the tutorial level.First I try some sneaky stuff and going around him, that didn’t work as you can’t open the door till he is dead. Next I try just rushing him and swinging my sword around, that didn’t work either since I found out I didn’t even start the fight and had to pull a sword out of him to be able to damage him.I pull the sword out and kinda just stand there not know what to expect. He then precedes to hit me, pick me up, throw me across the field, and kill me.I’m slightly irritated but realize that I had no clue what to do and think I’ll do better this time. I go back in there and frantically run around trying to get back to my Souls to recover them. I’m kinda a completionist so I’m not gonna let myself lose any souls. When I finally get my souls back I try fighting him but he’s already gotten me low and I e had to pop a potion or two so I die quite quickly.I repeat this and start getting stuff down, I’m actually able to get to the boss without taking damage consistently. I still get rekt by the boss though.After a hour or so of this grind I’m starting to get the hang of it. Until I realize that’s just not true as he turns into some giant tar monster thing after half health and recks me.I kept going at it for a long while but then something happened. I failed to retrieve me Souls before he killed me. I was furious. I threw my controller and went to make some pizza rolls.When I come back I considered restarting as like a knight since I already lost all my souls and have seen in most Dark Souls clips they are a knight. I ended up deciding against it as my friend reminded me that I have been getting items from the guys I kill leading up to the boss that will give me Souls. My friend had beaten this boss on his third or fourth attempt and was just farming everything before the boss whilst waiting for me so we can do stuff together.I continue to try this fight attempt after attempt and I’ve gotten to the point where I can do the first half of his health bar flawlessly but keep getting killed by the second part. I’m starting to get the hang of it, at least I think I am but in actuality probably still suck. I’m not really used to this type of game since I normally play games like CS:GO, PUBG, overwatch, and Osu!.After about another three or four hours of trying this I’m finally able to do it. I kill him. It’s over. Then I see the bonfire that spawns after killing him and I’m so relieved. I continue on and can finally meet up with my friend.Some of the time I spent failing at that boss my friend spent looking up how to do co-op stuff so he had it all ready. He joins my world and I sigh a sigh of relief as I think I’ll finally have a good chance at doing stuff. Then someone invaded my world, kills us both, and we go to bed.10/10 would get fucked again"
Positive,"Quick background. I have beaten Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2, and Bloodborne. I enjoyed these games, each for different reasons, but now that I have beaten Dark Souls 3 I feel it's the best work by FromSoftware.I was gripped by Dark Souls 3 from the beginning. It's great to see the franchise meet the world of modern AAA production, shedding its repressed PS3 and Xbox 360 derived skin for something wonderfully detailed. Early on the game's influences from past games show in its environment textures, but soon these familiarities were left in past chapters as I explored some of the most breathtaking environments in RPG history. There's great diversity here, and despite the game requiring less time for me to beat than Dark Souls 1 and 2, I felt like I had visited more memorable places.The boss encounters are dynamic, with multiple phases that prevent one strategy from defeating them. I had to adapt to changing conditions, and survive increasingly difficult odds that were the gatekeepers of my success. Some of these bosses had tremendous production value that inspired awe and delight. Each remained at a high standard, preventing any form of loss of momentum.In the case of both regular foe and bosses, enemy design is breathtaking. Enemies don't only look, but sound and behave in a way that brands the game forever in your memory.What I think commonly goes unappreciated by many gamers is how great the gameplay in Dark Souls is. Many complain about the camera system and other peculiarities, and while these hold it back from being perfect, I can't think of another modern RPG that makes me feel more like I'm swinging a massive sword, raining fiery hell on opponents, and clobbering foes into smithereens. It's something that is the result of meticulous work in all facets of production: programming, art, and audio. In addition to the high stakes and merciless of enemies, this tactile gameplay aids in making the somewhat repetitive nature of the combat enjoyable for dozens if not hundreds of hours.Dark Souls 3 isn't the most challenging of the series, and will commonly be compared to Bloodborne in this regard. For this reason hardcore veterans will probably give it a tough spanking. However, what it does exceptionally well is providing a balanced difficulty curve. This game doesn't suffer from the spikes in difficulty like the early games. While some players might see this as a negative, it's something that has required a ton of careful design and testing on FromSoftware's part, and for that it should be commended. Newcomers and returning yet hesitant players are likely to find a welcoming atmosphere, at least for FromSoftware's standards.Traditionally, the end of an RPG adventure means the end of my career with the game. Not in this case. Dark Souls 3 is the first RPG I have ever beaten, and immediately started a new game. You may now find me in the swamps and castles of Lothric tossing down White Soapstones to help other players take down the menacing creatures that inhabit this world.All of the negatives that I can name about Dark Souls 3, from its heavily derived influence from past games and performance issues, fall short of holding it back from being one of my favorite RPGs in history. If you enjoy action RPGs, it's an easy recommendation from me. The only question is a matter of if your PC can handle it, and if not whether or not you have a PS4 or Xbox One."

Positive,Game of the year :)
Positive,I am the worst player of Dark Souls in the entire planet.
Positive,the game is fun
Positive,"Update 2020: I'd probably classify DS3 as one of my favourite games of the decade. If you haven't played it it's absolutely worth it.DS3 is my favourite game of the three Dark Souls games. It feels like they took DS1 and improved all of the gameplay elements, the movement is a lot more fluid and responsive compared to the quad-directional movement of the first game and the fact they got rid of the invicibility frame bullshit of DS2 means fights actually feel fair and rolling is less of a gamble.  In my opinion 3 does everything better than 1 except for the world, it doesn't mesh and flow as easily as the first game's world did but it's still fun to explore and breath-taking at times. Certain areas can be a pain to slog though, Farron Keep in particular isn't very fun but other places are highlights of the series such as Irrythl of the Borreal Valley. The worst problem with DS3 for me is PvP. I don't enjoy PvP or actively take part in it so getting invaded isn't something I look forward to if it weren't for the fact From Software still uses P2P instead of dedicated servers and as such 3/5 invaders are always laggy as hell inflicting hits when they are no where near and never recieving damage from clear strikes that connect. I dislike DS2 with a passion but the ability to burn an effigy to prevent invasion is one thing I wish carried over from it into 3.Dark Souls 3 is a good place to jump into the series if you've never played it before as it's definitely the most polished experience of the 3 games but playing 1 first will definitely allow you to appreciate it more."
Positive,you wont find a game with better gunplay than this
Positive,positive pointsFantastic art design in all components of the gameUnique stage designAtmospheric and captivating environmentsThe best non-linear storytellingThe struggles are getting faster and fasterVery beautiful music
Positive,"The best game in the Dark/Demon Souls & Borne saga, for me.Compared to DS 2, everything is better. Beautiful looking graphic, nice ost, faster, dynamic and less clunky combat system, fair challenge. And there are pyromancers again. I really enjoyed the game. It's like the ultimate hybrid between Souls and Bloodborne.Up to now, 19th May 2022, the PC version servers are still offline. But on PC online servers of Souls games, there are always a lot of cheaters, so not a great loss IMHO.Vote: 9/10p.s. I only played base game, not DLCs. Not yet."
Positive,"I was hesitant to buy this game as there were a lot of reviews stating that the game is extremely hard, yet I bought it anyway and decided to give it a go. What I found was that it was indeed challenging yet addictive, and once I started I found myself wanting to play more and more. The landscapes are beautifully done, and the world has lots of hidden gems to explore. There is a sense of accomplishment for every segment of the game completed. I like the fact that the online community can leave notes for those that will follow to give them clues as how best to approach an upcoming phase.I would definitely recommend this game."

Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is not the perfect game out there, neither in general or when looking at the ""Souls series""However... I feel like Dark Souls 3 is the easiest to start from due to the most refined movement and animations and variety on weapons and their special move sets and unique skills as well as all the bosses challenging you in a different way than the previous one.Now that Elden Ring is out, it's even easier than Dark Souls III as it was made for broader audience.Dark Souls 3 is still really popular to this day and has bunch of active players daily to do co-op with or to invade / get invaded by. :)  (Not sure about this anymore in October 2024)I only wished that there would have been same type of restrictive teleport bonfires as in the first Dark Souls game.(I have no experience on Demon's Souls or Bloodborne)Better than Dark Souls IIBetter than SekiroMy tier list:Dark SoulsElden RingDark Souls IIIDark Souls IISekiro(Have not played Bloodborne or Demon's Souls yet)=Updated on 10th of October 2024="
Positive,"Having 100%'ed this game now I feel this is a good time for a review.TL;DR:Overall, this game is honestly the best game I've played this year. It's better than the games I played last year too - and it managed to pull me away from Overwatch for basically 3 weeks straight, and I'm still not finished with it, even after 280+ hours.Very highly recommended, even for newcomers to the series. In fact,  especially  for newcomers to the series, as this game is probably your best way in to what is most definitely one of the best damn game series ever created.Long(er) version:Dark Souls 3 is the first Souls game I played that I actually enjoyed - I own Dark Souls 1 & 2, and neither of those immediately grabbed me like Dark Souls 3 did. I didn't have to try nearly as hard to start enjoying DS3 as I did the other two games in the series.Because of this, if you are a newcomer to the Souls series, I would highly recommend you play this game first to get a feel for the controls and playstyle of the game, then after completing it, go back and play the older games, which is what I am doing now.As for DS3 itself, I haven't played a game this captivating, both inside and outside the game, in years. The last time a game occupied my everyday thoughts this much was many years ago, back on my old PS3 days with Battlefield 3. I played DS3 for a couple of hours to begin with, and made fair progress. But - the moment I beat the 1st real boss you face, after the ""tutorial"" boss, I was hooked.Every time I put my controller down I was immediately thinking what I was going to do next when I played again. I put 60 hours into this game in my first 2 weeks of owning it - whilst also working full time. Like I said, I haven't played a game that captured me this much in years.The combat system is intuitive, fluid and feels fantastic to play at 60fps. The hitboxes are awesome - a simple search on youtube will reveal to you just how good they are. The rolling thresholds are gone from the old games, so now you can ""fast"" roll at 70% equpid load, rather than the 16% from Dark Souls 1.The graphics are fantastic and very well themed - playing on an Nvidia 770 4GB I can run this game at a solid 60 on high. Walking through one of the later areas of the game that is lit with moonlight looks stunning - you'll know which area I mean when you get there!The story continues from the previous 2 games, and is as deep and fascinating as ever. You can skip the story completely, by not reading item descriptions and skipping the NPC dialogue. But, if you pay attention and spend some time every now and again reading a few things, you'll quickly become immersed in this game (and series') amazingly deep and thorough story. If anything, I recommend you play the older games just to learn the origins of the some of the bosses and items you find in this game. If not, there are many lore videos on youtube, all worth a watch.The PvP is... Well, its Dark Souls, so very competitive and sometimes kinda toxic. There is an established meta Soul Level you can stop levelling once you reach - it is at this level you will experience the most varied and plentiful PvP. Invasions are broken, with the invader being at a huge disadvantage, but these can still be fun from time to time, if you get lucky and invade a good host. If you're looking for good, fair PvP, look up honour duels for this game and try some summoning rather than invading - I enjoy honor duels substantially more than invasions, but it all comes down to what type of a PvP experience you are looking for. Poise is  broken  "" working as intended "", so be careful when using super slow weapons in PvP as enemies with faster weapons will very easily stagger you and get you in a stun lock - not fun at all.The weapons are varied enough to keep you busy for a long time, if you want to learn and use each. Some weapons that were very good from previous games have been completely borked, but there are many other awesome alternatives you can use that are equally as fun. The armor is good with many blast-from-the-pasts from previous games, allowing you to cosplay as your favourite bosses or make some hideous monstrosity wearing only a loincloth giant fat armor.Character creation and customisation is also improved from previous games, allowing you to tweak your character to fairly deep measures. The music - oh man the music. Give the composer a Grammy, please. The boss fights in this game are awesome as they are (well, most anyway..), but the music really takes them to the next level. The music in the forefront of my mind is the track that accompanies the first Lord of Cinder you fight, but all of the tracks are amazing in their own right and perfectly accompany an already fantastic game.Overall, this game is honestly the best game I've played this year. It's better than the games I played last year too - and it managed to pull me away from Overwatch for basically 3 weeks straight.Very highly recommended, even for newcomers to the series. In fact,  especially  for newcomers to the series, as this game is your best way in to what is probably one of the best damn game series ever created."
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is a sendoff for the series. Not only have From Software confirmed that the series is going on a break, but while playing it’s clear that this is the end of the series as we know it. The game constantly references the games that came before it, borrowing visuals from Demon’s Souls, Dark Souls 1 & 2, and Bloodborne. The greatest complaint you can level against Dark Souls 3 is that it doesn’t convey a strong image of its own, as it’s making you think of other games all the time. But as a sendoff for this series of games, that’s perfectly appropriate. I didn’t mind this approach at all, because the quality of execution is From Software at their best.This is probably the most consistently good Souls game yet. For example, in Dark Souls 2 and Bloodborne I felt the quality of boss fights was too uneven, and in Dark Souls 1 some areas of the game felt rushed. In this game though, the minimum level of quality is very high, and the boss fights are better than ever. It presents the sort of challenge I like, where you have to learn to read enemy animations to learn when to dodge or attack. Given that even normal enemies now have more animations than before, regular fights outside of bosses retain a high level of tension and excitement, even after you’ve spent a few hours in the same area. Leveling up can only take you so far, so you’re pretty much forced to patiently learn enemy attack patterns to win consistently. It’s nicely balanced, where it feels fair. Most games like Witcher 3 can often mess up subtle details in how combat works, and add a sense of chaotic sloppiness. I’m talking about things like hit detection, invincibility frames while dodging, how target lock-on works, and so on. The best games make these things predictable and dependable, where your losses feel like your own mistake, and not the system screwing you over. Dark Souls 3 is such a game, where you CAN master it, and it will treat your fairly. As much as people (and Namco) hype the difficulty, it’s really only about on the level of Ninja Gaiden or Devil May Cry on medium. It’s not a cakewalk, but most people should be able to get through this without going nuts. I mean I had more difficulty getting through Uncharted 3 than I did this.When it comes to story, the game is as obtuse as ever at conveying information, as you really have to dig into it to learn anything. Especially at the start of the game you feel starved of information, to an extent you don’t in other games. So it’s more of a slow burn where pieces eventually start falling into place. One disappointment is how there are things that don’t pay off properly in the story. There are things put into the game seemingly because they thought they were cool, and not because the game “is about” those things. So there’s a sense that the game could’ve been even better, had there been more depth to the story here. But I guess we’ll have to settle for it being merely good.Even though the game reuses a lot of assets from earlier From Software titles, it does so with good direction and intent. The world design and layout makes sense, unlike Dark Souls 2 which was more like an amusement park than a world. There you went into a windmill, traveled up an elevator behind a throne room, and ended up at the entrance of a lava mountain land. A mountain which by the way wasn’t visible behind the windmill itself. It was a complete mess. Because Dark Souls 3 only came out a year after Bloodborne, I didn’t dare set my expectations too high, and as a result it consistently exceeded them. This is the kind of Dark Souls sequel you’d hope for after the first game, as it has most of the qualities that made the first game so good. One thing that bugged me is how every location has fixed time of day and weather effects. Every location is tuned for a particular look and mood. This would normally be fine. But because you can teleport everywhere in the world via bonfires, it’s a bit odd to go from a sinister solar eclipse in one place, to a moon lit night in a different location, in the span of just a single load screen. I’m hoping this is something they can improve in future titles with better technology, so that the entire world can change its appearance as you advance through the story.As the final Dark Souls game, this is a great way to end. This is just the amount of game this formula can take before running itself into the ground. Same goes for the tech they’re using, which also feels like its played out its role. For every flaw in the game, there were a hundred more things I thought were just awesome. I had a great time, it didn’t feel its length, and I couldn’t be happier with how it ended."
Positive,"For the third year in a row, the studio has pulled it off, and Dark Souls 3 remains a deep, complicated, fascinating experience. Newcomers can jump in, old fans will experience lots of ties to the previous games both visually and lore wise, and if this is indeed the final Dark Souls game in the series, it went out with its monster arms swinging high! It’s fitting that the end would come like this, not dead and buried but at the pinnacle of its hollowed life."
Positive,10/10thx chu for playing <3
Positive,this game is not really that hard you just  die so many times for  stupid reasons...
Positive,First boss: Easy. No problem.Second Boss: I hate this game. It's screwing my anus from all directions.
Positive,"It's Dark Souls 3. It walks around in the skin of Dark Souls 1 quite a bit as far as areas visited and NPCs, which can be disappointing or nice depending on how you feel. The speed of the combat is closer to Bloodborne, but lacks the rally mechanic and feels a bit out of place as a result, but it's still good Dark Souls combat and the weapon skills add some nice variety to choosing your offhand.Multiplayer servers are currently down due to a severe security vulnerability, but the multiplayer is goofy and fun when it's up."

The pvping is truely horrible most times its a fair fight and sure you can go pvp builds i get that, but maybe work on something too counter the endless amounts of hackers? getting put off by invading or getting invaded by people that cant take damage from anything and therefor just stands there sometimes emoting etc >_>. stil i recommend the game its truely a visual and challanging game with an amazing playthrough!"
Positive,"Can't recommend this game highly enough.-Performance: Well optimised. The engine delivers frames in a beautifully smooth manner, so 40 fps looks more like 45. Does require a 4 core CPU at a decent clock rate to prevent bottlenecking.-Art style: Classic Miyazaki, this is what fans of the original dark souls and bloodborne have been waiting for. Atmospheric and incredibly immersive.-Level design: Complex and interconnected, incredibly enjoyable. So dense that at some stages in the game the scope can be overwhelming, something I haven't experienced in a souls game before. It's a good thing.-Enemies: The enemy AI is intelligent and punishing, but not to a disturbing extent. Patterns vary greatly from boss to boss, and each fight requires the player to learn different tactics.Edit: One downside I have to mention is the texture resolution. It is apparent that the textures have been compressed, likely to allow consoles to be able to handle the game. It would have been nice if they gave us the high definition versions. This is only apparent when you move the camera angle close against the textures, and won't bother most people, but I am a bit of a stickler for this kind of thing. This is especially the case when they have the ability to use high definition textures, but just haven't included them.~ I'm not having any of the controller or crashing issues that some others are, but all I can say is that hang in there and hopefully From Software will address it. Don't let these horrible technical issues put you off what is, and will be a greatly enjoyable experience for you."

Positive,"Далекий ныне 2009 год «растряс» игровую индустрию. Японская игровая студия From Software, ранее известная лишь в узких кругах игрой King's Field, выпускает Demon Souls -- рисковый и нишевый проект, предназначенный для консоли Playstation 3. Одинокий и крайне уязвимый герой, опасные и безжалостные враги, мрак, гниение, отчаяние и невероятно высокий порог вхождения. Все это, вкупе с уникальной ролевой механикой заставила игроков Японии, а после США и Европы влюбиться в эту игру. Почему? Ведь для того, чтобы сделать человека счастливым, нужно у него что-то забрать, а потом вернуть. Demon Souls шла на невиданные для того времени риски, забирая баланс, комфорт и выкидывая вас во враждебную среду без каких либо намеков на разъяснение. Пришел поиграться, пацан?! Ну так играй!Спустя семь лет лет, уже третья номерная часть франшизы становится одним из самых главных релизов в игроиндустрии. Тот Dark Souls, который мы видим сейчас -- это крупный, добротно сколоченный проект и настоящий, в плане идей, сиквел первой части. Игры серии Dark Souls стали уже самостоятельной культурной единицей, которая имеет свою преданную армию мазохистов. Даже автор этого текста начал свой пусть в серии с фразы: «Ты в нее не играл -- не мужик!».Третья часть -- это кульминация, возвращение к корням. Локации: проклятое болото, заколдованные леса, рыцари и замки. Тут же и знакомая фанатам механика - смерть грозит потерей душ, которые выполняют роль как опыта для прокачки, так и валютой; враги мрут относительно быстро, но и расслабляться не стоит -- для главного героя смерть традиционно повсюду. Замешкался -- и тебя уже проглотила тварь, размером с небольшой автомобиль. Таким образом, игра все еще исповедует старый и добрый принцип: одна ошибка -- и ты труп.Так как же прожить дольше? Быть осторожнее, следить за собой и главное -- не стыдиться отступать, дабы перевести дух и собраться с мыслями, сжимая в мокрых ладошках геймпад.Система боев в свою очередь обросла новыми-старыми фишками. На место нерасторопности во второй части пришел темп, который скорее подходит прошлой игре From Software -- Bloodborne. Удары отполированы, мечи наточены, а игровые хитбоксы стали среди фанатов своеобразным жанром порнографии. Также вернулась и система маны из Demon Souls, не забыв обрасти новыми фишками: отные, каждое оружие обладает особенной спобностью, которая поможет выйти из схватки победителем.Все вышеописанное подкреплено сюжетом, правда, нет смысла пересказывать его или раскрывать то, что будет происходить с героем на протяжении игры. Ведь есть негласное правило: игра даст тебе ровно столько сюжета, сколько ты сам у нее возьмешь. Сами события игры все также подаются через описания предметов, врагов, окружение и локации, редкие ролики и, конечно же, диалоги.Это все то, за что любят Dark Souls. Последняя на данный момент номерная часть отправляет вас в долгое путешествие, полное опасностей, жесткости и ненависти. Путешествие, в котором ошибки не прощаются, а феерическая сложность доводит до скрежета зубов. Если вы фанат, если готовы биться несколько часов с боссом, чтобы после победы разрыдаться, рассмеяться и снова рыдать, то не купить эту игру -- все равно что совершить преступление против себя.«YOU DIED»"

Positive,"Fluid combat ☑️Hard bosses ☑️Beauitful scenery ☑️Co-op ☑️PvP ☑️Great DLC ☑️Better than Dark Souls 2 ☑️Overall, Dark Souls 3 is a great game and provides an experience with very little hand holding. While it is a tad expensive while not on sale, it's worth every cent. Once you start playing you'll be sucked into the world and will be in for a long ride."
Positive,Magnificent. Even the fairly linear level design and predictable encounters/traps don't mar the experience over much. It's a game completely comfortable with its' own new ideas and the ones that came before it. PVP is still active and likely the best of the series. A fitting end to the Dark Souls saga... so when's Bloodborne 2?
Positive,"PvE:okay I got to this vantage point where I can see the entire level and using my binoculars I can see enemies 1 2 and 3 located where I can lure them one by one with throwing knives and bottleneck them into a corridor where I can land quick attacks then roll or block and repeat and take almost no damagethen after that there's a tougher enemy but his attacks are very telegraphed and very slow so I should be able to roll through them and get easy attacks in after, if I get hit it's easy to roll away and then healthe boss is pretty challenging but I know he's weak to lightning so I'll infuse my weapon with a gold pine resin and be sure to two-hand since blocking his attacks costs too much stamina and maybe I'll summon a Sunbro so we can split aggro and make it easy to counterattack and heal and that should be itPvP:rollrollrollrollR1R1backstep walk a bit rollrollR1rollR1R1rollbackstep rollR1rollrollweaponartrollroll walk some more rollR2rollrollR1R1rollroll estus rollrollrollR1R1R1roll R2R1rollrollroll weaponartrollrollR1R1R1rollroll estus estus rollrollR1R1rollroll walk a tiny bit more rollrollR1R1R1R1 gesture point down11/10 would play rolling simulator and R1 spamerino again"
Positive,"It is done. I’m done. I finished Dark Souls 3. With all DLCs. Beating all opponents in the game with at least 4 different builds: Pyromancer, Knight (from Deprived), Mage and Cleric. Played for more than 400 hours. Mostly on Linux (flawless!).What to say? Well, I recommended Dark Souls 1 as a masterpiece in the past. And Dark Souls 3? It’s all Dark Souls 1, *but even better*! Dark Souls 3 is simply awesome. The only thing to note is that again, From Software stories are hard to follow and do not unfold. Another point is, that some ways are simply too long. E.g. why do I have to walk back into firelink shrine to the smith to adjust my Estus flask distribution?Yet, the environment, the look & feel, the mechanics are simply some of the best.Sure, it’s hard. Yes, it sometimes makes you cry. But then again, it never really is full unfair. You always have the idea, that you could manage it.A masterpiece.10/10"
Positive,"I recommend Dark Souls to anyone with a spine and anyone who is looking for a game that is actually worth the money you spent for it. It does not hold your hand like all the other games out there. You won't be able to beat it without using your brain unlike most action titles. (batman/tomb raider and so on.) This is the best looking Souls title to date and really shows it in later areas. DS3 employs the same stuff as before just a little faster and with more aggressive monsters. I would say play the first before hand as this one heavily references the lore of the first, that and there is no respect for those who watch videos instead of playing it themselves. As with all Souls games, this one really begins on newgame plus. In fact they are usually designed for you to miss or mess up story arcs and ""quests"" the first time around. So yeah, adapt, ""git gud"" and beat the Dark Souls games or tuck tail and retreat to the safety of your hand holding titles."

Positive,"This has been fixed and there shouldn't be any security issues from the game anymore.-------------------------------------------------------!!!!!WARNING!!!!!!!!There is currently a fatal flaw in the network system of Dark Souls 3 and likely Elden Ring as well, playing online can mean you could be affected by remote code execution (RCE) which can take over your system and steal your banking info and other personal data, not to mention brick your system.If you want to play DS3 or Elden Ring, play them offline until fixed!

Positive,"One of my personal favorite games of all time. This game is very punishing and doesn't expect for you to get through it easily.   Even in just the first ten minutes of the game, you encounter a boss battle, almost serving as a test for who will endure through the rest of the game. There are traps around every corner, powerful enemies that pack huge hits, and many other small things that can tick away at you.The challenge is what makes the game so good, and the feeling of getting through it is rewarding. Many of the locations you travel to have amazing scenery and are based on the first dark souls art style (a lot of the original dark souls locations were based on real life structures). If you can handle the challenge or want one, dark souls is known notoriously for that."
Positive,"TL;DRLong game (If it is your first entry into the Dark souls series it can take you anywhere from 30 (with coop help) to a 100 hours to beat)Great Co-op functionalityLackluster storytelling methods (You get most of the interesting story bits through item pieces and gear sets)Most builds are garbage (Playing a sourcerer or healer is only really prevalent when you're playing co-op) DARK SOULS™ III  is most likely the final entry into the cult following series but it is a great entry nonetheless, where the series felt weak in several regards to previous entries, DARK SOULS III fixes many of these issues and places a great emphasis on a fluid combat experience unlike the previous two games.e.g. dodging and rolling felt very wonky in Dark Souls 1, because you couldn't have omni-directional rolling in a locked-in state, which could lead to many ridiculous deaths, but in the third entry, if you die, you died cause you genuinely sucked major ass.PVP combat can be very annoying at times, but that's mostly because of the nature of Dark Souls combat, many times you simply dodge attacks even though you can hear the sound of you getting hit, or vice versa.Overall, the game is great, and I recommend grabbing it with all the DLC on sale."

Positive,"One of my favourite Souls Series game after Dark Souls I,It's just too beautiful yet brutal to play. PROS One of the best thing about DS III is the graphics, too beautiful and you can even sit on a spot and enjoy the view of the world.I really love the story that happens in DS III. Main storyline, Side Quest storyline and DLC storyline are very interesting and fun.  The lore of the bosses interesting but most of them are sad and sorrow.Lots of interesting weapons and armor in the game. There are some weapons that are specially designed for PVP, and using off meta weapons against player will surprise them. There are not best weapons for PVE since you can use any weapon you like against them. Fashion > Defence, and DS III provide lots of badass armor for player and you can build any cosplay you like.Souls games always contain rolling and dodging, It's combat is just too fun for me. You can level up to Lv802, switching playstyle as you wish, and rebirth(respec/relocate) up to 5 times per character. Feels good to parrying and backstabing enemies.  CONS The only bad things I found in DS III is PVP. The delay in PVP is very sucks since sometimes you thought you dodge the attack but it hit you anyway. Sometimes you see enemy player sliding towards you instead of running. Really hope FROM could fix this issue. Invasion is not fun anymore. Most of the time they just keep running away from you and waste your time. Even invaders themself also keeps running away. But I still love the game anyway, just can't stop playing it. Definitely recommend to anyone out there who loves RPG. 9.9/10"
Positive,"What can I say about Dark Souls that hasn't already been said?The world is exquisitely well crafted and almost always breathtakingly beautiful yet bone-chillingly haunting.The combat is extraordinarily well designed and sometimes absurdly challenging but never remotely unfair.The story is expertly woven and incredibly deep but never spelled out or in your face. You have to find the pieces on your own, in every aspect of this fascinating experience.Take the plunge, it's a journey you will never forget."
Positive,"Dark Souls III is a solid addition to the series. It does seem to wallow in itself from time to time, leaning heavily on referencing past installments but I think that’s heavily tied into the theme and purpose of this iteration. It’s a definite treat for fans of the series as it’s more of the same but with enough novelty to keep them invested and it’s a bit more accessible and with a more gradual difficulty curve so new players don’t feel alienated. The only thing that remains for me to do right now is to finish the game and then try to remember what life was like before. Oh yes, and to git gud.Full Review Here: http://pressa2join.com/reviews/dark-souls-iii-review"
Positive,"I gave up on  a class 15 min in becuase I kept dying to enemies I had already defeated. Next class breezed through those enemies and got crushed by the boss, BUT, I noticed the boss is better to fight at a range for the second half of his life then the first. So went back to first charecter and I have now doubled my level since then. So baisically what I'm saying is. this is the Dark Souls we know and love!This game is awesome 4/5 its alot like the originals but adds so much more depth to the environments, the story has a little better hook for me, and as a whole a lot of fun.Prepare to Die!"

Positive,"Probably the best game I have ever played.It's challenging! Yes, it feels bad when you die 30-40 times to a single boss, but it just builds towards the reward of killing him/her. These moments of great pride and excitement upon completing a challenge are just priceless. Graphics are beautiful and artistically it's very creative/weird. Bosses are so cool and fun. Music is insanely good. It has some replayability too, but nothing special in my opinion. My first playthrough took around 40-50 hours.The negatives: Random PVP is not my cup of tea, but it isn't that bad, because it's easy to avoid (don't use ember or simply enter the boss room to remove the invaders). Co-op is super clunky to do and annoying, but honestly - it's bad to do it. Co-op just trivializes the game so much and ruins it. Same with summoning NPCs (phantoms). I would strongly recommend - DO NOT DO IT! Play the game completely solo, without summoning phantoms. I personally did my first playthrough without phantoms or people AND an ultra greatsword. It was very hard at times, but so satisfying.Overall, worth every cent!"

Positive,"I don't even know where to begin with this game, but of course I recommend it. Fromsoft's most recent addition to the Dark Souls series carries over the high standard of visuals and amplifies it tenfold, this game looks gorgeous. It was an absolute blast traversing each of the environments, and I liked how most enemies thematically match with the locales they are placed in. The bosses in this game are some of my favourite out of the whole series, from the elegance of the Dancer to the aggression of Sullyvahn, every moment was filled with a tense urgency, even some of the easier bosses hold a potent threat if you happen to misstep. The game maintains the unforgiving-yet-not-unfair nature to the gameplay, it still provides a good challenge for veteran players, however, streamlined mechanics and simplified navigation make it a good way for new players to ease their way in to the series. On the subject of the mechanics, you can tell that the game took some cues from Bloodborne, DS3's combat feels pretty fast paced compared to the other Souls games, mind you, it's still wrong to have a blatant disregard for strategic engagement. The faster pace could just be due to better optimisation and refined mechanics, whether it's a good thing or a bad thing is entirely subjective, some people prefer the clunky charm of the first DS and that's fine. Be sure to get your summon sign placed down and ember yourself up cos this game is really fun with friends, cooperative play is beneficial for both easing difficulty and farming souls, as well as sharing insight with players that might not know a lot about the games hidden intricacies. My favourite part of this game as with every other FromSoft Souls game is the delivery of the lore through item descriptions, inscriptions within the environments and employment of show-don't-tell methods, and the mellow yet empowering orchestra makes for a fitting soundtrack to accompany your entire journey. Last good thing I wanna mention is the more streamlined navigation of the menus, makes it easier than ever for those true to the Fashion-Souls way to navigate all the gear you'll end up acquiring. Whilst I have a lot of good things to say about the game, I don't wanna be positively biased, so here are some things I personally didn't like. The combat could be a put-off to those who prefer DS1 due to the less authentically sluggish feel, like I said, this game took more cues from Bloodborne, giving the character a separate levelling branch for equip-load also seemed a little unecessary. Another hit-or-miss feature is the abundance of fanservice, whilst it's fun for the vets to see returning mechanics and NPCs/enemies, it did start to feel a little distracting at times, but this is another entirely subjective critique.  The only other qualms I had was the less intricate connection of each part of the world, sections of each area felt a lot more linear and was more about creating loops than actually weaving each zone together (it's massively outshined by the interconnection of DS1), my last qualm is that some of the NPC side quests were a little too obscure, so those going for a completion run should beware, whilst I'd usually advise against guides, if you think you've missed major points in a characters quest then it wouldn't hurt to look up a walkthrough since some of the requirements are pretty damn easy to miss out on. Overall, I had a lot of fun, playing through with my friend, discovering all the optional areas and bosses which despite having the choice of skipping them entirely still have a staggering amount of detail poured into them, it truly is incredible seeing the craftsmanship of the environments and tone. FromSoft, you did not disappoint. Now to dig my claws into the DLCs...*ENDGAME SPOILER, STOP READING NOW IF YOU WISH TO AVOID*The final boss being an emalgamation of the DS1 base classes with mechanics carried over from the first Chosen Undead in the form of the Soul Of Cinder was an incredible final boss to finish the series, and brings the whole story full-circle, having his second phase inherit the moveset of Gwyn, the final boss of the first Dark Souls, was a moving moment as the remastered theme kicked in, it was a brilliant end to a brilliant series and honestly I can't think of any way they could've made it better."
Positive,Perfect game for masochists.10/10 would be beat again.git gud
Positive,"One of the most amazing franchises I've ever had the pleasure to get into. Must play. Beautiful as an art piece, and as a game."
Positive,"I highly recommend this game, I have already beaten this game multiple times on PS4, and have nearly 200 hours on my character, and that didnt stop me from buying it here too.I know the game seems really hard (especially now when everything is ""the Dark Souls of something""). But if you rise up to the challenge you will get one of the best experiences in gaming. It is my personal favorite game of all time, so if you are thinking about buying it, I assure you you wont be disappointed.10/10 Would die again"
Positive,"(as of 78 hours playtime)This game is an absolute gem, and the perfect way to close the Dark Souls series. I truly don't believe From Software could've done it any better. Playing it for the 3rd time round, still absolutely adore this game <3Pro's Addictively good questline Flexible levelling system Best bosses in the series (in my opinion) Great travelling system Awesome integration of shortcuts and checkpoints Genius level design Fantastic use of optional areas Sexual levels of nostalgiaCon'sSomewhat frequent frame dropsSometimes underwhelming boss fightsThat's literally f*cking it go buy it nowEven if you've never played a Dark Souls game before (including bloodborne/demon souls), you will adore this game to bits if you have the courage and determination to keep going. Some may say it's ""too difficult"", but then those people are usually the ones that just came from CSGO and expect everything to be handed to them.My Verdict - 9.7/10"
Positive,"singleplayer is good.i like the detailed animations and fluid movement like in bloodborne.the music at boss fights is super epic.9/10 so farmultiplayer is beyond bad.its so sad that fromsoftware did not learn anything. ""cross-region on/off"" stll means ""japan on/off"".i did 4 invasion and i fought against ppl from china, canada, australia and china again. (and i am from sauerkrautland)the lags were ~1-2sec delay.i would rather search for 5 min and get a decent connection than having delays like this.makes me rly sad to see that pvp is even worse than in ds2.0/10 from did either not learn or they dont care for their non japanese fanbase.conclusion:if you buy DS3 buy it for the singleplayer."
Positive,"I played a few hours and I think I can say a few words. :^)  This game is extremely worth it even for the full price. If it's on sale don't think, don't ask reddit is it worth, just buy it.  This game has something for everyone. It is difficult at first, very much so but with time you learn to appreciate the pacing, the lore and story told within descriptions of items and placement of enemies. You'll discover how and why locations look how they do with vaatividyas videos and end up contemplating who's the real vilain and which ending is really the good one. After all that, and if you chose to play online (which is great for coop with buddies and strangers alike) you'll be greeted by red and purple spirits. They might guide you, give you gifts or just plain murder you. But this game is about not giving up, as all dark souls are. ""There is no game over screen, only 'you died' screen"".    So if you chose to join. You might end up like me. Randomly picking up the game on sale, falling in love with it and wasting more than a thousand hours of your life invading lonely hosts and 4 man gank squads alike. If you take your first step into lothric. I'll be there waiting. Kill me and point me down if it helps, I won't stop :^)."
Positive,"Game is Good...1. Solid movement Clear and defined.2. high pace and tension.3. customization keeps game very replayable.4. Release high levels of dopamine after defeating bosses.5. PVP is awesome and fluid really fun.However, this game is BS even for dark souls...1. Every small enemy is a joke, and all the large enemies you should run away from.          a. small enemies trap you into constant stunlock and then death          b. large enemies have Hyper armor and will tank though most hits and postpone attacks, as well as drop little souls...               very annoying.2. (Up above) PVE gets boring and almost every level plays out the same... run to the finish and grab nesesary items...3. Bosses will either kill you in one fell BS swoop becuz you said in your head ""can we please hurry this up"" and went for 3 attacks insrtead of the normal two.4. HYPER ARMOR is retarded remove it please. it turns every PVP encounter with a greatsword into a stamina guessing game with lucky hits thrown in. :))))))5. Faith and Intelligence spells are ripperoni unless ganking... (PVP only)6. Gankers you never have the privilege to point down... Its just like bruh come on 3v1 really and i suck at this game?          a. if invaders taunt or throw dung pies that aSS is all game boy hecking lay him with the spin point down.7. For the love of God please make titanite chunks have a higher drop rate...8. King of storms, fight with camera not boss, fire move is close to undodgebale.9. So many fighter .pl wannabes.10. Why do i get one attempt with siegward in dark souls 1, but unlimited when helping anri fight Aldrich or sirris fight her ganked victims. Punishment???11. Holy shnikes dying is hella nnoying and I only seem to die when i have a junk ton of souls... (personal)12. Why do Dlc weapons have such cool and unique weapon arts?I just want titantie chunks man... give me them plez...all statements earlier said are true based on expierence... if you disagree suck my wiener."
Positive,"What will I say after completing Dark Souls 3? The game is excellent, but I do not recommend it to all fans of ""light fantasy"". This game suppresses the atmosphere of a dark and dying world, where any story can end in your tears. Complexity is the hallmark of the SOULS series. (Network components are high, graphics are good, recommend to anyone who wants to immerse themselves in the dark story of dark souls .... ^ _ ^"
Positive,"After Spending a few months playing this game i have come to many different conclusions. I love this game!It's beautiful and gob-smacking, the animations are fluid and quick. Areas are challenging if you don't know what you are doing and its brilliant, i just simply cannot get enough of this game. The boss's are memorable, so are the areas which  you can explore, the voice acting is amazing and the music, it's an orgasm for the ears. It's an absolute breathtaking game and i love it.Although it may be an epic game and awesome to play, i do have some concerns...My problem is invasions, and i know, i know, you're going to say ""Pvp isn't suppose to be fair."" and all that crap but there are genuine problems that a majority of you will agree on, I have some ideas on how it should be.The whole point of invasions are suppose to be fun and enjoyable, but it's facing more then 2-3 people if you're the invader, okay, i can agree with that if you are desperate for help but really that many people is simply not needed, at all, the whole point of the invasion system should be to enhance the difficulty for said host, with 2-3+ people, where is the challenge? The souls series are based off challenging difficulty and with that many people there might as well be an ""easy mode""... or even a ""Beginner mode""When you, the invader are faced up with them people with 3+ phantom, you got no backup you may as well crystal out. Not only that but all the people at said area and they just linger around the bonfire, with your 2-4 bodyguards with their heads up the hosts ass. Overall i can forgive all that, that's right, Invasions ain't suppose to be fair, and you should have to fight at least the host +1, maybe +2  phantom('s) (If you can play smart.), BUT, (Now this is what really gets to me!). If you kill the phantoms, the host has the power to summon them an unlimited amount of times and chooses not to fight you at all without a helper, which is unbelieveably stupid, and down right pethetic, It's really bad game design, expecialy when the host is 1) A higher level then you. 2) Has more heals then you. 3) Way more better then you at Pvp 4) has 30% more health then you. It renders the invasion system completely useless and not fun at all. DarkSouls2 was more forgiving in this matter, if that phantom died, you COULD NOT summon that same guy again untill either you died or you rested at the bonfire, yeah sure it resetted the NPC's but that was but a small price to pay for the back up you needed, and looking back, i loved that feature. Back to DarkSouls3, this time the wolf covinant, and the aldrich covinant, they are awesome don't get me wrong, but when im playing solo trying to make my way through (This has happened to me loads of times.) i get 2-3 watchdogs or aldrich faithful invade me, when you say ""Invasions ain't suppose to be fair"" you actualy being a hypocrite. Oh the Irony. The point of invasions is to have fun and really, it's not... In DarkSouls2 there was always the suspence of the possiblility to be invaded, you were always on edge and alert, and you needed to be prepared and DarkSouls3 takes that brilliant, brilliant mechanic, and takes a shit on it, then proceeds to smother that shit over it's face while laughing histericaly...Overall It's a fantastic game and beautiful, it's an absolute thumbs up for me, it's not perfect but with certain fix's, it's really has the potential to be perfect. I can almost taste how perfect it would be if the invasion system wasn't as flawed."
Positive,The combat is just as fluid as your tears will be.
Positive,Not as hard as people say; or atleast i was just having a lot of fun and not realizing i was dying.
Positive,"I can't recommend this game highly enough. It's genuinely, in my opinion, one of the best games of the past decade. It is punishing but fair. It makes every little accomplishment feel amazing. The challenge of this game is part of what makes it so fun. You gradually learn how to fight, and progress from struggling to fight little dogs to killing literal gods. The atmosphere is so dense and rich. The game itself looks amazing (look up screenshots of Irithyll of the Boreal Valley for some stunning examples). Each region has its own distinct enemies and style, most of which are engaging and enjoyable. (Except the Irithyll Dungeon with those stupid jailers -_- )The story and plot is very bleak and dark, but in a refreshing and captivating way. It isn't thrust in your face like many modern titles do. It's dripped to you in subtle little hints in such a way that you gradually piece together what is happening in this miserable world you find yourself in. Being able to pick up on little hints rather than having a massive sign with neon lights pointing at every plot point is a smart way to reward exploration, and really helped me to immerse myself in the world.Compared to DS1, it feels more responsive, less buggy, more pretty and more well designed overall. One gripe is it is definitely slightly more linear than previous titles in the series, but that is in a way a trade off, as this game is able to balance itself far better than DS1 was (particularly in the end game) and doesn't have a massive drop off in quality at any points.It's freaking great, not a tonne more I can really say at this stage.Jeez dude just play the game already I'm gushing far too much."
Positive,This game can be fun when you have a functioning controller.
Positive,Praise the sun!
Positive,"One of the best games of all time, for me this is the second best FromSoftware's game right after DS1"
Positive,"Not as hard as people make it out to be, very fun and addicting. This game is a genuine sign saying get good or don't play. You can't just blow through everything with a really overpowered build (well, you probably can. I just haven't seen it) This game genuinely makes you think and play your cards right so that you can win. That being said, I'm addicted to this shit. 10/10"
Positive,"A great game, like all the previous Souls/Borne games. Actually the first game where I was able to put together a good part of the story without help from VaatiVidya (and that's kinda saying something as I love story, but want it kinda thrown in my face just enough that I'll look for the rest if it really intrigues me). Combat is just as fluid as ever (if not more so). By and By worth a buy! Bought the season pass edition (whatever it's called) 3 weeks before the game released TWICE!! (one for me and the other for a friend). Still worth every penny and I would still throw them more (not much more considering I did pay 170ish dollars but more still the same.) One of the few games I have actually enjoyed and continued to play till the very end (just not the DLC's yet because 600 steam games and I've only beaten like 30 of em.). Also this game made me cry when it not only killed one of my favorite NPC's, and yet another as I watched in horror (on my first play through of course) as my character in a cutscene killed my other favorite NPC. Both of which caused me to immediately play through the game a second time to make sure they lived (after looking at a guide of course ;)). Now everyone has had their (sorta) happy ending and FromSoftware has all my money. Thanks FROM!!!!"

Positive,Everything Dark Souls 2 should have been.
Positive,A Miyazaki Masterpiece.
Positive,"So I boot up my eMachine W3653 and after waiting 15 minutes for steam to load I see that the sequel to my favorite game of all time DARK SOULS II was just released, DARK SOULS III, directed by the great Miyazaki himself.  Now I could tell from the trailer that it's got swords, armor, and enemies, and Kiki's Delivery Service just happens to be my favorite animated film of all time, so I knew I had to check it out. So I download the game, open it up, and, just wow... It's so great. The title screen is wonderful. It's similar in style to the title screens of it's two predecessors, however with a genius addition - three ""I""s follow the titular ""DARK SOULS"" (I believe that this is to represent that it is the third game in the series).In DARK SOULS III you again strike out as the Chosen Unkindled Curse Bearer. You have the ability to choose a class at the beginning of the game, which affects what armor you start out with. The design of this is truly genius. Miyazaki has tailored each class such that their abilities reflect the difficulty you wish to play the game at. At the moment, there are two classes you can play as - Knight and Deprived. Perhaps Miyazaki will develop more classes and add them as DLC? As you venture through the world of Lordran once again, you will meet old friends, and old enemies. Siegmeyer of Catarina, Andre the Giant Smith, and Patches (we all hate him!) all return to assist you on your quest to slay the Lords of Cinder.DARK SOULS III is undoubtedly the most difficult game in the series. After 6 hours of play, I finally arrived at the games second boss - The Winged Knight. This big boy wields a ""Winged Knight Halberd"" (Which he has a 10% chance of dropping) and is really large and hits really hard. My advice? Don't get hit by this enemy. Instead, avoid his attacks and hit him until his poise breaks (stunned). Now continue hitting him. If you're lucky, he will die before he can hit you enough to kill you. Remember, in DARK SOULS, your fate is in luck's hands.DARK SOULS III has covenants. Something that this entry of the SOULS series is seriously lacking is the Mask of the Father and the Giants set. These two armors are iconic to the series (as the Chosen Undead is shown wearing them on many promotional materials) and I think that it is a real shame that they have been left out. (P.S. The Legend will never die! (laugh out loud))In conclusion, DARK SOULS III is a great game. I personally don't like it, and couldn't recommend it to any of my friends, but it is definitely one of the best and most enjoyable games of all time. This is due to it's hard difficulty, and because my favorite Twitch Streamer Lobos Jr. plays it. (TLDR: 10/10)"
Positive,"DIed, summoned sun bros, sat around the born fire, got invaded, went camping, end of story."
Positive,just got past the tutorial
Positive,"Game is a lot of fun.And now you've got mods when you feel like the base game has got nothing left for you, i think for me that was around the 1300h mark. Just make sure to boot the game starts in offline mode, can be done in the settings of DS3. I am unsure if setting Steam to offline will work on its own."

Positive,"Taking its cues from Bloodborne, the speed of play has been dramatically increased in this latest Dark Souls outing and combat is a lot more stressful and punishing than it was in the first two games too. Relative to a series renowned for its challenge, the earlier levels contribute to a fairly reasonable difficulty curve, but souls (the currency that allows a player to gain items and improve their character's abilities) are kept in short supply and the hub area where they can be spent is locked away until a player ""graduates"" from the first boss fight.Whereas the bosses are comparable to previous games in terms of difficulty, they're almost upstaged by the regular enemies who attack with heightened speed and aggression at every opportunity. Long gone are the lumbering knights and club-wielding underlings of Dark Souls II, here you're frequently accosted by bizarre horrors including crystalline beasts, demented stat-reducing jailers, and crazed demons that will literally try to rip your character's head off!Aside from new features like the smart skill system and some welcome changes to how magic behaves, Dark Souls III is very reminiscent of past games in the series. The story concerns the four Lords of Cinder whose departure has plunged the cursed Kingdom of Lothric into chaos. Players take on the mantle of the Ashen One and must return the Lords - or at least their heads - to their ""moulding thrones"" so that the undead curse can be averted once and for all.Fans of the series will be glad to know that Dark Souls III does not sell out on the qualities that have made it so successful and admired up until now. The gameplay is still tense, the environments still inspire awe, and the fragmented tapestry that makes up the game's narrative will take many hours of decrypting in order to knit together.There are elements that feel a bit tired; it's only natural after so many sequels, but it's commendable how successful FromSoftware has been in trying to keep the series feeling fresh and exciting. The boss battles are an especially good example of this. Improving on the mediocre confrontations that characterized much of Dark Souls II, here the actual number of bosses is reduced in favour of providing more honed and interesting confrontations. Dark Souls III has bosses that set a new high for the series and each one is very different in look and execution. The variety here is bolstered by several good commonalities including interesting arena design, superb backing music, and dynamic move sets.Dark Souls III does well to introduce some circuitous level design towards the end and even though the more linear approach in the first half is focused and effective, it's fair to say that those expecting another vast and interconnected world like the one from Dark Souls are probably going to feel a tinge of disappointment. That's not to say that this is a small game though as you'll find Lothric to be a huge place that's absolutely brimming with enemies to slay and secrets to find. It may not be as vast as Drangleic was in Dark Souls II, but Lothric does feel more packed with content and it's a rare area indeed that doesn't feature a satisfying verticality to it.In terms of this PC version specifically, Dark Souls III is a success beyond words when compared to the ports of previous entries. The 60FPS action is fluid, the graphics are sharp, and the loading screens are so short that item descriptions will disappear before you can even finish reading them! Conversely though, there is a tendency for the game to pause slightly when picking up items and it sometimes has trouble streaming certain areas; blocking them off behind unsightly fog barriers until they finish loading. The environments are still well designed - you can expect to see plenty of ""gorgeous views ahead"" - although the game as a whole is rather grey in appearance and it can be easy to miss areas and NPCs because of how well they blend into their surroundings.My time with the PC version was smooth sailing on the whole though and I can only hope that future software updates help those players who have reported crashes and related bugs during the launch period.In terms of performance, it's important to state how well this game plays with regards to its multiplayer too. Whilst Dark Souls was more experimental and arguably ill-suited to serious cooperative/competitive play, the series as a whole has always been too good not to share and FromSoftware have taken steps to further improve the network code for this new release. Players can still summon human-controlled phantoms to assist in clearing out levels and bosses and the number of permitted players in each host's world has been boosted for more team-based insanity than ever before.Multiplayer has been a very strong focus for FromSoftware this time around and it really shows. The disastrous soul memory feature from Dark Souls II has been axed in favour of simple matchmaking rules (including a glorious password system for friends) that eliminate a lot of the undue frustration associated with summoning other players. The realms of PvP and PvE feel closely intertwined in Dark Souls III. Estus healing is quicker, combat is more nuanced, and you'll likely find a deluge of summoning signs and invaders in every new area that you visit.Whether they're the hostile red phantoms that want nothing more than to kill you, the gold phantoms that want to earn medals for helping you, or the mysterious purple phantoms (God only knows what they want) entering your world, the potential for player interaction is off the charts.FromSoftware has acted to make sure that players feel more secure in general though and Dark Souls III seems to be more protective of its PvE players as a result. Likely an attempt to curb trolling, red phantoms seem to be regularly, if not exclusively matched up with ""victims"" who have already summoned helpers into their world. In this way it seems that player invasions have lost some their non-hardcore appeal as a red phantom will frequently find themselves staring down multiple foes instead of just one. There are fewer easy kills to be had in this game that's for sure.There are signs of franchise fatigue, most noticeably in the number of callbacks and references to previous games in the series. At times the setting in Dark Souls III risks losing its sense of identity and becoming that of a mere nod to the first Dark Souls. Whilst a subtle musical cue or visual reference does hit the mark from time to time, there are too many revelations in this game that failed to surprise me because I found it easy to anticipate what was going to be another tribute.It's impossible to feel unsatisfied with Dark Souls III as a complete package though and you can easily expect a 50+ hour initial playthrough if you're committed to searching every nook and cranny the game has to offer. The game has its lesser points, but none of them are severe enough to stop it from being a fitting end to what is perhaps the greatest trilogy of video games there has ever been.Much like the motif of fire and embers; a visual that permeates the game's bosses and locations as much as it does your player character, there's a certain warmth about Dark Souls III. It's a familiar resplendence found in the sweaty grip of the controller after slaying a towering boss, so too is it found in the game's deep backstory, its beautiful environments and the mystery behind its many secrets and hidden endings. The developers may have gotten a little nostalgic for this entry sure, but I'll be damned if they didn't earn the indulgence.Read the full review at my blog »[www.celjaded.com]"

Positive,"""Long may the sun shine!""Dark Souls is based around the 'Souls'and such as a cycle between the Flame and Dark.""But then there was Fire.And with Fire, came Disparity. Heat and Dark. Then, from the Dark,They came, and found the Souls of Lords within the flame""-As Dark Souls NarratorThere were four kings(Gwyn the Lord of Sunlight;Gravelord Nito;The Witch of Izalith and The Furtive Pygmy) divided the Original Flame(Souls) as four parts.The Sunlight lord Gwyn created the most of thunder magic miracles and sacrificed himself to link the fire and continued the light amount 1000 years. Gravelord Nito created a cemetery world and he lived in there. In order to keep this world,Nito had to devide Death Souls power and thats the reason Nito is weak personally. The Witch of Izalith attempted to duplicate the First Flame from a soul, but instead created a distorted being of Chaos and Fire. Its power formed a bed of life which would become the source of all demons in the end.The Furtive Pygmy more likes human's ancestor (Pygmy in Dark Souls but Normal people in real life).Pygmy gained the 'Dark Souls' and sealed a part of Dark Souls in the Ringed City.'Fire is fading and you have to return the five Lords of Cinder to their rightful thrones in order to link the fire once more.'Overall, the Dark SoulsIII is about the kingdom of Lothric story and you journey through the kingdom of Lothric. As the Fire Keeper said in the end:'I am a Fire Keeper. I tend to the flame, and tend to thee. The Lords have left their thrones, and must be deliver'd to them. To this end, I am at your side.'I gave up the flame and dark world was coming but i still owned the Fire Keeper(Worth enough).Rating:9/10"
Positive,"Excellent introduction for players new to the Souls series. A healthy mixture of gimmick bosses and challenging fights, dozens of secrets, character questlines, lots of different unique and interesting architecture, scenery, weapons, fight styles. Coupled with a lively PvP scene and a rock solid system for bringing in friends to help you fight make DS3 a thrilling and frustrating must-have. Usually sells for fifteen USD at major sales. If you've ever wondered if you'll like Souls games, this is the one to start it with. Even myself, being someone who primarily only plays FPS games, bullethells, and sidescrollers thoroughly enjoyed my time spent."

Positive,SOULS NEVER DIEYOU DIED
Positive,"Such a great game.You pick up the controller while thinking about playing for a few hours, maybe kill a boss or two. Next thing you know, it's been 7 hours and you've spent most of your day playing the game. It's easily the best game in the Souls series so far. Excluding Bloodborne of course, can't beat that, atleast until the expansions for DSIII arrive, we'll see about that then. The game does have it's flaws of course (without going too much into them) but FromSoft has been doing a pretty decent job on countering them.Do you love RPGs?Do you love atmospheric fanstasy/dark fantasy settings?Do you love to challenge yourself?If yes, then this game is definitely for you."
Positive,"Insanely good installation of one of the best games I've ever played.Although I have some major gripes with major components of the game (The implementation of the poise stat, invading resulting in ganks 90% of the time) the PvE component is stellar. Lots of references to the original Dark Souls game, switching covenants on the fly, weapon arts, password matchmaking, fun weapons, all of this makes the game fantastic due to fresh gameplay and improved coop capabilities.Before buying this I recommend starting from the original dark souls and playing each game in order. If you have a PS3, I'm sure playing Demon's Souls would be worthwhile"
Positive,dark souls 3 is the last game of the dark souls franchise the first game was perfect and it is my favorite game of all time but this game is not quite good and dont get me wrong if I havent already mastered dark souls 1 this game would be my favorite game of all time so lets first start with the bad things and compare it with the first game------bad things------1- the game is so linear first game had the perfect map there were so many ways start and end the game but this game is literally a straight line2- the areas problem with the areas is that they suck (most of them) they are not even fun to play first game however had some of the best areas in gaming history ------good things------1- pvp damn the pvp is fun2- new fast and fluid mechanicsah yes the first game needs a remaster with these3- bosses bosses are really and I mean really well designed especially friede and soul of cinder (plin plin plon)4- 2nd dlc ringed city5- drakeblood greatswordits literally the best weapon and no one uses it6- dex builds in the first game dex builds were too weak but they fixed it in this one___so thats it I think its really worth the price but the first game was definetly better I will recommend this game to everyone

Positive,"Many think this game is unfair, that it is impossibly hard. I had never played a Dark Souls game, or anything this hard before. It takes time, but even a complete noob can catch on. Took about 20 hours, but I can tell I'm getting better. Learn something from ever time you die. Try something new every time you re-spawn, if something works remember it. The devs probably intended you to fight the enemy in exactly that way. The combat is some of the best I've seen in an RPG. It's depth rivals or surpasses 2.5D fighting games - games that rely solely on their combat mechanics and offer little else. If you haven't found much depth to the combat you haven't looked hard enough. Do your research! Environment is jaw dropping on max settings at 2k - 4k. But, even an GTX 1060 or an RX580 (any GB version) can run this game at max settings on 2k. Frame rates are stable 60-50 fps. I'm very impressed.  When I can save up the money, I will buy the DLC."

Positive,"DARK SOULS™ III = GOTY 2016, and literally the best Dark Souls game imo. I really enjoyed the dynamism of gameplay compared to the previous ones in the series, and there are so many memorable bosses (my god, the Dancer of the Boreal Valley). Don't hesitate to start with this one if you don't like the first Dark Souls, you will do them later anyway. Also, prepare to GitGud!"
Positive,"I'll be rating the product on five categories which will then be averaged for a final score.Dark Souls 3 is the continuation of the Souls series into its final chapter. For those that don't know, Souls is a difficult series that follows the story of an undead individual trying to link the fire.Dark Souls III's graphics, to be honest, can only be described in one word. Breathtaking. You'll be whisked away to endless vistas of mountainous beauty, gothic cathedrals glinting under the light of a pearlescent moon, and sharp crags jutting out from the dusty ground. The graphics are fucking amazing. The lighting and atmosphere produced by this game is nearly unrivaled and the artstyle is stupidly good. Coherent and immersive on a scale only seen in masterpieces.4.5/5The gameplay of Souls can't really be simplified down to a mere paragraph as it is extraordinarily rich. However, note this: You WILL die. A lot. It doesn't detract from the experience whatsoever though- it rather enhances it. Each death is a lesson and you learn a little more each time you die. The combat in Dark Souls 3 follows a similar formula as the other games except there are hints of Bloodborne's faster pace here and there. It's pretty damn glorious to be honest and the many weapons and spells available have varied movesets and weapon arts that make it feel entirely different each time you swap out your build. Overall pretty fucking amazing gameplay. The lore is immersive as fuck as well and is as deep as the abyss. Better equip artorias' ring.5/5The port of Dark Souls 3 is amazingly good compared to the shitty port of the first game. However, it has one single issue that PC players may find disconcerting: All the controls are shown in console buttons. Nevertheless it's not too hard to learn how to play using mouse and keyboard but I feel that an Xbox controller feels much better (not something I say a lot) and as such players should use one.4/5Wow. Oh wow. Holy mother of fuck the soundtrack in this game is utterly incredible. It's a masterpiece. The game itself does not feature much music in levels themselves due to it being contradictory to the lonesome atmosphere FROM Software creates. However the boss music is absolutely incredible and many times I've been in awe of the beauty of the music and subsequently gotten squashed, lacerated, and defiled by the numerous bosses of the game. Easily one of the best soundtracks I've heard: It's grim, sombre and fits the atmosphere flawlessly.5/5The level design of Dark Souls 3 will fuck you over as much as it can. Enemies are placed in the most irritating and unexpected locations and the areas themselves are sprawling and massive. Do I love it? Absolutely. Games have long since departed from creative and scummy level design that is meant to screw the player over and it is oh so refreshing to play something that does. Damn good.4.5/5-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I haven't even mentioned PvP in this review, however the PvP combat is really great as well. Just remember your duel ettiquette and don't chug >:(Overall, a grossly incandescent game that is fucking good.Net score: 92.5%"
Positive,"I don't play a lot of games but this one is really addictive, you can play as any class. Or be all classes.It's a little difficult at first, but then you'll breeze through the game. The second playthrough you'll be wondering what you even struggled with in the first. The third time it's your boss music that plays whenever you enter a fog wall."
Positive,"If you like constantly dying at the same spot 1 billion times and spending hours to go up 1 staircase, this is the game for you!"
Positive,super cool & very addictive Dont Give up attitude  good game. Love The tough Level Of The gameAwesome ..
Positive,"I hate it almost as much as I hated Dark Souls 1, 10/10. Made me question my existence at least thirty times already."
Positive,"This is everything Dark Souls 2 should have been.Still not as good as the original Dark Souls, mainly because the gameworld is not completely interconnected like it was in DS1, it is more linear, but the levels themselves have become much larger and more intricate. Save your estus because if you waste it you'll be left looking for a bonfire like it was an oasis in the middle of the desert.Also... poise. Poise should apparently be there in the game, somewhere, because a lot of items and skills give a poise bonus, not to mention armor. But it just doesn't work. I'm not going in-depth because there are countless threads and videos about this... what matters is FromSoftware's statement about this, saying it is ""working as intended"". I don't know how to feel about this but it's clear they fucked up on this one, somehow...Still, overall this is the worthy sequel to the original Dark Souls, finally, after DS2 and its ""expansion"" left a bitter aftertaste. DS2 in comparison looks like an indie fan-made game, and its lore sounds like straight up fanfiction. ""Well, what is it"" DS2 fanboys? u mad? fite me"
Positive,"WHAT I THINK IS GOOD- I love it so far, but then again I loved every Souls entry, so there's that bias from me.- Died in the first 15 minutes. That's Dark Souls enough for me, money well spent.- Performance is solid 60 frames. GTX 970 and an i5 4460 at 3.2ghz. - The weapon arts is cool.- Combat is fast, not as fast as Bloodborne but definitely has more pace than the previous two Dark Souls.NOT TOO GOOD-No crashes so far, but there are a lot of instances where the game kinda stutters. It doesn't linger for long (you may not notice at all) but it's there. Not enough to hinder the experience though, I'm pretty sure I never noticed it when fighting the first boss (I managed to beat it yay!)-Firelink Shrine is a little drab. Loved the original's unconventional shrine and Majula's beauty. I know it's a nod to Demon's nexus, but that one was majestically designed. -I miss our cute Herald VERDICT SO FAR (Will update later)Buy it if you're a Souls fan, won't change your mind if you never liked the series."
Positive,better than elden ring
Positive,"Amazing, 100% recommended."
Positive,"I woke up this morning and thought, ""Hell yes, I want to love my life.""I booted up Dark Souls sipping a cup of coffee imagining all the wonderful souls I'd gather. No sooner than booting the game I died. Over... And over.... and over....My coffee cup is broken.. The world is broken. Nothing can be done for me now... I must... Link..The fire..."
Positive,"I hated souls games, now they are the only game I play. Played all of them on PS5 and am planning to the same on PC as well! Souls is life."

Positive,I feel like guts berserk playing this
Positive,"Highly Recommended!This game is honestly amazing. I can't say which one's my favourite, 1 or 3, but I've always loved the Dark Souls series. I've played both 1 and 3 and can't wait to play more of this kind of game from From. It's sad to see that it's the last one of the series but that only makes this that much more worth it.The Dark Souls series is my favourite series due to all that it is. The game has a way of gripping you, entrancing you not in amazing graphics (which truly the graphics aren't bad, actually quite good), or instructional guided questlines with a straightforward story (which again, there is a story, yet it's truly hidden and you must be a true fan to really understand half of what goes on), but in difficulty, punishment, and overcoming new challenges. It's amazing to see a game that some can finish in 1 hour, and others spend 200 hours, but both can get the same great takeaway of challenge.This game has given me amazing memories. I highly respect those who put their effort into bringing this game to us. Thank you."

Positive,"Dark Souls III is an engaging, somber and atmospheric, intense combat driven experience.At its core it is a 3D Action RPG with limited hand holding by design.You control a character from a 3rd person perspectiveThere are 3 core stats: HP, FP, & Stamina Running, attacking, blocking, & casting spells uses StaminaStamina naturally regenerates at a rate based on your attributesUsing skills and special abilities reduces FPIf you run out of HP you dieKill enemies to gain SoulsSpend Souls on gear, items, weapon upgrades/augments, and stats for your characterWhen you die you lose the souls you have collected and leave behind a vaporous verdant glow which when interacted with retrieves your Souls which you had at the time of deathOnly one death vapor can exist for any given player at any timeAll players can invade to kill and also come to aid in their and your worldThis is the most linear Souls game so far, but also the most accessible to new players- taking roughly 8 hours straight to complete the first time for someone comfortable with the combat system.The story is somewhat of an extension of the previous titles. You'll find a lot of references to all of the previous Souls games in the details.Compared to the previous titles in the series- Dark Souls III is much of the same thing with some refinements, cuts, and additions.Rough terrain, ambushes lying in wait, overwhelming groups of enemies, and death pits. Dark Souls III challenges players not to die, over and over again. This game can be as intensely frustrating as it is rewarding. The standard sword arts have been refined drastically and ""power stance"" dual wielding of weapons is no longer available to players. Weapons have abilities which can be activated for an amount of FP which have various effects, such as a special attack or temporary increase to a stat/attribute among other modifiers.There are checkpoints scattered around the game worlds various zones which you can teleport between much like in the previous titles. They appear much more often in this release of Dark Souls, than in previous titles, making the overall difficulty somewhat paltry. NG+ and onward is a sad increase in difficulty by merely increasing the amount of health enemies have and an increase in damage dealt.The major improvements to the core gameplay of the Souls series are especially apparent in the boss fights, they've been improved from the previous Souls titles by leaps and bounds with transitions that drastically change the bosses attack patterns requiring players to change up their approach from aggressive to defensive and vice versa on the fly.Sound design leaves nothing to be desired at all.The soundtrack and the atmosphere are absolutely perfect.Dark Souls III runs excellent on all last gen video cards and it looks beautiful though it is fairly CPU demanding in order to run above 30fps consistently.Online play can be frustrating due to the connections being Peer to Peer. The worse a players internet connection is the more likely there will be desyncs which will cause all kinds of issues and drastically alter interactions between other players as well as players interactions with other players world's enemies."
Positive,more gestures than any dark souls before
Positive,I have bad friends
Positive,10/10 casual game
Positive,"So let's be real with ourselves. We were disappointed with Dark Souls 2, but were longing for a sequel so badly that we tried convincing ourselves that we thoroughly enjoyed it. Dark Souls 1 was a fantastic game that left a mark on a lot of people. Now don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Dark Souls 2. I put over 300 hours in to it, but it was still a huge disappointment. Now we have Dark Souls 3, and it's finally the sequel to Dark Souls 1 that we wanted. When playing it you can just feel the similarities to 1 with game mechanics and story. It also brings over the nice little tweaks that Dark Souls 2 gave us with armor aesthetics and such. Is it perfect? By all means, no. But you can't ignore the fact that it feels like a FINISHED GAME. Something that Dark Souls 2 was not. I'll be honest and say that I was a bit hesitant on buying when I saw a day one season pass, but after finally beating the game I can say that I look forward to playing the DLC and having hilarious Co-op adventures. And I can't wait to pump more hours in to this game.It also has something that Dark Souls 1 and 2 lacked. A GOOD FINAL BOSS"

Positive,"-welcome home ashen one-ashen one , be sure to bring more soul's"
Positive,"honestly one of my favorite games of all time. Easily something that I put over 400 hours in (across multiple steam profiles,) and continue to put multiple more into. Dark Souls 3 and its brother and sister titles are wonderful series that I can't help coming back to. Only thing that I can complain about is the cheaters in PVP. If you're planning on putting any time into pvp covenants make sure to download Blue Sentinels mod to keep yourself safe from soft bans. 11/10 game"
Positive,"I feel horrible for that darkwraith that is trapped behind a locked door because nobody can perform the requisite invasions to unlock his room.He was imprisoned forever for our sins of using cheat engine to uncensor the word 'Knight'But ultimately, this game had the worst online mechanics in the whole series, so it  was worthwhile.At least you can't go wrong playing single player unless you pick mage, and coming back to it from Elden Ring reminds you of a time when bosses were actually good."
Positive,"This is the first dark souls I've tried and oh boy, I absolutely loved it! You need to love a challenge to enjoy this game and I sure as hell love a challenge. The DLC for this game was incredible as well, I seriously reccomend giving this game a go!"
Positive,One of my favorite games ever. worth every penny.
Positive,very good yes
Positive,"In this review:I'm addressing the only aspects of the game I think are the best. For all other things you think the game has and what to read about, or a pros n cons type of review, you came to the wrong place.I had one big problem with Dark Souls 1 and Dark Souls 2. Neither of them managed to mantain an above average level of interestingness throu out the whole game (at least for me). They had great innovating ideas as for the storytelling strategy goes, being them based on an enviormental way of selling the information needed to understand the lore behind the events happening at the moment. We all know those games had a great gameplay mechanic quirk that worked all game long, but it felt really repetitive. whether you started the game at Firelink Shrine or Anor Londo, the moveset nor the general look of the enemies changed much. Don't get mistaken, the lore behind those in-game places was astonishing, but the picture behind was over used throu out the game. In conclusion, they both needed variety on enemies.Dark Souls III completly change that fact, and to an amazing result. It not only had tons of different character models for all enemies in games, they also had completly different movesets, forcing you to spend time or patience understanding them all. That, plus the new hyper bloodborne-type game speed, made this game a different type of difficulty. Before, after dying a few times to the same enemies, you understood there was nothing to do other than keep dying until you get how to win, or farm ultil you get the level to continue. In this game, the speed makes the learning curve really faster, and the enemies variety makes it more interesting than before. Basically, It makes failure interestingHope this addressed topic is of use to you. I tried to speak about something new.If you ask yourself whether to buy the game or not, do it. It is completly worth it"
Positive,One of the best soul game but price is too high.

Positive,"Runs great on my 750 graphics card and a computer I bought 4 years ago. Only slight lag spikes when transitioning areas so it is never intrusive. If you are a souls fan, you will love it! Incredibly hard coming from dark souls I & II. Regular monsters are trashing me left and right and bosses...holy crap! I keep trying on my own but really need summons to succeed in bosses. Always try first on my own a few times though."
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is an Action RPG in a Gothic Medieval fantasy setting, with Japanese inspirations from it's Japanese designers.I'd like to start off by saying this is by far my favourite and the best souls game I've ever played ( Haven't played Demon Souls or BloodBorne though). It is a vast improvement over the previous 2 Dark Souls games, not that they were bad games, not at all but it's done what a sequel should do, and has (in my opinion) outdone both of them, taking the good from both. In this review I'll try go over the key parts of what I think will make you want to buy the game ( the short of it is that you should).This game's performance has been mixed for the most part, it's worked fine for me and I've not suffered any serious issues during my entire playthrough, the only one's I've encountered are the occasional stuttering or a few frame drops here and there.To clarify, my PC meets the minimum requirementswith;AMD FX-43508GB DDR3 RAMNVIDIA GeForce GTX 750 TiMy game ran at 45 - 60 FPS most of the time on High settings, with the occasional stutters coming from over the top effects ( A problem which was in DS1 too).Like I mentioned, I've had no problems that were critical, but some of the people who are complaining have valid reasons, for example if they have quite a powerful PC, but if you're a half wit who's got a worse PC than the minimum REQUIRMENTS, yes what is REQUIRED to play the game with minimal problems, then don't complain. And if you're someone in that situation looking to get this game, you might get lucky, but I'd get a better PC honestly.For people who have never played a souls/borne game before and you're looking to get this one, seeing as it's the newest then you may already know about the supposed 'brutal' difficulty, which isn't entirely true for the most part. It's a difficult game in the sense that your hand is never held during the game, you're given a basic tutorial at the start of the game, teaching you the need to know mechanics for combat and the world then you're told to go out into that world. There's also the matter of things such as a lack of health regen (to start with) which means you've got to be a bit more methodical in your combat and how you approach a situation, because rushing in and getting spanked from pillar to post will get you killed, alot.For players who are somewhat familiar with the game, a new feature was added called 'weapon arts' or something like that, allowing you to perform different attacks/buffs from the normal moveset of the weapons in the game. The range from simple guard breaking attacks, to ludicrously fast slash and dash attacks.The pace of combat has also been sped up, in favour of faster attacks and more rolling in most cases, which is similar to what I've seen from BloodBorne, which is good and bad, but for me it takes away from this medieval theme, with some of these really cool swords, that are just too slow in some cases.In my opinion the combat in this game is what sets it appart from other games and you can't have the game without it, so if you're not a fan of fast paced, skill based (mostly) action packed combat that will punish you, but will be so rewarding if you win, then maybe miss out on this game.Since the start, the souls series has been known for it's epicly sized worlds, with massive landscapes, enemies and bosses and it's no different in DS3, and unlike in DS2 the world is more interconnected like in DS1, so if you see a cool looking area in the distance, chances are you can visit it, but more often than not, it's not a direct route.Some people seem to forget the story of this game, because a lot of them play it for the cool looking combat or simply the challenge, but Dark Souls has a lot of lore behind it, even though a lot is hidden away and you have to go and find it yourself in some cases. In DS3 it's not just it's own standalone game, it has references, some big and some small to the previous titles and as someone who's played a lot of the previous games, I like how they've kept some form of continuity in the series. So if you'd like a deep, interesting lore to get into then this is a great game for that.The difficulty of this game needs it's own category, simply because it's a staple of the series for most people. The most difficulty comes from the bigger enemies, that attack aggresively, or that need to have their patterns of attack learnt to defeat them and the same is with the bosses. Now if you've played the previous games, you may have noticed how (again in my opinion) Dark Souls 2 difficulty, wasn't as hard as DS1, which I believe to be mostly in that the attacks of the DS2 bosses had somewhat better hitboxes (so you didn't die from as many bullshit deaths) and their attacks were more predictable and easier to dodge. In DS3, the difficulty is noticeable ramped up, mostly in the later game after you've gotten used to how the game works and feels, but Bosses and enemies alike are more relentless with attacks, and can chain a lot of attacks together, which means you mustn't rely on simply blocking attacks, as rolling now costs less stamina, so being agile is often the key to victory.During my first playthrough, there wasn't a boss that I couldn't handle eventually, sometimes you need to level up a bit and come back, or simply summon someone to help and I'll explain the online next.Now I personally have a love/hate relationship with the online in this, mostly because of invasions. Invasions are when other players, come to your world with the goal of killing you, the host. For me personally I'm not overly bothered that they exist, it's annoying in some cases such as when you're trying to get through a particullarly hard area, and then a bad player invades and only sits behind tough enemies then gets you while you're overwhelmed. Now I can admire PvP, when it's fair. For new players this is extra difficulty that just isn't needed, even if they have summons it can still be irritating (Summons are players the are invited to help the host player in their world, mostly to defeat the area boss.) You can however invade and be the good guy, for example as a 'blue sentinel' which are players, dedicated to aiding other players in need, and do their best to protect them from invaders. This for me is somewhat satisfying, as you get to both help a new player not get stomped on, and you get to put an invader in their place and ruin their day. A big problem with the online PvP is that, in a game where life and death is decided frame by frame sometimes, the latency issues are a real problem and it doesn't matter if you're like me and have superb and fast internet, someone with terrible internet will ruin a fight, because they'll be hitting you before their animations even start, they'll lag all over the place and all sorts, it's just not well optimised for some people, who still insist on playing and ruining other people's experiences. Online extends beyond invading and co-op, as you can see messages in your world, left by other players in theres giving hints (usually) and 'bloodstains' which show how other players died in that spot.Lastly, while it is entirely possible to play the game in offline, so as to not get invaded by players, this also cuts you off from help from other players, through messages and summons, which some people may want rather than total isolation.Sadly there's not enough space in these steam review for me to write about everything I love and hate about this game, such as the God awful community (at times) or the Beautifuly made sound track, but hopefully I've given you some insight to this great, albeit flawed in some areas-game. Definitley recommend this, maybe wait for a sale if you're strapped for cash, but this is something any souls fan should experience!"
Positive,my pp grew
Positive,This game will put your mental strength and patience to the test.
Positive,You can cosplay as an anthropomorphic Onion in robes that swings a sword twice it's size with one hand.
Positive,"When I first began playing this game, (my first of the games) I had absolutely no idea what I was getting myself into. I died 8 or 9 times to the tutorial boss, but the next day, I defeated it. This game made it difficult to put down, and I found myself swinging away and enjoying every boss fight (except curse-rotting greatwood). A few hours later, and I have started a new character, one whose play style I enjoy every bit as much as the original character. The game has a steep learning curve, and it is one of the best games I have played."
Positive,"Personally I always hated games with confusing plotlines, hard to understand stats and numbers and just rpgs in general. But holy shit this game is amazing. This is my first souls game so you know I went in butt naked and in return got my ass handed to me an uncountable number of times but man oh man was it fun. I wouldn't call the game unforgivingly hard but it is quite challenging to new players. But never ever let that stop you from experiencing the game. Also people who say it is impossible to play without a controller are wacked in the head because I play with a keyboard and it's just as good in pvp. Don't let all this distract you from buying this gold mine. I'd tell you to experience the game butt naked with no guides but that's just me.10/10 amazing once in awhile game."
Positive,"This is one of my favorite games of all time. But be aware that hacking has been an issue for all of the dark souls PC releases. The anti-cheat system is at best mediocre and at worst actively harmful for normal players. It would honestly be better if the anti-cheat system was just disabled entirely and left to the modding community, who has been doing a significantly better job than From or Bandai for the past three games. On that note, if you are going to play online I highly recommend checking out the anti-cheat mods created by the community. Hackers are capable of ruining your save file and getting you soft banned. Luckily Bandai did re-enable to family share feature so if your account gets softbanned you can use steam family share to get around this."
Positive,"How would I rank this episode compare to Demon Souls, Dark Souls 1, and Dark Souls 2. This is a hard choise. On a technical stand point, Dark Souls 3 is the most beautiful out of all the souls series and by far. However, the game still suffer from optimzation issues on PC such as no support for Triple Monitor (can be done but requires a modification of exe file), SLI is alright, drops in FPS, etc... now story wise, well, not convinced about it. It seems to take place in between Dark Souls 1 and Dark Souls 2, so it is I guess a prequel to Dark Souls 2, not sure. The gameplay is good and controls are spot on. Overall, it is a great game but falls short of the rest of games in the series. Another thing too, the game feels much easier to tackle than the other two. So, I will still recommend the game :)"
Positive,"never have I been more frustrated and simultaneously enthralled by a game. this being my first SoulsBorneKiro game, it at first seemed as though it was punishing for no good reason and stopped after I reached somewhere around High Wall of Lothric. eventually it drew me back in and I sure am glad it did. it may have partially been the hunger for internet clout in beating it, but the main draw for me was its incredibly layered world-building, cryptic storytelling, and tough-but-rewarding gameplay style. all of its incredible aesthetics had stuck with me even after I had written off the game in my own mind. this attachment led me to go out and get 100% achievements in the game and continue along down the series to do the same thing.after having played a small amount of Bloodborne, DARK SOULS II™: Scholar of the First Sin, and DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition™, I can say this is likely the most accessible one to new players and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the Souls franchise. it has a bit of a learning curve at first, Iudex Gundyr may take a few tries initially but if you can surpass him then you are definitely ready to take on the rest of this game. you need to learn how to learn to play games like this. if you don't feel like your efforts are paying off after the first area or two, definitely try and at least complete a playthrough to see if you think this game is for you.while I had a tough time deciphering much of a ""story"" through the base game itself, watching videos from YouTubers like VaatiVidya and hbomberguy definitely gave me more of an appreciation for what goes into the writing and mechanics of these games. no game has made me feel this disheartened and broken as a person upon completion as this. The End of Fire ending was what I ended my first playthrough on and it was such a fitting and glorious sendoff.the brutal atmosphere holds no punches in these games and is entirely meant to wear you down mentally as you go through them. Irithyll Dungeon/Profaned Capital especially had freaked me the f*ck out with what they had in store for me. I HATE THE MONSTROSITIES OF SIN SO MUCH WHAT KIND OF WEIRD FREAKISH FETISH IS THAT MIYAZAKI?!?!my only gripe with the game is the difficulty tends to wear off once you start NewGame+. my first playthrough (NewGame) took me around 50-60 hours to complete. NewGame+ took me maybe 5-10 if even. once you learn the ins and outs of this game, there isn't much that's going to surprise or challenge you except the DLCs or PvP/co-op, both are wonderful to have fun with once you feel comfortable with the main game.just kidding, fashion-souls is the real endgame.all in all, excellent game and definitely kickstarted my interest in the franchise and FromSoft in general. highly recommend but it's not for everyone.9/10"
Positive,"Generally, the worst thing that can happen to a games series is to run out of ideas and to continue going on only as a revenue maker (Assassin’s Creed?!). If Dark Souls III is the last game of the Souls series, then it is a worthy finale, one that goes out with a boom. It changes just enough in terms of mechanics to make the gameplay feel more fluid and refined, while offering the best collection of bosses that sprawl some amazingly designed areas. Although its world may not be as meticulously built as the one of the first game and the future of its online component is uncertain as of now, it is a hell of an experience that kept me addicted for two weeks straight and offered more than enough quality content to leave me satisfied. Despite enjoying it a lot more than Dark Souls II, it hasn’t managed to impress me as much as the first one did, but that’s perhaps because it was my first Souls experience.On an ending note, I can’t wait to see what From Software will do with the DLCs (expect reviews for those as well!), as in all previous cases they have surpassed the vanilla game experience. What’s more, I’m excited for the possibility of new Souls-based games in different settings that are built on the same design principles.Pros:+ Impressive artistic design+ Epic soundtrack+ Mysterious and captivating story+ Good level design+ Refined combat system+ Greatest roster of boss battles and the best difficulty curve in the series+ Atmospheric+ Good itemization+ Fun PvPCons:- Bugs from the previous games made it into this one with new additions- Some issues with mouse & keyboard- Linear world design with a few exceptions- Perhaps too much fan service- The graphics quality and graphics related problems- Little incentive to continue with NG+ and onwards- Weapons balance issues due to Poise stat having no effect- The lack of proper support for the Online component- Annoying lag in Online playRead the in-depth review here.[thegameslashers.blogspot.ro]"
Positive,"It is very addictive, play it"
Positive,wonderful lore and combat experiences 10/10
Positive,This Game Is Very Hard But Yet So Very FUN
Positive,I'll keep coming back to DS3 until Elden Ring is released.
Positive,No comment needed. It's Dark Souls... 3 Cheers
Positive,1. buy and play the other 3 Souls games2. get pissed off from dying and losing souls3. realize how many other people died lost more souls4. buy Dark Souls 35. Gets to Dragonslayer armor or Twin Princes and dies6. Realize how great of a game it is and write a Review
Positive,10 out of 10 game  i beaten the first boss in dark souls 3 the story line is good and the design thourgh this game  is  epicsince dark souls 3 is an old game i still recoomand it  for new players that like   an hard challange for this game
Positive,Get Good / this game has some pros and cons but in all retrospect its really good i would recommend this game...
Positive,"This game is honestly one of the best games I played, if you keep on dying then GIT GUD"
Positive,Really interesting and fun game but also difficult which is good. I recommend playing this with a friend to double the fun
Positive,The souls were dark. 11/10
Positive,Good game. Would play again.
Positive,ow that hurts
Positive,"This game is just plain amazing. Its challenging gameplay keeps it interesting, its boss fights are downright a hell of a time and its graphics are pretty good. My friend got me this game and at first I wasn't to interested, but that changed after actually playing it. If you haven't already got this game I definitely recommend doing so, playing with friends makes it less challenging in my opinion so if you want to make it as challenging as possible play solo."
Positive,"Hours of fun, especially when you praise the Sun! ;D"
Positive,Like talking to the girl you like but much easier
Positive,Good for stress relief
Positive,"I've started a challange , for every death , i will do 10 push ups ( 2 days later ) It hurtsssss !"
Positive,"Awesome graphics, very fun to play with friends, especially when you're stuck. You won't forget these boss battles with your friends."
Positive,"It's definitely got problems (connection issues, hacking problems, lack of proper balancing), but it's a great time. Still play with friends today (160 hours and 2 years later). Dark Souls 3 is basically Dark Souls 1 in the Bloodborne engine both in a good way and a bad way. In a good way being that the gameplay is active and fast, giving you little time to breath and on your toes. In a bad way because storywise it boils down to Dark Souls 1 references in the end.Definitely fun, would recommend even more if you have a friend to play with for Jolly Cooperation. Grade: B"
Positive,"It's not an easy game, but that doesn't mean you have to git gud. You can bum rush into hordes of enemies, or choose to snipe them one by one at a distance like the cheeseburger assassin you are. Combat feels extremely rewarding when done right, and there's many different ways to progress including summoning phantoms and completing sidequests with NPCs that might help you later on. Prepare for lots of 'ohshit' moments.Interacting with other players, even if you can't chat directly with them, was the icing on the cake for me. Good times were had with silly gestures and being tricked into an untimely death from deceiving messages. It's an interesting dynamic to say the least, and one of the most unique forms of online interaction for someone new to Dark Souls."
Positive,I felt like this was a really good end to the Souls games. No series has made me feel such reward with struggle. Amazing detail in the level design. Lore is fascinating like the first installment. The weapon arts are really fun and encourage you to try all the weapons. Bosses will have your heart beating like crazy as you get to the end of their health bar. And the DLC ended up being some of the best add-on content money can buy.
Positive,"Kingdom Fall trailer made me buy this game,Darksouls1 made me buy all dlcits a great game, with a very dark atmosphereenemies have more different attack patternsboss and miniboss fights are about dodging/parrying incoming damagebut you always have a small window to do damage tooim only playing single player mode, i think pvp is abusive in this game"
Positive,"No matter what they say about multiplay experience, at least I haven't encountered any of those problems yet.And COME ON IT'S DARK SOULS !"
Positive,"With only 3 hours of gameplay, i got killed by tree testicles"
Positive,after like 200 days they brought back the servers so uh good game i guess
Positive,do doge and hit hit hit hit hit hit hit hit (492 omitted) and do the button on controller to dodge again but idk what button that actually is because i use a keybord and not controller so cannot properly place game what button is dodge on controller? cool knight simulator
Positive,"UpdateAs time passes on, so does the hackers (I presume). I bet it's safe to buy now, yet always keep in mind, that you do NOT want to take gifts from people you haven't met, and don't trust.I'm not the type which puts a lot of effort into his reviews, but I'll say what's on my mind.So overall this is the greatest milestone in the Souls series. However, it's also the most troubled version of all the Souls games.Yes.. We're talking about hackers. Now, it's nothing new with hackers on the PC platform, however what's been going on with DS3 lately is ridicolous. I'd like to refer to my thread at the steam discussions for more information about this.The atmosphere and general sound, is amazing. Especially the atmosphere. Have you heard the Firelink music? It's awesome, go look it up on Youtube. Now, now. I'm not much in this game for the sounds ofcourse, as it's the gameplays (and partly the graphics?) that really matters to me.The gameplay is solid, and is challenging like you'd expect from a Souls game. I personally don't feel like it's the hardest there's been, but that may be because it's not my first Souls experience anymore. What I find most astounding, is the online play (except for the mentioned hackers and modders), which consists of you, and other people being able to both invade, summon and being summoned into other worlds as phantoms. My 64 hours in this game, is mostly consisting of PvP. The variety and fun you can have, finishing a PvP build, and then wrecking havoc in other host's worlds is really great.Now, is the PvP balanced? No, and you probably wouldn't be able to name one game which has perfect balancing. however, From is doing a good job at trying to patch, when someone finds, and exploits an insanely good combo/weapon.That's it. Not a great review, but I don't really have more time to write this now.One last thing: Please for the love of god, don't pick up items from a person whom you find highly suspicious, or have seen hack. This may get you banned. To combat this ridicolous anti-cheat, do regular back-ups."
Positive,"I can easily say Dark Souls III is the best buy of the year so far for me. I'm already a fan of the genre so I can say it's probably a biased review, but the game's worth it.I've got many of hours pumped into previous titles especially Demon's souls, even with my experience I'm finding this title challenging and fun, also definitely rewarding. 'Git Gud or die trying'. I can quite easily say I think this is my best game out of the Souls series for sure.10/10 - It's very nice to play a title I can enjoy endless hours playing instead of jumping from game to game."
Positive,"When the fire fades, the world goes to its end. And the choice of making fire aflame or outfire rest with you——the Ashen one.To find your meaning of being a cursed one in the sorwe fieldor to pursue your indelible conviction even the result is in vain?It's a different myth for everyone.  May the flames guide thee."
Positive,"Awesome game, real hard aswell, and if you have problems beating a boss, don't hesitate to git gud"
Positive,this happened to my buddy Eric.
Positive,this game best
Positive,"I rarely lost my mind in this game, but when I lost it I also questioned my sanity.  11/10 IGN approved"
Positive,breddy gud 10/10
Positive,played the remaster before thisand i must say this one is my fav one 6 hours in the gamethe combat is much better than the remaster and im still learning about the story and the sceneries are just gorgeous
Positive,"i love my balls being crushed between 2 things that maybe even slightly turn me on, if you like torture and pain with a climax worthy of divine scriptures then play this game, you beat boss and you happy but fighting a boss is like bashing your head into a wall and using a benedryll as a potion every 30 mins until you realize an easier way to destroy your braincells and the wall."
Positive,"So, the land of Loran had a grand-grand-grand-GRAAAAAAAAAAAANDson and the very-grand-very-son is the land of Lothric (also the name of the prince, but keep with me here). Then ash suddenly decided to become sentient and get it's greatsword shoved into places it most surely does NOT belong (trust me, been there, done that) as it tries to kill all the alliven't people and... more ash? Sometimes? Yeah, fuck, why the hell not. Buy it you dipshit, like granny always said: ""If you're going to spend your money on shoving a greatsword up your ass, at least get a proper greatsword!"" Oh, and btw. FUCK MIDIR, FUCK EVERYTHING THAT STUPID FUCKING DRAGON STANDS FOR, FUCK HIS CHILDREN, FUCK THE CHILDREN OF HIS CHILDREN, LET THINE CURSED WRETCHES OF THE WORLD SPEAK NOT HIS FUCKING NAME, FUCK HIS TAIL, FUCK HIS HORNS, FUCK HIS WHOLE DRAGON BODY, FUCK MIDIR.:)"
Positive,im a little bad at this game but i got the spirit
Positive,"This game is simply fantastic! A worthy finale to an excellent series, albeit unfortunately the last chapter of this deep and amazing lore. Praise the sun!"
Positive,game sucks III
Positive,"An excellent end to a fantastic series. Whether you're new to the series or a returning vet, you're gonna absolutely love this entry in the Dark Souls series. This one has more roots with 1, more so than 2. Combat is fast paced, enemies offer a decent challenge even if you've played the previous games in the series. I found this one to be a bit more difficult than 2. If you played 1, then you should recognize the references, and returning characters that make appearences. Small spoiler, the final boss will really hit the long time players right in the feels. Overall this game looks, and plays great, and remains a very challenging game for newbies or vets. If you haven't played the Souls series yet... Then what the heck are you waiting for? DIVE IN AND PLAY"
Positive,"After playing every souls game (not including Bloodborne [for very long that is]) I can say this game is best left at ""short, but sweet.""Things that killed longevity for this game for me personally: 1. You can't be invaded after killing the area boss.2. Everyone and their mother's have enough estus to last them long enough that if you're invading a host, they'll most certainly have the advantage. I could go into this for a very long time, but I think the Dark Souls 2 system for estus was better.With that said, the game is still pretty fun and I enjoy spending time doing pvp and looking into the lore of the game. It's always fun to make friends and duel people too.Just not invading. :))))Anyways, I personally really like the game still."
Positive,"One of the best game I ever played, a lot easier than the other souls game imo and the graphic nice. I kept getting back into the game because it never get boring for me.10/10"
Positive,Its a very good game but my biggest critique is its not interconnected as other souls games in the series. imo it has better bosses  especially in dlcs(dont buy this game without dlc its on of the best in  series). also easier than other souls games but totaly worth your money and time.May the flames guide thee.
Positive,"its just awesome! Buy it. Its so challenging, but thats the fun part. You will definitely suffer and cry, be mad and almost quit, but the moment you finally beat that boss feels amazing! Although the first DS is considered to be the best, I would put this at the top, because its the most beginner friendly, still very challenging but leaves out all the annoying features that just make the game useless hard and uneasy to understand"
Positive,"Very good game. Challenging, but in the correct way. Doesn't just give enemies more health or give them extra damage output. The challenge comes from movement. Expect to die to bosses and tougher enemies more than a few times until you learn their attack patterns. It's very worth it though. The multiplayer aspect is very cool. If you invade, expect to be ganked. You can usually find a friend to summon at bonfires that are closest to bosses. Deep lore too, if you are into that sort of thing. I didn't really pay attention to it.Voice acting is superb. Each character feels like they have their own personality.Wide variety of gear, magics and stats make for limitless build variety. I mean yeah, there are the established meta builds but it's more fun to think of your own idea and run with that. Mine was a Strength-based mage who can buff his Greatsword with several different elements.Level design is also top notch. This is something I've not seen mentioned much, but each area feels so believable. I wouldn't be surprised if FromSoft got actual architects to work on the buildings. They really are pretty.Speaking of pretty, the graphics are quite nice. I wouldn't say it's the best ever but it's really good. This game really nails atmosphere. The game runs exceptionally well. This is a game that I can truly say is a masterpiece of porting. It runs on max settings 1920 x 1080 at a rock solid 60fps on my modest machine (i5-4590, 8gb 1600 ddr3, gtx 970). FromSoft really did an amazing job here, and it's really nice to see a company that actually cares about PC and doesn't just half-ass it for the extra sales and focuses on console.Similarly, the game is amazingly free of bugs. I've only found a few.Every weapon and spell feels unique. This is something a lot of games don't do very well, but really every weapon is viable as long as you build around it. And you are gud.Sometimes, bullshit happens. I've glitched a few times and died. Fell through a floor, got knocked a ways. It happens rare enough that you forget about it but it's often enough to be annoying because dying in this game means losing time and progress, two of my pet peeves in gaming. I'm fine with dying to a tough enemy but dying to bullshit is just aggravating.Weapons and enemies can swing through walls. This is probably the biggest con. You'll have an enemy with a weapon that's longer than a man is tall and they are going through a doorway, when they do a horizontal wide swing. Common sense dictates that the weapon will obviously never fit, but this is dark souls. Those weapons find a way. Connecting to a friend via the password system is slow as fuck. It works but expect to wait around for the summon sign. I've spent 15 mins waiting before. To me, having online play be tied to a consumable item that's of limited quantity is kinda iffy. But you gain so many that it sorta balances out.A very small one that's more of a mild annoyance is that fact that you can't quit to desktop from in-game. You select quit, then are ejected to the title screen which prompts you to press start. When you do, you have to go through a loading sequence, which goes to the main menu then you can hit quit.Worth the full price. Challenging in the right way. Creative enemies that won't make you bored. Great depth to the character creator. Lore! The final installment of the git-gud simulator is the best in the series."
Positive,"I am and still terrible at this game. Keeping count of all my deaths.. After defeating ALL bosses I ended up dying 702 times, but I will never forget the journey I had in this game <3PvP is a lot of fun! I love the fight club the community created! That is right outiside Pontiff! Finding matches quick and hilarious to roleplay with people and duel them for honor!"
Positive,A waste of my life
Positive,guide for writing dark souls 3 reviews1.find funny review/overused joke2. control c3. control v
Positive,"Elden Ring was my first Souls game and it consumed me. I got completely lost in it's open world and the combat was simply the best in any game I have played, ever. It was a joy to explore ER's world and it's still one of the best games I have ever played however DS3 offers something that ER does not. A continuous level design where the entire game feels like a very long Legacy Dungeon from Elden Ring.Each enemy is carefully placed and each level feels very intentional and well crafted to create a challenge of getting from point A to B but often providing several ways to get to B while also in the middle of my journey from A > B throwing in a wrench of a path to C.I personally feel like the level design of the Dark Soul games is where From Soft and Miyazaki shines the best and honestly playing Elden Ring's DLC I missed it dearly.It's hard to say this game is better than Elden Ring and I wouldnt go that far but certainly there are aspects of DS3 where it's limitations of not being open world often provides a more well crafted experience than ER. My hope is that we get to see From Soft return to a game that is not open world and the dream would be to have a DS1 type of level design. Either way, whatever they cook up next Ill be there to play it.As for DS3, game good. Me take big sword and unga the bunga. 10/10."
Positive,"Why this game has 5 stars for me1) The game is balanced to give a certain amount of challenge every moment you play the game (The game introduces invasions to players that have a phantom to expose the player to a certain amount of ""harm"", also enables the player to experience the ""PVP"" part of the game.2) The lore is self-interpretation, so you could just play the game for the gameplay3) There are infinite amount of builds (You can do whatever you want, tank mage for example)4) The game is pc-friendly, not requiring that high spec of a setup5) You can install mods but always remember to play offline.Cons:Currently, there's a new breed of hackers that get you banned for putting items in your inventory, remember to have a backup save file.If you just bought it and contemplating whether to refund it or not, please read this: Seeing as there are many that they think they have made a mistake and asking for a refund, I'm asking you to just spend 3-5 hours and give you a guide.1. Be PATIENTa) As long as you try, you can kill the boss, you get to learn more about the moves of the boss when you die, the joy of defeating the boss is more than the remorse of having defeated multiple of times. *Insert meme where you point down to a boss and saying that he/she is trash despite killing you 50+ times*b) Time your attacks and rolls, there are iframes when you roll. (Iframes are the moments where you're invincible or you don't take damage). Don't be greedy too much, bosses can also detect your opening just as much you can detect theirs.2. Don't be afraid to DIEa) Dark Souls is all about dying, as much as the saying ""Defeat is the mother of victory"", you learn your shortcomings everytime you die and you improve yourself. I won't recommend ""GITTING GUD"" since ""GITTING GUD"" just comes along every time you play. Even with 432 hours, I still die to ♥♥♥♥♥ dogs and miscalculations.b) The difficulties of the boss are subjectiveSome find pontiff the hardest and they find friede easier than him, vice-versa. It's fine, we have our own experience on bosses and you get to keep it for yourself.3. Don't be afraid to ask for HELPDon't be angry to ppl calling you a ""CASUL"", just ignore them, a game is made to be an enjoyment for the ppl that play it, not for a certain few. The people here in the forums are very responsive most of the time, but still, try to defeat the boss alone first, since, the enjoyment of victory is meaningless on an easy one. The ""Easy"" type of victory will be explained below""The boss Hp gets stronger too"" - The boss also gets stronger when you summon a phantom, so the element of ""challenge"" is still there, but the element of ""challenge"" is extinguished when you make the phantom do all the work without exposing yourself to a certain degree of ""harm"", this is what I meant by ""Easy"" victory.To counter my argument that recommends players to kill the boss by themselves first, there are also bosses that gets harder when you have a phantom, like Uncle Gael that slaps you on NG++++ and your phantoms really HARD, dies HARD and he gets 50% more hp for each?The point is that ppl have many ways to enjoy the game, and don't let other ppl judge you on how to play the game.4. INVASIONS are part of the GAMEIf you hate being invaded, play Offline, but you won't be getting achievements when you kill a boss. As I have said earlier, this game presents you a challenge every second of your playtime. Being alone is less likely to get invaded, so having one phantom out gets you higher chance of getting invaded. Why? Because an ally enables you to clear an area faster, the game tries to counter this by presenting invaders. Rushing to the boss fog disables you to feel the DS3 experience. If a boss is getting on your nerves and you really just want to kill it by yourself without any hindrances, I advise you to equip the Way of the Blue covenant so that the Blue phantom would buy time for you to go to the boss fog. You can always ""gank"" invaders. What is a Gank? Ganking is playstyle where you have 2 or more phantoms bullying invaders. But don't complain if given the advantage, you and your team still got defeated. DEFEAT is also part of the game. Also you can invade too, so it's a win, right?5. Always copy your SAVE fileHackers are prominent here, but ""HACKERS that get you banned are the worst kind. Always have a backup save file. There's a separate guide for that, I just don't know the link (Please comment it lol)6. The Lore is open for interpretationsIf ur interested in the lore, just visit Vaatividya on Youtube (not that he's the only one, but he's the most famous in this section)7. Giving back to the communityBeing helped is FUN, and helping back is also FUN!8. Have FUN!As I have said before, a game was made to be an enjoyment. As the game gets harder, your skills also would have advanced by that time. A game is a game because there is a CHANCE, and it's fair if you analyze it carefully. You just get USED TO IT. If you feel sad, fret not, my friend, for we were on your shoes once and experienced your feelings right now. And learned the enjoyment of victory over uncountable displays of ""YOU DIED""."
Positive,I died and i loved it again!
Positive,"This game is peaceful, its playerbase kind(?)."
Positive,"over 9999 Death from boss of 10 / best game worst game Of course I'm jokingso everyone understands that the game brings a tremendous amount of pain .At this point, it is the best game of the year. Praise The Sun!"
Positive,"One of my favorite games of all times, however as of Jan. 22nd 2022 the RCE exploit has not been fixed. Therefore I cannot recommend this game to anyone, no matter how good its gameplay is. Hopefully it gets patched before the Elden Ring release.2022-02-12Multiplayer is disabled. Good game. Buy it and the DLCs now."
Positive,"Warmth. You feel… at peace. The gentle heat of the bonfire brings with it an aura of tranquility that only the Unkindled will ever truly understand. There’s panic within the calm, but panic is omnipresent on your journey; the stone from which your labyrinth is constructed. Mind foggy, you stare into the crackling flames, trying to piece together how you got back here. You died of course, but cursed ones such as yourself always come back; ‘what got me?’ is the question on your mind. You ponder this matter; it was something blunt. Yes, blunt; and incredibly heavy for that matter. It felt cold, as death always does, but more so than usual. Ah, there it is, clarity; that accursed watchdog from Irithyll had done you in. He’s a fast one despite his stature, and certainly unlike anything you’ve faced prior. That mace of his is quite menacing and, though it looks unwieldy, he definitely swung it with ease. A fearsome competitor, a warrior befitting the title ‘Heir to the Fire’, but not enough to keep you at bay. You steel yourself and meet the entry to his domain, determined to make this your final visit. With a solemn step, you part the fog; the fire of battle ignited within. REVIEWDark Souls IIIGENREAction RPGThe love-child of everyone’s favorite masochistic enabler, From Software, Dark Souls III is the culmination of a series-wide effort to break the record for broken spirits and controllers alike. From the humble western fantasy of Demon’s Souls to bloodsoaked eldritch horror of Bloodborne, players far and wide have learned what it truly means to be brought to your knees. And so it’s time for the main line’s third, and supposedly final, installment to bring its best to the table. With refined combat, improved matchmaking, and a return to form in terms of branching paths; can DS3 make a name for itself among its eternally infamous brethren, or will it fall into step with its predecessor Dark Souls II and be known forever as the mark of a dying franchise? Objective questions like that can’t be answered or assured by the likes of me, but I can make certain one thing; you’ll die. A lot.Allow me to commune with the spirits that be and channel my inner VaatiVidya to discuss the story of this game. In DS3 you are one of the Unkindled, undead souls unfit even to be cinders. As one of the Unkindled, you are cursed with the dark sign; forcing to forever wander the lands, unable to die. [Sorta.]  Against what has been ordained, the Lords of Cinder have not returned to their thrones; making it your job to hunt them down and bring them back by force; though things can’t always be so simple. Considering the fact that you literally crawled out of the ground; you’re a bit of a chump, and victory won’t be comin’ easy. The High Wall of Lothric wasn’t built in a day, and so too must the warrior be slowly chiseled from the base. By spending souls, you can progressively upgrade your character and weapons to make yourself more effective, but beware; with death comes loss of souls. If you die, you’ve got to retrieve your souls or lose all that progress, and dying on the way back causes you to lose them forever. So, prepared to die and equipped with a sippy cup of Sunny-D, some blue juice from wannabe Oscar’s corpse, and that wonderfully hideous face of yours; you begin your quest to become a lord-slayer.Combat feels satisfying. Whether it be with a hefty greatsword, a grand lance, or just a good ol’ mace; you can be sure that your attacks will feel meaty and effective. Straight swords sadly take dominance over all other weapon types as of now,but  their boring playstyle will hopefully persuade you to peruse your other options. Almost all weapon types have been rebalanced to be not only viable, but interesting and fun to use. Weapon arts add a whole ‘nother level of complexity to the system, and their addition is heartily welcomed into this veteran’s playbook. Boss weapons almost always have a flashy, devastating attack; though they’re hard to land. Other weapons arts would include stomp, perseverance, and spin attacks, but most weapons just have the ‘stance’ ability; which allows you to take an offensive form to deal massive damage. None of these abilities can be accessed without the use of focus points, however, a returning feature from Demon’s Souls. It’s basically mana.Boss fights and level design are equally fantastic this time around. Boss fights are all very fun, but none of them are really anything new to the series. Each has two phases and, though it seems interesting at first, it eventually becomes very, very tiresome. I will say, however, that I think the final boss may be the single best Souls boss in the entire series, but that’s just me. Each level is varied and interesting, each with their own set of enemies and hazards to keep you on your toes. My personal favorite would have to be Lothric Castle, one of the final areas. Multiple elevators and hidden doors weave in between the level to conveniently connect important spots and save you time. Each time you find a new shortcut, it’s like a breath of fresh air; a great burden lifted from the weary shoulders of a traveler. The lowest point would have to be Anor Londo, a cesspool of all the things horrible with Souls level design. Giants playing dead wake up to assault you whilst priests shoot high-damage fireballs at you from afar. At the same time, two pseudo-human enemies charge after you with quick, powerful weapons; and it’s still not over yet. Anor Londo is also home to the Alrich Faithful, the Bellkeepers 2.0. Two of them can invade you at once, instantly bringing you into an unfair fight, and I’ll be damned if they aren't guaranteed to fight like pricks. Thankfully the area is short, but that didn't stop it from leaving a horrible taste in my mouth. [And the faint taste of swedish meatballs, strangely…]But here comes my biggest gripe. [Brace yourselves, folks, this one might shock ya.] This game is way too easy. Not easy for video game standards as a whole, but easy for a Souls game. Outside of my first run of the game, which was obviously blind, I rarely died to anything. Boss fights are a breeze; they’re no longer dudes in armor, but they’re barely a threat in most cases. Enemies have predictable attack patterns with easily noticeable tells, and the only thing that might really kill you is stunlock. With little-to-no skill, this game could easily be beaten by anyone, you’ve just gotta learn from your mistakes.Here’s the thing though; Souls games have never been about the difficulty. It was never about it being the ‘hardest game of all time.’ It was never about how much you’d die, how hard you throw your controller, how furious you’d get. It was about the environmental storytelling, it was about the little details you’d pick up from item descriptions, it was about the lore behind the characters, it was about the silent bond formed through cooperation with a summoned ally. Dark Souls isn’t the hardest game of all time, and it was never meant to be. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying they’re cake-walks; they’ll definitely kick your ass if you don’t learn, but that’s just it. It was, is , and always will be a game about the reward of overcoming adversity by learning from your mistakes. Much like you would in life, you’ll make mistakes. You’ll stumble, you’ll do the wrong thing, you’ll take the wrong path, but you’ll learn from those mistakes. You’ll pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and chuckle as you keep on keepin’ on. Who’s plotting against you, who’s there to help, what threat’s just around the corner? No one knows, life’s not a fair game. At any moment, we’re prepared to die, but with the knowledge of the past we can better face the trials ahead. Dark Souls is the game of life, so chin up; you learn something new every day."

Positive,"Amazing fast gameplay, the stronger 1v1 enemies feel amazing, with timing being very important, being punished but not instakilled. Smaller enemies can really surprise you in groups too.Areas feel much more alive. No square rooms dressed up with debris like in DS2, you can really feel this is a built world.This could be the best Souls game.However, there is a crashing bug tied to bonfires. This can be fixed by setting ""Lighting quality"" to low in advanced graphic settings. This change is not saved upon turning off your game, so it must be redone every time you restart the game."

Positive,"Dark Souls III holds a special place for me. This was my first souls game so it will always be my personal favorite. Yet it is truly something that anyone who is a fan of souls or a fan of RPGs should play.The game is beautiful. The combat is incredibly smooth and satisfying and is, in my opinion, the best in series. The levels are drop dead gorgeous with some beautiful set pieces and great enemy designs. The music is incredible and there's this sense of scale that is hard to describe. The bosses are absolutely amazing. The draw to the souls series always seems to be the bosses. Well there are some bosses in here that are a very difficult challenge and will surely make for memorable fights that will stand out as some of the best boss fights you might've ever played in a video game. This is definitely one of my favorite games of all time and I would love to forget everything and go back and experience it all again for the first time. I cannot recommend this game enough, I think everyone should play at least one of the dark souls games."
Positive,"(I have only played 70hrs so dont be too hard on me)How may I sum up a review for Dark Souls III In MY opinion is one of the best games I have played so far... FromSoftware managed to put in a game empathy, which I think is remarkable, not just the lore, but every NPs background is breathtaking... indeed there are issues with the game and sometimes, because we are on PC, the encounter with a cheater or modder online is to be expected.(SPOILER BELOW)Still the game is sooo immersive is amazing, I cannot explain the emotions I felt during the battle with Gael, the moment he stod up I had goosebumps all over. (By the way I did it 1st try)... There I felt all the love from the game developers. So in the end, I think this is a very very very well made game, the price is a little high and if you buy it with all the DLCs is even higher, but if you manage to buy it when it is on sale, like myself (NOOOOOB), it is worth it!"
Positive,"""Try tounge but hole"""
Positive,"Dark Souls 3, Get Gud Edition."
Positive,"Dark souls 3 is a action JRPG made by FromSoftware just for you to play, have fun, suffer, and cry.The ""have fun"" part is not guaranteed to be present for everybody.Anyway, the game's great. A solid 8/10 honestly, very good closing game for the souls series. Is it the end of souls? I dunno, companies these days would beat any dead horsejust to keep their capita's heart pumping.STORY?:So, the story, first thing I want to address, I have no idea what the hell is going on.You have to kill some Abyss Watchers, a giant called Yhorm, Aldrich the snail guy and two cripples so you can start a new age of fire or bring upon the age of dark, as per usual, nothing much has changed with the story as in the previous games. For anybody that really gives a heck about lore I'd suggest you go watch VaatiVidya or whoever the heck is hogging the youtube views from making up theories that Miyazaki later just <can't show this word on a christian gameing site!> on.COMBAT:So combat, pretty fun, pretty challenging, don't get hit, but hit back. Two attack buttons, this time dual wielding is available, no power stance, boohoo what can you do.Two attack buttons, a block, parry button, backstep and dodge. I know it sounds like ""oh wow that's not that complex"" yeah, it's not that complex until you get into PvP Isuppose, then you really need to think what to do. From charged R2's, regular attack into a special with a finishing charged R2, you got plenty of ways to kill your enemies, just make sure you don't get killed of course.The game is this time around way faster than DS1 and DS2, feels like Miyazaki liked Bloodborne so much he wanted to make another one but then remembered he was making a soulsgame halfway through the development.Shoutout to the parry kings out there though, you guys are killing it.BOSSES IN THE BASE GAME:Bosses are all cool and dandy, none of them do really feel unfair, at least in the base game. I got one complaint on the difficulty curve with Pontif of Sulyvahn, because he is probably one of the hardest bosses in the game, and throwing him out there like that felt like a ""casual filter"" as some would say. Like I imagine that's a point where a bunch of people just rage quitted, or is it just me? Might be me, I am still a casual.THE DLC'S:Anyway as I said, none of them feel unfair in the base game, but in the Ringed City DLC a lot of players have been complaining about Midir's massive health pool, so I guess you could write that one down as an ""unfair"" boss, even though he's just more tedious than anything.The two DLC's though? Ashes of Ariandel was a dang letdown and don't let anybody tell you otherwise. Two bosses? Yeah I regret getting a season pass just because of that DLC. And no the arena was not worth it, the usual invasions are much more fun than that. But it's too late to cry about that now I suppose.Ringed City though, boy oh boy, that one surprised me. Don't get me wrong I expected From to make a DLC to make up for their mistake with Ashes of Ariandel but the sheer sizeand content of this DLC was amazing, it might even be better than the DLC from Dark Souls 1, simply glorious, honestly get Ringed City you will not be disappointed. Amazing 4 boss fights and a lot of cool weapons and spells are just waiting for you to pick them up.THE WEAPON AND ARMOR:Armor in this game has no upgrades and poise is useless outside of hyper armor. If you're not using a slow weapon that hits hard, wearing havels really won't matter. But if you're using a havels while you're wielding the Fume UGS then you can bet that you will out-trade anybody in PvP no matter who it is. Well unless you get outsmarted. In which case if you're wearing Havels and are using the Fume and do get outsmarted I suggest you delete the game and never come back on steam you filthy casual.Weapons are amazing as far as I'm concerned, sure From doesn't know how to balance them, but a lot of weapons are just amazing and I love the different weapon arts that each of them have. Just today I found out the Man Serpent Hatchet had charge with the charged R2 after you use the warcry, 10/10 surprised me really.The weapon upgrades might be some of the most detailed in the game, you have heavy, sharp, raw, chaos, fire, simple, refined, hollow, dark, deep, I'm sure I missed some,but yeah a lot of upgrades to choose, so that was a very nice thing.THE PVP:Not sure what to think about it. On another hand I love killing people, but on the other hand the netcode makes it unbearable at times. Well, might have something to do with my internet. Can't wait till I upgrade to a 4G internet from my 3 million BC slavic router. Do not go into PvP expecting everything to be peaches and cream honestly."
Positive,"""It's Hard but forgiveable""It's Highly anticipated FromSoftware title since Oct 2015 when they launched ""Gameplay reveal Trailer"". I personally glad for the Game lived up to the Hype. And yet, Gameplay feels more like Dark Souls 1 with the Bloodborne built-in graphic engine with no power stance skill (DS II feature) and non-upgradable Armor set in-game, require Skill over stats, leveling on this game it's only 1/3 way to Git Gud, the rest are majorly depending on your Skills and weapon usage.it's true gameplay last around 30 Hours, i had completed the game around 28 Hours,  and i had feeling this is shortest Dark Souls game in DS Franchise. Class: DeprivedWeapon: Broadsword+10 (Except Yhorm)Level: 161 (I used level cheater due to busy work day and increased VIT for avoiding Phat ROLL)Magic: Homeward Cast only (No Other Sorcery/Miracles Used)Style: Solo Mode (No Co-op)Game features really beautiful Orchestra Music Soundtrack, especially on Bossfights and Main Menu Theme.Game also required beefy rig in order to run it, let say GTX 960 with 4GB graphic memory is at least for 1080p constant, i'm encountering stuttering issues especially when entering Road of Sacrifices and Slow loading textures when passing through area/door, but it seems recent patches has fixed this issues [1.05].+ Epic Bossfight in-game (Epic way to die in-game too!)+ creatively well designed enemies AI (Movement and Attack)+ returning elements from DS PTDE+ Atmospheric and Beautiful world of Lothric+ Beautiful Soundtracks in-game- Gameplay feels too short for A-RPG genre (30 Hours long) for first run- Plenty of Shortcuts, world seems smaller.- ""Does not open from this side"" door bruh.....Despite in short of lengthiness, still this is really the best Dark Souls yet... and it's final one according to Miyazaki (The Director), reported on working new title IP recently.""PRAISE THE SOUP""""PRAISE THE LADDER""""SPOUSE AHEAD"""
Positive,It's good (works for me)
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is an action game with some RPG stats and leveling. You can play in many different ways, blocking with a shield, using magic, dodging attacks with perfect timing. Dodging for me is the most enjoyable, that thrill when you dodge a series of attacks perfectly. There's many different weapons, I can't tell you anything about them as I'm the kind of person to pick one weapon and just roll with it for the entire game. I do like that this is possible, especially when you upgrade your weapons.Let's discuss what Dark Souls actually is. Dark Souls is difficult, Dark Souls is learning enemy patterns. Some of the difficulty very rarely might be unfair, this is sadly inevitable. Most of the game however will not screw you over with fake difficulty as long as you pay attention. Exceptions to this: several bosses that keep breaking your lock on due to poor design.Once you've managed to traverse one of the diverse areas you will face a boss, the bosses too have some great variety and will keep you on your toes. Though Dark Souls 3 Does tend to use a certain boss gimmick a bit too often. Knowing each boss will have a second phase where they'll get more powerful can be annoying.While exploring areas you will not have music, allowing you to soak in the atmosphere. During boss battles however there will be music and most of it is great.Dark Souls 3 requires you to go through multiple loading screens to level up as you'll have to teleport back to home base, level and and teleport back to where you were. This, as you might imagine can get quite annoying.Should you play Dark Souls 3? Yes, but only if you like being challenged; if you don't this is not a game you will enjoy in any way. Though I would like to mention I enjoy the Souls series more for the exploration and level design than the combat. This made the Ringed City DLC slightly disappointing as the level design was terrible. Ringed City was only saved by having some of the best bosses in the entire game."

Positive,"I was a hater back then, but now I'm a big fan of Souls games. Patience is one thing you must have during the game, because there are a couple of hard points, which you can pass by learning the tactics and movesets. the story is so vast to the point that I might take class sessions to learn the lore of Dark Souls.Boss Fights are the times when you shout and scream as if you're fighting them yourself lol. although, I had a hard time killing some of them, like The Brothers and Nameless King. I also played both DLCs and boy it was exciting. Slave Knight Gael truly is one hell of a boss fight.The graphics are greats, plus the designs of characters and locations is gorgeous. The Music... OMG the music is so damn good, My favourite is the one called ""Epilouge"" which plays during the credits. With all that said, I still agree that Souls games are hard, but like I mentioned, It requires skill and patience. you have plenty of options like NPCs and online players in order pass the game, though the latter isn't functioning as of now, but It'll hopefully be fixed soon.I might play Dark Souls Remastered someday, but my main goal is playing Elden Ring next. I have some unfinished tasks in the game, so for now, I'll enjoy the time playing Dark Souls III."
Positive,"Quite honestly never could have expected how dedicated I would become in this game.Never played anything quite like Dark Souls 3 before and least to say it is the most painful but rewarding gaming experience you could ask for.With each boss you complete and each area you progress you're reminded every time that ""holy shit you did it"" but then instantly after you're smacked in the face with ""now go do it again"".I could say with confidence that I have never been challenged and pushed to achieve in a game such as Dark Souls 3 does.The level design is amazing and gives you so many paths to explore and discover for new places and items.Overall if you're looking for a new game to really dig into Dark Souls 3 has you covered!"

Positive,"This was my first FromSoft game and although I didn't enjoy it at first, it really grew on me as I continued to play it. I 100% recommend it if you're looking for something that challenges you or if you're just a bit of a masochist :) . However, I was expecting things like hitboxes and various other mechanics to feel more polished than they were at times. I understand the game is meant to be difficult, but the difficulty shouldn't come from basic things like hitboxes not being consistent.With that being said, I still found the game very enjoyable in many of it's other aspects. I found it's environments and enemies really fresh and unique and although I wasn't 100% sure I knew what was going on most of the time, there is a ton of lore you can go and look into for further context if you want that. For me personally I would have liked to have seen more of that in the game other than just in item descriptions, but I feel like the gameplay 100% needs to come first so I understand why they've done it like that.Overall I liked DS3 and I suggest that if you're just starting out with FromSoft games like I was it's a good place to start!Rating: 7/10 (Good)"

Positive,"In short, this game is a work of art, and it's essentially Dungeons and Dragons in videogame form and it's hard as hell, but you knew that already, it's a dark souls game for god's sake. There's nothing about this game that isn't beautiful, from the swamps of Farron keep to the Boreal valley. Each area has evidence that it was once thriving, but it's all faded now, and all we have left are nightmarish hollows that patrol the area. Seeing how dilapidated the world is creates this atmosphere of bleakness that few other works of art can match in quality and depth. The game play forces you to respect your enemy, or die an embarrassing death. You can't just spam left click and win (except if you pick easy mode, aka the knight), you have to always be patient and take your time with each encounter, which can be hard considering how aggressive some of the enemies can be. It doesn't matter what your level is, it just matters how calm and skillful you are, and I think it's amazing the game is so well balanced to allow that to happen. This game treats you with respect, and expects you to be able to keep up with it's lore and combat, and in this era of constant hand holding and linearity that caters to everyone, its refreshing to be thrown into a game with nothing but your wits and intuition. One final thing I would like to say is that if you're gonna play this game, don't look up anything about the lore, and just stick to looking up tips for bosses that you're struggling with, or some collectibles you missed, it'll make the game much more enjoyable to piece everything together through reading loading screens and from other clues."

Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is a game that compels players to persevere on the path to victory, constantly testing their endurance and decision-making skills. It is a game that presents a unique world, saturated with a dark atmosphere, terrifying monsters, and captivating bosses.One of the main advantages of Dark Souls 3 is its difficulty. The game doesn't offer players easy victories, and each obstacle presents a new challenge. This forces players to continuously improve their skills and make decisions that can impact the outcome of the game.The visual design in Dark Souls 3 is stunning. The game boasts detailed graphics that create a dark, ominous world filled with horrifying monsters and animated undead. Every element of the game is crafted with great attention to detail, creating a breathtaking atmosphere.The sound design in the game is also remarkably well-executed. The sounds recreate the atmosphere of the dark world and contribute to a sense of realism during gameplay. This adds even more immersion to the unique world.One of the drawbacks of Dark Souls 3 is that the game can be quite challenging for new players. It takes time and patience to learn how to play, and even experienced players may face difficulties in completing the game.In summary, Dark Souls 3 is a game that demands a lot of effort and patience from the player, but it also offers a unique and captivating world that compels players to persevere on the path to victory. If you're looking for a new challenge in the gaming industry, Dark Souls 3 is a game worth trying."

Positive,"EDIT: After 90 hours, beating the game twice including all DLC and optional bosses, this is by far the greatest solo player game I've ever played - no contest. Everything is a masterpiece, with a standing ovation for all the boss music. It's unlike anything I've ever played in my life.Original post: One of the best games I've ever played. The story is so rich and full of mysterious things that keep you wondering, ""wtf is this weird item for?"" And come to find out, it's a vital piece to a much bigger puzzle all along. I'm just now scratching the surface with only 35 hours put in the game so far, but good grief. If you thought this game was all about finding the big badass bosses, there's so much more than that.Quick background: I played through Dark Souls 2, but I will admit that I half-assed it. I got lazy at the end and bum-rushed through the bosses to get over with it. It's been hard to not do that with this game because there's so many things I know I'm missing. That's what makes this game so repeatable, and allows you to explore so many different builds."
Positive,"I played this game for a long time, this game is not game which you will do speed run for a couple tries.Bought this about 8/9 months ago and i played it every day litle bit. Last few days i played it alot.My opinon: This game is not for everyone, you need to be rly focused good on fights and you shouldnt be greedy to go for couple more hits.So lets talk now bout stuff in game. Story mode (Exclude DLCs) is awesome rly well done and game is allowing you to play which every boss you want mid game, thats really cool for me.DLCs: Not so good optimized when we talking about enemy attacks, it acts really weird. First Boss in Ashes of Ariandel at Cathredal is so buggy, you dodge attack but it still hits you or you attack and see that she/he got attack, but game doesnt register it and it dont lose health. The Ringed City is so hard dlc but worth to buy it, Boss fights and places are rly cool madeBuy Deluxe Edition only if you are really good focused in game and you rly want to finish every singe thing in game.MY Ratings:Graphics: 10/10 (Really well made and game is rly good optimized in that way)Story Lines: 10/10Characters Actings: 10/10Boss Fights: 9/10 (Cuz Bosses in the end are really easy to get)Soundtrack: 10/10Overral Rating: 9.8/10"

Positive,this game very relaxing
Positive,"Ahhh, I never get tired of dying in this game"
Positive,"This game... man, this game. There's so many different reason why I find this game to be incredible. I'll try to list them below, but forgive me if I miss anything obvious""- Immersive world. From the characters you meet to the lore of the game and even the multiple endings and their meanings, the story just sucks you in. What you think may be the best choices for your character end up bringing the Age of Darkness to the world. Each character is unique, every area beautifully detailed, and every single death as spectacularly frustrating as the last one. - Combat and customization. Where to even begin here? There are over 180 different weapons. While there are some weapons that share a similar moveset, it still leads to a game where each playthrough feel completely different. At this point, each of my playthroughs are usually just me randomly rolling ""What will I use this time? Will I play a pure pyromancer who forgoes all melee weapons? Will I use dark pyromancy only? Will I use Demon Scar and adopt a hybrid playstyle?"" There are so many different ways to play the game that it's hard to get bored of it all.  And for me, the combat feels fast paced, which I love. Going from Demon Souls and Dark Souls 1, where combat felt stiff, this game just brings so much to the table. Each weapon has unique weapon arts, true combos, etc. I could go on and on about the diversity of the combat. - Music. My god, the music in this game. There are days where I will just open the game and let it sit on the title screen so I can listen to it over and over. I cannot stress enough how incredible the music is for this game. When you're in the middle of a boss fight and the choir breaks out, you really start to feel that ""Okay, this is a REAL boss fight"". I don't know how they do it, but my God, they nail the music every single time. - Graphics. The first time I beat High Lord Wolnir and stepped into Irithyll Valley, I was BLOW AWAY. And it's not just this area... the whole game is beautifully dark. You can tell someone poured their heart into the design and it shows. My favorite bits are as I'm progressing and reach an area and notice ""Wow.... that's where I was the other day. It looks so small from here"". Even the enemy design is beautiful, although a bit creepy at times haha. I just can't say enough about how much love was put into their art style. I honestly cannot recommend this game enough. Even for folks who die to the first boss over and over again... keep going. I stopped playing for a while when I got stuck on a boss and came back later only to destroy them. And it made me feel on top of the world. Everyone should give this game a chance and really experience it"
Positive,"Where do i start, hearing about Dark Souls before I can remember, its incredible, I did not play the first 2 games either but learned the roped in this game, first time playing is challenging, fun, amazing. Learning abut the New Games afterwards and how it get HARDER, just keeps you playing, after a while you can play this game for chilling time.Playing with friends is a great bonding time and always nice to talk about lore (yes there is some amazing lore).I really suggest this game to anyone, with controller support, a huge community, and years of time passed for any questions you need can be answered online from older discussions, don't be scared about starting it without playing older ones. Get used to dying and learn. Link the fire!"
Positive,You should play with all your patience. Good luck...
Positive,one of the games ever made
Positive,"This game makes me want to cry with anger, disappointment and pure Unrivalled pain.10/10 would do borderline self harm again. <3"
Positive,dark souls 3
Positive,It is an ideal game and its difficulty prompts you to keep playing. I advise everyone to buy the game
Positive,yes its game
Positive,"I never imagined myself playing any of the Dark Souls games. I first delved into the series back when I bought a PS3 and played Demon Souls. I immediately returned it and chopped it up to ""I am just not into these types of games.""Recently I played The Surge and Jedi: Fallen Order, and to my surprise, really enjoyed them. So, I finally decided to install it (its been in my library forever) and give it a try. I immediately fell in love with it.The world is absolutely beautiful. In some areas you can look into the distance and see castles and keeps in the distance that you will eventually travel to. The areas themselves, except for a few choice areas (Farron Keep), are well built and really fun to explore and discover new enemy types. The bosses are fun and challenging, and will keep you on your feet. Every day I could not wait to get home and continue the story. The combat in this game is fluid and fun. I really feel like I am hitting the enemy and it makes tearing down that next tough enemy all the more rewarding. I love RPGs, and this game really scratches that itch. The level up system is cool and rewarding. I believe that it does take time to really feel the effects of leveling up, but after a while you can really see your character developing into what you want them to be. The amount of weapons is staggering. From what I had read when beginning the game, every weapon is viable throughout the entire game. Some will be stronger of course, but in the end, does not matter all that much. Getting to level up your weapons is an added bonus that really starts to make you feel powerful.The story is pretty confusing to be honest. I am not sure if it is due to the fact that this is the first game in the series I completed, but I did need to look up the lore to understand what was happening. You can very easily miss important story items if you do not look hard enough. This is fine, I know that this is part of the charm of the series. I still enjoyed reading about the lore online and putting the puzzle pieces together. For a game that tells almost no story, there is so much there. I don't know how, but it just works.Even though there were times in this game that were infuriating, this game is now one of my top 5 favorite games of all time. I cannot believe it took me so long to play this game. Do yourself a favor and play this. Do not let the difficulty keep you away because it really is not all that bad.Now I just want to give Demon Souls another chance. Fingers crossed that the remastered edition will release on Steam! And Bloodborne too. Let us have that too!"
Positive,"Now after I've finshed the game (and all DLC) i can finally say this is a great game and i love it.Don't play this unless you fucking hate yourself, and only wish to torture and scream your lungs out.Honestly it's majestic."
Positive,My favourite game in the world <3
Positive,I can't stop playing help
Positive,This Game Is So Cool And Challenging Its Better To Try It :D

Positive,"Well I started playing this with beating it as a goal. Next thing I knew i had 300+ hours spent on it and I was aiming for the Dark Soul achievement. There is no one way to beat Dark Souls, you can always create your challenges and then overcome them or you can learn the easiest way to beat an area/boss and then use that knowladge to breeze through the game. This game is as hard as you make it to be. And this game teaches you through dying so embrace it. Don't give up skeleton!"
Positive,"Absolutely awesome game. I had heard over the years that the Dark Souls series was among the harder games on the market. For this reason, I wanted the challenge and to see what it was like for myself. From an incredibly immersive and rich atmosphere and storyline to exciting combat and gear, this game did not disappoint whatsoever. It did an excellent job living up to its challenging reputation, and left me constantly wanting to keep playing to get past that one difficult stage. It had me hooked very quickly. I found myself retrying things just for the fun of it, looking for different tactics and always looking forward to seeing that next campfire where I can take a break. The boss fights and strenuous combat always had me on the edge of my seat. The graphics always have me taking a moment to look around, and take a look at that sweet sweet armour. A variety of weapons allowed for me to fine-tune my character to a play style I enjoy, and let me savour every second I spent in combat. There is plenty to customise and experience and I always strive for a better piece of gear. There are many combat concepts that allow for your fighting style to be diverse and to be played as you wish to play it. Slow, heavy weapons to lighter quick ones, shields, and so on. Other combat mechanics, like backstab for example, allow for an even MORE diverse playstyle and combat system. (Note that there is much more than just backstab.. Not to mention, magic! Always a treat). Dark Souls continuously has me hooked on the game and fully immersed, eyes on the screen and nowhere else. With such a well-built world that is so immersive in so many ways, why would I want to look away? At this time, with only 57 hours on record, I still find myself working on my character build and improving myself. I am far from completing the deep story and find myself repeatedly distracted looking for some special items. The game is NOT pay to win, which I am thankful for and value in a game. There is no pop-up every few minutes to buy some special sword for 50 bucks. You are left to the game, and that is that. Character customisation allows for you to upgrade specific stats to what you wish, which will impact your abilities. Each stat will have their own effect. For example, some weapons require more strength to wield. The game is also NOT something quickly completed. I often find myself bored when I play through a game where you beat it in an hour with max-level gear. Dark Souls 3 is not like that, and has a lot to discover with a large amount of gameplay. Things do not happen fast, you will not level your stats and get better gear from a single quest. It will take time and will keep you immersed for a long period of time, at least for me personally. A lot of the game's solemn, dark aesthetic was extremely satisfying and felt great to explore. It all has a certain tone to it that makes me want to keep playing even more. There is nothing quite like the feeling of finally beating a boss you have spent hours not just fighting, but reaching. And the relief of seeing that campfire afterwards is like none other. Dark Souls never fails to send a shiver up my spine from how good everything looks and how satisfying everything is. They do not go easy on you, and make it very challenging yet not impossible. It certainly lives up to its reputation. DS3 is regarded as one of the most challenging games of the series, being known to many people as one of the hardest games ever.. Take that how you like, and form your own opinion on that one. Note my profile picture.. The aesthetic of the game draws me in and I find it incredible to look at, to the point of changing my pfp to match it. Personally, the game is worthy of the hype and high ratings, and I look forward to working more at the game and getting better. I love the game and will be happily spending much more time on it in hopes of finally beating it. To this day, it does not disappoint whatsoever. After some time off my computer due to my computer sucking.. I look forward to jumping back into this. I should also note, while I am at it, that the game runs surprisingly well, even on my 7 year old computer that can hardly run anything. I did not have to dull down the impressive graphics at all, and it continues to run smoothly. The money, in my opinion, is certainly worth it. You will get a lot of bang for your buck as well as hours upon hours of good times. Especially with the sale on currently, I think the game is worth picking up. 10/10. Happy soul gathering :)"
Positive,Roll roll and roll
Positive,This is quite possibly the greatest game of all time.
Positive,"Darksouls 3 is so far the most infuriating game that I have ever had the pleasure of playing. I play a lot of games on hard difficulty and yet this game was able to make me genuinely angry. There are multiple things that I am going to talk about in this review but this is again from my perspective of the game.The first thing is that I played through the game experiencing stuttering due to what I can assume is hard drive problems. The graphics weren't the problem so I had to do further investigation and found that many people were saying it was something to do with how the game played on hard drives. The community has around 3 sides which are those that cause utter chaos and respond to anyone asking for help with “git gud”, those that try their best to help and guide you through the game, and those that strictly play offline to avoid people. The graphics for the game are nice and its design is interesting. The weapon upgrade system is nice and decently balanced. One of the main issues I had with the game was that your first run of the game would be absolutely brutal. Someone who hasn't played a previous Darksouls game and isn't used to hard difficulty will get very frustrated and give up. However this is only for the first run of the game, my 2nd and 3rd runs of the game were easy and I was able to complete many of the bosses in one go. Most of the bosses you will either beat first try or end up dying a lot until you figure out the move sets they use. My favorite bosses were champion gundyr and darkeater midir. Covenants are somewhat grindy but add some motivation in the game to either invade people or help them. Playing with friends is fun but is a little tricky sometimes to get to work. I found getting to the boss was much more difficult than the boss itself which at times was very infuriating, I would die 8 times to mobs only to kill the boss on the first go. The biggest thing that I can say that was more annoying than the invaders, lag, and bosses was that when you play with a mouse and keyboard, certain keys have multiple functions. So when I would swing my sword it had a 25% chance to kick the enemy. The amount of times I died to such a thing is utter bull, the fact that you couldn't change it in the settings was even bigger. The community response was a shrug or “git gud”. The walls do not function as walls a lot of the time as well, you can hit enemies right through them. Another thing that can happen is if you are falling the edges of whatever you land on become a slip and slide, usually ending in your demise. A lot of the people I talked to said that you were supposed to get satisfaction from killing the bosses that you died so much at, it didn't feel like that to me. It felt like I was dragging my fat f***ing nuts through the farron swamp water. I actually went throughout the game saying it was sh*t for about the entire first playthrough. In the end this game was an experience and I GREATLY RECOMMEND THE GAME to any who want to contemplate their life choices and possibly break something you own. It's just something you have to try for yourself to see. The ending scenes were some of the most beautiful that I have seen in games and its lore is decent as well. I felt the ringed city DLC was far more worth it than ashes of Ariandel. Better bosses and much more to do.-Bubblez approved"
Positive,Invading be like uuuuuuuuuuuh yea CONNECTION ERROR OCCURRED
Positive,Excelente jogo e está vivo até hoje.
Positive,"Love this game its a fitting ending to the series. Characters are great and there's allot of throwbacks to Dark Souls 1. Siegward's so awesome ""Long may the son shine""."
Positive,its like dark souls 1 but instead of 1 its 3
Positive,"Dark Souls III has been one of the most unforgettable gaming experiences I have had. It is truly a modern gaming classic and would recommend it to anyone (who doesn't lose their patience easily). There are almost too many different things to look into and collect and that can be daunting. There's also a huge learning curve for learning the combat mechanics. I can safely say, this is a fantastic game though. It has a very grim and lovecraftian-esque theme with larger than life ambiance which is integrated into characters and environment. As far as replayability, I can't say I would play this game over and over. Maybe 4 playthroughs. It is super challenging and fun overall though and I highly recommend it."
Positive,100% worth it
Positive,best game of all time .
Positive,"Love the game, it has beaten my ass so much into submissions that i learned to love it.10/10 would die again eternal servitude."

Positive,"Easier than the other souls games, but has a lot more to offer."
Positive,"This is such a great masterpiece.Even u are a new to pc or a veteran u will feel the pressure throughout your progression in this game.Each boss is a challage which mean u need to surpass it.But to surpass them won't be so easy.I recommend this game for you if you love fantasy (little bit dark in here :V) and 1 player game.If u played some MMORPG,u will definitely love DS3 becuz it also have pvp online.The atmosphere will make you fall over it.I love this game so much <3"
Positive,Its a really good game but be aware if you buy a DLC and play dark souls 3 and you want to refund the DLC after you play when you refund it you can't play on the same character again unless you buy back the DLC other then that GREAT game
Positive,"Although I might have died a TON this game kept me trying again and again and again and again until I rather beat the part/boss I have been stuck on, or summon some random guy who usually curb stomps the boss for me. This game can take a decent amount of time to beat depending how fast you pick up the mechanics, and learn how to read your enemies. This game has given me allot of replayability through trying different weapons as there are a fair selection of weapons that work different from all the others. -many weapons(magic,swords,great swords,ultra greats words,axes,great axes, hammers, halberds, spears, shields that you can parry with, shields you can absorb tons of damage with, ect.)-sense of accomplishment when you beat a boss you have been stuck on-Can play offline, with a friend(you will be at risk of being invaded by other players if you are playing online and you are embered), you can also invade other peoples worlds for PVP     In conclusion good game it is."
Positive,"This game is a pure masterpiece! I love every second of it. At first it seems as a very hard, nerve destroying game, but after playing it for a while, you really change your mind. Initially, I bought it as a challenge to brag to my friends, but then i fell in love with this game. It is sure holding a spot in my ALL TIME favorite games. I would really recommend it to anyone.And don't forget to..."

Positive,"Is is hard? Yes. But if you can't git gud, just call a friend and it gets a lot easier.(the inicial statement is just to try and make people who are too afraid of the difficulty of DS games to try DS3 out, because it's an amazing game and everyone should try it)Really, just play it. If you like RPGs, if you like character building, if you like deep, intricate lores and interesting NPCs, just play it."
Positive,"The definition of depressingly beautiful, the game suggests you play it as it is: defeat the bad guys and save the world.And this is how I went through my playthrough. It took me about 130 hours to beat the game, that's considering I went through the trouble of exploring every nook and cranny, defeating every unique enemy, picking up any orb I see, and admiring any view I would stumble across.From the walk out to the Last Flame and seeing all the destroyed ruins to the view of Anor Londo, this game, despite being labeled a difficult game, intrigues you enough to complete it despite your tumbling. However, once you beat the game, look into the lore, I am in no ways a lore guy, and lore bores the fuck out of me, but hearing how the world had evolved in this game had passed, makes you almost feel bad for completing the game."
Positive,"The third installation of the franchise whic is the Dark Souls of the Dark Souls in terms of difficulty, artwork, gameplay and longevity was in shelves almost three years ago but it is still capable to amaze in how much this game is well produced, directed and build.For the  hardcore fans it would be the not ""grandiose"" ending of one of the most acclaimed RPG franchise of the last decade that maybe they waited for, but it would be a great one nonetheless, and for those that approach this type of game for the first time, probably is the best chapter to ""start"" with. As a matter of fact, you cannot actually start a story in any Dark Soul ,because the narration always sets you in a moment of time where the great events that shook that cycle (because time is cyclical in Dark Souls) are long past and you are the last, dying breath of that world whic is ready to lay down and die (and in many,many,many occasions, bring you down with him) and let you explore an almost barren landscape wich in reality is brimming with life. And death. Mostly with death.As always, the narration is not built around long and meaningful dialogues by the characters we meet ( even if that dialogues often are short but always meaningful, in their way) but mainly by the items we collect through our journey, and that is one of the greatness of this game, the capacity of make you wonder what is happened way before you where there, and to connect the dots in your own unique way, to have the story leading according to your likings.And as the story unravels in front of you, discretely the world with his now various ambients wich merges almost perfectly with one another makes you cherish every single ""level"" thanks to their variety of ambients, enemies and bosses wich are  uniques in their own way, with very little exceptions that are, with a great trick of the plot, greatly justified.The gameplay, with the adding of the ""Weapons Art"" is more fluid than ever and where the past combat animation where either hand-mande but beautiful, or with the mo-cap but stiffy and repeated, all now feels unique in their way, with the animations, special attacks and skills well crafted with both a good mo-cap and computer elaboration. As always every boss fight have its own unique musical theme, whic are majestic and greatly composed, and resonate with the silence whic is omnipresent in the world, where we can only hear our steps and the cry of agony of our foes. Same as for the past installations, the DLC's are a gorgeous addiction and the story do not feels complete without them, so it's greatly recommended to purchase all of them.In conclusion, Dark Souls III is a masterpiece whic every single RPGs fan, and none, should hold in his hands and play it, because not only is one of the cornerstones of the genre, but also a very engaging and challenging game that will make you feel like every single victory in the game, is a victory in real life."

The graphics are stunning, combat is fluid and the music and voice acting is just phenomenal.Don't buy this game if you have no patience to learn. Because it will only punish you by bringing tears and anger upon you.10/10 Git Gud or Die Tryin'"
Positive,"I cannot recommend this game enough. I love it , my favourite of the soul series. Visuals are stunning , bosses are interesting , gameplay is fun and dynamic. Difficulty curve is real. Game is great fun , and the PvP scene - which is the true end game - is very much alive and well , beware of trolls and grievers though. But that is just a feature which makes the game more HARDCORE ! Minor bugs - also called features that make the game more HARDCORE !Sometimes you due to the camera controls....a feature which just makes the game more HARDCORE !Praise the sun , git gud , and die !"
Positive,"Yes this game has been out for some time now, but still i wanted to give an opinion. This game made me fall in love with RPG games, especially Dark Souls. The atmosphere is just right. Its great that there's this mixed feeling of an open world and linear gameplay, it makes it worth exploring but not too difficult to find your way. The PvP is a bit less great, its been improved over the time but still backstabs dont work great. sometimes you hit somebody but it doesnt damage. This is no problem for people playing offline. I also really enjoy the adding of weapon arts, it gives combat a way different style and makes incredible combo's possible. For me, this is an amazing game."
Positive,"its beautiful game, the music ,gameplay, weapons, mechanics, boss, traps, every dam thing is good in this game. i dont say its hard game, its just u have to be careful at every time in game, assume you are level 400 and if u careless, any enemy can kill you in  2-3 hits, and all npc including friendly and non friendly can killable. the key part of game is ""what you have done is done its cannot be undone"" , wethere u do it in purpose or by mistake, game doesnt care about that.This game also tells you that you should never give up, i really learned from this game, i have spend about a whole day for killing 1 boss, and the satisfaction u get from killing or achiving is amazing, u dont get it anywhere.one advice if you are not played and want to buy thisjust blindly go for it. and never watch any guide, walkthorugh or any kind of video, because it will be more fun in that way, i still wish i forget about this game everything and start as a new, its amazing feelingPraise the sun"
Positive,"about 300 hours of playtime hereFor begginners this game is indeed difficult especially if your new to the souls series like i was this game will train your reaction timing and your usual play style with other rpg type gamesalthough it is difficult there is no better feeling than finally defeating a boss that was giving you trouble for hours straight dont give up keep trying you get better every time, the gameplay of this game is amazing and the designs theyve put into the different areas such as irithyll and the castle , for those who are not sure if they should buy the game or not i can say it is deffiniently worth it"

YesWill this game confuse you time and time again with its cryptic storytelling? YesWill you get stuck in an area and ultimatley rage quit after attempting to speedrun the area? YesWill you kill the Nameless King first try? NoWill you upgrade luck? Maybe on accident"
Positive,"I bought this game on release and forgot to write a review. This is perhaps my favourite game of the last couple of years. It takes the Souls games formula to perfection. While the lore in this game seems to be tailored to old time fans, with all its references to the first game, it still stands alone as an example of exquisite craftsmanship. It's extremely rich in content, and both of the DLC's are awesome.Overall for me an absolute 10/10. I love it <3"
Positive,"Among all the games I've playedThrough out all the places that i have beenAnd beyond all the emotions I've felt.This is where my heart belongs, This is my comfort zone.Where it pushed me to be a better person and persevere through out hard times.Thank You Dark Souls.

Positive,"The Souls series contains the perfect games I could've just wished for, and the third installation of the series is absolutely the most polished one of it. I could talk about for like ages and ages how incredible the atmosphere is, or the visual- and world design, original soundtrack and the implementation of the lore into the gameplay and the world itself, but all of that has been written before, all across the web. And no, Dark Souls is not only about how hard is it, this trilogy offers something which you just can not find in any other title (besides Demon's Souls and Bloodborne). Since I played FROMSOFTWARE's masterpieces, I can't truly enjoy and sink hours and hours into other games anymore...Why would I? I have Dark Souls."
Positive,DARK SOULS 3This is an awesom game & sequel. One of my all time favorites. What do you get by buying it?    Challeging Gameplay    Great Story    Great Soundtrack    Great NPC's    Awesome Bosses    Awesome Atmosphere    Awesome Memes    Active Community    Lots of Weapons    Jolly Cooperation    And many more
Positive,"I got this game on sale for fifteen dollars. I was so excited because of how people are rating the game, and I would have to say this game is an easy 10/10 its fun challenging but fair. It rewards the grinders or the hardcore badasses who enjoy the game and you can joing random people at anytime which you can help or hunt. I would HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun challenge"
Positive,Overall brilliant game! The easiest Souls game to date and worth every cent. Dark Souls III offers a more polished (noob Friendly) set of mechanics and the enemies are more forgiving. Great game to sink plenty of hours into. It's a game that new players to the Souls series can get into and have a blast.
Positive,My Favorite game. 10/10 very exited for Dark souls 1 Remaster
Positive,Best Game ever
Positive,"Para mi el mejor de los 3 sin dudarlo. Las cosas que tiene este juego superaron ampliamente sus 2 entregas anteriores.  Muchísima más variedad de enemigos,  (lo que diré a continuación no se si contará como spoiler pero lo pongo como si fuera uno, no quiero arruinarle la sorpres a nadie)  GRAN VARIEDAD DE JEFES QUE SON DOBLES O REVIVEN MÁS PODEROSOS , online muy activo, gente que está dispuesta a ayudarte en el chat de grupo que hay en la comunidad de este juego, podes jugar con contraseña para jugar con tu amigo que recién empieza sin tener que crearte un personaje nuevo (se balancea), jefes hermosos (como la bailarina ♥) y una gran cantidad de escenarios bien hechos.Lo único malo que podría decir, es que hay lugares que consumen muchos más recursos. El dlc Ringed City me va a 15-19 fps cuando la campaña principal (excepto el Pico Archidragon) me corre a 30.  pd: en que estaban pensando cuando crearon el Principe Demonio, From Software?"
Positive,"Who never played, will never understand why is this game top rated.I can only say that its fabulous."
Positive,This game is just another dark souls clone. Oh wait...
Positive,"One of my favorite games of all time! Amazing fighting system, beautiful design, very hard (The hardest one of the franchise, in my opinion), amazing soundtrack, a few bugs (Nothing serious), pretty cool pvp system, among other things.This game is near perfect."
Positive,"What is there to say about this game ?!After a good but still disappointing Sequel to Dark Souls they managed to make a game that is closer to the first game but better in almost everyway !If you liked the previous games you'll love this one !And the last DLC is a must-have, everything looks great (areas, weapons, armors, etc...), it's really challengin and it brings a closure to the franchise (and added lore).Pros: Challenging gameBeautiful sceneryGreat PVPAwesome mechanicsCons:The anti-cheat isn't worth anythingMage class feels rubbish"

Positive,Game is amazing love it rage at it but the feeling of just swishing your sword gives you that manly feeling
Positive,"I love it, tons of fun with friends."
Positive,it's...nice...the dogs in this game have just reassured my hatred for their kind -.-
Positive,"Tip from someone who recently beat the game.You can use the cord for your controller to hang yourself.Due to many responses as to having wireless controllers bash your head with it until you forget about the game or you die doing it.I've completed the game and yet, I'm not satisfied."
Positive,Gwynevere where you at
Positive,darksoul's is like anal hurt's like a bitch for the first little while then you start to really enjoy it
Positive,"Before I say anything else, this was my first Souls experience, including Bloodborne.People have said you need a controller, and that's absolutely not true - I started the game with M/KB thinking I'd get as far as I could at least, and wound up beating the whole thing without being annoyed about controls, including the endgame optional boss with keyboard and mouse. For those who like controllers, go for it obviously, but for those of us who strongly prefer M/KB, it's a perfectly servicable option. That said, control labels will be off, so you'll need to remember that X and Y correspond to E and F, respectively, and a few other oddities. Oh, and you have to exit to main menu and press a button to exit the game. Or Alt+F4, which it complains about, but I did it anyway.In every other regard, it's a great PC port, and I had no performance issues, etc, and the mouse movement felt great to me. Mouse support in menus was a welcome surprise.The game itself is a masterpiece. I can't remember the last time I played a game that was able to make me this frustrated but keep me playing. The difficulty curve is a little all over the place - I found the last few bosses much easier than some of the midgame bosses - but the whole ""Dark Souls is hard"" narrative is pretty correct. There's very little room for error in most fights, and it gets harder as you go on, for the most part. What's interesting is that they managed to make the progression of your character feel meaningful while increasing that difficulty, which is a place many games screw up, either by making the player overpowered or by having to pull a macguffin and remove abilities to make boss fights hard or something. This game does none of that, but you do feel like you're getting somewhere as you level up.The enemy design is pretty spectacular, although there's some ""oh, Japan..."" moments. It's fun to see a Japanese game set in Western fantasy, though. It's an interesting cultural perspective.In terms of the game design, there's some obtuse stuff; unhelpfully named items, a number of poorly-explained mechanics (parrying, damage scaling, weapon upgrades), arcane NPC plots, and quest-crucial stuff being hidden will all have you looking things up online. Let's just say this is a good game to have a second monitor for. I can't imagine what people playing this on their living room TV would have done. I guess iPads are a thing now.Speaking of which, while I can see this being the kind of game that would appeal to people who want to find out everything on their own no matter how long it takes, for the rest of us there are some really excellent walkthroughs and guides out there. Without that kind of assistance, I would never have gotten through the game; I would have missed something important, gotten frustrated, and done something else.I feel like a lot of diehard fans are going to look at me like a casual tourist scrub, and you know, they're not wrong. I don't really play games to prove something, but for entertainment, and while this game did force me to step up my game, and did make me really frustrated in parts (Dancer of the Boreal Valley was a personal low point) being able to finally get past something that's been stumping you for an hour or two is really satisfying. Despite all the flaws - and I DO view the obtuse stuff as flaws - I enjoyed the heck out of this game. I would recommend this game to anyone who thinks they're up for a challenge.Also, for what is technically a JRPG, this game is amazingly light on cutscenes, even by Western standards. Like damn. Still had a full-DBZ-mode moment or two in it, though. And no shortage of helmets worn so far forward they're actually blindfolds.Final opinion:8/10 Gud Sh!t Here"
Positive,>Get summoned into catacombs>wait till team thinks im afk>they go ahead and i take a shortcut>activate a trap and a boulder falls right on them and kills them both.>10/10 would betray their trust again.
Positive,I haven't even finished downloading this game yet and I can already feel the endless agony.
Positive,"Not an RPG fan,but the game just so awesome.Never get tired of killing bosses and collecting stuff.I like the map design.PVP part also exciting.Now I got to save money for PS4 and Bloodborne.xD.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"
Positive,"Great game even for people new to the Souls franchise, infact I would recommend this to someone who has'nt played a Souls game before because it is the most polished and refined souls game. It can can be very challenging at times but equally rewarding with a great sense of achievement. The lore in the Souls games is some of the best I ever come across in any game. Great RPG mechanics with optional PVP if your into it. By no means am I a good player but the game still managed to keep me invested in advanceing the story, all in all a great game well worth a playthrough you won't be  disapointed."
Positive,"award-winning, genre-defining Golden Joystick Awards 2016 Game of the year RPG. Journey to the world’s end to search for the Ringed City and encounter new lands, new bosses, new enemies with new armor, magic and items. Experience the epic final chapter of a dark world that could only be created by the mind of Hidetaka Miyazaki. A New World. One Last Journey."
Positive,"This epic game ruined all other action RPGs for me through and through. The community aspect of the game is one of the best parts of the game for me personally. Truly you see all sorts of people in the game, from the nice ones to the a-holes but people are generally awesome for the most part. I've had many positive experiences with players from all over the world and made a couple of really good friends from it too.The game is also versatile enough for you to be able customise your gaming experience and how you choose to enjoy the game. For example, I enjoy mainly PvE and jolly co-op but I know of others who love duelling PvP or solely invading. You can level up as high as you want or finish the game in as low level as possible for a sadistic challenge. The possibilities are endless! And I don't need to go on about how absolutely GORGEOUS the game is because the other reviewers here have already said it for me. I love this game so much and it is truly a masterpiece and in a league of its own. I see myself sinking another 100 hours into it easily. Having played Demon's Souls and now DS3, I look forward to gitting gud/rekt in DS1 and DS2. I really want to learn more about the lore and play the entire Souls series!"
Positive,"Great Game, fun and addictive! you are going to die a lot, so git gud!"
Positive,"Great game, This was my first souls game and i love it... this is probably one of my favorites sagas right now"
Positive,Fun and Challenging.
Positive,"Definetly Reccomend, Its hard but the challenge is fun!"
Positive,I returned it cause I was a filthy casual but now can only think about rebuying it
Positive,"Start Dark Souls 1 with all the fear in the world in your body, end Dark Souls 3 running arround naked with a giand log of wood swinging arround. 10/10 would recommend."
Positive,"2016:Best Game to buy this Christmas. Grants you the need to to purchase new keyboard and mouse through its various means of succesfully impacting you with emotional and psychological trauma.2018:Dank souls 3 best geme ecks dee <32019:Ah shit, here we go again"
Positive,"This game is a masterpieceDark Souls 3 is the best game in the Souls series.It looks amazing, sounds incredible, plays amazing.One of the most beautiful things about Dark Souls III is the music. The music is simply stunning! It fits perfectly in every area and it really gets you into the dark atmosphere that surrounds the Kingdom of Lothric. The cutscenes are also very well made and really get you hyped to get into the game to learn more about its dark story. The diologue voice acting is very well done and makes you actually want to listen to what the characters have to say.This Game is not hard like Dark Souls 1 or 2, is better for cassual players, but still have good story and dont exist soul memory and is playlable with friends becus exist password system.Bosses are so good that you want to be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by them.Design and Artstyle are Amazing10/10"
Positive,Is a pretty good game. Helped me cope with my crippling depression.
Positive,"This game is beautiful  not just graphically,  but emotionally. I was invading as a mad spirit in farron's woods.  I find the host and their summon. ""Oh boy,  I'm going to get ganked,"" I think to myself, ""maybe I can fool them into trusting me. "" I put my weapons up, wave at them,  ""HELLO"" the carving drops. They seem less tense,  so I drop a seed of a giant tree.  I point down at it and back away,  sitting down to wait for then to take the bait.  They do it,  use it.  It's time to jump for joy and they do so back.  We fight through countless enemies in a poison swamp,  make our way up a tall tower,  and there's the mini-boss. Time for the fight.Minding my spacing to not hit my allies, we take the fiend down.  Their healths' low, I could finish them in one hit.  ""No,  not yet"" I think aloud.  I'll let them get to a bonfire.  We progress,  jump down a cliff.  I lost my control, I go for the plunging attack but in midair I realize I'd hesitated too long.  I turn around so it seems like it was an accident.  They both lock onto me.  ""Oh no,  this is it."" I walk past as if nothing happened. ... and it worked!We continue through deadly swamp and basilisk,  large demons tromp through but we persist.  We reach a new bonfire,  the poison has eaten the host to the last of their health.  ""I could hit them now and it would all be over."" No,  I can't it would be wrong. We've fought together for 30+ minutes,  and I've done it all for no souls since I was an invader.  The host lights the bonfire. .. and sits there.  They waited to for the poison to finish them off,  I get my vertebra shackle, and bow. HOST OF EMBERS DEFEATEDThis game has made me feel things."
Positive,"The words ""You Died"" have been plastered into the back of my skull. Thank you Dark Souls."
Positive,rage k thank you
Positive,"This is one of the greatest games of all time. Its probably the best game I've ever played. You get used to dying and the best tip is when you die it's either part of the game, i.e you're not a high enough level yet, or it was your fault. Its hard but so worth every controller that gets broken in the progress, worth every curse at loved ones and once you've completed it you get to go through all of it all over again!Get souls Praise the sun ☀"
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is like a easier version of Dark Souls 1 with the only real issues being 3 puzzle bosses and so much fan service that you can't tell if the game has anything new to add to the series character wise.This being my first real Dark Souls game as I didn't really get into Dark Souls 2 as the P.V.E was totally crazy with horrible hitboxes and insane amounts of enemies being placed in single locations while lacking else where.I have already pumped about 30 hours into the game as I am writing this review and I am yet to try out the P.V.P as I am slightly intimidated by how bad the netcode is and how good people are.Edit: Alright I have put about a solid 20 hours into P.V.P and invasions and I can safely say that it isn't as good as Dark Souls 2 but better than Dark Souls 1. Invasions are annyoing because of multiple opponents going up against you most of the time and it's likely that you die quickly upon entering the world. P.V.P is very basic with many weapons performing better than others and magic and that meaning that those weapons are very common to find. But diversity is possible and you can get away with doing pretty much anything as long as you just make sure that you know how to use your weapon.I have heard that this game is the easiest out of all of the games in the Souls series and it shows for the first couple of bosses but other than this slight difficulty issue that games is great.On to the issues with the first bosses is how easy they are with all of them having small health bars and the only difficult you might have is with trying to use magic on them. They also hit weakly meaning that if you don't just stand there and tank and just get hit once or twice then you will be fine for the most part.Currently this review is still in development but as I experience more and more of the game I will keep on updating this review.SUMMARY:Dark Souls 3 is a great game I recommend for new players of the series with the only faults being easy early game bosses and pretty much all bosses in general having a low health bar with all this being topped of with a pretty linear P.V.P. system.Apart from that I have to say that Dark Souls 3 is a great game with plenty of challenge for newer players but not as much for veterans of the series.Overall this game is very solid and is deserving of 8/10.EDIT: The game is great and that's what I already have said. But this game suffers from some very big and quite glaring issues.The start of this game from the 3rd Area (2nd non-tutorial area) to the 6th area (5th non-tutorial area) are just annoying and slow. The enemies are slow and annoying and are full of horrible concepts that weren't executed right. The places themselves are plain and just ugly. The bosses (not including the 6/5th area boss) are easy. That entire part of the game is just... Not very fun on consecutive runs.After that the game is just infinitely better. Apart from the Dungeon.I hate that place.I wish they could have just done something exciting and fun for those 3 areas and not just some bland and not fun areas.Otherwise this game is great and feels a lot less clunky then Dark Souls 1 and a lot less annoying than Dark Souls 2.The bonfire placement in this game is needless to say kind of silly. Some bonfires being only 10 metres away.Apart from these issues and bosses having really small health pools in the start of the game this game is great.The DLC has come out quite recently and after playing it I can confim that PVP has been fixed to a certain extent. The DLC has added a whole new area and an arena, as well as two bosses, pne being average and the other being amazing. Once again I cannot recommend this game enough as it is an amazing game to enter the souls series with if you haven't already."
Positive,"Thank you FromSoftware; as a bored adult gamer, you’ve brought the real joys of gaming to me once again.TL;DR: Been getting bored of games fairly quickly in the last few years and didn’t seem to have much attention span for most. Then bought Dark Souls 3 when it came out as my first ever Souls game in the series, got massively hooked and felt the real joys of gaming again. Bought the other 2 as well as a PS4 so I could play Bloodborne and now I’m a complete addict!I have been a gamer since I remember, and now in my early 30’s, for the past few years, I found myself getting bored of games very quickly. From AAA’s to indie games I’d mostly end up playing them just so I can beat them and be done with them so I could move on to the next title, like ticking chores off a list, and quite often not even bother finishing the game at all (I’m sorry The Divinity, you were one of the better games I played recently!)I’d known about the Soul games for years, but had been hesitant to even try them for fear of frustration and boredom from their infamous difficult gameplay and the countless deaths phenomena. Until a few months ago I saw an interesting video that delved deep into the Soul games’ sense of exploration, and the rewarding factor of the games - something I truly realised later on when I played the games - so i decided to pick up Dark Souls 3 upon its release a couple of months ago. After countless hours of frustration and deaths (as expected), I realised I must be doing something wrong; I may not be a real hardcore gamer, but surely I can’t be that bad? That’s when I decided to read up on the games mechanics, stats system, guides on how to play as a noob, what starter class to pick, guides on parrying and so on and on and on. So I started a new game, picked up a knight and started to play properly. Never have I ever found myself so immersed in a game in such a long long time. I invested so much time in the game, not only by playing, but also reading up about every bit of the game - something that I’d barely and rarely done with any game before, unless it was a little walkthrough through some section of some game I was stuck at or some such. I studied the maps and made sure I missed not a single item. I read up on all different NPC’s and quest lines to make sure I’d make the most of the play-through, something I realised later wasn’t possible to achieve in just one play-through. So not so shockingly, I started the NG+ once I beat the game so I can achieve 100% achievement completion: an idea that I would’ve laughed off at in any previous games that I’d played. “Who gives a damn about achievements?""Nonetheless, I loved this game so much I bought the kickstarter board game and the other 2 Soul games in the series, which I’m yet to play because I ended up buying a PS4 (that came with Uncharted4) just so I can play Bloodborne. Yes, I’m really that much affected (read: obsessed) by these games. And Bloodborne: what an utterly gorgeous game. It’d probably come as to no surprise at this rate to say that I even ordered the game’s guidebook, to save myself from countless amounts of internet checking (which I still do anyway!). I could write a long post about how amazing this game is but I’ll save that for another time!So thank you again FromSoftware for making some of the most amazing games in all my years of gaming experience, and bringing back the joys of gaming again to this bored-no-more adult gamer. My wallet may hate your guts, but I love you."
Positive,"To preface my thoughts on Dark Souls 3 I should provide some background information about my experiences with the Fromsoft series as a whole.I started playing the series at Dark Souls, I never got the chance to play Demon Souls and now the graphics are a bit too outdated for me to want to go back and run through it. I had about 500 hours on Dark Souls for PS3 (which is why I dont have many hours for it on Steam) it has been by far my favourite game. I also extensively played Bloodborne on PS4 and Dark Souls 2 on both PS4 and on Steam (would estimate around 300 hours for Dark Souls 2). In addition to loving the game mechanics I also actively read up and watch Youtube video's on the lore behind the series as I find the Fromsoft version of storytelling to be quite compelling if you dive deep enough.With that out of the way, as many people have said I will rehash, Dark Souls 3 is a fantastic game. It captures all of the essence of Dark Souls while adding some good things Dark Souls 2 implemented like the bonfire fast travel. With that being said it's not as good as Dark Souls in my opinion but it is a fantastic game and if that's what you're looking for then stop now and buy this game. The mechanics are much more refined and the areas are absolutely beautiful in this game. The weapon and upgrading system is as good as it's been with many options for different playstyles. There doesn't seem to be such an easy way to progress in this game as some of the other entries in the series. For example, in Dark Souls the sorcerer class was pretty good throughout the game and it was a solid path if you were just starting out so you could learn the mechanics from a distance. In Dark Souls 3 there are bosses that favour someone using a melee build and bosses that punish it, bosses that favour miracles/pyromancies/spells and bosses that punish it. The challenging gameplay has always been the staple of this series and Dark Souls 3 doesn't hold back. It's as hard as any of the other games with bosses that are just as memorable as some of the favourites (O&S). Adding in the two phase boss fights was a really perfect way to keep replayability high and making you feel on edge the first time you make it to the second phase of a fight. This game also has the hardest boss in the entire series in my opinion, one who shall not be named or spoiled. One thing that sucks is there are some gimmicy bosses but they are mainly optional. In addition to being memorable and having solid mechanics there is also a lot of lore to most of the bosses if you're into that sort of thing. Dark Souls 3 embrases the lore and progress the timeline since Dark Souls where Dark Souls 2 tried to disregard the original. If you're a fan of Dark Souls then you probably already have had this game since launch like I did but if not there is a very nice callback area to the original.My one and only complaint about this game is the enemies and their surrounding areas. Dark Souls and even Dark Souls 2 to a degree had areas where it felt rewarding and almost necessary to kill the enemies in the area you are trying to progress through. Dark Souls 3's enemies and areas feel useless and it's almost a waste of time to clear the areas. My first playthrough I cleared all enemies before progressing as normal but on my second playthrough and beyond it just became exhausting to keep killing enemies that yield little souls and only annoy me, so I end up just running from bonfire to boss, to bonfire to boss, until I've defeated the last boss.I really love this series and this game is no exception. Though I think it's a bit inferior to Dark Souls it is by far my favourite game so far in the year and one of my favourites since I last played Dark Souls. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves a challenge both in boss design and area design.TL;DRPros+Great boss mechanics+Great boss lore (if you're into that sort of thing)+Immediate fast travel+Tons of weapons and spells+Great upgrading and infusion system+Signature replayabilityCons-Enemies get annoying to kill so I end up running from boss to boss-Some areas are really annoying (you know which ones if you've played the game)"
Positive,"Much like the first Dark Souls, this game is difficult and requires a lot of patience to down the epic and challenging bosses and the, sometimes, much stronger enemies.The fact that Dark Souls III returns to the roots of Dark Souls (and Demon's Souls to a lesser extent) is incredibly exciting and I had an awesome time playing this installment. As someone who struggles to stay interested in a game for longer than a couple of hours, I've got 100+ hours clocked into DS3 and I still want to play more.A lot of my opinion on the game is based on PvE and PvE Coop (both matchmaking and password, which is a godsend), as the majority of the PvP I've done is either a pretty good matchmaking experience or I've used a password to be summoned by friends for a friendly duel. I have not experienced any issues with the online thus far, apart from a few summons being timed out, however this usually only happens once.As with DS1, the hack 'n' slash action-RPG style gameplay is what entices me the most and allows plenty of replayability using different builds and equipment. The leveling system is the key to wielding higher-tier weapons and it feels so satisfying to come back to difficult enemies in the earlier areas to slaughter them in revenge.Dark Souls III is easily one of my favourite games so far of 2016 and I'm highly anticipating the upcoming DLC.In regards to my game time and saying I have ""100+ hours clocked"", I spent about 80-90 hours on a pirated copy before I was able to afford the game. I have no regrets buying the game as I believe FROM has done an outstanding job and they deserve my money as I've enjoyed this game quite a lot. I just thought I'd write this for anyone who cares."
Positive,The game great. Just as every souls.
Positive,"Blood Souls: Prepare to Sin Edition - The Best Of Collection10/10, Miyazaki."
Positive,"If you enjoyed the other souls games, you will probably like this game alot. This isn't necessarily a pro's and con's list, but rather important features that make up the core game.-The combat mechanics seem to be a  little faster than its predecessors, more akin to Blood Borne agility based rolling to avoid damage rather than block damage.-The story was much easier to follow than the previous souls games and proved to be quite interesting.-The summoning password feature was an excellent idea, making it easy to die again and again with your best buds!-Follows similar patterns of previous games: learning enemy types, movements, attack patterns and weaknesses; with the occasional switch up to make sure things stay spicy and you keep dying!As a returning veteran with advice for new players: Don't take it personally when you get invaded! It's a cool part of the game that you should enjoy and embrace! Who wants to fight the same old AI over and over again? Not me! Having your progress temporarily stalled to have a more technical and mechanical battle should get your blood pumping and keep you on those unkindled toes! Granted you will come across an array of seemingly unfair tactics, but everything has a counter! Now get out these and kick some ash!As a returning veteran with advice for returning players: This game has quite a different feel than the other souls games that you will quickly adapt to. If you're a perfectionist and would like to collect all the items in the game, be prepared to invest some serious time into the game for covenant item collection. I'd recommend remaining at PvP meta levels to satisfy the automatic summon covenants as you will hardly ever be summoned if your Soul Level is too high.In closing, I love this game very much, and having the oppurtunity this time around to act as a guiding hand through the realm of ash for my friends was a very rewarding and enjoyable experience.Highly Recommend"
Positive,"Excellent all around. Graphics, music, fluidity, level design, boss design, difficulty, style. I'm only 30 hours in but I hear it only gets better!"
Positive,"Okay so having played Dark Souls1, Dark Souls 2, and Bloodborne...I have to say that this is by far my favorite so far next to Dark Souls 1.  The level design is very comparable to Dark Souls1 but isn't overkill like Dark Souls 2.The bosses and the enemies are more fast paced comparable to Bloodborne fighting which is great.PVP is soooo easy in this and I love it.  At Pontiff there is so many people invading and hosting it is basically like a built in fight club now.  No more waiting in a forest or old boring battle systems that dont work haha.  Overally I have beat the game a few times now and plan to keep playing for a while.  It is unfortunate that this is the last Dark Souls.  RIP"
Positive,"Great game so far, not sure what all the negative reviews are about. If you have problems with crashing just turn the reflection to low and lighting to low."
Positive,God....i love this game. It will make you cry and maybe sometimes you just have to give up because you are playing for 15h straight and fall asleep in a pvp battle. But god damn this game is good shit. It gave me the feel i had playing Dark Souls 1 back. The atmosphere is dark but wonderful and the locations look incredible.  The whole online experience is way better and it runs smooth as fuck without crashing or buggs.10/10 would fall asleep again
Positive,"I personally believe it is the best of the souls games yet, perfecting combat (It underwent a few changes over the series) and making a very enjoyable rpg. The characters are fun and easy to interact with and I am really enjoying it.However I understand it would be frustrating to be unable to run it the only negative people have is that their pc's are not good enough and however that sucks don't dislike the game itself for that reason."
Positive,ets vewy gud
Positive,hey its pretty good
Positive,"After the somewhat mediocre second part, DS3 seems to be back to form. The level desgin in the first  sections of the game reminds one of the best parts of the series, as well as the enemy desgin. Boss fights seem to be a bit easier so far, although I have not beaten the game as of yet, but the designs are more interesting than in DS2, reminiscent of the good ol' DS1 days. Speaking of DS1, there are multiple throwbacks and cameos, maybe even a bit too much for some. Some would call it fanservice, others well deserved since it seems to be the last part of the series.Weapon variety is given pretty much from the start, nearly as fast as in Bloodborn, as well as a lot of fashion options to clothe one for the Lords of Cinder. Also, armors stats only marginally differ between sets so you can go full fashionborn.All in all the game is fun, looks good, works (mostly) fine on my rig (framedrops when picking up new items below 20 for 1 sec) and I wanted to go to sleep 4 hours ago... so yeah, exploring and getting gud while getting horrible murdered time and time again is still as addictiv as ever.EDIT: Framedrops and performance have been fixed and the game works now without any hickups or technical issues.Also, after finishing the game now twice I can say that the game is more fun than DS2 and offers greater enemy placement as well as more ""fair"" enemy mobs. No more big mobs that crush you from the get go. The mobs you will encounter remind more of the DS1 mobs in Undead burg, which could kill you but were easy to kill. Also enemy groups can be singled out to instead of group aggroing like in DS2 (Bell Knight boss run f.e.).All in all I would recommend this game fully to any fan of the series as well as people who like some challenge and exploration in their game. Multiple replays still entertain as I am now on my third character, ready to discover the secrets of Ariandel."

Positive,The best Dark Souls game in the series.
Positive,"Just want to say I haven't had a single crash or anything related to freezes/FPS drops so those aren't affecting my review. However, if you're worried about having technical problems before purchase I'd wait until a patch is released.So far I love it, it's a solid game with a strong amount of bloodborne/demon souls feel to it, which is good for me. Will you like this if Bloodborne left a bad taste in your mouth? Maybe. The combat isn't as fast though it's preeeeetty fluid, however beyond that the game feels a lot more... grim and spooky than the previous souls games (most enemy designs would fit right into Bloodborne 2, along with a few locations if you tweaked them slightly). Once again this isn't a con much like the combat but I want to point out another similarity to the two (the inventory is also the one from Bloodborne). Basically, they learned a lot from Bloodborne and are showing it off here. I didn't want the review to be solely BloodbornexDark Souls but I've had a few friends outright put the game down because it doesn't feel Dark soulsy enough for them and too Bloodborney.Buy it if you're in the crowd who wanted Bloodborne on the computer. DAS3 is far from being a BB copy though you will get a small taste of it through this.Buy it if you just want another solid Souls game."
Positive,Maybe its the DS fan boy in me but this game did not disappoint.10/10
Positive,Finally I can play the dating sim I've been waiting for!
Positive,"I must say, this game is a masterpiece.  Beautiful music, brilliant gameplay, stunning graphics, awesome lore, and one hell of a challenge.  You won't be let down by this game, anyone can pick it up and play, just takes practice to git gud"
Positive,"⁃8.5/10⁃Last one in the trilogy, Dark Souls III is a really nice conclusion to the series. The improved graphic quality is seen from the get-go with absolutely beautiful skyboxes and big diversity of enemies, as well as new smooth animations making the fights, both PvP and PvE a lot of fun, yet the game has some negatives as well.Finishing any NPC questlines is close to impossible without a guide, because of characters' unintuitive positioning from one part of the quest to another. The game punishes you for not looking up info if you want to get an alternative ending or finish a NPC questline.Many people complained about Dark Souls 2 world being incoherent, yet the third game suffers from it even more (DS3 has an actual explanation for it, but the explanation is quite weak).Still, the atmosphere in the game is wonderful and art design is brilliant as always, with voice acting being one of the best I've ever heard. Both main game and DLCs were really fun with some of the best boss fights in video games ever. The character movement is excellent and you can feel the weight of any kind of weapon you're using, with huge selection and diversity of those weapons.All in all, Dark Souls III is a very good closing of the series and personally almost on par with Dark Souls II. It's one of the best trilogies I've played and I'll be very eager to replay all three games in the future.""This spot marks our grave, but you may rest here too, if you would like...""PS.: Majula is still the best player's hub."
Positive,"I want to make a post addressing all of the new bad reviews for dark souls 3, as they fit neatly into 4 categories.  The first is that the game is too hard.  This would be understandable from new players, but I've seen people who claim to be veterans say the same.  I am a newish player.  I only got into the souls series in the last couple of months.  Dark Souls 3 is not hard.  I am not saying this to be facetious, I am being legitimate.  It is challenging, but there is a difference.  Like all souls games, if you find yourself doing really poorly over and over again, there is probably an easier way to do what you are trying.  For example, I see many people playing ds3 with their shield up and just circle strafing.  That works well in ds2.  In ds3, the dodge key is your friend, and your shield will betray you.  Try a more active playstyle.  I hate to say ""git gud,"" but if you are playing passively and haven't noticed how fast the enemies are in ds3, you are either new, or have no idea how to adapt.The second argument people have is that the controls are poorly optimized for pc.  To these people, I have to question if you actually play on pc.  The reason is it should be obvious that you can rebind keys.  It took me no time at all to find a configuration I enjoyed.  For those saying go to console... I have to question your sanity.  You have a pc.  You can plug in a controller if you just can't be asked (though I can confirm the game is way easier on keyboard and mouse once you set the keys right).  I will even point you in the right direction.  set 'q' as interact, and 'e' as both back out and use items.  It works wonders.  Also, if your mouse has extra buttons, use them for power attacks so you can pull off weapon arts easier, as those are the only thing awkward with keyboard controls.  You can get a cheap 4 dollar mouse from cyberpower pc of decent quality for gaming that has two side buttons, so cost shouldn't be an issue.The third issue people have is graphical.  I'm sorry, but ds3 is a graphically intense game.  You might not be able to run it on ultra settings.  It isn't an optimization issue, you just have your settings too high.  I can pretty much garauntee that if your card fits the minimum requirements for this game though, that you can at least achieve console quality.  Obviously you can crank it up far above that with better cards.  Stop saying go back to console, you have the better version, its bad advice.The final issue I have seen in the reviews is people saying ""too many cheaters, go back to console,"" or ""too much lag, go back to console.""  I group these two together for a reason.  I have yet to come across a single cheater.  It is exceedingly rare, because the anticheat software for this game is very good.  People seem to think that just because its pc, it's easier to cheat.  easier is relative.  It's still extremely difficult, and will still get you banned REALLY quick.  As for the lag, I hate to tell you this, but it is just as bad everywhere.  Every youtube video I see for pvp has at least one lagger, no matter the system.  There is no magical ""lag free"" system, because people all over the world play this.  I can say that ds3 will probably in the long run have the least lag on pc, because pc gamers tend to latch onto games longer and play them after the console market has moved on (this has to do with the way marketing is done to console gamers, as well as backwards compatibility in many cases).In other words, stop blaming these issues on the game, it's brilliant. It has its flaws, but these are not them.  You need to, and I know you saw this coming, git gud scrub."
Positive,"Great game story , combat and PvP"
Positive,an easy game for rich people.
Positive,"this is an amazing and a little bit hard game , loved it and it worths 100/100"
Positive,it seems like this is the dark souls 3 of dark souls (will update review as I progress)
Positive,Dark Souls 3 is the Best 3D PvP fighting Gamechange my mind
Positive,"Amazing game, great last installment for a wonderful franchise!"
Positive,"This game reminds me of myself back in calculus class, you see during my calculus class I didn't study at all so I was always not prepared for the quizzes and tests and I failed the course, however calculus didn't have respawn points but in DARK SOULS™ III there are bonfires I tried making one in my calculus class but I got expelled from the school so now I've got nothing to do but keep playing DARK SOULS™ III the game punishes me for every mistake, it shows me my weaknesses and therefore makes me a stronger person. Thank you DARK SOULS™ III :')"
Positive,"Dark Souls is one of the most infamous franchises in gaming for a good reason. Its environments, combat, and boss fights set the standard for other RPGs. It certainly earns its reputation for difficulty, but it isn't difficult simply because the enemies have a lot of HP or because they do a lot of damage (although they do). To git gud at Dark Souls, you have to learn the attack patterns of the enemies. Learn when to dodge, when to block, when to attack, and when to parry. Figure out a strategy and character build that works for you. When you finally beat a boss, you will know that you earned it.Welcome to Dark Souls. You're gonna die a lot."
Positive,"This is my First Experience with DARK SOULS series and the FROM SOFTWARE games in general, let me be honest with you, this game can be Hard at some point but also enjoyable, fantastic and great ! I do enjoy playing this Video game so much, to the point that I might even play it for NG+ or even NG++ after I finish my first journey through out this beautifull Game!Or maybe also buy the Older Versions of the Series like DS 1 and DS 2, to get the full Experience.I defiantly recommend buying and playing this game, just to get the feeling of dying and coming back even stronger than before.I know this game is hard as it has been told by many, especially for newcomer players, but once you learned it, you'll enjoy journey throughout the DARK SOULS 3 ! so never give up."
Positive,"There are only 2 upsides to playing this game on Mouse and Keyboard, alt and f4"
Positive,sam is a cunt.
Positive,One of the best games
Positive,"I think I died, maybe, not too sure. You're not getting an easy mode, feel the pain."
Positive,Thank You Darksouls.
Positive,"Está bueno para iniciarse en la saga, el modo campaña tiene muchísimas cosas que están ocultas o que se pueden pasar por alto y son centrales para el desarrollo de la historia, por lo que recomiendo jugarlo con alguien que lo conozca. La dificultad lo vuelve un desafío interesantísimo, la jugabilidad acompaña y no interfiere en este proceso, el control del personaje es fluido. Se puede repetir la historia en mayor dificultad y con diferentes finales y side-quests. Tiene modo co-op, mensajes de la comunidad que sirven de guía y modo pvp. Lo recomiendo."
Positive,"This is a really fun game and I had no idea it would even work on my computer, but somehow it did and even let me play too. I love this game however I still feel like the first Dark Souls ment more playing all the way to the end then this one.However the gameplay is vastly improved over the other two games."
Positive,Even after 4 years. The online community is super active. Game definitely worth. Aside from a few network gltiches. a fun hardcore action RPG game. controls might feel a bit clunky early on but its meant to be that way. Now occasionally a few hackers may pop up during multiplayer. Best to use modes like watchdog9/10
Positive,game kicked me out because my framerate was too awful
Positive,with all the hours I put in I finally got past the main menu! 10/10 worth it
Positive,"Вся серия Dark Souls очень затягивает игроков и 3 часть не исключение. Она потрясающее себя показала во всем своем свете, начиная превью и годной графикой и продолжая уже в процессе самого преключения. Если же вы думайте покупать ее или нет, то лучше посмотрите обзоры у ютуберов, потому что некий % игроков считает, что эта игра сложная и они правы, но прелесть этой игры именно в ее сложности. Если вы покупаете эту игру с целью просто пофаниться и отдохнуть после работы, то она вам не подойдет. Эта игра требует действительного упроства в плане прокачки и тренировки, чтобы сражаться с другими игроками в онлайне или одолеть боссов, которые будут по сюжету. Играть или нет решать вам, я же вам просто дал свой совет и рассказал о Dark souls 3 совсем кратко. Удачи всем и хорошего дня!!"
Positive,Praise The Sun!
Positive,Honestly this is my favorite in the dark souls series they could not have ended it at a more perfect game and the dlc is amazing.
Positive,"0 technical problems. not a single crash in 19 hours of the game, frames droped to 55 a few times (I got to a point where I dont even check fps anymore), runs 60 fps maxed out on my r9 290 in 1080p.game itself is great, its the dark souls 2 I wanted 2 years agoalso people who complain about invasions system and want honorable duels on release week probably never played souls game before and/or just watched some mlg pvp duel compilations on youtube."
Positive,"Okay so I've played lots of this game already, over 200 hours. I've 100% completed it, and I've done the same for all previous titles not including Demon's Souls because screw you Fromsoft and your Pure Bladestone.So I'm a fan of the series, it's safe to say, and Dark Souls III hits the mark for me really well. If you liked previous titles and you want more of the same, this game has it, you will enjoy it no doubt.My only complaints right now are small, and there's one huge issue with the game regarding online play. I'll get on to that after I talk about the game a little.So I started the game with very little knowledge about what to expect, and I also started alongside a bunch of friends who also bought the game. We all played our first characters solo though, so we could get a better feel for the bosses and learn the game a bit better. Without spoiling anything, this game has fan service from previous titles, and some of it is purely there to get a reaction from returning players. That was kind of a disappointment for me, but as I played on and kept reading item descriptions, some of the returning locations/items/NPCs actually made sense within the world itself. For that, I was happy. The story this time around is again, more of the same, but that is not a bad thing. I love the rich lore in Fromsoft games and I love how much love is put into item descriptions and NPC dialogue, something which you can choose to ignore or dig real deep into it and learn all the secrets about the lore.The bosses are amazing, I really enjoyed a lot of the bosses, with really only two of them lacking in my opinion. I did not like the Wolnir or Deacons of the Deep boss fights. I didn't like Wolnir's mechanics but overall was a VERY cool boss in design and concept. I didn't like the Deacons either, because well, it's a typical Fromsoft multi-enemy boss fight.  The fact is (and no one likes admitting this) Fromsoft are bad at multiplayer. There's always issues surrounding the multiplayer and it's always been an issue in the previous games, and now this one. I'm not talking about balance and overall functionality, I'm talking anti-cheat and their stance on banning people. In Dark Souls: Prepare to Die edition (the first game, on PC that is) had NO anti-cheat whatsoever, so cheaters where rampant and nothing could be done about it, other than playing kiss chase off of a ledge for the hacker to die from fall damage. Fromsoft were very unexperienced in PC titles and they did a bad job of Dark Souls 1. It wasn't terrible though, because the mod DSfix cured that game. Dark Souls II was the same, it had no proper anti-cheat. Except this time around it had soft bans. The way someone was selected for a soft ban is simple, they monitored the servers and players for any suspicious activity and if they spotted something out of place and they could confirm it to be cheating. You were soft banned, but... they didn't tell you that you had been banned and you had to email Bandai Namco just to find out if you were. Obviously this system has its flaws just like any other anti-cheat system, but the big problem is the hackers were still everywhere and softbans didn't really help.Fast forward to the release of Dark Souls III and this game has had almost the exact repeated problems, except people are being softbanned for rediculous reasons, like playing in offline mode or picking up an item that they didn't know was cheated in using a third party program.At least you get an error message when there's invalid data. All you have to do is use a backed up save. What if you don't? Enjoy playing offline.To close out, all I'll say is it's the best Dark Souls to date, in my honest opinion. The issues regarding multiplayer can be solved over time, and once they are, this game will be a hell of a game.TL;DRThe game is good. Has some multiplayer issues regarding softbans. Good lore. Good Bosses. I recommend."
Positive,"GREAT SHOW <GOOD SHOWBAD SHOWAWFUL SHOWFirst of all, Praise The Sun!  \[T]/ or whatever, before I get called a friggin' casual.Now onward to the review.It's Dark Souls, what more can you ask for?It's a HUGE improvement from Dark Souls 2, which had problems, but wasn't terrible anyway.There are complains, that DS3 feels similar to the first Dark Souls, resulting in people comparing the two.Being a Souls fan, I myself felt the similarity. But nonetheless, that is what actually makes it good.The original director of the Souls game, Hidetaka Miyazaki, returned to direct this third installment to the series, and he knew what made the first one so good. So there are bound to be similarities, although it is too much similar at certain places. The game is still different in certain places as well, especially the combat system. It's much faster than the first one, and they introduced ""Weapon Arts"". This makes the gameplay better, but may be a turnoff for some.Multiplayer has been improved tremendously, with the introduction of password matchmaking. Password matchmaking also removes level restriction, but still balances your teammate's level to yours. Which is good. The game also added more Covenants ingame, which can result up to 8 player chaotic PvP invasion. Whole lotta fun.Enemies design-wise, tons of new ones are introduced, while still having some similar mob enemies.The bosses, are a blessing and a curse, unlike DS2, which is only a curse.In DS2, most of the bosses are just ""Big dudes in big armor"". Lazy design, and not so smart attack patterns, which made them easy to handle.In DS3, it is a blessing because their design is terrific and varies throughout the whole game. It is also both a curse and a blessing, because their difficulty has been amped up, but also provides a challenge. DAMN YOU NAMELESS KING!!!The soundtrack is terrific, suiting the gothic theme and fantasy theme, albeit the soundtrack only plays during boss fights.Overall, great game. It has problems, especially HACKERS. That has been resolved, maybe. I don't know. And there are tons of weapons that are unbalanced or is utterly useless. Also bugs, of course there are bugs. But they are releasing updates fixing those problems quite often.Here's hoping the DLC to be a good one."
Positive,"Peak Souls 3 is the best thing conceived by man. The game is punishing but also rewarding, it can make you a little angry but it's all worth it when you take your final blow on the Soul of Drip & you feel the feeling of beating a souls-like game. I would recommend this to people who like Dark Fantasy (Berserk, Game of Thrones, etc.). There are many moments where you will cheer & many moments you will rage, Overall 10/10 game play it if you're a real sigma"
Positive,"If you like dying over 20 times to figure out a boss fight, fight pattern then I guess this game or any Dark Souls game is for you."
Positive,"It hurts to give a negative review to this amazing game, but it's been 2 months without any update or announcementAnd update: online is back again, let's gooo!"
Positive,bro i thought i bought the PC edition why is everything in controller inputs
Positive,like berserk but without the boat
Positive,Online play brought back %100 fun of this game! GREAT times!
Positive,"Todays reviewers are 40%+ just nagging about every problem whatsoever. It crashed? Bad game. Performance issues on launch day? Bad game. A few scattered bugs? Bad game.Yea, just forget that the developers put a hellton of time into this, hard work for thousands of hours.I also had a crash, right at the start, the very first bonfire. Right before reaching it the game crashed 3 times at the exact same location, after I changed settings to Medium it worked perfectly. And since then I had one-two crashes and not a single bug.Now to the actual review.Dark Souls 3 is as the name suggests the third Souls game delivered by From Software. You'll still die a lot, no question. In my opinion DS3 is more difficult than DS2 but easier than DS1 - Casually seen.The design of every single area is gorgeous, you'll either be amazed by the view, or frightened by the atmosphere.Music is great as well, boss themes especially.The game is now way more flexible in design for Online play. In Dark Souls 2 there was the concept of Soul Memory in which you could absorve the amount of Souls you collected throughout your journey, but not only that, when being invaded, you get invaders with an equal Soul level. So you gotta spend your souls wise, don't waste them on collecting spells for achievements or lose them all accidently. Spend them on Lvling up correctly and strenghtening your weapons and armor.In Dark Souls 3 you get matched based on your Level and your weapons level - what is enough by far. I have no problem collecting every spell I come upon even as a pure melee class that doesnt use spells whatsoever.I love collecting all items in Souls games, from armour to weapons or spells - now I get to without being matched against people that just straightly leveld up - Not that it always matters, pvp is still 80% skill based.Overall I have no clue at all why this is ""Mostly Positive"", but I guess this is how the reviewing community on Steam just is like. Alltogether Dark Souls 3 is a very GREAT game, with enough content to easily justify a higher price - so stop nagging about every little problem whatsoever - It works great, way better than many other titles at Day one, and if you have some little problems, don't b*tch about it in a negative review, write a post in the discussions forum so the Devs actually notice it.Little Update:The DLCs are awesome, loved them all!"
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is brutal , hardcore yet addictive like previous souls games ,  but way better than them in many way : from the bosses ruthless design , area/world extremely detailed , interesting lore/npc to beautiful weapon art .I already made my way to undead settlement , passed the 2nd boss and haven't encounter any crashes nor framerate issues yet. The game run just fine in medium setting with 60fps on core i5, nvidia gtx 850M  , 8GB RAM.Git gud, fellow DS fans!"
Positive,Praise the sun!
Positive,"If you haven't played the others, I highly recommend you do that to acquire a basis for the lore and gameplay mechanics and how they evolve through the series.That being said, this game beautifully wraps up the series with punishing gameplay and a need to be alert at all times.Fans of the series will love this game and what it has to offer, from the classically cryptic lore the series is known for to the little things like finally being able to give all covenant related items at once instead of one at a goddamn time.\[T]/ Don't forget to Praise the Sun"
Positive,"btw: Dark Souls 3 is a nice journey about patience, failure & success. Discover a beautiful grim world with a combat system, that let you grow on yourself. Sometimes you will cry like a baby, and in the next moment you will do the biggest flex in the world. Play it online and you will meet honorable and brave friends or the biggest dumb*ss muthaf*ckers in the universe. But let it happen.... Let the game touch your soul. It is my favourite game until today! Together we will wait for Elden Ring and maby meet there! Have a nice day  praise the sun"
Positive,"This is my second favorite game I have on steam because of many reasons. First, I love the graphics of the game, I do feel like they improved them a lot from the first and second dark souls. Second, I love the weapon arts and the variety of weapons, such as the ringed knight sword and friedes scythe. Although both of those are in the DLC (I also highly suggest that you get DLCs). If you don't though, there are still other cool weapons such as the old wolf curved sword or the dragonslayer swordspear. And third, the level design is amazing, especially the area of lothric. I love how in the souls series and even elden ring, that there are so many areas where there are places in a level that make you think outside of the box. However, there are many parts of the game where it is way too easy, and there are places that you wish you could go to, but you cannot. There are so many examples of this in lothric and irithyll, it would be cool if they released another version where there are so much more areas."
Positive,definitely one of the video games

Positive,"First Souls game I have ever beaten, and I loved it. Will definitely be picking up the remaster 10/10"
Positive,"Dark Souls 3, It is an amazing game and definitely deserved the GOTY title. As someone who played through the entire series and enjoyed all the game. Dark Souls 3 was the easiest one to get into, and the most forgiving at the start. I also enjoy the increase in endgame difficulty that gives a challenge even to veterans of the series.9/10 good story, but the other dark souls felt like they had more of a theme or a message behind the story.Shitter Souls 3"
Positive,"Dark Souls III takes place in Lothric, another fallen kingdom. you start out at the Cemetery of Ash, where you will have to defeat Iudex Gundyr, who is there to test your abilities to show if you're worthy of the things to come. this time you're an Unkindled instead of a near-hollow and your quest is to return the remains of the five Lords of Cinder to their empty thrones at the Firelink Shrine.the first thing you'll notice is that the pace has changed. in the first two games of the trilogoy the boss fights, and fights in general, were rather slow and you had to learn the enemies' patterns in order to survive. Dark Souls III however has taken over Bloodbornes faster movement and attack speeds.you will need ligthning fast reflexes in all the boss fights and the first few times you face them you most likely won't notice any patterns; most of the bosses also have two stages and/or you'll have to face multiple opponents at once. one example of this is the brilliant fight against the Abyss Watchers: in the initial stage you will have to face up to 3 Abyss Watchers at once (which can be easily evaded, but you have to know how). once the health of the main Watcher drops to zero, stage two is initiated. his sword starts burning, his speed becomes even faster and his attacks more aggressive and fierce than before.Dark Souls III has hands down the best soundtrack and the best lore of the trilogy. bosses like the aforementioned Abyss Watchers, Pontiff Sulyvahn, the optional Nameless King, High Lord Wolnir and the twin princes Lorian and Lothric cannot be forgotten, even if you suffer from amnesia.the locations aren't interconnected like in the other two Souls games, but they're visually varied and the level design itself is godly. there are also lots of references to the first Dark Souls, like the Firelink Shrine or a short visit to Anor Londo. you'll also encounter NPCs from the first game, like the blacksmith Andre or the (now dead) Giant Blacksmith.the atmosphere is less oppressive and the world seems more alive and seems to almost have recovered in contrast to Dark Souls II, which had a post apocalyptic fantasy vibe.I personally prefer the atmosphere and pace of Dark Souls II to Dark Souls III. if Dark Souls III was a bit more depressing, if the pace was a tiny bit slower and if you wouldn't have to face multiple enemies at the same time all the time, it would be my favorite Dark Souls by far. as it is, it's a very close second and one of my all time favorite games. -- taken from my review on RPG Codex --"
Positive,"Not going to go in-depth with this to be honest. My playtime should show how much I enjoy it. Pretty much imagine that Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 2, and Bloodborne took turns unleashing their spunk into Demon's Souls, and you get Dark Souls 3. It's a pretty fun game. Some balance issues to be sure, but nothing a skilled player absolutely can't get past.That said, I do have an issue with it. As it stands right now, if you use an AMD CPU(except maybe a Phenom model?), you are guaranteed to get subpar performance. The game does not properly use all cores of AMD CPUs. On my FX-6300 I get good usage on cores 1-3, core 4 varies wildly, and cores 5&6 are pretty much entirely unused. And that's with a fair bit running in the background, mind. If I eliminated those processes, it would probably paint a more damning picture.So pretty much my verdict is this: If you like Souls games, get it, you won't regret it. Unless you have an AMD CPU. Then you will regret it. Dearly. At least until Fromsoft pulls their collective head out and addresses the issue."
Positive,"A very dark, gritty, and bru-HOO-tal fantasy world for the ""hardcore"" crowd! This game deserves two talons up, followed by a loud, resounding HOOOOOOOOT! The dark, gothic architecture is very interesting and imaginative, which lends itself well to an atmosphere of dread and horror. Dark Souls III comes with a strong, hearty recommendation, regardless of which class you choose to play. This game was definitely meant for owls and other creatures of teh night--and the challenging difficulty is somewhat legendary, yet manageable if you learn the game's various and partic-HOO-lar intricacies.Thanks for the excellent, entertaining, and sometimes frustrating, diversion Ba=mco! This game is hootiful and deadly, and deserves to be played by those gamers (and owls) looking for a dark, gothic fantasy realm with a phenomenal atmosphere and challenging, yet visceral gameplay (and boss battles).I whole-HOOT-edly recommend this game, and feel that I can safely give it 10 HOOTS out of 10! ""OvO"" Hoot HOOOOOoooot!<3"

Positive,Dark soul i love
Positive,I remember my girlfriend saying just hit him and then move so he doesn't hit you on the Nameless King like I hadn't thought of that shit before and she would allow me to have anal with her if I beat the game without dying. (I'm still trying)
Positive,This is the dark souls of gaming.
Positive,Great game. Get it when it goes on sales
Positive,"My life changed after playing this game . Thank you dark souls.  Whoever is reading this , good things will happen to you, trust in yourself , believe and move forward. :)"
Positive,can we have bloodborne at homewe already have bloodborne at homebloodborne at home:
Positive,"I fucking hate this game. Every time I enter into an area I remember why I hate it, why I hate this game, and it and it's developers hate me. I feel as though many of the mechanics in this game where designed, precisely made, to piss me off.Overall great game, 10/10."
Positive,I mean as it is common gamer knowledge dark souls is challenging. Nothing for weak nerves as i experienced with my friends already. The 5th boss run is a common reason to rage quit at these times. But if you are like me and only get more motivated to go for the next one then this is the game for you. And even if you have to take breaks in between the sweet taste of victory over that god damn bastard of a boss is a experience that can not be described. i currently have 30 hours of game time and haven't even reached the first the abyss watchers (one of the 5 main bosses for those who haven't played it yet). I'm looking forward to the day i reach the 100th hour of game time and finally beat this beast.Can totally recommed
Positive,One of the best games
Positive,"game was awesome, do get"
Positive,Cool game.Died a lot though
Positive,This game made my brain produce dopamine again.I had never enjoyed a boss fight as much as i did in this game.
Positive,I'm suffering from male pattern baldness but it was worth it
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is probably the first game that I would ever call my ""favorite."" It is rich in every category of gameplay; combat, lore, story, progression, and the feeling of community you get from the online experience. Combat is extremely flexible with over 20 types of different weapons, and every playthrough could be completely different depending on how you play and what you choose to use.The linear progression system is refreshing, and feels very well laid out. You can grind as much as you need to gain power and step up to the next boss.Co-Op is something that is very important in Dark Souls. You can run through areas with a friend, and their help is invaluable if you aren't ready for an area yet. Running solo is the classic experience, but having a friend who is willing to help makes it much more enjoyable.The graphics are very realistic, yet timeless somehow. The game still feels very up to date on graphics despite it being from 2015.The deep mechanics are something to learn and explore, and there are so many little things to do and complete in each zone. The UI seems very intimidating at first, but gets easier to understand as you learn the game and make it over the beginners curve.The curve is something to take note of. People will get this game expecting it to be hard, but not THIS hard. To get over the curve, you MUST complete at least the third boss. By then, you will already have fallen down the rabbit hole, and you won't be able to put this game down until you beat it- similar to Terraria or Valheim.The class system adds to the progression. You can find any armor or any weapon in the game, so the class you pick in the beginning only effects your starting stats and items, and you can change your entire gameplay style at any point. Souls are the ""XP"" in this game. You collect souls by killing things, which you then use as currency and leveling up your character. This means you can infinitely grind to get as many levels as you need, given that you have the patience. Weapons can be upgraded a total of 10 times, and that means you can get any single weapon and max it out to endgame level, meaning you can use any of your favorite weapons at a very high level.The online presence is hilarious most times, and if not that, charming. Notes can be left behind by players using a preset word system. You can view notes left behind by players letting you know that the chest in front of you is in fact, a mimic. Then there are other times when you receive messages like ""plunging attack required"" next to an abyss.Of course, the greatest challenge is getting through the game. So, if you are thinking about getting the game, it is worth every single dollar. (... ... ...but get an online key for 15 bucks)PRAISE THE SUN!"
Positive,The best dark souls game
Positive,one of the easiest games ever made
Positive,"So, Dark Souls III. Well, there's a fair bit to say about this game. First of which, it's Dark Souls. As expected from such a game, it's not going to be easy. You will die. A lot. But you will  learn from it each time. The first point to dive into is gameplay. Now, Dark Souls III is different from its predecessors in that it's far faster combat-wise. Enemies are faster but so are you, leading to faster thinking than in the previous instalments in the series. This does lead to a much more gradual adjustment to the gameplay if you played a previous title before this. For myself, I played Dark Souls: Remastered and then moved on to DS3. The pace took a while to adjust to, but it eventually clicks.Speaking as someone who currently has ~500 hours in the Dark Souls series, it's clear that these games are addicting. A lot of that time was just playing through for the first time and exploring the world, but a good chunk of it is also just going for achievements. Speaking of which, Dark Souls III is pretty rough on that front. If you plan on doing achievements, be prepared to do a minimum of three playthroughs on the same file. In order to get one achievement, you'll need to play through the game all the way through to NG+2 in order to complete it.Personally, I find it difficult to determine which of the two Dark Souls games I prefer, of the two I've played, but I think I prefer Dark Souls 3 by a margin, purely because it's more  diverse.  The world may not be too open like in the first game, but there are more different ways to play. More spells, more weapons, better covenants (Unless you're achievement-hunting), which all lead to more play-styles.Overall, Dark Souls III gets a high pass from me. It's fun, it's addicting, and by god, it's satisfying to play."

Positive,"Played this game originally on PS4, sunk hundreds of hours beating it multiple times and exploring it, tons of fun, the music, the boss fights, and visuals are amazing, my first and not last FromSoftware game experience, I highly recommend this game, definitely worth it."
Positive,"DS3, at first glance, is better than all of the previous souls game. More epic bosses than ever, more cool looking gear than ever, refined graphics and plenty of epic locations, huge bestiary with better animations and design, a better audio quality than ever; you get the point, yet it lacks that magic DS1 brought. That magic being the level design. The way the world all connected together  in DS1 was the reason the experience was so goood. It is subjective of course, but the teleporting system from region to region doesnt do it for me.Objectively speaking Dark Souls III is undoubtedly a great game. No two ways about it. Decent, it's just DS at this point, we've been able to play games with this type of gameplay since ages ago. It works, and, yes BS hitboxes are still alive and well.Good. Lacks the DS1 structure and feel but it's alright.What can be said ? Perhaps on the best depiction of medieval fantasy ? Such a claim seems reasonable enough. Visually, it's a pure treat ! From mobs, bosses, to npcs, gear, locations... No flaws. No doubts. From software on their A game, masterpiece territory.Every single aspects is good to near perfect. They continue to deliver these perfectly coherent and balanced soundtracks, with drastic rythm and ambiance changes, great NPC voice over, convincing mob sounds etc... Not a single reason to complain, excellent work !DS3 with all DLC's is quite a beast to tackle, huge amount of content plus your classic ng+ and online play. There's meat on the bone son !"

Positive,"Bloody brilliant, well worth the price of game during that hot 90% off sale.Been playing the whole game with keyboard and mouse, beaten the game thrice over, played the DLC (Would highly recommend), and 100% it, keep coming back to it, probably one of my most favorite games of all time."

Positive,"Dark Souls is developed by FromSoftware and published by Namco Bandi (Europe & International), Atlas (US) & FromSoftware (Japan). Dark Souls III is the third & final installment in the Dark Souls franchise. Dark Souls III takes all aspects from the other Dark Souls games and perfects them making this the best experience of the series & a worthy final installment to the franchise.The Dark Souls franchise is well know for its punishing difficulty, but is Dark Souls REALLY that difficult? Well yes, but it's not what people would intially think. Dark Souls developer Hidetaka Miyazaki insists on creating a living & believable world which is more challenging than punishing which makes its difficulty justified.Dark Souls III story centres around the player (known as Ashen One or Unkindled) waking up after the bell tolls signaling the coming end to the Age of Fire, you are considered the next in line to light the fire and prolong the Age of Fire should the first fail to complete their goal.During your quest you must defeat the 5 Lords of Cinder & rekindle the flame to start the next Age of Fire, this is considered the right thing to do, but it's up to the player to decide if they want to persue this age or if they'd rather persue one of the other endings, thus giving the player multiple choices & other reasons to play through again.From here your story becomes your own.Dark Souls III takes off putting your right in the deep end and expecting the player to learn on their own time. There's VERY little tutorial & very little explaination of where to go and what to do. The player must make their way from their awakening point to the Firelink Shrine & reignite the flame there in order to even begin embarking on their quest to reignite the flame but first comes death, then comes frustration & eventually comes success.Enemies at the start of the game are very weak and will die within 1 or 2 hits of your chosen combat style, however this won't last for long & players will eventually find themselves overwhelmed by difficult & brutal enemies which will happily gank you in large groups.If you're not willing to put in hours of time learning how to effectively stratergize and learning patterns to beat enemies this game will kick you @ss. Combat feels fluent & for most cases you'll have very little time getting a grasp of it, learning to dodge, block and parry attacks & finally learning good times to strike in order to take little or no damage. As such Dark Souls expects the player to take their time & not rush into combat head first, but rather examine their surroundings, decide on which enemies should be targetted first & then putting everything you've learned from your multiple deaths into practise and finally progressing forward.Combat in Dark Souls consists of 3 different forms Melee, Magic & Archery, each with their own various flaws and strengths in combat situations & each requiring various levelling of attributes in order to be effective with certain weapons & armour types.Bosses in Dark Souls follow different fomulas & can be overbearing to new players but with persistence can be easily & often quickly dispached of. That's not to say that the bosses are pushovers, they will by all intesive purposes kick your @ss several times until you get lucky or are able to get their attack patterns & your dodge times perfected.Dark Souls features its usual multiplayer aspect here as well, Multiplayer consists of 4 different types of interactions:Other-worldly Phantoms: The most common kind of phantom you will see are the Other-worldly Phantoms, these white phantoms will occasionally phaze in and out of existance as you progress through the game. These phantoms are other players in their own worlds in the general vacinity of you. They serve no purpose but to add to the feeling of seclusion in your own world but they can be entertaining to watch flail around on occasion.Friendly Phantoms: Friendly Phantoms will leave a glowing White or Gold sign on the ground with their White Soap Stone which you can use to summon to your world in order to Co-operate in defeating the world boss or by going through the entire stage and completing everything together. (These phantoms will generally summon with a White or Gold aura around them. They can VERY rarely be Purple as well, if you see a Purple they are considered a Mad Phantom & CAN attempt to kill you in PvP.)Dark & Mad Spirits/Phantoms: These Phantoms/Spirits are classed as ""Invaders"" they will occasionally enter your world at random and attempt to kill you, don't be fooled, these are actually players who've summoned themselves into your world so you need to be careful of what you're doing & what's around you. Dark or Mad Spirits/Phantoms will generally be Red or Purple but they can sometimes be Blue or Gold as well. (This being said not EVERY Mad Phantom or Dark Spirit that invades you wants to kill you. It can be an experience some times.)Player Messages: These glowing Orange messages exist throughout the world, some are placed by the Developers to guide newer players through the world & offer advice. Most however are placed by other players, these messages can offer advice on combat, give tips on ambushes or point players to hidden items or secret locations. Others can point players to their death so trust these messages with caution!Dark Souls is a series that not everybody will love but it can certainly be a series that will grow on you the more you play them. As somebody who used to dislike & not get the hype around the series I finally took the plunge and I can safely say I now understand what my friends were talking about when they kept raving about this game to me all those times.Dark Souls III gives you a challenge but for the most part is fair & when you die it's (MOSTLY) the fault of your own actions, occasionally the game can be cheap & let an enemy stun lock you without giving you a chance to fight back.Dark Souls III is not perfect by any means, it has its flaws & they do occasionally pop up, like delayed actions upon taking damage your action will play out after the damage animation finishes putting you right into another situation you can die from, connection time outs which can halt your progress if a Dark Spirit tries to Invade but fails to connect. But these are few and far between & can easily be overlooked when you get into the other great aspects.Dark Souls III is a beautifully crafted world, fairly detailed for the most part & has graphics that still stand out to this day for its age. There are some TRULY outstanding and beautiful section in this game that are breathtaking, Irithyll of the Boreal Valley & Anor Londo being the most standout of these places.Note: I haven't even touched on half the things in this game that I wish I had the character limit to put here, but with what I have written I'm at my maximum cap. If you want to know more then check out some reviews from people you trust.With all this said can I recommend the game?Yes this is a recommendation from me! Pick this game up whenever you can if you think you'd be interested in it."
Positive,"Aloha, this is my review of Dark Souls 3, where to start. It is an excellent finale to a great series. I have played the souls games since Demon's Souls but only got into the game in a big way after I played through Dark Souls. I think aside from the original Dark Souls, this is perhaps the best game in the series, and my opinion of the first Dark Souls is biased as it was what really got me excited about this series and genre of game. Therefore, if you do not have the nostalgic blinders on as I have- this may well be the best game in the souls series for you, and that is not something I say lightly. The multiplayer is fun in the same way Dark Souls 2, the lore and story are incredible just like the original, and the tone is grim just like Demon's Souls. I recommend you get the DLC and pay close attention to the ending.The Good:Perhaps the best game in the Dark Souls Trilogy.Great graphics.Tight controls.Amazing customization.Epic story.Grim and mature tone.Outstanding musical soundtrack.The Bad:PVP is favors melee classes and magic is less viable.Some of the bosses are frusterating until you figure out they are a puzzle boss, not a hit and dodge boss.The Ugly:Some of the monsters have a gross out factor that makes them much more dangerous than equally dangerous but normal looking monsters. Without spoilers, be prepared to fight...A naked man in a bathtub.A rat dying in a rat-trap.A lap dancer with a switchblade.A pile of giant babies.A gaggle of sick ducklings.A coven of grudge girls on roids.A bunch of bugs."
Positive,"I honestly thought this game was worth every penny. Amazing gameplay, graphics, storyline and more! I wanted to quit day 1 but when I stuck through it, I enjoyed myself heavily after every boss fight. Also randomly throwing prism stones in invasions and being friendly with hosts is fun."
Positive,"Death is actually a feature, and you will pretty much do so a lot. You might even have fun doing it too! Never thought I would enjoy Dank Souls, but, I do, and I highly recommend it."
Positive,This game made me suicidal

Positive,"Its game with nice game, i recommend to play game is nice game. 10/120 i have play game again. Just buy, No thought! Nice game! I like."
Positive,"Ok. so i just finished dark souls 3 and i dare say that this is the best game i have ever played. the experience you get through playing this is so amazing and is something i mean everyone  should have done through their life. if you want to go deep you can pain your way through the first or the second game to get a small sense of what is going on. This game also has the best last boss i have ever faced. one of the only last bosses that stood up to what i would think a last boss should be, i absolutely love this game and i bet you will too, so go on and let the darkness embrace you"
Positive,"even though it's my least favorite dark souls game, i still loved it. the addition of an fp bar instead of uses and the many battle arts was a great idea, and every boss is just as polished from the last game, with rolling becoming a rather common move to dodge the many sweeps the boss may do.the pvp, is however something i think should be worked on. certain builds are definitely broken and phantoms that are summoned are really fragile, taking a few hits means most of the time certain death, especially in pvp where the invaders took such few hits to die later in the game.the environment and areas have many, many callbacks to other souls games, EVEN dark souls 2, which wasn't ""canon"" according to the fanbase, you find things like  laddersmith gilligan's corpse, creighton the wanderer, and smouldering lake just being bloody lost izalith. despite its flaws, i still loved it as a souls game, and i plan to buy the dlc when a sale comes."
Positive,I'm having such a great relationship with this game and this relationship is even better when you die and it says ''You died''.This game is masterpiece and I love it a lot!10/10 for this Souls game!Absolutely recommend it to anyone who enjoys to get git gut.

Positive,"128 hours in and still going strong, infinite replay value."
Positive,"Why am I always playing this game, even that I have the 100% achievements? I don't know, perhaps it's the fun of playing a hard game, perhaps it's I don't have more games, perhaps it's the nostalgy of another games of past times where playing was hard. I love this game everytime that I die for something stupid or not. I love it for winning, for everything."
Positive,"For anyone looking to get into Dark Souls that hasn't played the series before, do not let it scare you.I had never played a Dark Souls game before this one, and it is a fantastic game. What you hear about it being a challenge is true, but it is not a negative thing.The game is rewarding. When you beat an area or defeat a boss, you really feel like you've accomplished something. Each enemy you fight has the potentital to kill you if you aren't careful. Too often in games now the enemy AI is not actually a threat, merely a minor nuisance on the way to a clear cut story. You can master the enemies, but not without a lot of trial and error, aka dying all the time.There is much more to the game that just difficulty however. Each weapon has it's own unique set of moves and fighting styles. The weapon art in the game is fantastic, and picking a weapon can be as much about style as function if you want it to be. You can PvP and find people using all sorts of different weapons.There are also hidden items all throughout the game. If you are an easter egg hunter, you are going to love this game. You will find walls that look normal, but fade away when you hit them, and hidden paths and all sorts of little goodies.The level design is great. Coupled with the difficulty, they add in what essentially amount to checkpoints throughout the level, each one making it easier to get to the main areas final boss. You can really feel the progress you are making as you get better along the way.This is just a great game overall. The graphics are beautiful, (quite demanding though I will say, but it is well optimized) the gameplay is a ton of fun, and the replay value with new game + is through the roof. I couldn't really be any happier with a game than I am with Dark Souls. So many games have come out with a lot of hype, but this one lived up to it and thensome for me.Get this game. I don't know if it'll go on sale, but it's worth the $60 if you ask me."
Positive,"Better than second, worse than the first one. The advantages are: still quite hard to walk through, beautiful graphics, pvp, music, most things closer to Ds1 than 2. Disadvantages: lags in pvp, many R1 spammers, complicated lore, poise seems to not work. But they will release a patch soon that fix everyting. From my point of view 9-/10. So dry your tears and git gud casuls. And for the gods sake upgrade your computers and keep at 60fps."
Positive,"Much much better then Dark Souls II. You have your basic graphic improvments (similar to bloodborne if you ever played that) and gameplay improvments (good old darksouls mechanic). Bosses are much harder and unique then before. The OST is awsome as well, and is something that I felt like was missing from Dark Souls II. All in all, this was a great game and would recomend it to others like any other souls game.Some things that I kind of noticed but wasn't really bothered:-Faith builds feel a little nerfed this time around.-Invasions have no time limit. (this will either be a good thing for some, or a bad thing.)-when co-oping, when the host enters a boss fight, he may glitch through the fog wall. Making it imposible to participate in the fight. (hoping for an update on that)Overall great game. Much better then the second one. 9/10 would praise the sun again."
Positive,"What I liked:    Better UI and graphics( DUH)    Bosses are still great( two were really lame) and varied, along with the mobs    The setting is still atmospheric and amazing     Online works better and is so much fun(first game didn't have it when I played)    Every weapon and some shields have new skills attached to them to add more variety in choses    Invading as the mad phantom( hybrid)    What You Need to Know:    New covenant that is a mix of of white and red phantom( OMG)    Humanity is replaced with ember, and no need to kindle( this is a good example of good streamlining)     PC port is great, mouse is no longer annoying when using a controller like in the first game    Leveling up and merchants are in one location( can't level up anywhere now)    NG+ has better rings of certain types and solid soulsMasterpiecePaid: $66(Deluxe)Completed in: 40 hours Games similar:      DarkMous"
Positive,"This game was the perfect stepping stone for my 3-year old daughter to get into more isometric based horror games. I started her off on Bejeweled, but she never truly appreciated the artwork. I figured I might give her a more updated game, so I introduced her to FL Studio 9 Producer Edition. Unfortunately, she had not experienced the first 8 installments in the series, so she was completely lost in the series. Other games like Daemon Tools and LinkedIn were simply too expensive, regardless of how good gameplay they might have.However, then I discovered DARK SOULS™ III. This is basically the dream game for any 2-year old. It has everything she's been looking for. Regardless of what she might say, my daughter is an extremely skilled gamer and masters every game like the elitist she is. Some games like Spotify and Samsung Galaxy S7 were simply too easy to master; she beats world-level competitors for these games on the daily. On the other end of the spectrum, she couldn't even beat the final boss to games such as Skrillex and Aquafina. The skill required for DARK SOULS™ III is the perfect balance between Samsung Galaxy S7 and Aquafina, if I am to be perfectly honest. This game has kept my little one year old girl occupied from the day of her conception to the very present while I am writing this. She is currently ranked in the top thousand players in terms of elo rating, and she has some of the best gear I've seen in the whole Call Of Duty franchise. DARK SOULS™ III also offers some of the most breathtaking downloadable content available for any game I've seen. The only game that even rivals DARK SOULS™ III in terms of downloadable content would have to be Hotel Mario, but I will save that review for another time.However, no game is without its faults, and this game has more than I have ever seen in any film across the Federated States of Micronesia. Where do I even begin? First of all, the game is clearly optimised for the GameBoy Advance system, so the resolution scales horribly on my six 8K monitors. Secondly, the game simply CANNOT run on my Windows 2000 machine, which severely limits the portability of this game for me. Additionally, a normal QWERTY keyboard will put a hardcap on the framerate, which is actually a huge issue being that I stream with a high-speed camera. Regardless, I hope to see more Bloodborne installments in the series. Great job, Valve! You guys have really outdone yourselves this time. If more good news keeps coming like this, hopefully my wife's unborn child will survive the second coming of Christ. Ave, True to Caesar."
Positive,Absolutely magnificent and brilliant. An art piece by Myiazaki
Positive,"This game brought me tears of joy. The perfect send-off for the Souls' series.Do yourself a favour and buy it with the DLC - they are god tier, on par with The Old Hunters from Bloodborne."
Positive,It's a masterpiece.Fuck those wolves in the Ashes of Ariandel.
Positive,"Oh~god!i did it!u know?Oh, my God, that's crazy"
Positive,"Very nice game and it is worth to play. Dark souls 1 - no steam cloud support (okey its an old game)Dark souls 2 - no steam cloud support ( well, they may add it in dark souls 3)Dark souls 3 - REALY ? no steam cloud support.WHY ? - its Dark Souls :PAnyway the game is worth to play, if you are not fan of Souls games but you still want it, wait for a discount but if you are a fan of the series you should get it."
Positive,"This game feels like a remix album of FromSoft's Soulsborne Greatest Hits and its the best one [yet]. They’ve nearly perfected their formula and it shows.Tight/precise combat mechanics/controls, amazing music/soundtrack, gorgeous art direction, massive layered/labyrinthine levels, and well-designed bosses/enemies:  everything is [kind of] the same but with more polish and detail. Difficulty is still on the fair/challenging side and even Souls veterans will feel its sharp teeth dig in from time to time (this game has the best intro boss in all Souls games that sets the game's tone for vets and newbies alike).For fans of the Souls games, this is a must-buy. For those who haven't played a Souls game and is looking for a change of pace from your standard hack-and-slash-with-QTE-heavy-sequences RPG, this is a good place to start. Highly recommended, I'm giving it a 9/10.Good job, skeleton FromSoftware. \[T]/"
Positive,"Pros:+ Hands down the most beautiful Soul game ever in the series. Both technically and artistically.+ Levels are well designed and fits together in a logical manner ( unlike DS2 )+ NPCs are much more likable, have more interesting quest line, which has an impact on the main quest.+ Smarter AI, and individual fight feels challenging.Cons:- Short, took me 25% less time to complete than previsous Soul games (or maybe I'm just getting good?) - Armors are meaningless, no longer upgradable. - Weapons are not as balanced as DS2, and you only see a handful used in PVP, the rest are junk.- Mutiplayer is very laggy, way worst than previous games, wonder why?- Terrible camera that cannot keep track of enemy, again, a big step down from previous titles for some reason..."
Positive,"If you took the last five From Software titles and stacked them up side by side in a direct comparison, Dark Souls 3 would on paper come out ahead in many areas. It is evidently clear that the developers have made a concerted effort to take the successful aspects of their last several games and combine them in what they claim to be the final entry in the series. The result is the most polished and least obtuse offering so far, removing some of the needlessly cryptic aspects the series has had while maintaining a sense of narrative mystery and remaining jammed with obscure secrets. Dark Souls 3’s biggest weakness is that its formula is no longer as fresh and unique as it once was. Veterans of From Software’s last several games will know exactly how to approach Dark Souls 3. However the formula is still a good one, and it is executed brilliantly here, with only a handful of missteps to bother you throughout your journey.continue reading[www.newgamenetwork.com]"
Positive,"Dark Souls III has uniform boss design across the board. They're all giant humanoid knights wearing armor while wielding swords and shields. They all have similar 10-strings. Dark Souls III gives the player what they want! This is peak aesthetics and enemy design! More variety would would muddy the water. Knights are key.  Key to the world of dark souls. Embrace the giant humanoid knights, and forget the bosses of olde. Dragons, Piles of bones, Sooth the Tooth, attractive spider ladies, giant sword wielding dogs, masses of excretion, Manus, various stray demons, these are all designs with no guidance. The future and now are knights, giant humanoid knights. Giant humanoid knights are forever.Bless Miyazaki and his return to the basics. We want knights. Giant humanoid knights for eternity.4/4 Best Souls."
Positive,14/10 viva mexico
Positive,What a great game.
Positive,They brought back multiplayer.
Positive,"As a Dark Souls/Bloodborne fan I was prettyhyped for this game.Dark Souls 3 is everything I hoped forand even more than that.Must-buy for Dark Souls/Bloodborne fans, obviously.But also recommended for newcomer to the series."
Positive,"Very good game. I'm not sure if it was easier than DS1 and Bloodborne, or if I have just gotten gud, but it didn't seem nearly as challenging as those two. Beat the final boss on my first shot, beat the dragon rider third try, etc. Still an excellent game and I would recommend to anyone who is a fan of DS1 or Bloodborne."
Positive,"Hundreds of hours later, my opinion of the game definitely has changed.The overall level design can be a little flat here and there, and the cosmetically they seemed to really struggle with making hills, valleys, and cliffs. However you'll still find no lack of beautifully designed areas.Weapon design throughout the entirety of the game was and has always been amazing, alongside the large selection of armour you have to choose from. Weapon movets are re-used on a regular basis in dark souls, because of this its more likely you'll  find the perfect weapon for you. However the re-used weapon arts quickly became frustrating.Both DLCs are very enjoyable and replayable, I do find they are short and are unfortunatly specifically focused on new areas rather than adding to existing ones.Balance changes have been added quite often and fixed a lot of the issues I originally had with the game. Personal Side Notes:I found that the copy and pasted boulders littered across the cliff sides looked somewhat ugly and out of place.The textures for different armour sets could have been more similar, allowing prefectionists such as myself to combine different sets without desliking the differences in metalic shade or texture quality. (chain armour)Not including poise as it originally was in previous titles was a poor choice.Different weapons with different designs should have unique weapon arts at least. I didn't like how a lot of the great hammers were simply given perseverance as an example.Although I don't want to \[T]/ praise \[T]/ this game as something it's not, its definitely a dark souls title, and they achieved at least living up to that standard. All it really took for me to appreciate this game was a second look, some friends, and a little less pessimism. If you have the game already and have a bad impression of it, I highly suggest giving it a second chance with a friend(s), and take the game slow to more precisely develop your own opinion on the games mechanics, aesthetics, and level design. It's dawned on me that there really isn't a single souls title I wouldn't recommend to a fantasy lover, so yes. It is definetly worth the purchase... ᴵ'ᵈ ˢᵗᶦᶫᶫ ʷᵃᶦᵗ ᶠᵒʳ ᵃ ˢᵗᵉᵃᵐ ˢᵃᶫᵉ ᵗʰᵒᵘᵍʰ"

Positive,"It's the kind of game that any casual gamer can pick up and excel at.  New players will find the enemies and bosses to be very forgiving. Environments are vibrant, beautiful, and easy to navigate. I really enjoyed my time with it - would recommend playing it when you need to relax after a hard day's work. 9/10."
Positive,"Dark souls,     I wouldn't describe this game as hard even though it is. I would describe it as challenging, unforgiving, and adventuress. In my opinion The dark souls games are the final remnants of the old school RPG's.      I grow so tired of games putting me on rails and holding my hand through the entire process never truly letting go. Like Skyrim for example, how many quests in Skyrim were spoon fed? The answer is ALL of them. Remember when games were about more than just the ride? When killing dragons was hard? When Death was more than just a simple inconvenience? When beating a game was a challenge and not just how many hours you put into it? Do you miss that feeling?!?!    If you answered yes to my final questions buy this game.Dark souls, a game for real gamers."
Positive,"An amazing send off to a beloved series. The combat(those hitboxes unnf), multiplayer, lore, and PvE in this game is just too good. Looking forward to starting over again on NG+ after I finish hosting these fight clubs :)"
Positive,Good Game but the hackers suck
Positive,Good game. Still can't beat Nameless King.
Positive,"""Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.""- Albert Einstein"
Positive,try tongue but hole
Positive,According to my experience so far: The best Dark souls game in the series while being on the list of the best RPGs in gaming history.And to everyone crashing: Buy better computers. Simple as that.I have a gtx 970 and it hasn't crashed a single time.
Positive,"Here we go again. The name says it all. It's Dark Souls for the third time and that's pretty much what you get: demanding melee combat reliant on timing, rewarding exploration, cryptic lore, fashionable armor and medieval-themed environments that are as beautiful as they are deadly. There are differences to previous games, however. But they're not nearly as striking as the similarities.Dark Souls 2 received a lot of flak for its uninspired environments, its floaty, somewhat cheap combat and the lack of enemy variation. It's great to see that Dark Souls 3 improved on most of those complaints. Decrepit castles, dimly-lit chapels or moldy dungeons - as usual, the selection of areas sounds like fantasy standard, but the way in which they are presented certainly is outstanding. On many occasions the player will stop what he's doing to soak up the atmosphere. Meanwhile, From Software has actually increased the combat's floatiness and it's easy to see why: Bloodborne happened - the game that took Dark Souls's formula and made it faster and more frantic, so of course Dark Souls needed to keep up. Enemies have shorter wind up phases resulting in much shorter windows for counter attacks, so combat in general requires you to be quick on your feet. It all plays into shields being kind of unimportant in Dark Souls 3. They're viable for fending off groups of smaller enemies, but when it comes to large enemies or bosses, you really want to master dodging since the stamina loss from blocking a hit is much more severe.In terms of difficulty, Dark Souls 3 is demanding but fair for the most part. Still, some of the cheapness introduced in Dark Souls 2 remains. The attacks of some enemies cover easily 75% of the area around their bodies and they can attack seemingly without running out of stamina. However, enemies like these are few and far between. Also, the advantage you gain from leveling up or upgrading your weapon is noticeable, but barely enough to make a difference in the early stages of the game. I returned to an area after ten level ups and three weapon upgrades and it still took me three hits to down a common enemy. Also, sometimes enemies tend to be damage sponges.Despite the differences, Dark Souls 3 plays like a greatest hits compilation. It features many callbacks to previous games, which is expected from a sequel to some degree, but it's arguable whether or not those callbacks were executed with grace. Often situations or characters are replicated with few variations, suggesting From Software is running out of things to show us. Even Demon's Souls gets referenced on some occasions. If you've played a Dark Souls game, barely anything this one throws at you will come as a surprise. A large swamp area where the water slows down your movement while gradually poisoning you? Never seen that before. Which is a bit disappointing considering that Bloodborne took the established formula and added its own unique twist to it, making the experience fresh anew. Basically, Dark Souls 3 is more of the same. If you don't insist on it reinventing the wheel, you will have a grand time."
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is a masterpeice... First off let me say yes this is my first Dark Souls game WAIT HOLD THE PITCH FORKS I GET IT. After concluding my first playthrough of this game which was about 65 hours for me was an amazing experience. Let me list the following about this game to make it easier.Graphics: The graphics in the game are magnificent I can't say it enough the enemies, npcs, landscape, armors, and weapons all come togethor to really solidify this amazing experience.Difficulty: After playing this game for over 90hrs I can easily say I am not an expert I am just starting my NG with the chararcter, but I can say this game will beat the dog shit out of you if you don't keep your wits about you. For example I could die to a boss and my souls then drop in the spot I died and I decide to give it another try and grab my souls but, to my dismay I am eviscerated by a hollow with a long stick. Now you can imagine the amount fucking anger that currently resided in my body was at an all time high and it was BUT I LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT! Everytime I died I never left the game in anger it only called me in more to figure out strategies or trying to get lucky every once and a while and not many games can manage to be this unforgiving and have players glorify the game just for that reason it's spectacular.Boss Fights: HOLY SHIT. The bosses in this game are great but there are a few exceptions (DEACONS) but, I can say I had a lot of fun with everyone zero of these fights were boring and defeating a boss gives you a real feeling of accomplishment especially when I can say with full confidence I died 7 times to the first boss and loved every death it took. The boss fights are one of the big highlights of this game and it executes it extremely well to the point that I was really excited to start my new game just so I can get my ass handed to me again.Game mechanics: Look a lot of people might say that ew don't play with keyboard thats complete horse shit I played this game with both keyboard and a controller and I found both to be quite similar and either will do, the game's menu and inventory isn't really keyboard and mouse friendly but once you get the hang of it your in the clear.Servers: Dark Souls 3 servers can be questionable at time connecting to friends and dueling online can sometimes not work well for me it was a 50/50 but more times than not it worked out fine there was a few times where I would join a friends game only to be booted of immidietely but after a couple tries it was just fine. There are also sometimes when being invaded it looks like the invader is just floating through time but those were few and far between for me.In conclusion I did buy this game on sale but after playing it I would have gladly payed the 60$ price tag, this kind of beauty in a game is uncommon these days so I would definitely pick this game up at any time possible. You will not be dissapointed."
Positive,Git gud skrub
Positive,スコア 95/100まだ、序盤ですが....感想文。一言で言うなら、難しいけど理不尽では無いゲーム。雰囲気も良く、面白い。このゲームに影響を受けたと思われる『Salt and Sanctuary』があまり好みで無かったので躊躇していたが、セールで購入。レビューも高難易度と書かれまくっていたので、おそるおそるプレイ。確かに難易度は高いが、理不尽では無い。攻略法を考える事でクリアできる設計になっている。3D ならではの奥深い戦闘がメインのゲームで、どっしりと構えてプレイする必要がある。その分、満足感も高く、良く練られている。また、演出も押さえられていて繰り返し作業が苦になりにくいように配慮されている。ゲームのインターフェースはコンシューマーのベタ移植なので、キーボード&マウスだと少し操作しづらいが、プレイできないと言うほどでは無い。他には FPS が 60 制限になっており、これの改善パッチは無しとのこと。あくまでコンシューマー版の移植と言う事なのだろう。実際のゲームの中身は、重厚な設計で生半可なプレイだとゲームがなかなか進まない。ちょっとずつ攻略法を思いついて試していく様なデザインになっている。それでも、高難易度のゲームのためある程度繰り返しプレイが必要。敵の配置一つ取っても嫌らしいというよりは、経路がいくつか用意されているので無理に戦う必要が無い所は好感を持った。また、メインストーリーには関係無いが明らかに危ないエリアは貴重なアイテムが用意されていると言ったベタな要素も、このゲームでは上手く機能している。一番良いと思えたのは、マップデザイン。3D ならではの立体的な構造を持ったマップが本当に良く出来ている。各ポイントが印象的になっており、迷いにくいのも素晴らしい所。良くないと感じる点は、起き上がり無敵が無いのに起き上がりに敵に攻撃を重ねられてハマって死ぬ事が多いこと。じわじわ進めていく感じはなかなかに心地良く、近年のゲームでは珍しいデザイン。やたらと親切なゲームが多い中、挑戦的なゲームである。全体的には丁寧に作られた印象。この難易度についていけるかどうかはプレイヤー次第。
Positive,This is what Dark Souls II should have been.
Positive,"This game is amazing. Not sure why it doesn't have 95 percent or above. Quite difficult, punishes you heavily for mistakes but rewards you when you complete bosses. Really fun, great cinematics on bosses. 60 dollars is pretty expensive, but it is a really good game if you like challenging games and are willing to spend the money. But you should defnitely have a controller if you want to play, makes the game a lot better."
Positive,"For the longest time I had put off playing Dark Souls. I had heard it was great but didn't feel like it was something I would be interested in because I had heard how hard and infuriating it was. I even got Dark Souls 1 on Xbox 360 for free and after 10 minutes I had rage quit and refused to ever play DS again.Fast forward to winter, 2017: My close friend (also a souls virgin) had bought DS3 and would not shut up about how amazing it was. It took some convincing but he eventually convinced me to purchase the game that I had sworn never to play again. Official Review Starts Here Almost immediately after being thrown into the game I was met with enemies which endlessly slaughtered me. Cut up, burned, pushed off cliffs, Dark Souls 3 did everything to me. At least 50 deaths before I reached the first boss. I will take a moment here to mention there is a learning curve to this game but after a few hours, you will learn the basics. Without spoiling much about the story, I can tell you that you will need to make important decisions and strategically plan your attacks and routes while still a noob. It took me 10 hours of grinding and practicing on lesser mobs to finally kill the first boss. After I had finally felt confident about the skills I had developed, DS3 changes up game mechanics and introduced new fighting styles and mobs. Pretty much everything but the characters in the game are beautiful and almost always, I found myself pausing to take in the breathtaking views and artistry put into the meticulously crafted building and levels. For players who find themselves having difficulty sticking to a certain play style, in PVE, it is fairly easy to spread levels around to be able to use either a sword or be able to wield fire. The customization possibilities available from the beautiful matches of armor make me feel like my warrior is truly real while she struggles to triumph over those who stand in her way, both good and evil. All in all, Dark Souls 3 had brought me a tremendous amount of happiness and will always have a special place in my heart. Although I was resistant and worried about the difficulty at first, as I progressed and learned, the difficulty made me cherish the game even more and is possibly why I love this game so much."
Positive,"I really love this game. Some say it doesn't compare to the masterpiece that was the first Dark Souls and I can agree on some points. The first Dark Souls game was amazing story-wise and it's incredible world building. The reason I recommend this game is because I feel it is better than Dark Souls II, with hackers at a minimum it is easy to enjoy the whole purpose of the game which is to git gud. This game is harder than the previous games in my opinion."
Positive,Amazing game! Got this just a bit after it released and only got to the Abyss Watchers before i stopped playing. Recently I just got back into it and is one of my favorite games by far! If your thinking of getting the game but worrying about it being difficult just go for it!

Positive,"Blood, Sweat, Tears and Depressions..9/10"
Positive,made me hate myself even morepoggers game 10/10
Positive,"Yeah this game clears Elden Ring by far. If you played Elden Ring and want to play a game with real replay value that doesn't require you having multiple tabs open to be able to build craft and know where every single item drop you need is then play this. Probably the most well crafted Souls experience to this day, the only con I would say is worth mentioning is the lack of poise. The game is handled at a much faster and aggressive rate though so you'll want to be dodge rolling most things instead of tanking them anyways. If some moron like me can spend 400+ hours in this game after having it be my first souls game ever on Xbox back in the day with probably the same hours put in, AND I still get enjoyment out of it, chances are you picking it up for the first time after playing Elden Ring (or never playing a souls game) will grant you the same enjoyment. TL;DR: Definitely worth full price, especially worth on sale at half price. Buy it."
Positive,"There are literally no issues here somehow, I'm just as surprised as you are~The story and lore is extremely complex, if you have seen my review on Elden Ring then you sure know I won't start to explain it here because there are many Youtube channels for that~ The gameplay is what I would call the most refined, it doesn't bring many new things compared to older Souls games but what it takes on, does it the most perfectly~ It has tons of weapons, some spells and miracles but half of them are D tier or lower and the game has nowhere as many bosses as Elden Ring or Dark Souls 2 so that's maybe a letdown for some players, for me it wasn't since those bosses are all different and well made except 2 of them~The multiplayer formula is made up from:A host: Plays the game normally~Summons (White, Sunbro and Mound-makers who can act as an enemy~): Can be called as a help by a host~Blues (BotDM and Blue Sentinels are the same~): Can be automatically summoned into a host's world if they have the Way of Blue covenant equipped~And invaders (Watchdogs, Aldrich and the normal red~): They can invade a host's world with the purpose of killing them~Now after this little lesson I will explain more, the reason why new players will hate this and veterans mostly love it is because of the tremendous amount of PvP glitches there are: Estus Cancel, Estus Refill, Bow machinegun, RKSS Cancel, Ring of Favor swapping, Animation swap, Tumblebuff and so so very much more~ None of these will ever be fixed, and because of that veteran players learned them and use them frequently and for new players this will seem very unfair and horrible, and veterans mostly play as invaders and newbies as hosts with some summons~The game clearly worth the price and it sometimes gets a 75% off, that's huge so if you have the chance, then I can only recommend playing this game, I had lots and lots of fun with it, several NG+X and challenge runs, months of PvP and also some mods~"
Positive,not for normies
Positive,Dieing to a tough boss that has low hp gave me the same feelings as when my family was killed right infront of me.
Positive,It's definitely a game
Positive,~Casuls will never learn
Positive,A great challenging game that is fun and thrilling at the same time. In this game you can only get better at this game no joke at all. if you want a game that actually challenges you unlike most games buy this you won't be disappointed unless you have a 144 hz monitor since this game locks at 60fps which you cant change at all. Still its a fun game worth trying out some time if you can.
Positive,Try woman but hole
Positive,"So, after ammassing this much of a playtime and this much fun from this game, I think it's time to leave a reviewDark Souls 3, is not a perfect game. Balance and content issues are all around, and arguably the older games were better. But I still love it and play it far too much. Why? Well, there are a lot of reasons. It's my first Souls game, which leads me to not be able to see a lot of its flaws, and I do love the combat of this series, which is probably some of the best I've ever said. This isn't a game for everyone, but it's definitely worth trying at least. I can't promise you'll enjoy your time, but it'll be a damn experienceP.S. GIT THE FUCK GUD YOU CASUL"
Positive,"Honest review: -Gameplay is amazing (as precise as DkS1, as fast as BB, as ... well its not like DkS2)-I have only had 1 situation where the boss hitbox was bullshit-Difficulty is exactly how it should be-Level design is a bit too straight forward at times, but mostly on par with DkS1 (you travel for hours and suddenly you are back at the beginning, opening a shortcut)-Story is exciting but not very deep (measured at a normal game, but hey its a souls game)-If you have played more than 200h each game of the series (DS,DkS,DkS2,BB) you will see sooooo many references and reoccurances, FromSoft really knows how to tickle that nostalgia nerve"
Positive,Over 300 hours and I still fucking suck. I completed this game by sheer luck. Still pretty good tho.
Positive,Gud game but invasions are way too easy. I just hit them with my broadsword twice and they're dead!
Positive,I didn't git gud.
Positive,"Absolutely phenomenal. This is a beautiful game and at times almost artistic, though like all the games, it not without its flaws, mainly PvP balance. The removal of poise was a hard pill to swallow, but it makes a lot of sense now that I've played PvP for longer. I cannot recommend this high enough. I will be playing this game until the day the servers die."
Positive,"Dark Souls III is a fantasy RPG game, the fourth one in the series (if you count Demon's Souls). You kill enemies and collect souls to purchase new armor and level up your character. That is not anything particularly special, however the series is renowned as being difficult. This difficulty is derived from the lack of consistent healing and the necessity to plan out and play carefully. The enjoyment in Dark Souls is from the bosses, and the gratification of defeating them, especially if it took many tries. In this review I will determine whether or not the game lives up to its predecessors.+Bosses are generally varied, with different arenas, styles, and novel mechanics+Best visuals thus far+Faster paced mechanics decrease sluggish feeling from previous titles+PVP provides great replay value+Many weapons to choose from+DLC section is fun, but nothing exceptional+Interesting regions and 'levels'+Armor is fun to stylize with+Low-level enemies are varied and interesting+Incredibly immersive and atmospheric throughout the game-Ending(s) are modest and uneventful-Easier than previous games to appeal to casual players+Faster paced mechanics lead to incongruity with different weapon types (negligible)-No weapon durability mechanic-Online issues with potential bans and cheaters-Instant swapping weapons during swings opens up potential exploits-Certain items are locked behind covenant rewards that take way too long to fulfillDark Souls III is a great installment in the series. It is faster paced than Dark Souls I & II, mechanically speaking. I had a lot of fun playing PVP with friends and randoms online, but there are glaring vulnerabilities and exploits that can lead to an unfair ban on your account. DSIII has a ""three-strike"" system, and I received one strike when I picked up an item from a cheater. All in all, it's a fantastic game, it has an interesting DLC, and it is certainly worth purchasing and playing- preferably right now."
Positive,"Never played a Souls game in my life, including Bloodborne.Decided to give this one a shot since I was itching for a good single player experience.Play the first 8 hours with extreme frustration, having 5 of those 8 hours be nothing but dying and loosing souls.Get in the zone one saturday and play it non stop for 20+ hours.Finish the game a day after feeling very accomplished.Just get it if you like action adventure games or if you grew up playing Zelda.."
Positive,"i love the mechanics, difficulty, and story"
Positive,"One of the best game expirience i ever get. Beautiful art, challenging fights and great soundtracks. it's brilliant!"
Positive,"this is the best fromsoft game ever made, it is a master piece everything about it is perfect. All boss fights are an experience you would only see in few other games (especially gale). Would highly recommend to everybody."
Positive,Plin Plin Plon
Positive,need pvp :(
Positive,One of my favorite video game franchises! I enjoyed the third installment of Dark Souls just as much as the first two games. Bandai Namco remains true to the path and refines Dark Souls even more in this 3rd epic journey through your own levels of patience and determination.
Positive,"My honest review and opinion of Dark Souls IIIIf you just want to know it it´s good and worth playing, YES, it is.Now to the ""review"" part.I have to mention, that this is the VERY FIRST souls like I´ve ever played, which is why it has a special place in my Heart. When I first started playing the game, I thought it was good idea to play it with Mouse and Keyboard.It wasn´t. In the first few hours I got owned by the Tutorial Boss, locking on and dodging were foreign words to me.Some hours later, I opened the doors of Lothric and got hit with the breathtaking view of Lothric Castle in the Distance.I got my first pieces of Armor, Shields and Weapons, and made my way through the High Wall of Lothric. Until this Point the Game was fun, but left me with the feeling of ""thank god it´s finally over"". That changed when I encountered the Abyss Watchers. This Boss took me at least 40 tries to beat, but the feeling of victory, the rapidly beating heart and adrenaline rush was more than worth the struggle. Even though it´s just a game, I was sitting in front of my Desk, screaming ""I DID IT"" for 2 minutes straight to my friends in VC. After the Watchers I purchased their sword and spent many hours by spinning my way through the following areas. Pontiff took me some tries, but wasn´t too bad. Right after Pontiff I got invaded by some guy who quickly noticed that I had no clue what was going on, who he was and why he was in my world. In the end he escorted me all the way to Anor Londo, dropped me a Large Soul of a Hero and black crystald out. Absolute Chad <3Many hours later I reached Grand Archives and struggeled with Lothric and Lorian, until it ""clicked"". Despite having an Elevator, the way back to the Lothric and Lorian Bossfight is unnecessarily long and packed with enemies. Why Miyazaki, why. After the Twin Princes it was time for the final Boss, and my god, this fight was so good. Soul of Cinder kept surprising me with several mid-phase changes between ""classes"" but was a great experience to fight. Some time after beating the game, a friend gifted me the DLC´s and a had more content to dive into. The DLC´s were great, had many cool weapons, especially the Ringed Knight ones. Sister Friede took me some tries and surprised me with THREE FUCKING PHASES, but went down relatively quick. The Ringed City had it´s highs and lows, but rewarded me with one of the cooles Bosses I´ve ever fought in a Game. Slave Knight Gael took me hours, but holy shit, this fight was an absolute trip and I wish I could fight it again for hours. This fight, the music, the moves and Gael switching weapons MID AIR made this my all time favourite Soul Boss. After beating Vanilla Dark Souls III and the DLC´s, I wanted to take some time off, but couldn´t stop thinking on how play it again, more efficiently, using different weapons. New Game plus, despite being the exact same but a bit harder, was still an absolute blast.  I rolled through the Game with the Black Iron set, Havels Ring and Heavy Caestus +10, buffed with Lightning or Poison. Past obstacles like Pontiff were a lot easier now and more fun as well. Just imagine beating up a 5m Tall priest with Fire and Magic swords while wearing Boxing Gloves with Metal Notches inside them, it felt so damn good.After beating several new games, I forced some friends to play Dark Souls with me and it was a whole new experience. Despite some arguing against it, Dark Souls is even more fun when you´re playing with friends, goofing around and beating the game dressed up as Peasants, armed with nothing but a flaming pitchfork. The PvP Experience is also surprisingly good in Dark Souls 3, some encounters end rather quick or even get resolved by one of the players beginning to emote. I´m not an active pvp player and yet I have to say it´s fun, even Invasions can be fun. Some Invasions had actually respectful individuals that bowed down and waited until I cleared out nearby mobs to 1 v 1 them afterwards. And then there are these individuals that invade with cheats, such as using Estus Flask SEVENTEEN TIMES, having infinite stamina or reviving themselves after being killed, just to instantly apply the curse effect on you and the point down. These Individuals are lower than low and have to Cheat in pvp, then point down in order to feel anything in their lives. The only two things I dislike about this game are cheaters in PvP and the fact that this game DOESN´T HAVE CLOUD SAVE. Fromsoft please, with Dark Souls ""remastered"" you pretty much released the exact same old game and it has cloud save.  Every now and then I still start a new DS3 run and get reminded of how much fun this game can be. 9/10 for me."
Positive,"I am 69.My ex-wife and I have adopted both a son and daughter together. They are now both 5 years old.When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some drywall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest gamer with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 7 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the parent I needed to be in that moment, not the weak drywall-puncher I was behaving as.Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 5 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.Thank you."
Positive,this game was so hard it cured my erectile dysfunction.
Positive,i am lonely
Positive,I don't know if I'm a masochist or not  but I love this game cuz it's too hard
Positive,Love the game! Play with friends for a extra fun experience
Positive,Darks Souls Good.
Positive,dark souls 3
Positive,"Awesome game, feel like everyone should've the experience."
Positive,"What a game, one of the best I've ever played"
Positive,"What can I say? Definitely one of my favourite games of all times.The level of detail, the lore, the atmosphere and - arguably most importantly - the gameplay, are all unparalleled.Everything is just so inherently consistent. Playing the game with a different build feels like an entirely new experience.While it's obviously a niche game that's not exactly meant for the casual gamer, it's one of - if not  the  - most rewarding gaming experiences.\[T]/ / 10"
Positive,"Bruh what can I say Dark souls is literally everything you can expect from a video game, the complete package.Now go play it already shoo"
Positive,i just wanna eat a big honkin burger
Positive,Love this game
Positive,best game ever <3<3<3
Positive,"We have witnessed the history of a magnificent melancholic world. We've seen it grow, crumble and be reborn; rising again from the ashes. This is our story as well. For we met every death with a quite determination, and succeeded against the odds. Everyone here knows why this game is special. We all had different experiences and yet we all shared the same journey. You, me, we, are the SOULS."
Positive,"In terms of mechanics, it's an improvement from the past games but lacks content. Hours played on your first play can vary depending how much do you suck at this game. Replayability is really good since you can experiment with different builds and weapons. Definitely will recommend this to anyone who wants to get into the Fromsoft series since this is the easiest one in the series"
Positive,"most fun i ever had in a single player game great visuals and amazingly challenging game.1st run cound't even get past the 2nd boss, now in my 2nd run i'm already at the profained capital.love this game and recomment to anyone who is looking for a challenge"
Positive,"If DOOM puts hair on your chest, hair on your nutsack and hair on those nuts in that sack....then DARK SOULS III will give you an anal prolapse ANDfist- fUCC you till you LOVE IT.My post Darkeater Midir gaping bunghole RECOMMENDS !"
Positive,"What else can be said about this game that hasn't been said before? I'm writing this about a year after my first gameplay and I still want to keep playing, try new different builds and try other weapons. The story line is beautiful, I mean, How could you tell a story through the gameplay without use cinematics trying to explain everything? Well, Dark Souls III have done that, masterfully. I thought it was very struggle for games to be ""art"" or telling a story using just the gameplay, the scence of a videogame, but this change my mind. The gameplay is fast, if this is your first Dark Souls (my case) it is tough to learn but rewarding. Don't be worried if you didn't play the first two games, you're gonna enjoy this one because the story line is complete by itself. I'd pay even more than his price to play this game again if I could so, I highly recommend it."
Positive,I didn't know I owned this game
Positive,The most fun I've ever had dying. 10/10

Positive,"One of the most detailed, challenging, fun, time consuming game you will ever play. You might rage after you can't beat a boss for a long time, but after you beat it, you will a feel a huge sense of accomplishment that will feel so good and make you want to continue the game"
Positive,"have you ever wondered ""hmmm i wonder how can i get depressions as fast as posible?"", well, this is your best option, in the first 5 hours you will feel despair but not the good one, hell no, this is hardcore despair10/10 would suffer depression again"
Positive,This game is just amazing! A must if you're a fan of the Dark Souls series.
Positive,Worth Every Riyal.
Positive,"PROS:- Incredible combat and responsive controls- Great atmosphere (level and sound design)- Minimalist plot (yay for no long cutscenes), but surprisingly deep lore- Quite difficult but never unfair, progress is very satisfying- Cool summon/invasion system adds co-op and PvP elements into the game, making it feel like a hybrid single-player/MMO gameCONS:- Some areas and enemies can be more annoying than hard- Online quality (summon/invasion system) is inconsistent; can be laggy and frustrating- Sidequests, while certainly not the focus of the game, can be insanely obscure and easy to missVERDICT:This is the greatest action RPG I've ever played. The difficult (but extremely satisfying) combat and co-op summon system in particular kept me playing for hundreds of hours. For those of you like me who value gameplay over everything else, this is the RPG you've been looking for."
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is the culmination of the dark souls trilogy. Fromsoftware has through the last 2 games and bloodborne figured out how to handle the souls series, and it shows. The combat has never been more well handled, which is not saying it doesn't have some flaws I'm simply saying it feels responsive and is very rarely clunky. If there is one thing I would critizise it is the progression and build varierity , it feels like they went a bit too safe with early game build and routing variety which can sometimes feel a bit bland. However the quality of bosses and ingame locations/lore is simply amazing as to be expected of the souls series, npc questlines are not as obscure as they were in previous titles which makes it easier to follow the questlines.I really recommend  that you try this game, and if the difficulty is scaring you I can safely tell that dark souls is not what game journalists make it out to be, it's challenging yeah but far from ""impossibly difficult""."
Positive,It's like rough sex but you want more
Positive,"Looks good, runs well (only 2 crashes in 20+ hours), decent FPS (More than I expected out of my rig) and it's really fun.I recommend."
Positive,I died to the opening cutscene.
Positive,"I’ve been playing the Souls series since Demon’s Souls. I’ve invested hundreds upon hundreds, if not thousands, of hours across all platforms that the games have been available on. Many souls have been lost, many curses thrown, many quits incited by rage. Playing through Dark Souls 1 for my first time was one of the most intense experiences I have ever had. I spent countless hours attempting to beat Ornstein and Smough, those brillaint combatants… When I finally beat them, it was the best feeling a videogame had ever given me. Playing through Dark Souls III has been such a phenomenal experience, and I know it shall continue to be so. It is bringing back that constant joy/anger of being destroyed and then going back and destroying the once destroyer. It is allowing me to relive the feeling of beating that boss whom I had been trying to beat for so long now. Though at the time of writing there is one boss whom I am yet to beat, he shall remain nameless  for now. I am yet to venture into NG+ as I’m trying to beat all the bosses. Being able to relive all those brilliant feelings is making this game truly phenomenal.Now, down to the nitty gritty stuff. Be warned there will most likely be minor spoilers ahead. Performance Bear in mind I do have a fairly beefy pc; check my profile for the specs.Having played upwards of 50 hours at the time of writing, I have only encountered one area where I suffered frame rate issues. These issues were rather short lived, and did not cause any major hassle thankfully. They occurred in the Lothric Castle area, pushing from the Dragon Barracks bonfire into the castle proper. Gameplay During my 50+ hours of gameplay, there have been a few issues with hitboxes with certain enemies, one enemy that irked me the most with this issue was the Reptilian wolf thing on the bridge into Irithyll of the Boreal Valley. This mob caused a few issues with its body causing damage during weird moments where I should not have taken harm. I’ve also noticed the classic extra range thing that some weapons have, though with this being a recurring thing through Souls games it isn’t too much of an issue.Multiplayer wise I have encountered a few issues. (This could technically come under performance. Though it could well be my internet) During co-op I was often summoned and when my host entered their boss battle I would be unable to pass through the boss fog. This is a particularly annoying one as I had it affect me as a host a few times. I would summon someone to help out, and they would be glitched outside of the boss fog, unable to join. This issue was often accompanied by the no animation bug that I had found to be rather prevalent in multiplayer. However the animation one seems to be far less common, if it’s around at all that is. Balance As far as I can tell, weapon balance is perfectly fine for PvE. I can’t say much for PvP however, due to the rampant hackers frightening me away from it. Armour is less balanced; there is the commonly known poise issue, and I’ve seen some things on a problem with physical reduction. The poise one is basically where armour/stat poise does not actually do anything, however weapon/spell buff poise does indeed work. So it’s a weird situation there.Npc summons are far more accessible in this game, which makes certain boss battles far too easy in my opinion. I found with the Deacons of the Deep boss fight, summoning Anri or Syrris made the fight easy to the point where you could essentially have the summon do the entire battle for you. This is, personally, an issue as it takes away any semblance of challenge from certain boss fights. It’s a similar scenario with a few other bosses. Lore As with all Souls games the lore, albeit hard to come by, is rich and fulfilling. With ties to all the classic games, it manages to span stories from Dark Souls one, and mixing in locations and characters from the previous games. It reinvents and revitalises old characters, it ushers in new and complex characters. One thing I did find to be lacking was the dialogue from the NPCs. Upon completing rather significant events their dialogue options would barely change. This is quite unlike FromSoft as many of the NPCs in their other games changed their dialogue when you performed certain tasks. They do however, bring back the classic souls quest lines where you just hopefully stumble upon someone in their time of need and can help them out, all to hopefully receive that Titanite Slab at some point down the line.Dark Souls III is a perfect entry in a phenomenal franchise, and brilliantly fitting end to the series. It perfectly incorporates the challenge that the Souls Veterans are hoping for, and it has that slight edge for the newer players who want to get into it but are far too intimidated by the intense challenge. It’s got a warm and welcoming community that is always keen to help. It boasts a brilliantly smooth combat, levelling, upgrading, and exploration range. With a story that spans multiple games, it’s got that little bit of lore that’ll bring you back and keep you speculating for years to come. All in all it’s one heck of game, packed full of content, and with DLC down the line it’s only going to get more and more intense!I give it a 10/10, but hey… I’m biased. These are my favourite games ever!Keep an eye on this review as I will be updating it when the DLCs are released"
Positive,"Performance review: Runs fine for me most of the time, in some areas the framerate dips below 60 and 50 to the low 40's. And there is some annoying stuttering and fps drops when exiting menus and dialog boxes too fast. But atleast I have not experienced any crashes so far.I hope they will fix the performance issues in the near future because there is no reason this game should drop below 60 fps on my machine (2x 980's and a 5820k).Game critique:Although I'm not anywhere near completing the game, I'm still going to comment on my experience thus far.I am somewhat annoyed on how extremely linear the game is from the start, only giving you access to 1 area. You won't be given the option to explore different areas until after the 3rd boss. Comparing this to the original Dark Souls, where you can access several different and diverse areas as soon as you arrive to Firelink Shrine. Even Dark Souls 2 lets explore different areas, and I remember people complaining that game was too linear.Thankfully the game makes good use of shortcuts and diverging paths, a bit of an over abundance of Bonfires though. Seems to me that the developers use them as a bit of a crutch, since you also get the ability to warp between Bonfires right from the start.Another thing that bothered me, was that you discover several NPC's who are locked away in cells and cages. If you find the key or the path around the locked door, you will be given the option to befriend and learn new things from them.When you do this though, they warp back to Firelink Shrine right infront of you. This really breaks my immersion because if they are locked away and trapped, but then warp away after you have unlocked the whatever thing that was keeping them from leaving, why wouldn't the NPC just warp away without you having to unlock the door for them. You could argue that they had lost all hope, and was at the brink of hollowing until you found them. And they regain their spark after you agree to help or whatever.But this still doesn't justify them just warping away. This wasn't a problem in the previous titles because the NPC's you meet travel back to Firelink Shrine or Majula after you have left the area. Leaving it up to the players imagination to conjure up how they got there. This is a much more elegant solution in my opinion. It doesn't ruin the players immersion, unlike when you unlock a gate to an imprisoned NPC and then having him or her simply warping away, effectively ruining the players sense of accomplishment.I know I went on a long tangent about such a small difference, but that is because I feel that it is worth highlighting these flaws in an otherwise amazing game.The developers have made several other great and much welcomed changes in other major aspects of the game and it's mechanics. I would love to go on and on about what I love about this game, but it is much better to experience this for yourself.Though I would hold off until there is a fix for the crashes and stuttering."
Positive,It's a fun game and I like fun.
Positive,Gives me Conniptions!
Positive,"After months of putting this game off I finally resumed it and restarted so that I'd have a fresh new experience. Having played and thoroughly enjoyed Dark Souls Remastered, I was greatly looking forward to playing this one. My expectations were met and I had an amazing time with this game. Majority of the bosses were great fun whilst of course being rage inducing. Music is played when it is needed and makes moments all the more impactful. Gameplay is more polished and the level design is consistent. I highly recommend this game and I cannot wait for Elden Ring."
Positive,"Very Long list ahead+Sound track is awesome+PvE is challenging, as usual+No reskined bosses+Three endings+Buying the season pass with the game while having a copy of previous souls game in libary is 80 cents cheaper than deluxe edition+Mostly Fun Bosses (totally true)*+OP Lore+UGS still exist+everyone gets minimum 7 rolls with full stamina bar+FAST, like very FAST....+Less Turtle strafe kills+Weapon arts+Poise+Best souls game for the newbies+/- PvP+/-Bonfire placment-invaision mechanics-sword shield superiority-Ganks(mostly)-The Pontiff-Broke my controller's R1s twice-each weapon type only has two main moveset plus weapon special-expensive-Havels no longer works TwT-Magic can no longer stand alone on lower levels-NG+/NG++ has nearly no incentive-kinda short???-Spells don't work well-less punishing on death-Phantom range-Network sucks at times-Viability and Variety of Builds-Over Nerfing or Over Buffing patches?-Lots of other smaller things, don't get me wrong, the game is perfectly fine if some things here and there were patched."
Positive,"One of the themes of Dark Souls is cycles; if enough time passes certain events, people and places are likely to repeat. It is also a series about death and rebirth. If From Software is to be believed, Dark Souls III is the death of this franchise and I have to say I'm glad. Now don't get me wrong, I really like this game (not quite as much as the original) but the franchise appears to be running out of ideas.The story is a continuation on the dying fire needs rekindling theme with no major additions to the lore, or explanations for why this is happening. This show, don’t tell approach worked amazingly well in the original but this is the third game in the series and some answers would be nice. Items, characters and locations also repeat with little rhyme or reason. Are they connected to the originals world and if so how much time has passed? What happened?In its favour DS3 has the most interesting location and monster design (in terms of visuals) so far in this series and the Cathedral of the Deep is some of the best level design. Combat is a mixed bag and often leads to spamming light attack especially in pvp. The faster pace occasionally makes things more exciting but I miss poise and blocking.This is still a good end to the series and is well worth checking out if you’re a Souls fan; just don’t expect to be blown away in the same way as you were with dark Souls."
Positive,"Amazing lore, bosses, and gameplay. Easily one of the best games I've ever played and ever will play. It is difficult but honestly once you get the hang of it its not too challenging, therefore I would recomend this game to anyone who's even slightly  interested!"
Positive,"This takes a shit on Dark Souls 2, and then proceeds to fat roll all over it."
Positive,"Spent my time helping people fight dancey bitch early on in the game. Was a lovely, funny and also a heartbreaking experience"
Positive,Best souls game.lets you emote your maiden waifu.
Positive,"This game is fun, stressful, artsy, compelling, unique, and its hard not to be passionate about it, be that anger or joy..."
Positive,"found a dude named Yort, he was a fucking beast."
Positive,10/10 will die
Positive,"A game that is challenging yet fair, filled with tonnes of content that will keep you hooked for multiple runs. New areas, weapons, armour sets and spells all to help you diversify yourself and allow you to play the way you want. The DLCs are also what they should be, filled with additional content that doesn't feel like it was cut out of the original game, especially The Ringed City."
Positive,I spend 2 hours on the face customization to only be covered by a helmet.
Positive,"got sofbanned because some asshole summon dropped me a modded farron greatsword renamed to ""weebslayer""still good game tho"
Positive,10/10 would die
Positive,"10/10 would rage quit, refund, and buy again"
Positive,With almost 400 hours on record I can safely say this game is definitly really ok
Positive,There are games that are amazing. There are games that make you live a new life within them.Then there is Dark Souls III: teaching youngsters that being a f a g g o t is not okay.
Positive,"ever need to take a 5 minute break from a game due to the adrenaline pulsating throughout your body because you beat a boss with only one hit worth of HP left? if so DS3 is the perfect game for you, challenging and rewarding, but only buy it if you are truly prepared, if you get pissed easily you may as well leave now, because you will die, a lot"
Positive,"Its a wonderfull Game and end to the saga of Dark Souls. Everything started with Demons Souls and since then people went crazy about these kind of games but it is wonderfully challenging and rewarding a game that really binds you for hours and hours and you can't let go off it. It aches my heart that this is the end of this wonderfull adventure, but From Softwares Team is one of the best out there and even if they move into a new genre of gaming only the sky is the Limit for them.If you were disapointed with Dark Souls 2 and you really wanna play a true Souls-Game again than this one right here may bring that old smile back to your face."
Positive,"Amazing game!The third of the souls series, you do not have to play the previous to understand the story but there are some nods to armor and characters from the previous games. I've played through all the souls games and whilst i do think there are some things they did better in the previous games, i'd call this one my favorite!"
Positive,"Ahhhh.... Dark Souls 3 - the only game I regret not buying at first time, but playing cracked when it got released.Since I have much more than 215 hours (around 700), I think it is time for a review from me.- Awesome Lore / Story : Masterful indirect storytelling! Dark Souls 3 not only features a the reworked story of Dark Souls 1, but also adds more to the general Lore.- Good and enjoyable graphics : Typical for a soulsborne title. It emphasizes the general idea of the game and delivers pleasant experience, and also : we all know that a good game is not only about good graphics.- The combat system : It is very well made, easy to learn and is close to realistic ( despite some differences )- The RPG experience : Dark Souls 3 brings more to the RPG experience, despite that the whole idea is dependant on the player`s decision on how to play the game.- Well thought areas : the atmospheric feeling is top of the line- Good PvP arenas ( They could have made more )- Difficulty : when it comes to difficulty. in my opinion Dark Souls 3 is more ""noob friendly"" than the other titles. *Which is good! Some players think that it is a little bit too easy, but that is why we have mods, levels and customizable characters.- Music : As expected - the soundtracks are STUNNING! They totally fit with the boss types and the general emotions..- Since I have no serious negative remarks I should put this here : WHY NO MASK OF THE FATHER?!"
Positive,"Game is good, what is not good is hardware. Fucking broke my keyboards for this shit. 10/10 next time fromsoftware should buy me one next time"
Positive,Gravity is the toughest ennemy
Positive,"Secondary and final edit: From Soft has officially taken notice of the issue and is working to patch it out. This review was for nothing other than hoping to spread a bit of awareness, but with the company taking notice and working to do something about it, this is no longer necessary. I will not be looking at this review any longer. Glad to see it happen for a game that I've enjoyed for so long.Important edit: Blue Sentinels have officially dropped a patch to prevent this from happening, check them and their community out if you play dark souls online frequently.MASSIVE EXPLOIT. People are able to remotely run code through the online of souls games, meaning your data and information are at risk just by playing online with other people. From Soft has not been known for patching things, but with a serious problem like this, there needs to be enough of an outcry for them to do something about it. This ALSO will likely apply to Elden Ring. If there is even a chance other people see this and follow suit, need to get the message through to the team somehow."
Positive,DARK SOULS™ III is the Dark Souls III of the Dark Souls franchise.
Positive,10/10 would game again
Positive,Praise the sun!
Positive,"Between 8am and 5pm I go to this funny smelling building that people call work.Then at 5:30 I come home, feed the dog, feed myself (sometimes) and then begin my actual real job.Blue Bro'ing in DS3....... Please give me my life back FromSoft"
Positive,"Dark Souls III is the final culmination of the Soulsborne series, and what a journey it is.  Dark Souls III begins something like Dark Souls, with the player awakening and regaining consciousness in the middle of nowhere.  The world of Dark Souls III is even more hostile and inhospitable as the first or second game, and any allies you find will be few and far between, and those you think of as allies might be something else entirely.This game ramped up the Berserk references to 11, as the player even does battle with demons that look like they were taken directly from the pages of Berserk; and yes, they will slaughter you.  In Dark Souls the world was already falling apart, in Dark Souls II you saw even more destruction as even once mighty cities lie under oceans of water and even lava, but in Dark Souls III the world is at its breaking point.  Entire mountains and continents have fallen away and left behind strange pillar-like towers and castles jutting into the sky with no surrounding land, portions of the buildings themselves even falling away.  This is the end of the world, and you think you have the mettle to do something about it?Graphically the game is very beautiful, there's a lot of eye candy, no longer dealing with the limitations of the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, they certainly decided to take advantage of the platform advantages of the PS4 and Xbox One, which allows for the PC version to be so good.  Unfortunately it's one of the most intensive games I've ever seen, so you're going to need a GOOD video card, the requirements are not fudging the numbers at all when they say you need a 750 or better.Sound design too is really good, creepy sounds in the distance, the screams, the sounds of dripping water, boiling lava and the scraping of metal on stone.  It'll put you on edge.  The music is fairly decent too, I might say that the Dark Souls III music rivals the Dark Souls soundtrack, and they certainly leveraged the music in ways they didn't do in any previous games.The controls with a gamepad are very tight, and while I don't know about how it plays with a mouse and keyboard, I really doubt anyone will be playing this with mouse and keyboard anyway.  Controller wise it's quite excellent and you'll never have to feel as if half the difficulty is the controls themselves.Now for difficulty, they definitely went for a blend of Bloodborne and Dark Souls II, enemy placement is downright insidious.  Enemies don't move slowly at all in this game, they're constantly leaping in and flurrying their attacks in combos, and enemies are not afraid to work together.  I will say that unlike in previous games, there are enemies who can attack and kill each other while trying to kill you, so it's not QUITE as bad as previous games where enemies would shield block you while enemies behind them would combo you in groups of 3s.  I'm not going to say that doesn't still happen, too, however.  Poise only seems to matter when swinging your weapon, so unlike Dark Souls 1 where you could stand still and sip your estus casually while 5 hollows beat on you simultaneously in Havel's armor, in this game you won't get that much poise and you will need to keep moving and swinging.  There's a lot of secrets to be found, a lot of world to explore, and a lot of sights to see.Boss design is nothing like Dark Souls, bosses are not slow and lumbering.  I'd dare say that alot of the bosses and encounters in the game were designed with coop in mind, and some of the bosses even seemed as if they were designed to be done coop and only coop (which isn't to say you can't beat them solo).  The first boss encounter seems like a real hail back to Old King Doran of Demon's Souls, and the second boss encounter is a lot more vicious than it first seems.Gone is power stancing but in its place they have introduced dual-wield weapons, such as twinblades, a broadsword with a parrying dagger, and any form of fist weapon seems to be a dual-wield weapon.  There's plenty of build variety, and in the case of fire weapons they went back to a non-scaling form of weapon that does a significant amount of fire damage.  All in all, I would say that the mechanics of the game are very interesting, and it was done this way as an obvious answer to the balance problems of power stancing (such as dual wielding two greatswords).This game is a solid 10, but sadly, if FromSoftware are true to their word, this is the end.  Maybe they'll make an Armored Core series that plays something like Dark Souls?  Jokes aside, I wonder what's next from such a great developer."
Positive,"It's almost perfect.FromSoft has learned from their mistakes, and has released this wonderful entry in the series that has fixed every main problem that the earlier titles had.At first, I kept preferring the first one, like many other people... But then, I had been enlightened.• Absolutely gloriously amazing Co-Op and PVP experience. I adore the fact that you can play the game on your own, and when you're stuck on a boss, just call a friend or two over to help. Or the fact that you can bring your character from your solo experience into a multiplayer battleground of scummy tactics and dank memery.• Fast and responsive controls, unlike DS1• Memorable boss battles• Breathtaking scenery and widely interactive envoirments (Irithyll, Anor Londo, Lothric Castle...)• Some great characters reminiscent of the first game's ones (Firekeeper, Greirat, Patches, Siegward, Anri...)• References to older titles in the series (""Post-Apocalyptic"" Anor Londo, Siegmeyer's descendant, Solaire's armor...)• No Steam Cloud support (Dafuq, FromSoft? Even DS1 had it...)• Server issues• Engine bugs• Sometimes boring or dull envoirments (Cathedral of the Deep, Crucifixion Woods...)• Mostly detached locations (with some exceptions), unlike the fully interconnected DS1.TL;DR: Improved on most of the other games' flaws, making up a great game Gameplay-wise, but missing on quite a bit of the first game's charm for the overall world structure and locations.Oh yeah, also, it's hard.Like, very hard.Not frustratingly hard!But very hard, indeed."
Positive,-created a character-killed some of the normal enemies-explored the starting area-was fascinated by the graphics-found corridor on the right-there was a cool looking lizard-lizard is tough as fuck-YOU DIED69/10 would try again
Positive,the best RPG game of all time better than skyrim
Positive,fire keeper sit on me
Positive,"One of the greatest RPG title that I've played, Dark Souls III concludes the Dark Souls Trilogy and ends the Soulsborne series as a whole, giving tight gameplay that truly fixes where Dark Souls I went wrong, and adds a new layer of Story and Interaction with the world. With consistently changing environments and a well-woven story, the game manages to give abstract and distinctly unique areas a cool feel of adventure while also making the world a believeably connected place, with little deviating from the core feeling. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great combat based RPG, and even a game to play through with buddies."
Positive,"All in all I feel DS3 is a good game. Just like the other Souls games it punishes you for making mistakes or being greedy with your attacks. The game has a couple downsides, but I'd give it an 8/10Pros:+PvE will destroy you if you aren't careful and the bosses and enemies are fun to fight+Still has a wide variety of weapons, armors, and spells to choose from+PvP is fun, though as always there are ""OP"" builds that are commonly used to win fights easily+There are hackers that hack to roleplay a character, or a boss fight which can be pretty fun to fightCons:-There are hackers, which means there are going to be times where you get invaded by enemies raining 1500 damage hell onto your head with no way to retaliate-If you have an unstable/slow connection (such as mine) you might not be able to participate in PvP much or at all-There's a glitch that happens very often if you have a poor connection where a friendly Phantom cannot enter through fog doors to help in boss fights (never noticed this happening to me in previous Souls games)-While the bosses are varied, I noticed that most of them are all humanoid(also many are some form of Knight), I want more terrifying monsters FROM!"
Positive,Gud GameEdit: Deserves an award
Positive,good game if you want to punish yourself.
Positive,"The best Dark souls in my opinion.  It makes sense that it was the last one.  It rewards you for being good at the game and had a lot less of the cheapness of previous games.  Not saying it didn't still have cheap moments but compared to previous versions there are less.  The story overall is cooler as well in this one.  There are more people to have contact with, more lore, more fun mechanics.  Magic has a whole new element to it with MP.  The combat is sped up.  I like it alot.  Nothing really felt new but it was refined."
Positive,What a fantastic game! Having beat all the Souls games (yes even Demon Souls and Bloodborne) on the Playstation I was excited to playthrough the game on the PC.  Its been a blast thus far!10/10 would play again.
Positive,"First Dark Souls game i played, really enjoyed it had to get all the achievements. It was my 2016 Goty."
Positive,"Got gud, game got gudder, more gitting gud needed."

Positive,"This is another great game in atruly great series. If you have played the previous ones I believe you will find this one easier and maybe like me feel that the world is not as big or deep as in the previous ones. On the other hand if you have not played any of the series before, you will definetly consider this a brutally hard, huge and very deep game.All in all it is a great game, much like the previous ones with a lot of replayability. I had a few issues getting it to play well on my decrepid old pc but with some tweaking of the settings I was able to enjoy it all the way, wiht only a fewmonr hicups here and there (with the exception of the last dlc where my frame rate - until the first boss - was so low that it crawled).If you are a fan of the series, you cant miss it... regardless if it is better or worse than the others, it is Dark Souls....If you havent played the rest I would strongly encourage you to start from the first one."
Positive,"Singleplayer, Co-op and the occasional Arena fight: 10/10An amazing experience, def. my favorite Dark Souls.The Shitty de-synced multiplayer full of cheaters: 0/10I don't know why they thought this was a good idea, but there's no permament bans in this game.If you cheat you just get a 1 or 2 week ban EVERY SINGLE TIME and all you need to do to get it lifted is delete your character.Basically a cheat fest. There are some fun cheaters to play with like that gigantic fucking Shrek dude that makes 2 people go against each other, sets both of their HP to 3500, disables Estus Flasks (Main Healing Item in the game) and sets both on fire so the matches aren't that long, but he's online rarely and just an exception."
Positive,9/11 would die again
Positive,"Still stuck in the Undead Burg, it'd be great if someone put down their summon sign, thanks"
Positive,"Hard at first, but gets easier once you understand how things work and play out. Love the music and the customization and play styles."
Positive,easy game hope they add a hard mode
Positive,I can say i always saw dark souls as a super hard game that i would probably never finish or get past the first boss its the 4th day now that i am playing it and i have finished the game. 10/10 would finish again. Also mynameageff
Positive,One of the most amazing experiences that you can have in game. The atmosphere is great and the satisfaction from killing bosses is amazing. The game is epic as well as the DLCs will be. I highly recommend the game and THE HYPE FOR ASHES OF ARIANDEL IS REAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Positive,"I put this above Elden Ring, frankly--legitimately one of my favorite titles of all time. Whereas other Souls titles, reaching to include Elden Ring, suffer from pacing issues, this is a game that flows the entire way through--while ditching the moribund controls which sometimes hampered the first game and Demon's Souls."
Positive,"If you are someone who wanted to check out FromSoftware's back catalogue after playing Elden Ring, you will definitely vibe with this game. The game is more linear and the NPCs speak in a more cryptic manner, but the atmosphere and world building is done really well. The base game itself is also not that hard so the experience was not a frustrating one for me."
Positive,good game but if u suck like ethan dont play it
Positive,Best game series ever!
Positive,"You know you'll go straight ahead, even if you don't know the direction. You know you'd like to come back again and again, even if you can't touch the next campfire every time. You know that the darkness waiting for you is deep, but you'll raise your sword, right? After all, you are blessed by her full of hope. After all, the bonfire is still burning there,What about coming back, what about losing everything, what about meaninglessness? I just want to burn myself. I just want to point my sword forward. If your feelings meet setbacks, play with black soul; you will find that there is nothing unforgivable in the world, if there is, then play again."
Positive,"Where to start with this game... I love this series and consider the Souls/Borne games at the top of the Fantasy/Dark Fantasy genre. All three of the Dark Souls game are fantastic in their own right, but I feel this is the cleanest of the three. This game, being the last, is the most sentimental in my opinion. The DLCs are nothing to scoff at either. Sure, Ashes of Ariendel could’ve had more, but I see it and the Ringed City as just one big DLC. The Ringed City though, delivers the best conclusion to the series that I could ask for. Don’t even get me started on the music, the lack of it throughout makes the boss fights just that more awesome. Each boss is downright memorable due to this amazing soundtrack and gameplay. Combat is slow at first, but then it noticeably speeds up and every fight becomes more and more threatening. The community around the game is definitely something, but the online is typically entertaining. Replay value, there is so much you can do in this game and so many secrets to find, replaying this again is a pleasure, not a chore.This game is easiest of the three, but that doesn’t make me think any less of it. If you’re into a challenge and a good fantasy tale, try these games, you will not be sorry."
Positive,It teaches patience.
Positive,you will probably finish the whole game and still have no clue what's going on.at least you have your ultra great sword by your side.
Positive,"This spot marks our grave. But you may rest here too, if you like."
Positive,"I've never been so tense while playing a game, this one is exceptional. It'll beat you to your knees at some points and other times you'll cry from joy. The emotional mix that this game gives is rare, and I'm glad that I've played it. Oh, by the way, the online experience is great."
Positive,"Truly, one of the greatest game I have ever played. I enjoyed the pvp in this game. Some invaders are honorable and well, some aren't. Be careful of gravity tho. I personally think gravity is the biggest boss in this game :pAnyway, PRAISE THE SUN   \T/"
Positive,Make sure your anus can fit a fist at minimum
Positive,Requires plenty of patience and getting used to if its your first game in the series.
Positive,I finally got gud. Praise the sun!
Positive,Praise the sun.
Positive,"So it seems that these days any shovelware game with a spooky aesthetic, a dodge roll mechanic and a difficulty curve higher than Kirby's Epic Yarn gets slapped with the ""Souls-like"" label.But do those games let you P R A I S E  T H E  S U N ? ?I rest my case."
Positive,"I DEFINITELY recommend this game. It is one of my favorite games of all time and is extremely fun. The combat is excellent in BOTH PvE and PvP. I only have 100 hours on this account but I have hundreds of hours on other accounts. I also recommend the dlc, which add a solid 10hrs (more, if you're new to the game) per playthrough and add a variety of new weapons, spells, and armor. Also, don't ever give up! It may take many tries to beat a boss or get through an area, but once you do, it's a very rewarding feeling. And don't be afraid to summon a random phantom or bring a few friends along!"
Positive,"Thanks to the release of Elden Ring, an urge to try other FromSoftware's creations has awakened in me and then this game falls into my hands...The enviroment, music and voice acting is amazing, some people may say this game isn't completely new and original by instead having almost the same features of the previous games, but for me it was a great conclusion to the trilogy.The characters and vague lore are interesting and the levels and bosses design are impeccable. Classes are very different and appeal to every type of play-style. Combat is thankfully not hard not due to high HP & DMG opponents, but because of their moves. This allows people to actually learn and get better at the game, but without ''merely getting better'' by getting better weapons and armor.I have not played such complete and satisfying game in a long time, Thank you FromSoftware for this masterpiece.PS: PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PUT THIS AND THE OTHER GAMES ON SALE"
Positive,"bought this game expecting a fun fantasy game for my graduation summer. wish i knew at the time what i had signed up for, because as soon as i played it i grew a mustache and a beard - a scar formed over my right eye, and my muscle mass increased by about 1000%. i was born a female. i regularly have flashbacks to the invasions i partook in, and the invasions staged against me: i have as many confirmed kills as a Navy Seal. irl i live near a bunch of farms, so i stole a scythe from a neighbor and tried to dance about the town killing people - i was arrested before i could go through with it all.out of five, i give this three stars; the reason for the minus two is because my breasts were really nice before this game changed me"
Positive,"Overall very good, played black soul 1, played Black Soul 2, but the play is the D version, the black soul 3 into a genuine, compared to 1 and 2, common people think soul 3 difficulty is low, I think it is the contrast operation PC platform 1 and 2 are different, so simple a lot, playing 1 and 2 PC platform, you know the key set is simply the human, has many advantages, map, combat sense, drama, there are many game player can own experience, there were shortcomings, often encounter and plug, the title system is very strange, not a plug-in, some game player was dropped to normal titles and don't know what is the title of Bandai rules to consider before starting the game, you are forbidden to play any screen patch, or set the title."
Positive,"this game is the dark souls of graphics. they are good. Mak is quite good at this game,  so i think it is really cool. KFC bucketThe bosses in the game, are rather graphical and have high poly count. The sword play is resolution. My video card enjoys this game and so does my son."
Positive,I fking love this series.*Deep Accursed haunts me till today*
Positive,Don't trust the purple dinosaur
Positive,servers are back the game is fun
Positive,"A worthy sequel of the Souls series. Mouse & Keyboard port is well done this time too. Loads of nostalgic references to the prequels. Maybe a little poorly optimized, but it does run good enough and does not crash atleast for me. Regarding to PvE there is nothing too noteworthy to complain about. I've been into some PvP for quite a while now and I've noticed that Poise as we know it is nonexistent. This means generally if you are not able to either outreach or outpace your opponent you are going to have a bad time. Thankfully heavier weapons have hyper armor but this makes heavy armor a mere fashion tool instead of it giving some actual functionality. All in all 8/10."
Positive,Praise the chest
Positive,"Loved the game. Great environment, combat and boss design. Great music, lore too. Really difficult and challenging. Cant wait for more from software games."
Positive,Overall great experience. Lived up to the hype and exceeded my expectations.5/5
Positive,"""Just give up on your dreams and die, and send those new players straight into hell."""
Positive,Wow like always git gud have fun
Positive,"this is a very good game the bosses and areas are great but the only downside to this game is the community, you will find a lot of toxic people and hackers but besides that i really like the game"
Positive,Good game ahead therefore try skill
Positive,this is epic
Positive,ultra greatswords are funny in this one
Positive,"Prithee, be carefulI don't want to see m' work squandered"
Positive,A very hard game! With the greatest story / lore! Dark Souls and Bloodborn have the greatest lore! This game is very worth for the money! Great work!
Positive,"To your valour, my sword and our Victory Together!"
Positive,"Why are we still here?Just to suffer?Every night, I can feel my armorand my Greatsword...even my tears.The Souls I've lost...The Embers I've lost...Won't stop hurting...It's like they're all still there.You feel it too, don't you?"
Positive,"All Souls games are amazing, probably my favourite games of all time ( I have over 600+ hours mostly on consoles spread across all souls games). They do have their issues especially on PC with the potential of hackers but ... The experience outweighs everything tbh. 10/10 Recommend ! (Also you always have the option to play offline so)"
Positive,beautiful game good pvp and pve 10/10
Positive,death or dishonor
Positive,Easily one of the best games of 2016.
Positive,I think this is the only game who's tutorial beat me up worse than my dad
Positive,I rate this game hitbox/0.I recommend.There's hentai of a character people can't even see
Positive,Nothing beats the feeling of ruining other people's experience by murdering them in cold blood while they innocently progress through the game. 10/10.
Positive,"Uma das minhas series de jogos favoritos dark souls 3 esta realmente sensacional apesar do fato da primeira dlc ser curta ela e boa da mesma forma, a segunda dlc ja agradou d+ ela e bem mais duradoura com mts chefes realmente dificeis."
Positive,"The game is simply amazing.Best gameplay of the three entries.Best atmosphere of the three entries.Best soundtrack of the three entries.Best bosses of the three entries.Best weapons of all the three entries. (lotsa of comebacks as well)Coolest looking armor of all the three entries.Best summoning system (for jolly-fellas) to partake in all the three entries.That being said. The game ain't perfect. For instance, I'd really like to see a couple of things:-> More NPC interaction at Firelink Shrine. It would be much appreciated if they reacted more to the things the Unkindled One does. It takes too long for them to even bat an eye at the things you do.-> More NPC dialogs. For they repeat themselves way too much in this game, to the point of them sounding douchey or even seem that they've got Alzheimer.(I know the game has some bugs regarding NPCs, accidental triggers of appearances and whatnot, but that's minor imo).-> Maybe some ''Gestures'' could trigger specific reactions from monsters/NPCs (not only the Firekeeper, thanks Bloodborne for that one). I lost count of how many times I used ''Call Over'' to try to lure out enemies.-> Ice/Frost based Miracles/Sorceries. I We need them. (Maybe in future DLCs?)-> Darkmoon Blades / Blue Sentinels still suffer a great deal when leveling their covenant. Invaders have it way easier, as usual. In addition, it seems that the Blue Eye Orb no longer exists... I hope they bring it back.-> A graphical enhancement would be nice as well. The game looks gorgeous, but up close, you start to see its flaws and low texture, which are plentiful.Edit:-> NG+ Could be more similar to what they did on Dark Souls 2, the way it is right now could use some improvement (different enemies and perhaps different placement and so on)."
Positive,ในความคิดผม ผมประทับใจภาคแรกมากกว่า ขณะเดียวกันผมก็ต้องบอกว่ามันเป็นภาคที่ดีที่สุด-ระบบคอมแบททำได้ดุเดือดขึ้น การออกท่วงท่าอาวุธดูมีมิติกว่าเดิมในอาวุธแต่ละประเภท-ภาคนี้มีสถานที่ที่เป็น hub ใครที่เล่นภาคแรกแล้วรู้สึกเดินไกล ชีวิตลำบาก ภาคนี้ยัด npc ไว้ในสถานที่เดียวแล้ว-บอสไฟท์ทำได้สนุก ออกแบบบอสมาส่วนใหญ่แล้วดูดีมาก แต่โมเม้นหัวร้อนเลือดขึ้นหน้า หากใครผ่านภาคแรกและสองมาแล้ว คิดว่าภาคสามนี้คงไม่ค่อยได้เจอความรู้สึกนั้น แต่ถ้าคุณเล่นภาคนี้เป็นภาคแรก อันนี้คิดว่ามีแน่ๆ-เป็นภาคที่มีหลายสิ่งอย่างอำนวยความสะดวก โดยเฉพาะกองไฟใกล้ห้องบอส มองในแง่ดีคือไม่ต้องเดินไกล แต่คนที่ชอบสไตล์ภาคแรกอาจไม่ชอบจุดนี้เพราะมองว่ามันไม่ได้มีความกดดันระหว่างทาง ถึงแม้จะวิ่งหลบๆศัตรูเข้าห้องบอสมันก็ไม่เหมือนภาคแรกอยู่ดี อันนี้แล้วแต่คนชอบ สำหรับผมคิดว่ามันดี เพราะเป้าหมายคือเล่นให้มันจบๆไปแบบเร็วที่สุด-ถ้าคนชอบเนื้อเรื่องในภาคแรกแล้วหงายเงิบในภาคสอง ภาคสามมันกลับมาเยี่ยมแล้วครับ ...ก็ต้องหาอ่านตามเว็บที่เขาตีความกันอยู่ดีนั่นแหละครับ คือเกมมันไม่ได้บอกอะไรมากอยู่แล้ว 555-การออกแบบสถาปัตยกรรมหรือสภาพแวดล้อมในเกม ภาคนี้มันเป็นอะไรที่อลังการ โอ่อ่า แถมเอาใจแฟนเกมแบบสุดๆ-ดนตรีประกอบยังคงคุณภาพ ให้อารมณ์เหมือนเราเป็นมดสู้กับยักษ์ ฟังแล้วจิตใจมันพองโต-คุณค่าในการหยิบมาเล่นซ้ำสูงมากสรุป มันเป็นเกมที่ยอดเยี่ยมนั่นแหละครับ
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is a great game (though not as good as Bloodborne), but avoid the multiplayer at all costs. There are many cheaters at this point in the games life cycle and most legitimate players have either left, or play offline like I have started doing. Additionally, 9 out of 10 phantoms you find in the early areas of the game are using equipment from later areas of the game or the DLC. This is accomplished by trading items with other players, and while it has restrictions on upgraded weapons, usually the late game weapons are in a power class of their own and make the early game trivial. This has always been the case with DS3, and while it was worse in DS1, multiplayer wasn't relied upon in the first game as much. As much as I love this game, checking the community hub discussions just reinforces the feeling that the community is zombified- pretty much all the threads are negative feedback about other players, or about players who have been banned for cheating."

Positive,it good game
Positive,"Ahhh the final installment of the souls series... I started playing the series on PS3 (demon souls) and i never finished it as I was still scrub at that time and had no idea WTF IS THIS GAME IS ALL ABOUT. I returned to the series with dark souls 2 and to be honest I liked it. Someone once told me Dark souls was superior so I borrowed the game and gave it a shot. and I liked both.Now we have the third and final game of the series, and gosh it is amazing. I was so excited for the game that it really pissed me off when certain people get to play 3 weeks earlier, and items location starts to pop up on the net. Trying to avoid spoilers as much as I could but well, internet is the internet. But at least there wasnt much spoilers after Abyss Watchers since there was an embargo. Which is nice..ish Still sucked that you couldnt play till 3 weeks later.  Now to the actual gameplayIt plays wonderfully on my GTX 970. No random crashed. Combat is fun. I'd say its a combo between bloodborne style with dark souls 1. A lot of weapons to choose from. So all builds are viable builds. Except estoc.. cause fck estoc.. pffff ConsHackers... well we know this would happen on any PC game. Sigh. \I'd give this game a solid 9.5/10. I take 0.5 away cause there's 3 FUCKING POISON SWAMP AREA. Its like miyazaki just go and like.. hey you know what would be better than 1 poisonous swamp area? 3 POISONOUS SWAMP AREA. Blurgh."
Positive,"Not died on tutorial and first boss (Iudex Gundyr)""Haha! Souls game are EZ!""Proceed to Firelink Shrine, met the naked samurai, YOU DIED.""........ K."" 9/10 like Dark Souls 1 on drugs."
Positive,Extremely enjoyable video game. 10/10
Positive,oh shit here we go again
Positive,"i played all the souls games, include demons souls, finish all of them couple of time, have 100% achievements in them.very close to finish my first round in dark souls 3, liked everything they put there, from level design(mix of demons souls\bloodborn\dark souls1), interesting boss designs, nexus looks great, a lot of hidden paths\roots to discover.for me demons souls was the best in the series, but maybe dark souls 3 will take this throne.."
Positive,"Awesome game, no matter your skill level or experience in other FromSoftware games. If you haven't played Elden Ring, this will teach you all the fundamentals. But if you have played it, then this will be a more ""fair"" and straight forward gameplay that only a few bosses will feel really tough, but nonetheless, it's a really great game."
Positive,this game makes me wanna come on your dad
Positive,Don't even need to say why this game is amazing. Just buy it you tit.
Positive,"Definitely a must play, and really fun pvp... until you meet cheaters and glitchers that is!"
Positive,I doubt you could even imagine how great this game is
Positive,Love this game
Positive,i beat the game and actually have 60 hrs on it and it didnt log because i did it all offline without wifi. also this game is hard as fuck so have fun with that shit. also i loved the game and the story so its worth it but get ready to break shit when you get to a certain boss who bends you over and spanks you like he does his step daughter. thanks.
Positive,"Great game, beaten it three times on my Xbox and is well worth the £10 it currently costs. Though on my first playthrough I didn't like it that much and thought it was pointlessly challenging after you get through that first playthough you get to see just how far you have progressed and everything the game has taught you shows through how easy the once tough enemies now are. The use of new game+ lets you use your old weapons to beast through the beginning parts of the game with your improved loot. Or if you want to see how much your skill alone has come along, you can create a new character at soul level 1 to show off everything you have learnt and experience the challenge again. All in all I would recommend the game for everyone as it is one of my favourite games."
Positive,"The lore is thicker than the armour of the YamatoThe Bosses cheat more than ClintonGrind is worse than the first windmillSoundtrack has more fire than ChernobylCombat is jankier than Portland trafficbut you will play it anyway.And when your CPU goes kaput and you lose all your saved games, you will play it AGAIN."
Positive,"Cant help but to fall in love with every dark souls game that i play. Dark Souls 1 showed me the joy of a game not holding my hand and pointing me in the direction I need to go. Dark Souls 2 introduced me to invasions and PvP, playing with builds and trying crazy strats to defeat my opponents. Dark Souls 3 came with a more easy and linear approach to the series but not lacking in difficulty due to the new timing and wind up animation of bosses. The scaling of areas and breath taking views that you encounter will leave you in ahhh as you discover shortcuts, traps and mobs that will wreck you within minuets. The variety of bosses will keep your heart racing and wanting more. There are also a massive verity of builds that you can create for pvp and online play. As a fan of every Dark Souls, I must highly recommend this game for veterans and noobs of the series."
Positive,What a way to end the franchise. recommended for hardcore gamers
Positive,Servers are back online
Positive,Love the boss fights
Positive,great graphics and story line.
Positive,"Hated it, played it, loved it"
Positive,"So this is my second review post DLCs. I have to say that this game is really refined, and EXTREMELY good. Smooth & adddictive combat, a wide arsenal of weaponry, great landscape. However, even tho it does have the same feel as Dark Souls. I personal believe that the map layout is a bit sloppy, making you feel like you are just moving bonfire to bonfire. (TOO MANY BONFIRES) The map layout is not as looping and vertical as Dark Souls. But other than it hot having a better map layoutm itz a 9|10"
Positive,"At the time of its release, Dark Souls 3 was a groundbreaking game. But in the year of our lord 2024, with both Elden Ring and Shadow of the Erdtree having released, is there any reason to play this game? Yes. Yes there is.If you played through Elden Ring and found the legacy dungeons to be the most compelling part of the game, then you'll probably like this, given that these previous Fromsoft titles are what the ""legacy"" is referring to. Paths that wind around until you unlock a shortcut back to a bonfire you were sitting at 10 minutes ago; amazing level-design; and challenging PvE in-between the bosses. The runs back to the bosses in this game are a little dire compared to Elden Ring, but there's nothing that's TOO bad, and the hardest bosses tend to have pretty forgiving run-backs. The Ash of War system in Elden Ring is in its infancy here, with a total lack of interchangability of skills between weapons. While this is disappointing in retrospect, one positive consequence of this is that every weapon has to be balanced to be at least somewhat viable on its own merits. Elden Ring and particularly its DLC has a glaring problem in that they are explicitly designed around encouraging you to change builds and use features like the spirit ash system if your build sucks at dealing with bosses. Why struggle to overcome Malenia for 200 attempts with your crystalian-themed build if you can just slap on Bloodhound's Step and use three statuses at once while your spirit summon flattens her with greatarrows? There's no reason NOT to use the most effective strategy because you have all the tools to make it at your disposal. In Dark Souls 3, however, the boss design is such that most every boss can be beaten by most every (reasonable) build and by a competent player, and being allowed to be creative is, I think, the strongest indication of good boss design in a game. Ashes of Ariandel and the Ringed City DLCs add some of the best content in the game. The former is accessible quite early, but is scaled to a much higher level; I would only enter when you're exploring Lothric Castle proper. The latter can be accessed either at the end of AoA or just before the final boss of base Dark Souls 3. The bosses are a comfortable middle between the anime 82-move combo lightshows of Elden Ring bosses and the slow, plodding knight duels of the previous games. They're epic and fair and I loved throwing attempt after attempt at them, feeling myself improve. Peak Dark Souls, in my opinion."
Positive,"Dark Souls 1 was effective but ugly as sin. Dark Souls 2 was gross in its entirety. Dark Souls 3 is clean, crisp and gorgeous to boot. It has the tight gameplay of the first, and none of the soul-lessness that the second suffers."
Positive,Extremely nice game.
Positive,-Cant beat a boss with 100 HP-Friend makes fun of me0/10 don't play with friends
Positive,I died and I liked it.
Positive,This game is good.
Positive,dark souls best game ever never and ever u cant find a game like this
Positive,I have 371 games in my library.  I've finished two.  This is one of them.
Positive,From what I can tell the servers are back up.
Positive,"Depressing,frustrating and hard,really really hard. Tbh the lifeless terrifying world of dark souls 3 made me rethink my life.Also thanks to those summoned phantoms in the end.Would not have been possible to finish the game without them."
Positive,"All I can say is :praisesun:and enjoy this chicken stir fry recpie - Serves 4- 10 mins to prepare and 10 mins to cook- 325 calories / serving- HealthyINGREDIENTS:- 1 orange, zested and juiced- 2tbsp soy sauce- 2tbsp sesame oil- 250g (8oz) tender stem broccoli- 5cm (2in) piece root ginger- 1tbsp sunflower oil- 1 garlic clove, finely sliced- 1 red pepper, deseeded and thinly sliced- 150g Straight To Wok Noodles- 400g (13oz) chicken fillet, cut into thin slicesMETHODStep 1 - Mix together the orange zest and juice, soy sauce and sesame oil and set aside.Step 2 - Blanch the broccoli in boiling water for 2 minutes, then drain well and set aside.Step 3 - Finely shred the ginger.

Positive,"This was my first soulsgame. After I got it I couldnt even beat the tutorial boss and stopped playing. Then a year later I came back to try again and after finishing my first playthrough with a friend I did a run on my own. Then due to reinstalling windows I lost my characters which hurt but I ended up starting from scratch, determined to 100% the game and I did. From not being able to beat tutorial boss to 100% achievements. Fromsoft games are special. Worth its price and an experience I wouldnt want to miss."
Positive,Too hard to continue playing.Too stubborn to refund it.To late to refund it.Too hard to win. 10/10 wish i could play ;-;
Positive,fun to play with other players
Positive,"Very welcoming for players wanting to try the Souls Series. The bosses in this game are very  fun for the most part *cough* Midir *cough*. The game is tough at first, but once you adapt to the mechanics and the enemies patterns, you should have less trouble progressing. The only downside to the game I am seeing right now is the linearity and PvP. The game is linear, so there is less exploration than previous Souls games, but thats just my opinion. PvP though is full of A. hackers or B. Gankers. Of course, you can get good enough to beat Gankers, but the learning curve is steep. For hackers, download Blue Sentinel Mod so you are safer."
Positive,"Great game with great atmosphere that takes its difficulty seriously, but never in any unfair methods, making you feel that when you die, it was entirely your own fault, that you can learn from this and hopefully defeat the obstacle that killed you and feel all the more satisfied with the victory.Except the Multiplayer, that can go burn in hell for all I care. (Except the Sunbros, they cool)EDIT: On a side note, I actually wanted to say that the game actually personally felt much easier than I expected, for I heard people say this game ""is the hardest game ever"" and expected to be stuck on every boss for hours, but no, never went to double digits deaths on any of the bosses, even Nameless King.Not sure to chop this up to me having a lot of experience with games in general and having good reflexes, or other people just being really bad at this game and ""hyping"" up the difficulty. Enjoyed my time with the game regardless and appreciated the good method to difficulty this  game employs."
Positive,"A great game for anyone with the patience to learn and play around it's mechanics. The entire point of DS is to provide a challenging but ultimately fair combat system while also letting players explore a dystopian fantasy world. It can be a daunting task at first and public perception doesn't exactly make the game look even remotely approachable, but I assure you that the game's difficulty is over-hyped. The game has several ""soft"" difficulty settings that can help you control how hard the experience will be. Don't get me wrong, it's still challenging but any pattern seeking human with a knack for using a controller can perform well enough to have a good time. Which leads me to my next point, use a controller. The game is designed for one and while it does have MnK integration, it doesn't work very well for this type of game. I use a wireless 360 controller with a cheap little knockoff wireless adapter I found on amazon years and years ago. Pretty much any controller you have will work well here (never used a steam controller myself though). Overall, a great buy."
Positive,Love this story.but so hard
Positive,"This game is really great. It reminds me a little bit of Bloodborne and Dark Souls 1, so if you're a fan of either of those games I think you'd like this one. This game is better than Dark Souls 1 in my opinion."
Positive,It's souls game don't be pussy and play it
Positive,great game awesome weaponry and skills and nice story very athmospheric!
Positive,This game will make you hate your life which makes it good.
Positive,Finally I beat this masterpiece
Positive,cool game ngl
Positive,h a r d a s a m f
Positive,Fuck this piece of shit game
Positive,A little bit very mkabel rages but ahla mshak10/10
Positive,I gitted gud and praised the sun!
Positive,It's a great game assuming you're up to the challenge
Positive,"i remember when i first bought and booted up the game, i was annoyed the keyboard controls were not mapped properly, or are just annoying when you dont know them, and how i almost refunded the game after it took me 2 1/2 hours and 45 tries to beat gundir (88 on pontiff on first run). now i have beaten it 7 times on nearly every class (all dlc) and i am currently doing a no damage boss run. 9.5/10, one of the few games i dont regret spending a cent on"
Positive,"Oh boy, Where to start...We all know Dark Souls has a ""reputation"" of sorts. Be it good or bad, nearly everyone has heard something about it. From the hilarious/infuriating/epic PVP, To the rage inducing,.... everything else.  Overall:  8/10 *  *Uses the “Very Good!” carving, and then praises the sun*Graphics: 7/10 Good but not cutting edge. Expect reused assets from previous ”From Software” games.Gameplay: 9/10 Viceral, cut-throat combat, Addictive items collection mentality.Replayability: 6/10 New Game Plus (NG+) Is not what it was in previous games. But with multiple quest lines and endings, worth a replay for the truly devoted.Price to pay: Game: About 30-50$ (USD) Season Pass: Unknown, No DLC released at time of writing.Estimated time to finish: About 40-120 Hours for average/casual gamers.I finished the first playthrough of the game with almost exactly 81 hours on my first character at level 109. This being said, it was not a true 100% run, as I messed up many quests, And even restarted after a 41 hour character had made some royal mistakes that caused the entire game’s progression to be unsatisfactory with my standards. There are 3 endings that i know of, and to get all 3 expect about 20-40 hours per playthrough after your first.Key Notes/Warnings:Be wary of Keyboard and Mouse. This game does much better than past installments of using these to play, but you will truly enjoy this game on a different level with a controller.Be prepared to use  a guide for the game. The good gamers at darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com have put an astoundingly well done wiki-togeather that has guides on every item of the game, from the mundane to the extrodinary. Online play is sometimes hard to connect to. (I suspect this will become better latter as the popularity fades.) “Death Ahead! therefore, Try resignation.” You Will Die. Alot. Be prepared to lose your souls over, and over, and be prepared to call for help from both guides and co-op players. But be wary, those you call to help may infact harm you by making your game appealing to those with a dark heart seeking to kill those who would so boldly try to kill the lords of cinder.Target gamer: Action-RPG Fans who don't mind using a controller. The game has everything most RPG fans crave, If you like RPGs, then this is a game that I suggest you try.The Short Version:Great game; With unique World, NPCs, Foes. Very Difficult for first time players, And thoroughly enjoyable as the rewards for every single action feel visceral, as if you can truly put yourself in the shoes of your character. The downsides are that this game is indeed so hard you will likely fail all of your NPC quest lines without some form of help, and even with help you may still fail due to some bugs creeping in.Pros:Good game length for money spent.Easy to use, hard to master combat styles. Decent sense of accomplishment and failure, Actions feel like they matter.Absolute tons of loot, weapons, gear, and thus a multitude of play styles.The Co-Op is rewarding and enjoyable, And the PVP is just as much so for the most part.Cons:Poorly Ported controls all but demand you have a controller. (Still the best souls yet in this regard)Buggy quest lines may cause characters with many, many, hours into their development to fail quests even if the user has done nothing wrong.Other Key Notes/Features:Unique Messaging system can leave you laughing, scratching your head, or simply shaking your head with a sigh.Unique take on Co-Op and PVP in an otherwise single-player focused world and game.Deep, but obscured lore. If you have the eye and mind for it, you can uncover an entire hidden world of strife.The Long Version: In the Dark Souls World there is no element more fleeting than the flame. Powerful beyond measure, and as fragile and fleeting as life in this world of the undead and horrors beyond reason. That being said, the game is as frustrating as it is rewarding. The rollercoaster of achievements, and failures is one you will have to ride at your own peril as one moment you're cursing at a boss made of bits and bytes of data, And the next, you are awe-stuck by your achievement of said boss’ demise at your hand, sending a very real dose of dopamine coursing through your veins as is the proverbial crack-like nature of this game. Immense, souls soaring(literally) highs, and deep, soul crushing(literally) lows.Dark Souls Is pretty, It is graphic, And above all else, it is a tale of tragedy, as if you look into the lore, you will find nothing but ruin, and pain. And so it mirrors this obscured misery unto it’s players making them through fits of rage, and bouts of depression when they die, and eventually lose those hard earned souls. But let's stop for a moment and reflect; Is it really the game that is difficult, or is it really a case of knowledge being the key to all of your problems? Case and point, The first boss; I was having a hell of a time fighting it when i first started. And i’ll admit, i was never the best souls player, but i enjoyed it enough that i kept at it. On my 12th attempt my friend made mention of a slight fact, that the boss mimicked the fighting style of a previous boss. Knowing the boss in question from Dark Souls 1, i put to use my new found information and on my 13th time at the boss, I managed to kill it without using a single health potion because I understood it now.This game does not hold your hand, And should you allow someone else to hold your hand, you will rob yourself of the true joy of this game, Which is discovering your own potential rather than riding on the research and insight of others.“Die well my friend, your souls, shall not be wasted.” ~Jes McDevlin: From the fight with Sif in Dark Souls 1+Rep if you know Sif’s whole story and why he was one of the most tragic bosses in DS."
Positive,"Literally just started playing with a friend, 2 minutes in then we got invaded, the invader won't die no matter how much we try and hit him. FeelsbadmanSecond time invaded, we're still near the Highwall of Lothric, someone came in with a huge mace (which turns out to be first boss's weapon) and killed me and my phantom in 2 hits, gets pointed down. Feelsbadman-Update | 09/05/20 -Turns out there's this thing called Watchdogs that helps to ""fend off"" the cheaters, it kinda work but i still sometimes see someone with unlimited estus whenever i got invaded for some reason. But everything else is pretty enjoyable so far and finally managed to beat the first boss and went to the next area.-Update | 11/05/20 -Got both me and a friend finished the first area and started summoning each other as a phantom in the first bonfire in the Undead Settlement. As we proceed to walk down the stairs, friend goes AFK, got invaded, the guy doesn't use any armor or weapons except for a shield. He spams Parry but doesn't work since he's lagging pretty bad, whenever we get his health bar almost depleted, he'd heal and this goes on pretty much forever til my friend went ALT+F4 Will update the review as time goes on-Update | 17/10/24 -Ended up finishing and 100%ed the game since a long time ago, i typed the review waaaay back then when i was still pretty new to souls-like games, now im quite literally just an addict for it, thank you fromsoft"
Positive,This game is good you should try it with your friends awsome laggy pvp fights i love it
Positive,Dark Souls 3 >>>>> Elden Ring
Positive,"I've only played a little bit, but it's every bit as fun as the previous installment (Which I owned on the PS3). As for the technical issues, either they have sorted them all out now or I've been very lucky as I played for 3 hours straight and never even experienced so much as  a stutter on 4k resolution with a 980 ti and i5-4690k at max settings AA off. Very fun, very recommended, hopefully all tech issues have been sorted.EDIT: Don't know why this is getting ""downvoted"" or whatever; it seems like many people are having problems with this game, I was just stating in my experience that I have had none and the game is very enjoyable.EDIT 2: Apparently people are getting banned for no reason from online; I have not had this happen to me but I do find such action from the developers despicable, and if this problem persists or affects me I will not hesitate to change my review accordingly. I still love this game however, and I am usually not embered so that may explain how I have not been affected by cheaters messing with my save data.EDIT 3: So far I still have not seen the almighty and furious ban-hammer, however as mentioned I am rarely embered, making my online play quite limited compared to normal. This does not mean that I do not fear getting banned though, as it is now the main reason I kill myself after beating bosses (as to lose ember and not be connected to online). Again, I will rewrite all this if anything changes, but I'm sure I'd still recommend the game even for just its single player experience."
Positive,It's like Dark Souls.
Positive,just press space dont stop just press it every sec
Positive,I like to think that there is an alternate reality where you need to beat this game to enter manhood.
Positive,"I first played dark souls 1, then this game, then the rest of the series, beat them all but I still come back to this game. Funny thing is after beating Elden Ring and the dlc, Im given new ideas for builds in this game, and new ways to play this masterpiece. Heresy is not native to this world, It is but a contrivance, all things can be conjoined. Fear not the dark my friend, and let the feast begin."
Positive,"Dark Souls 3, huh? It's a game for those who like to suffer, just like Megatron's leadership. It's all about dying, dying, and more dying. If you're into feeling like a failure over and over again, then this game is perfect for you. And if you're worried about forgetting that you died, don't worry, the game will make sure to remind you every single time. It's like being stuck in a glitched loop, but with more swords and monsters. I give it 10/10 because it's the closest thing to being trapped in Megatron's lack of leadership."
Positive,I love suffering
Positive,"This became one of my favourite games after playing it, even though I took breaks. Still haven't finished my first run, but I bought the season pass in advance. Definitely recommend."
Positive,This is certainly one of the best games I have ever played. I wish there were more games like this one!
Positive,"In shortPvE is really good, but way easier than Dark Souls 1, it's also way more linear.PvP is pretty interesting, sometimes you have a really good experience with smooth hitboxes, no latency, and just overall an enjoyable time with the game.And sometimes the experience can be compared to having fucking kidney stones, playing against a dude from the other side of the world with latency so high that he's just actually invincible or even completely invisible, and you start questioning how the developers didnt fucking fix that shit even after the game's been out for two years.But overall, it's still pretty fun nonetheless.>inb4 ""git gud"""
Positive,"Great game! fun pvp and pve! if you see someone from China, Japan, or Russia just run. ALL of them are lag lords."
Positive,"try tongue, but hole"
Positive,i love dark souls
Positive,"I wish I had gotten around to playing this game sooner, hackers make you emit sh*t particles from your ass if you do the squat emote this is amazing"
Positive,Fellas I must say I can't stop dreaming about Fire Keeper's feet and armpits like honestly the only thing I want from life is to smell her beautiful smell and lick sweat and dirt off her soles
Positive,its nice check it out
Positive,This game has two outcomes:You either get depress or the depression cures you.
Positive,"Honestly the best souls game in a while.Very gorgeous game, very stable for me. No crashes so far, great gameplay and just an all around blast.I highly recommend this game for fans of the Souls franchise as this is a very fantastic game."
Positive,"Good afternoon. I am here to talk about the greatness of dark souls. I have Dark souls 3 on every platform including PS, Xbox, PC, Nintendo Switch, IOS, and android. I have approximately 1 million hours on it, and I recommend you dive your nose into the gift that keeps on fucking you in your ass."
Positive,"Like the predecessors of the Dark Souls series, it's a gloriously detailed and gorgeous dark fantasy universe.The singleplayer experience is hard, unforgiving. You are taught bare-bones basics of how to control your character, and then it's all up to yourself as the player to adapt and manage your own survival in a world where anything and anyone has the ability to kill you on the spot. But no matter how many times you fall, you'll never be granted death.Be a Knight, Sorcerer, Archer, or a deprived miscreant void of any respectable equipment and test your mettle in a world where both Environments, Monsters, Undead, Bosses aswell as other Players are determined to make you a mental masochist. This is a world of suffering, and you'll realize this sooner or later.Choose and make your OWN character. Choose your own weaponry. Make your own unique hero.Multiplayer can be misleading upon purchase. Multiplayer is intertwined into the singleplayer experience. There's no multiplayer lobbies, hubs, or anything of the sort. Aslong as you have internet connection, you will be able to spot messages upon the ground that other players before you has left behind, become invaded by hostile players but also be able to summon other players to help you in -your- struggles.Everything the game has to offer, must be explored and -found- in the game itself. There's no ""Press ESC and click on Multiplayer"" kind of deal. All forms of luxury must be fought for, and obtained.How immersive isn't that?Dark Souls as a whole, is a dark fantasy universe with dimensions colliding into one another. In the world of most fantasy hack & slash games your hero can usually withstand blows that could demolish a building and act unphased by it all. Only there's one major difference in Dark Souls in comparison to other fantasy games......your Hero, is only human. Go ahead, get struck by a giant. Let's see if you stand tall afterwards.Filthy peasant."
Positive,"Ah, good, it's back. The game in which you can destroy giant demonic monsters, but you cant jump over a 10cm wall. Nevermind that! Great PvE challenge and strategic co-op combat. Damn great. No mind-numbing hack'n'slash or self-lobotomising pew-pew.One sad thing is the compromise of gameplay for the sake of a controller. Dash and roll locked to the same button? BLEH.But who cares! This game actually stimulates brain activity instead of shriveling your grey matter up into an unusable mash."
Positive,"This is an absolutely AMAZING sequel to Dark Souls and Dark Souls too. I'll try to keep this brief and spoiler free though. The PvE and lore is done really well but on the other hand the PvP balancing and covenants are really poorly done. I feel like FromSoft really took a lot from Bloodborne and put it into this series which wasn't the best idea, the increased speed of PvP causes a lot of it to feel... bland.Overall if they can fix the balancing in the coming months and with the inevitably fantastic DLC that is going to come out I'll give this game a solid 9 right now... which is actually really low considering how much I like it but the balance issues can't be overlooked."

Positive,"If you are a fan of Dark Souls then this is the sequal you really wanted when you bought Dark Souls 2. If you have never played a Demon/Dark Souls game before, this is still a great place to start. Dark Souls is easily a grown up version of the Legend of Zelda with it's puzzles, storyline, and grand adventure.Pros:Find familiar Dark Souls 1 areas with new storylinesStunning visual vistasSmooth combat that doesn't feel twitch basedEach enemy is unique in it's own wayEasy multiplayerMore weapons, armor. and emotes than you know what to do withNo classes, play how you wantYOU DIEDCons:Litttle intensive on the hardware requirements for a game locked at 30 FPSHad to roll back my Nvidia drivers (Fix should be inbound?)Fromsoft is terrible at communicating with players (see previous)No VACMultiplayer is not cross platformKeyboard controls are terrifying, you need a controllerYOU DIED"
Positive,"A lot of games do yearly iterations of some sort, and usually people roll their eyes and growl angrily. Case in point: that new Call of Duty: Bioshock Infinite edition seems to have broken global hate records for some reason. While I'm not sure I agree 100% that yearly sequels are evil, I will say that I pay very little attention to them generally.From Software's Souls of the Week series is a strange little exception to that rule. I've wound up buying the PC versions of all their Souls-y games at some point, regardless of the fact that broadly, they're extremely similar games. I think they get away with it because the games themselves have no market equivalent. If you don't like Battlefield du Jour, there's a Rainbow Six or Call of Booker DeWitt for you. While obviously these games aren't the same, they hit the same broad strokes: military dudes shooting other military dudes in extremely contrived yet intense scenarios. I cannot think of a game like Dark Souls without having to seriously qualify the statement. I'm not aware of another series that apes survival horror, action-rpg, and adventure games so well.Dark Souls 3 is no exception to this.Basically, you've played DS3 already if you've ever played Dark Souls and Bloodborne around the same time. DS3 is the fastest entry in the core series. Enemies hit hard and often, and leave hilariously little room for error, even more so than DS1 and 2's more punishing fights. The combat, fortunately, is a little more forgiving than its predecessors. Dodge rolls work against attacks you won't believe, and frequently I found rolling into an attack somehow stopped it from working outright (I remember collision detection in DS1 stopping my rolly antics quite thoroughly).Dark Souls 3's map design is a bit lacking in my opinion. Namely, there's a lot less choice this time. I can't think of any real branching paths that stay branching for very long. Most of the time, you'll be exploring cathedrals and castles. The overall map variety might be the only thing Dark Souls 2 did better than its sister (better) games, and Dark Souls 3 doesn't have a lot to show for itself in this regard.That said, Dark Souls 3 shines in a few separate areas. It doesn't have the quirky-yet-haunting lore of DS1, but tells a reasonable tale in its own right. A particular, powerful motif is vulnerability. I built up a roster of friendly NPCs around the closest thing the game has to a home, and slowly watched them abandon me, or outright die, one by one. Generally, this happened because the game demands you care for and watch over them, something I failed to do many times. Solemn, powerful stuff.Dark Souls 3's greatest boon is its roster of bosses. There are 19 in the game, each one memorable in a way not even DS1 attained consistently. I might just be willing to argue that DS3's boss design has no equal in gaming. No, these aren't the hardest bosses in the series. But each fight offers firm stakes, be it a change in the timing of blows, disorienting arenas, strong ties to complex underlying lore, or simply great design. DS3's worst boss encounters would be the highlight of many other action-RPGs.There's not really much to say beyond this. It's a Souls game. Chances are, you know if you're bound to like it. It doesn't offer the raw invention of DS1, but it's more grounded and whole than DS2. If nothing else, it's a fantastic note to end the series on."
Positive,"Man, it’s hard. To make up my mind on this game.Despite the general consensus, I feel like Dark Souls 3 is simultaneously the best and the worst of the trilogy. Let me explain why.It’s best in so bloody many ways. It has the best controls. Arguably, the best multiplayer. The best boss design. It’s the most artistically consistent one of the three: the influence of Bloodborne is felt in every detail which makes Dark Souls 3 stand out even more amidst other dark fantasies – that is the style becomes even more unsettling, even more bleak, even more subtly sickening. Miyazaki and his colleagues have fully realized their vision of this grim world: no more goofy enemies from the first game, now everything you meet will make you feel awe, or horror, or pity, or disgust – or all of that at once.Dark Souls 3 also honed its trick-based game design to the absolute extreme. As anyone who ever played the series knows, the AI is not the strongest suit of FromSoftware projects – instead they rely on setpiece encounters scattered around the world, often in the form of ambushes. Before, you could always expect the game to play some insidious trick on you. Well, now you don’t even need to expect anything – you know the game is playing dirty. All. The. Time. Every enemy that looks like easy prey has in fact plenty of support just out of sight. Every item that you see in the distance is bait and you will be attacked immediately after picking it up. Every other room you walk into has a few layers of enemy opposition – many of those layers hidden. It’s simply beautiful how absolutely b*tchy it all is, and it hugely incentivizes you to beat this game to a pulp like it’s done to you on so many occasions. It’s surprising to see how with this attitude bonfire and shortcut placement feels liberal compared to the previous games.It’s worst in only one way – and depending on what you want from games, it might be a completely irrelevant negligibility or a deal breaker. It’s utterly, utterly secondary. Art can be proactive and reactive. That’s why most movie sequels turn out to be bad: because they can’t be brave anymore; to be good they have to operate inside the limits of the original piece of art while being proactive at the same time, subverting what was proactive in the first project. Dark Souls 3 is very reactive, and almost non-proactive at all – even more so than part 2. The mythos of the first game feels so far removed and almost irrelevant, and yet ever present in forms of rather ham-handed fanservice here and there and everywhere. A few nods to the second game are made, but for the most part it’s as if it never existed and its events never even mattered. It is obvious that while mechanically the series underwent a stunning evolution across the years, ideologically it exhausted itself at the first installment. Where the first game dealt with primordial forces and the second one – with the heirs of those forces, here it’s just a bunch of degenerates pointlessly scrambling at the end of the dying world in which every iteration of events has already played out multiple times. The secret ending might transform it, but who are we to say it’s not another turn of the same wheel – just on a different axis? Another thing. Not so bad and not so big of a deal, but nonetheless. That famous trademark Dark Souls level design? You’ll get some of it, but you won’t get a whole lot of it. Yes, the world is still interconnected, but not to the same degree as it used to be – primarily, if in the first game you could argue that all the roads lead to Firelink Shrine (or to Majula village in 2), here it’s disconnected from the world entirely! Plus, you can teleport from the start, and shortcuts are plenty and generous, which makes navigation rather trivial.All in all – if you want to experience an extract of Dark Souls, look no further – you’ll have a ton of fun unraveling this insidious labyrinth of a world. If you are here because of how much you heard of the renowned Dark Souls mythos or level design, just go and play the first game.PSDark Souls 2, despite being considered the black sheep of the franchise, has those great gimmick locations, so that’s also something to look out for if you just want a cool dark fantasy world to explore."
Positive,it's okay i guess
Positive,"Difficult to learn and master, punishing bosses, superb atmosphere. You WILL die, again, and again, and again, and again, but then something will happen, you'll find yourself getting closer and closer to defeating the boss, the health bar will get just a little bit lower the next time you face them, that's when you realise that you're getting better and predicting their moves as you dodge their deadly onslaughts, and then, you will finally achieve victory, and you'll exalt a long sigh of relief and joy as you rest your wary ashen body at the bonfire, but you don't let that joy consume you, because you know that the dangers ahead are more terrifying and deadly than the ones before.  You, the unkindled ash will fight on until your sacred duty is fulfilled, for that is why the bell woke you from your slumber. Only you can decide the fate of this world. Only you can decide the fate of the fire. You, the Ashen one. This game is next to the witcher 3 as one of my favourite RPG's of all time. This game is not for the faint of heart, but if you're willing to be patient and learn you will experience one of the most rewarding games of this generation. Don't fear death, for it is the only way you will learn, embrace it and it will serve you well.May the flames guide thee."
Positive,"""Once, the Lord of Light banished Dark, and all that stemmed from humanity. And men assumed a fleeting form. These are the roots of our world. Men are props on the stage of life, and no matter how tender, how exquisite... A lie will remain a lie!""Dark Souls 3 is amazingly indescribable. This game made by Hidetaka Miyazaki is a masterpiece that will deeply amaze you with it's rich story and impressive soundtrack by Motoi Sakuraba. The story of the game is like a puzzle in which players have to put pieces together in order to understand the game. If for a moment you feel that the gameplay is difficult and unbearable for you, be sure that you have not deeply understood the game yet. The game became easy and enjoyable for you when you realize the main point of Dark Souls 3. If you still didn't play it, it's time to defeat the Dark. If you're already played and you became disappointed or Failed to beat the Dark, it's time to try again."
Positive,"great game, play before elden ring. Once you can jump you cant go back."
Positive,If you want to start with the Souls Series I suggest you do it here. Probably the easiest Souls game to get into and it's still a classic.
Positive,"Out all of the Souls games, this one is my favourite next to Bloodborne. But as always, like every game made by FromSoftware it had a lot of wasted potential.The game overall is enjoyable, the Level Design is nice, don't have much to say about it, except for Farron Keepand the Grand Archives. In my opinions those areas are just annoying to go through. The camera of course, it's still the same as the previous Souls games and it didn't improve at all and sometimes you just have this big object or even an enemy that's behind you while you're fighting another one that blocks your entire visual and you just have to spam the roll button and see if you got lucky on dodging the attack or not. And about rolling, just like Dark Souls 2, there are only 2 types of rolls: fast roll and heavy roll (technically there's also a third one where the equipment you're wearing it's just too heavy and you can't roll or run at all). And for some unknown reason the game doesn't allow you to ""Poise"" through attacks. What's Poise? Like the previous two games, if you did have an armor with high defense on you and let's say, an enemy with a dagger comes at you and attacks, you didn't stagger and you could still attack while being attacked, or just do something else, but of course you still did lose a bit of health. In this game you get staggered every single time, if an enemy comes you with the tiniest weapon in the game while you were wearing one of the heaviest armor and that enemy attacks, you still always get staggered, that's really annoying especially in the first areas.There's Hyper-Armor that is like Poise but not the same thing. You have to be in an animation where you're attacking, and there are some weapons/catalysts that have it as a weapon art. Obviously Hyper-Armor doesn't work with all the weapons present in the game.The combat system is the same as the previous Souls games that sometimes is frustrating just to kill something because you get staggered every single time over nothing. From what I've seen the only difference is the parry mechanic that they changed back on how it was like in Dark Souls 1 instead of sticking with Dark Souls 2 parry, the speed of said combat and the new Weapon Art mechanic that uses the FP Bar (Focus Points). The removal of spells usage and the introduction of FP changed the way how you cast spells: Instead of being able to use, say, 30 Soul Arrows has been removed and now you're stuck on having this Focus Points bar that you have to refill just like your health. Basically if you wanted to carry Soul Arrow and Great Soul Arrow together so you can lure enemies out by using the weaker one and lose only 1 usage on THAT spell and then switch to the stronger one which you didn't use yet has been removed.The same Focus Point bar also gets used by another mechanic that has been introduced into the game, Weapon Skills or  (Weapon Arts). If you two hand a weapon and press the ""parry button"" instead of parrying or blocking, you can use it's weapon special attack. Every weapon has a different one and each time you use it, you consume a portion of your FP bar.The bosses are challenging and fun and their soundtrack is fantastic and they go well with their design and game's setting. Some do get annoying because of the game's camera (thoughest enemy in the game) and some could have been far more better if they didn't just stuck on having you do the same thing over and over until you kill it. Not gonna name which ones.One other thing that really annoys me is that the game doesn't reward build diversity and it has a strange tendency on following this rule : If it looks cool it is bad . damn I really wish miracle spells were as good as pyromanciesThe Online aspect is one of the worst things, it has been the same since Dark Souls 1. It has lots of problems, sometimes players just start surfing on the ground and any of the animations don't start, that happens most if they have a bad connection or they're summoning someone. The melee combat is a Roll the Dice game: You can still get hit if you did roll correctly, you have to predict the player's actions and you could still get hit even if you're far away.The backstabs finally have been fixed and now instead of being a cutscene, there's an animation that starts before the actual backstab takes place so you can dodge and doesn't teleport teleport you back... mostly.The game's locked at 60fps since the game's speed is tied to the FPS. And you cannot disable VSYNC. I have a love-hate relationship with this game but overall it is a good and despite it's flaws, it's still enjoyable I really reccomend it.If it is your first time playing it, I would advise against summoning other players that will help you through areas and bosses because then it will lose its charm, and also it will limit the places where you can go until the player you summoned leaves. I also heavily suggest on buying both DLCs (Ashes of Ariandel and Ringed City) that will add new areas, bosses and equipment. Unlike the previous games, getting in one of the two DLCs isn't that hard and I still suggest on playing them without summoning other players. buying them do not fix the game's camera problem and do not bring poise back :-("
Positive,it is like under tale as it is very very hard and you fight skelton!
Positive,to beat the second boss i had to roll behind him and stab him in the asshole because he couldnt reach me there. i caused an anal rupture in him and he diedgood game
Positive,A simple and relaxing gaming to play for the casual gamers due to its simplicity and fun-oriented playstyle. Hardcore gamers that seek pleasure in punishing and difficult gameplay should try the more complex Elder Scrolls series instead.
Positive,"Definetly my favorite Dark Souls game by far. I really love the armorsets and weapon variety and new Miracles and other stuff. Really enjoyed it. Great locations. Cool bosses. Cool everything, really. I love the callbacks and fanservice in this game, too. Lots of fun. Def a buy if you're into action RPGs."

Positive,"very good, anyone who say its bad says so because they arnt good at it"
Positive,"Amazing visuals, fun gameplay, variety of bosses, some challenging in different ways. The music is on point and the npc questlines, although tricky, are engaging. I still prefer dark souls 1."
Positive,"Turned out to be my all time favourite game, even beats a long term love - Skyrim.Just get it,and git gud."

Positive,i actually hate this game

Positive,"In dark souls numero 3 you must play as Dark Soul a man (or womoid) who must do battle with many horrible creatures and monstrosities such as Poles, while grappling with having a Dark...Soul....hee hee ho"
Positive,Better than DS2.11/10 would get invaded again12/11  would recommend to crippled friend
Positive,Level one: killed the boss  Level two: killed the boss without taking damage  Level three: killed the boss with a starter sword  Level four: killed the boss with a bow
Positive,"I have played DS3 for like 15 hours + 60+ hours(diffrent account (offline) if you know what I mean to say :)) It's a good game, buy it if you want but as I have played it online after 6 months of the game's release, I realized that there are not so many players playing DS3 online now so yes there are less players playing online it may take some time for someone to invade you. I would like to thank my friend @Drakerider2341 for giving this game to me as a gift (one more thing I had some problem playing DS3 with my friend online was not able to connect that easily (maybe my network problem it's BSNL)"
Positive,"Quite possibly one of my favorite game franchises due to the fact of its infinite replayability and uniquely intense multiplayerDark souls 3 is mainly my favorite for a vast amount of reasons such as faster mechanics, (like Demon's Souls) great lore and just how great a port it is in comparison to its predecessors. Finally got gudIn conclusion i rate this 9/10Great work From Soft"
Positive,"I'll admit that I was very hesitant to buy because of how much I heard about the difficulty, but honestly once you learn the system and  the enemies movements you will in time ""git gud"" as they say. Plus if you have a friend who owns the game as well its very easy to invite them in to help you through the game, just beware that you'll also be open to invaders. I would highly recommend this game if you're looking for a great and memorable adventure, and even more so if its on sale."
Positive,PvP meta is AIDS but aside from that it's pretty good.
Positive,Dark Souls III
Positive,it has the best controls of the series and when the connection is good the pvp is fun.pizza/10
Positive,best thing ever
Positive,One of the best games ever
Positive,"This game probably has the best bossfights in the entire soulsborne series (Soul of Cinder and Gael are my 2 absolute favourite fights ever). Combine that with the incredible world design and visuals, the brilliant audio design and the amazing story, this game is a contender for best in the series. 10/10 experience. (but don't go for 100% please, killing silver knights for 7 hours is not fun)"
Positive,"Excellent game of the franchise, but it is a joke that they said that the online would be fixed after the launch of Elden Ring. It's been more than 3 months and they still haven't fixed it, it's unbelievable.Update 01/08/2023: The game is back online. I'll give it a 9/10 again, only I don't give it a 10 because they invade me all the time... I can't play quietly with my friend hahaha :'c. The interval time they give once they invade you is very short."
Positive,"You can do many things in this game.You can make a beautiful creature in character creation.You can get squished by a big guy.You can join Covenant (abandons former Covenant).You can fall off a cliff.You can throw poop at people.You can look up guides to do the insanely convoluted quests that you'd probably never be able to figure out on your own, but you need to do them to get items or you'll have to go into ng+.You can leave funny messages like ""Try finger but hole"" and ""don't give up, skeleton!""You can traverse fog doors before invaders can get to you.you can hang out in the Farron Keep swamps and do a little trollin'.But you can never really git gud."

Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is the sequel Dark Souls 1 deserved. Miles above 2 in every way, 3 is the perfect mixture of DS1 and some elements of Bloodborne. You’ll find yourself having constant nostalgia with the call-backs to previous games; be it in weapons and armour sets, or returning characters and areas. And that is just one of the things that makes you want to keep playing this game for hours. The areas and amazingly fleshed out, and not to mention absolutely gorgeous. Animations are very fluid and reminiscent to DS1. Bosses in this game are amazingly well done, requiring more than the standard Roll out of the way > attack > Roll > Attack mentality, and are all accompanied by a brilliant soundtrack, as always. In my opinion it is a lot harder than 1, and I found myself getting beaten into the ground a lot during the first few hours, even with my past experience with the souls games. It took a while to get used to the somewhat clunky-ness of the game, at least for me, my character felt heavy and burdened, but that soon subsides once you get a head for the game. Unfortunately I have experienced heavy FPS drops, especially when entering new areas of the game, though they are somewhat infrequent and by all means do not deter from the overall gameplay, even if somewhat immersion breaking for the briefest of moments.If you’re on the fence about the game, for whatever reason, I assure you it is worth every penny. There is a tonne of replayability, as there has always been with the Soul’s games. So what are you waiting for? Go and engage in some Jolly Co-operation! Or go invade and pillage or whatever."
Positive,uchigatana here i come
Positive,"Still an amazing game until today with epic and skillbased boss fights, but the PC port is poorly executed, they didn't even bother to adapt the UI for the PC controls. Highly recommended nevertheless."

Positive,this game easy
Positive,10/10 way to break your controller
Positive,I got fucked so many times it felt like my uncle came to visit
Positive,"Feels like lost home. Words can't describe.I've never encountered a game more polished than soulsborne games,I just wish that mp feature was simple. PvP and invaders are quite debatable,there's no matchmaking in this game which means for eg : A guy who has played this game for 3k hours or more can easily invade a guy who's played the game for only about 3 hours which obviously is far from fair. Guess there'll never be a plausible explaination for this other than ""GIT GUD"".But the cons in this game are far from noticeable in the end,because if YOU die then it's YOUR mistake,one can't just blame controls in this game,that's how polished game mechanics are (No I'm not talking about backstabs,that's still broken). It would be nice if we ever get official dedicated servers though. Easily one of my most favourite game \ [T] / (Could be also because I'm a huge berserk fan lol)"
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is, without a doubt, the best game ever made. It's not for the faint of heart, but the sense of satisfaction you get from finally ""Git Gud"" is unbeatable. It requires a certain level of determination, perseverance, and maybe even a little bit of grit to truly enjoy. The technical quality of this game is top-notch, with tight hit boxes, precise i-frame timings, and a risk-reward system for parry and reposte that is perfectly balanced. It took me until the Nameless King boss (close to the end of the game) to fully understand the lock on mechanic, but once I got the hang of it, it was a game changer.One of my personal favorite aspects of Dark Souls 3 was the abundance of unique and powerful weapons to choose from. The Dragonslayer Greataxe, in particular, was a joy to wield. It was a beast to swing, but oh so satisfying when I finally took down a tough enemy with it.And let's not forget about those mimic chests. Talk about a cruel trick. Just when you think you've found a nice, safe bonfire to rest at, BAM, you're being attack by a chest with teeth. But the true shining stars of this game are the bonfires. Oh, the sweet, sweet relief of finally seeing a bonfire after a long and grueling battle. It's like a warm hug from your favorite, non-mimic chest.As someone who was learning to use a controller for the first time while playing this game, I can attest to the fact that it was a challenge. But with a little bit of practice and a lot of determination, I was able to overcome it and truly enjoy all that Dark Souls 3 had to offer.In conclusion, Dark Souls 3 is a difficult, but ultimately rewarding game that I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a challenge. It's worth every single death and I give it a solid 10/10, because let's be real, dying just wouldn't be as fun without it."
Positive,havent played all that much but i fought a man in a dumpling suit so ill call that a win
Positive,they brought family sharing back
Positive,Don't give up skeleton
Positive,"If you enjoyed this review,consider giving it a thumbs up!Must BuyFallen Guardians of the land, beasts of an unspeakable nature, and undead abominations await you in Lothric, where the massive adventure that is Dark Souls III takes place. You are one of the unkinded, awakened from your eternal slumber to link the fire and preserve the light from the coming age of darkness through sacrifice and toil, where all others have failed. The task ahead of you: to find the four Lords of Cinder, those who were mighty enough to link the eternal flame, and return them to their towering thrones, through the only way which they can understand: violence. These four lords reside in lairs woven throughout your adventures, in such breathtaking landscapes as massive regal throne room of the Twin Princes, or the chamber of the Abyss Watchers, filled with corpses of the fallen. In Dark Souls III if you see a location off in the background then chances are you’ll be going there at some point during your quest. Not only do the locations get increasingly captivating as the game progresses, the enemies do as well, becoming more and more interesting and challenging as you near the end of your great journey. Exploring Lothric is a joy like no other, but what sets Dark Souls III out as a true gem among other such Role Playing Games is that not only will the world fill you with joy to explore, but in many cases will also fill you with terror.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1185401586In Dark Souls III you can count the amount of beings that don’t want you dead on one hand, ensuring that your quest will not be as easy as you may have thought. Enemies in Dark Souls III can be likened to puzzle pieces, each with their own backstory and every single one of them connected. Dark Souls III not only builds an exemplary game, but an enthralling world behind it just as well, absolutely no easy feat. There is no main storyline you’re following other than the quest to return the four lords of cinder to their thrones, instead Dark Souls opts to give even the most miniscule part of their world a backstory and a place in the universe as a whole. The best way that I can describe this is that Fromsoft seems to have designed every enemy in the game as if they were a boss, not in difficulty, but in the amount of work and story standing behind them. Dark Souls III has also managed a level of environmental design that few others have ever come near, rarely can a game balance the looks of an area, with how that area flows and connects with the rest of the game. Dark Souls III’s areas are filled with nooks and crannies brimming with goodies to be snatched up and put to use, many of which are so secret you won’t notice, or know how to get to them, on your first playthrough. The sheer amount of secret or hidden items and areas that Dark Souls III has is mind-boggling. Sets of armor which you have to do a hidden questline to obtain, zones and bosses that you can easily miss, all of these await throughout the perilous walks of Lothric. There’s this indescribable feeling of both satisfaction and glee you get after noticing a secret alcove or nab that out of reach piece of armor that encourages even further exploration. A critical part of every environment, one often ignored or unnoticed, is how everything in it sounds. Dark Souls III has some exemplary sound effects that enhance both the gameplay and the whole experience both inside and outside of battle. Not only are the sound effects definitely worthy of high praise, the same can be said for the music. In the more sinister areas, the music helps build tension, while in frantic boss battles it helps to keep the adrenaline flowing and ends up as one of the most memorable parts of the fight. There aren’t really a whole lot of games with a soundtrack so good I would pay money to have it, Hotline Miami and Payday 2 being notable examples, however I find myself adding Dark Souls III to that list as well. The soundtrack doesn’t just make the fighting and the ambience better, it adds to the characters, the bosses, in ways that aren’t tangible or really there. This sounds like I’m insane, a charge to which I plead the fifth, but just hearing a bosses soundtrack you’ll feel as if you know them, and in some cases you may even regret putting them down. Music is a part of many games, but in Dark Souls III, in Lothric, it’s not a part of the game, it’s a part of a living, breathing world.Now after all of that talking about the environments, music, and how Dark Souls III feels you may be wondering, isn’t this a game? Shouldn’t there be gameplay? There most definitely is. Dark Souls III has some of the most fluid combat I’ve ever seen in a souls game, making it enjoyable to play, not just enjoyable to walk through. The combat hasn’t changed much from previous souls games, with some notable exceptions, but that absolutely does not mean it’s any easier to master, this is Dark Souls after all. A major change from the other souls games is that in Dark Souls III you now have a mana bar for casting pyromancies, spells, and miracles, forcing you to split your total estus flasks into health flasks and mana flasks. You choose how many estus flasks you want to be mana flasks and how many you want to be health flasks, so you aren’t being forced to either use spells or hold on to useless estus. The biggest change though is the combat: combat in Dark Souls III takes heavy inspiration from Bloodborne and is significantly faster paced any other souls game. Dodging costs less stamina, the enemies are significantly more aggressive, and as a general rule everything seems to move much faster than previous games. This is a welcome change and makes the combat flow a lot better and just generally more fluid, helping to make the game seem more fair. There’s also the PvP to consider, though I won’t talk much about this because that just isn’t my thing, so I didn’t play much of it. Player versus player combat in Dark Souls III from what I can tell is just about the same as it’s always been, however the cooperative experience has been massively improved. They got rid of the dysfunctional soul rating system from Dark Souls II, now you can be summoned just about anywhere and by just about anyone, though you can regulate this by creating a password that your partner needs to match in order to connect. With such options you now have the ability to actually control your co-op experience, rather than using the needlessly complex systems forced upon you in the previous game. That seems to be a big theme with Dark Souls III: controlling everything. You control your co-op experience, you control the battlefield with the new and improved combat, and you control the power to link the flame. All you have to do, is find it.Dark Souls III is a not just a game, but an experience that pulls you in like a mimic and won’t ever let go."

Positive,AYO I CAN PLAY WIT DA GANG :)
Positive,yea i like it
Positive,Guys I am almost finished making my character :D
Positive,Really it's an S&M relationship.
Positive,it's dark souls 3
Positive,"From took out 80% of the pvp elements the other games had and made everything unpunishable as well as cost no stamina.  As long as these things remain true, and no special_tech emerges, nothing makes the PVP worth playing at any deep level. The franchise will die slowly and the players will move on.the princes are cute though"
Positive,"Once again, a new Dark Souls game is more Dark Souls, and I recommend it purely on the basis of that. However, unlike Dark Souls 2, Dark Souls 3 is actually worth playing even if you're not already sick of Dark Souls 1. Sure, it's got some significant mechanical changes, and it continues a few developing trends in the series that I don't like, but it's just a really fun game that manages to recapture a lot of what's great about the first installment, instead of just lazily throwing out the same things that you liked about the first one with infinitely less rhyme or reason, like 2 did.A few tweaks have been made to the usual presentation of the games. There's even more of a fire theme than before this time around, and a lot of stuff has been renamed as a result. This doesn't really affect anything once you get acquainted with all the new names, but it does mean that your character now has an orange glow around the edges of their outfit when they're [Human], which looks really nice in the shiny new graphics. A lot of the enemy designs are also fucked-up and weird again, like in 1, as opposed to the endless parade of knights in various armors that 2 had. Finally, there are plenty of callbacks to the first two games, some good ( a ruined Anor Londo that verges on genuinely affecting ) and some completely forgettable (more giant rats in a sewer area that are weirdly easy to kill). In terms of gameplay, Dark Souls 3 remains pretty loyal to the previous games' core systems—as one would expect—but has a few significant changes. It gives you a lot of stuff right off the bat, like your storage box and the ability to sell things (a godsend). It also gives you teleports immediately, like Dark Souls 2, which I still think cheapens the game's sense of a cohesive world. Besides that and a few other things, though, the game is mainly running on Dark Souls 1's rules as opposed to 2's, which I greatly appreciate. Being [Hollowed] works the same, Estus Flasks are your only healing tool, you can actually get ahold of 100% Physical shields, and overall it just feels so much more like the former than the latter. The main thing that I appreciate it keeping from 2 is the fact that weapon durability resets at bonfires, which is only good because it basically makes that durability a non-issue.The other big thing that Dark Souls 3 keeps from 2 is its hatred of sedentary blocking, unfortunately. If you're a tank, like me, you're gonna have to adjust your playstyle a bit; enemy attacks are fast, frequent, and stamina-annihilating if you choose to block them with even a good shield. I had to adapt by trading out my customary halberd for just my starting sword, which was bizarrely good and felt like a much better match for the game's speed.None of this is to say that Dark Souls 3 is without traits of its own. There's a whole magic bar now, replacing spells with a set number of uses, which I guess is an improvement. There's a neat system of refilling it that makes you choose between magic and health Estus Flasks. Weapons also now have specific skills associated with them when you're dual-wielding that use magic bar; I never really used mine, but it's a neat idea. It does come up in one of the gimmickiest gimmick bosses I've ever seen; if you've played it, you probably know what I'm taking about immediately, but if you don't: grab the item on the throne. The game is also a lot more linear than even Dark Souls 2; I didn't care too much, but part of the magic of the first game was how it had a whole interconnecting world, that looped back and around and into itself and really gave the impression of a 3D space. I will say that the linearity half-justifies the instantly available teleports, as without shortcuts like 1's Valley of the Drakes you have to backtrack across half the game to get anywhere. Finally, the game is really big on OTGs all of a sudden, presumably to make you use its recovery roll more often. I don't like that change at all, since before you realize you can recovery roll stuff enemies just keep getting a bunch of free damage on you.I've done a fair bit of complaining about Dark Souls 3, but it is actually very fun. It's not a masterpiece like Dark Souls 1, but its adherence to that game's best parts make it really engaging and enjoyable most of the time, way more than 2. I wish it was a bit more like the first game in a lot of ways, but its differences don't drag it down too much, and in a few cases make it even better. If you like Dark Souls at all, then—well, then you were probably already going to get this, but know that it is indeed what you're looking for."
Positive,half my playtime is the death screen 2: electric boogaloo
Positive,Didn't know I was a masochist until I started to play this game.
Positive,I can feel this game taking actual years off of my lifespan10/10
Positive,"My experience>Get 36 throwing knives>Low on health so uses them against skelly bro>in the original knives were slow af>in this game you can machine gun them>annihilate skelly bro>his friend poll vaults into me>knocks me off cliff losing 14,000 souls10/10 good game"
Positive,"Overall I’ve enjoyed Dark Souls 3 a lot. The exploration and big dramatic boss fights remind me of something like Zelda Ocarina of Time but if they added the difficulty of Zelda 2 in there. It’s a really cool world to explore with a vast variety of enemies, character builds and weapons to play around with giving the already pretty long game a ton of replayability. Other than the PVP multiplayer, bonfire placement and a few bugs it’s a fine game and a great ending to the Dark Souls series. I’m considering getting back into playing Bloodborne now as well since my attitude towards the Soulsborne games has changed for the better with Dark Souls 3. If you’re looking for a varied, very challenging game then this is the right choice for you.For my full review check out the video here:"
Positive,"It seems that the majority of reviews for this game include 'poor optimization', but I don't really think that's the case. If you're running on a GTX Free Range Egg your frames are going to be bad, that's not the devs fault, that's your fault. Buy any decent card and you wont have a problem. I also have not experienced any crashes, but other people have, so I don't really know what's going on with that.That being said, there are some problems I do have with the game, mainly a couple of bad bosses and strange glitches. - For insance, for a hour I had an issue where summons would only slide everywhere, never play any animations, even when they were an invader.- Summons randomly not being able to walk through fog gates to critical battles.- Two really annoying bosses, in which the entire fight consisted of 'hit these specific weak parts while adds attack'.The game has been out for a month, there shouldn't be problems like these.But, overall, this has to be the best game in the series.+ Massive amount of weapons, each haveing their own pros and cons.+ Loving looking game, really got that 'withered beauty' they were going for+ Interesting NPC quests, which actually give good rewards+ Some incredible bosses which were actually fun to fight+ Fast gameplay, much like bloodborne9/10 - Might change when they fix stuff."
Positive,"Nothing in this game is designed to be fair. It will punish you for failing, not dodging correctly or being to weak to block. If you going to PvP, expect a sharp learning curve and if you plan to invade other people...never pick a fair fight."
Positive,[Edited]Multi-player has returned.  [Original]I purchased four copies for multiplier capabilities of the game that was advertised with online play and online coop.   Multiplayer has been removed.  They are not a defunct company so it raises the question of why steam allows them to de-feature a game after it is sold and sell new titles.
Positive,"Best souls game, better than Elden Ring"
Positive,"This game is like anal,Hard and painful, but you'll get used to it. Highly recommended i've never had so much fun with friends :)"
Positive,it was pretty good
Positive,This game gave me a reason to live
Positive,You died even in your dreams.XD
Positive,I recommend it if you enjoy hard to beat games but if you want a company that cherishes your every opinion on said game then this isn't for you because they shut down the servers for what seemed like 20 years just to raise sales of Elden Ring
Positive,"100% the game, I love it! Even the first DLC. I still get that feeling of greatness when finally defeating something. The only thing I can say, like the other souls games, is PvP is boring. Once and awhile you get something that isn't lagging and isn't just the same items.Other wise it is the same weapons, same gear and fighting the weird hit boxes. I would say PvP is more tedious/the same than fighting the damn NPC mobs in the area."
Positive,"Not only can you use passwords so you can legit play with your friends at all level, PRETTY FAST, but it has some of the best stuff of all of the games. Imagine dark souls 1 with bloodborne inspired level design.  So many waifus, lots of good boss fights, and absolutely great for beginners while still being challenging for veterans. Easily some of the best dlc bosses in the entire series."
Positive,Great game. Best in the Souls series since Dark Souls.
Positive,Can see where Elden ring originated from.
Positive,The only way to find it bad is to compare it to the original Dark Souls.
Positive,"Far from flawless especially pvp wise. But not even close to being bad, amazing experience and worth every single cent of its price and dlcs, Ashes might be on the shorter side but still enjoyable regardless."
Positive,"Let me tell you something. There once was a man called chaggle and he played Bloodbourne. Then he said WOW this reminds me of Dark souls 3 and he shot himself. The end!?Well it is not the end because in HELL he met a guy called Sethasaurus and this ""Young boy"" said that he is the Devil and he dosen't like Chaggles. So Sethasaurus got a machete and was like ""You know what i do not like 3 pears"" and chopped Chaggle's head off.Now this is the end...?"

Positive,"When I (Claymore, strength build) was in Farron Keep, I was invaded by one of Rosarisa's fingers, and I immediately killed them. I felt bad so I looked them up them on steam and found out they were a girl (23F, she's  really  hot ). So now we play Dark Souls III together, so the game's pretty good I guess."
Positive,"One of the best games out there. In my honest opinion this game changed the way I look at games its art style, music, backgrounds, characters, story telling all of these are top notch if you did not play Dark Souls you are missing a lot of quality experience. This game is truly a MASTERPIECE.Praise the sun my friends.And dont let the flame die. Dont let Dark Souls die.Edit: After many years I did notice the irony of my review and the game's message but I left it in just because it points out how much I love this game."
Positive,"As I am writing this review I would like to mention beforehand that I have not played Demon Souls, DS1 nor DS2. Before I bought DS3, I was rather sceptical about it- about wether I would even like it or not, and worrying that it might become a game I would end up disliking completely and never finish it. And in the beginning, I actually came close to that moment. To the moment, where I felt like I wanted to give up. To the moment, where I became tired of fighting the first boss over and over again, only to be stomped into the ground and die. Over and over again. Thankfully, I kept trying. After some practice, enough attempts and luck I was able to beat the first boss. From that point onwards I discovered the Firelink Shrine, the comfortable home-base, and all it's features. I started to like the game more and more. The level-design, the large variety of enemies and bosses, with a lot of them bearing new challenging tactics, movesets and combos,  the architecture, the different environments you get to discover...and so on.As of now, while I am writing this review, I have over 200 hours in this game. I'm on NG+. Short summary:Positive:+Gameplay Tutorial+Design+Epic Fights+Interesting enemies and bosses+Interesting lore and backgrounds to discover+Lots of weapons and armor (and magic)+Higher difficulty than in most RPG's+Co-Op+PvPNegative:-Discovering/Completing all questlines can require more than one playthrough-Questlines and possible outcomes sometimes hard and nearly impossible to foresee-No endless load of quests like you might be used to after playing other RPG's"
Positive,"So, after 49 hours of struggling through the entire game (including DLC), this has been a fucking amazing journey. For those who aren't familliar with DS3 and love the lore, then this review may contain a few spoilers here and there.Graphics are outstanding, not as good as the one's from Elden Ring, but in 2016 it was PEAK graphics design. Still good graphics, very beautiful and the shading is really well.Graphics 10/10Now we're getting to the weapons and all that, the weapons have had a special move since DS2 but this game not only adds new weapons with new specials, but almost EVERY WEAPON has it's own unique SPECIAL skill, say the Uchigatana, you can either go for a lunge attack or a COUNTER ATTACK, or the DUAL WIELDING weapons like Onikiri and Ubadachi (most favorite weapon in the game btw), have this cool epic Jump slash that stuns opponent's who don't have resistant armor and then beats them to the ground, there are other weapons i can also say but that would be a whole day so let's just come to the conclusionWeapon Variety : 10/10Story time, so remember the 4 lords from DS1? SURPISE THERE'S 4 MORE YOU GOTTA BEATappreantly the Lords of Cinders are the following :The abyss watchers, guys who fell to the abyss like their inspiration Artorias and now are locked in combat, killing eachother back to back.Aldrich, a priest that developed a habit of eating men, and then eating gods, and he ate gwyndolin and maybe Nito, idk the bottom part has the same cape effect as Nito had in DS1, which makes me think he also ate Nito, idk just my theory.Yhorm the Giant, a Giant who failed to protect a loved one and lost all hope, he then met the Descendant of Onion boi Siegmeyer, Siegward. Siegward made a promise that if Yhorm becomes insane and doesen't link the fire like he's supposed to, then Siegward should kill em.Prince Lothric, youngest child of Gwynevere and a guy that can't MOVE, he was born with a curse that he can't move and he was told by the scholar that linking fire = bad.You go through graveyard, to Kingdom, to Settlement, to Forest, to Swamp filled with those godamn giant crabs, to another swamp, to a Fortress filled with dead bodies of watchers and skeletons, to Anor Londo again, to a Dungeon that leads to the Capital of Anor Londo, to the Castle of the Kingdom which is heavily guarded, and to the final area in DS1. Quite a journey of areas isn't it?Story : 10/10Now for my favorite part of the review, The boss fights.....Every boss is not easy and won't be beatable unless you have the skill to ADAPT to what they do, Gundyr the tutorial boss is a perfect adversary, letting you know that this game is NOWHERE AS HELL GONNA BE EASY FOR YOU, especially when DS3 is your first soulsborne that you play. Then comes a boss like VORDT OF THE BOREAL VALLEY, who also lets you know that you're in on a PAIN TRAIN. However every Boss also has their own weaknesses, like Vordt, despite his huge size and intimidating look, you can go under him and then he will either A. use a smash attack that you can easily dodge, or B. Jump away.  Some bosses also have their nice SECOND PHASES and maybe even THIRD PHASES, which not only extends the boss fight, but also makes them fun and tension is rising more and more. Never underastimate any of the bosses, because they are made to constantly salt your Soup.Boss fight design : 11/10The Physics in this game have been TREMENDOUSLY UPGRADED, finally no more sliding off some random ledges like in DS1 shortly falling to your death.Physics 10/10The Estus flask animation has also been improved, in DS1 you couldn't move when using it and it lasted like 2 seconds and by the time you were done healing you already took damage, in DS2 you had to level adaptabillity in order for them to work better, now in this game, you can drink that to your heart's content while walking around, so for those who love to drink the hell of that fiery delicious lava drink, this game's for you.Flaw from DS1 and DS2 : IMPROVEDFinal boss talk time.we'll go through the 3 final bosses of the main game and DLC'sAKA soul of cinder, sister friede and Gael.Soul of Cinder is your final main game boss, the Incarnation of all Souls of lords of cinders past. This boss can switch to 4 variants, the Sword, Spear, Mage and Pyromancer. After his 1st phase, he switches to Gwyn's fighting style, and can also use Lightning spears now.Friede starts off with a normal unrestricted duel between you and her, she has a variety of attacks such as a slash going back to make an explosive ice path and a final Smash attack. In the 2nd phase you fight her and her father but no matter who you hurt, the boss bar goes down no matter what. After that phase you'd think it's over but for some stupid Anime Main Character plot bullshit she gets up and get's a 2nd scythe, boss is hard cuz of 3 phases that you have to endure.Finally Slave Knight Gael is possibly the best Boss fight in Dark souls Trilogy, starts off agresively with not so much in his moveset, but phase 2 adds ember to your soul and he has a variety of attacks that will make your jaw drop, and phase 3 has the best Score and it's a desperation phase, the tension rises by every tick of the boss battle.Final boss fight designs : 12/10Now to go for ONE FLAW that the game hasit has the shittiest beginning of any game, like literally at the beginning, the game was kinda slow paced and was kinda bland, and you will have to endure the bland crap until abyss watchers, at abyss watchers the game becomes so fucking good it's like a blessing. that's the only flaw i have with the game, it has a very weak beginning, that you won't feel too passioned to progress through the game, like i said this review is an opinion so i'll be more than happy to hear your's if you have one.Beginning of game : 3/10SummaryIs this game perfect? no but it's CLOSE to perfectionis this game bad? not at allis this game a Magnum opus? Elden ring would most likely be the Magnum opus as of now, but let's think back to 2016, yes, this game can be considered a Magnum Opus of Bandai and Fromsoft, way better than Dark souls 1, despite not having a good beginning for the game that the player can enjoy, while constantly hollowing your humanity IRL, it's still a very great challenge for those who want to tackle the hard games, while not as hard as Elden Ring, it is still, one of the hardest soulsborne's of all time. Dark souls III enchances everything Dark souls I and Dark souls II had and made it to the point of perfection. If there's ever going to be a DARK SOULS IV, which likely is never going to happen lol, i would still be honored to play it.Thank you for your time on reading this review, this was my review on one of the best games i have ever played.Always rememberPRAISE THE SUN"
Positive,PRICE THE SUN!  MULTIPLAYER IS BACK
Positive,We're back in business boys!
Positive,there might be bloodborne enemies in a dark souls game but at least its not sekiro enemies in a dark souls+ game lol
Positive,I'm so happy that I gave it a try!This game is so much easier than Dark Souls 2.I just love this game.
Positive,"I DONT WHERE TO START..this GAME IS AMAZING ,MYAZAKI IS A GENIUS AND DESERVE MORE THAN THIS.I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND I THINK IS DARK SOULS OMG.BUY DARK SOULS.BE HAPPY.amazing bosses,amazing ost,amazing graphics,amazing backstory,amazing designs,amazing difficulty,amazing everything."
Positive,"It's a shame I haven't reviewed this game earlier, because it is one of my all time favorites. I played it through to 100% completion with my boyfriend and loved every minute of it! This game is responsible for some of my happiest memories and for that, the least I can do is give it my seal of approval. But seeing as that probably means very little to the people reading this, I'll list off some pros and cons:PROS:- Huge, expansive and mostly interconnected world that is easily one of the most beautiful From Software have created.- Fantastic, frantic, fast-paced combat that brings some much needed speed and flow to the franchise.- Easily the most balanced difficulty curve out of all three games, with a much more reasonable flow.- Super in-depth character leveling system which allows for virtually any build you can imagine.- Steller boss fights, home to some of the most stand-out in the whole series! I'd name names but I don't want to spoil.- The inclusion of the Weapon Arts and Focus Meter systems spice the gameplay up wonderfully.- While definitely connected to the other two Souls' games, this game still stands on its own perfectly.- Tonnes of replayability thanks to the myriad of hidden secrets, alternate routes, and different playstyles available.- From Software once again craft a beautifully, yet subtly realised world through the use of enviromental and written lore.- The DLC, when viewed as a singular peice, is some of the best From Software have ever made.CONS:- Veterans of the series may find the first few hours ""too easy"" for their tastes thanks to the adjusted difficulty curve.- Weapon and spell variety is somewhat lacking compared to previous Souls' entries.- The faster combat can occasionally devolve into dodge-spamming and estus-chugging fests.- Covenents system, while servicable, feels somewhat vestigial in this game and isn't as deep as previous games.- PvP meta is a little stale at this point, most players run very samey builds with little variety.- The PvP arena system, while appreciated, has very few incentives outside of testing your skill and playing around.- DLC1, Ashes of Ariendel, is slightly anemic when not expirenced alongside the much more fleshed out Ringed City DLC.Hope you enjoyed this review, and I hope you enjoy this game! It's a must-play for anybody who loves the Souls' series or is looking for really cool and well-polished RPG. In fact, if you're new to the Souls' series and are looking for an entry point, I'd probably reccomend you start with this game, as it has, in my opinion, the best new-player expirence of any Souls title. (Don't worry about it being the third game, you can really play them in any order and still get the full story.)10/10, My personal game of the year."
Positive,"Just really good, bonfire crash issue is annoying but easy to overcome and will be fixed. Game is amazing, level design is so satisfying and gives you a real sense of accomplishment when you get to a new bonfire or shortcut. Gameplay is everything dark souls is known for but improved where needed. Can't recommend enough for fans of the series and genre. 10/10"
Positive,"""I can't tell whether it's killing me or making me stronger.""  This is appropriate. But in all seriousness, I love the Souls franchise, and this is another fantastic entry. This is a game worth every penny and I confidently say that having only finished a small portion of the game so far.  Loving it."
Positive,Its better than Elden Ring.
Positive,"i've spent a lot of time and i like this game so far, i might make a new character(all my hours were spent in character creation)"
Positive,It's ok i guess
Positive,"As a Dark Souls veteran, I can safely say that this game is amazing. Truly a great send off to the series. God bless."
Positive,"the only game in my library that made me died so many of timesit's torturing me, but it feels goooooooodam I become masochist? O_o"
Positive,"Gorgeous level design, exiting/fun combat, and proffesional indirect storytelling make Dark Souls 3 the best Dark Souls game in the franchise.The enemy design is full with details,the bosses fulfilled with challange and the player fulfilled with ambition.The red texts on the floor can make the game fun,co-operative and helpful.To understand the story of the franchise you have to play and finish:Dark souls,Dark souls 2 and Dark souls 3 Each item in this game has its own unique description with a little bit of detail about the Dark Souls universeThe most memorable part about Dark souls 3,Dark souls 2 and Dark souls,are the bosses which can make you feel frustrated and happy at the same timeDark Souls 3 it`s not for everyone! It requires ambition,grinding and a lot of concentration while playing the gameDark Souls 3  is a 10/10 game"
Positive,Ok but where's Bloodborne?
Positive,I should have been the one to fill your dark soul with life 😔😔😔✊
Positive,"As promised here is my glowing review now that the servers are back online. Dark souls 3, one of the most heart palpitation inducing amazing time one can ever experience! If you want to know if you should buy the answer is 100% absolutely! If you are a fan of difficult yet fair and rewarding game play this is absolutely the game for you! This game will break you down to your core, and if your will is strong enough, rebuild you into a monster fit to claim the first flame as your own!People often complain that Dark Souls is too hard, yet that has not been my experience. The skills required to be proficient in this game are just different, and when you start seeing the fruits of your labor with your skills increasing is by far the best feeling a video game has ever given me. However, once you master PVE things settle down and you no longer get the same rushes you once got for defeating a boss you were stuck on for 3 hours. This is the fork in the road where you can either start doing challenge runs chasing that high, or you can dive headfirst into PVP.PVP - people are quick to complain PVP is too hard, or unfair. Let a souls pvp veteran tell you of my first days of pvp. I used to panic whenever I got invaded. I cowered behind summons and called my friends to come to my aid at the first sight of PVP. After mastering PVE though there was nothing left to do. PVP in this game is exactly like PVE in the sense you need to get your teeth kicked in a couple of times. Getting your teeth kicked in - not very fun. But killing an invader, or invading and winning a 1vx is the closest you will ever come to to regain the high of your first playthrough. PVP is dynamic, and fluid, Unlike PVE which is challenging, yet also static. Of course this was not possible for the first half of 2022, however with the servers restored I must personally thank Bandi Namco for not abandoning my beloved series.Dear reader, you may also fall into the trap of thinking Dark Souls has no story. The hell is up with all the npcs laughing? Where are the cutscenes after each boss with long monologues of exposition? Nay, you shall not get that here. The story of dark souls is told in item descriptions and scenery. After a few playthroughs you will notice things you haven't seen, like the night of Lothric being Red and Blue, why is this? Or perhaps who is this guy called ""Soul of Cinder"" and why is his music so sad? My advise for this is to play through once, go watch youtube lore videos for 10 hours, and then play again to experience things you missed before."
Positive,it made my friend's wife leave him
Positive,This game is really awesome.It is good and challenging experience and also community is great and almost everyone is always ready to help you with anything.
Positive,it's good. (fromsoftware please port bloodborne to pc i beg of you)
Positive,This game is like someone hits you with bat and you ask him to do it again
Positive,"teh darks 3 is my favorite game, i like rolling a lot and using BIG swords :3"
Positive,Praise the sun \[T]/ and die.
Positive,"Fucking Incredible. Incredible..When I began my tale of walking through the lands I was quickly given the chance to pick my class. I wanted to be a mage. I wanted to be a knight. I went with a knight and as a player with DARK SOULS II experience I delved in the easy way as a knight. Quickly I was found fighting enemies and soon a boss fight? I shat myself. I shat all over my chair and had to throw it away. I beat him like my 3rd time. It was a glorious time. Good game. Pros- Solid mamajamma, beautiful game.Cons- you die alot of times."
Positive,"Did I ever tell you what the definition of insanity is? Insanity is doing the exact... same fucking thing... over and over again expecting... shit to change... That. Is. Crazy. The first time somebody told me that, I dunno, I thought they were bullshitting me, so, I shot him. The thing is... He was right. And then I started seeing, everywhere I looked, everywhere I looked all these fucking pricks, everywhere I looked, doing the exact same fucking thing... over and over and over and over again thinking 'this time is gonna be different' no, no, no please... This time is gonna be different, I'm sorry, I don't like... The way..."
Positive,"Contrary to popular belief, this game is not hard. It simply has a steep learning curve and it takes a while to get used to the recipe. When you get a hang of things, it's a great game with respect to combat. There are so many ways to fight in this game, and you have the option of finding your personal style of combat (within limits, naturally). The role-playing capabilities, on the other hand, are mediocre as what you choose to do does not really impact the world within the game to a large extent. Without spoiling too much, the ending leaves much for you to interprete.The community is largely helpful and ready to assist you if you ever need help with something. Whether you need help fighting something within the game or need tips on how to progress in some questline, you're bound to find answers on the forums. You'll rarely be told to ""git gud"" unless you 'deserve it' (I'll leave that up to interpretation). Don't be afraid to reach out, and praise the sun!"
Positive,"10/10, Dark Souls will forever be my favorite franchise. Thanks for the amazing gameplay, game design, music, lore, bossfights, thanks for all the fun this game provided to me, and more importantly, thanks for the life lessons, Myazaki. I'll be sure my kids play this game when they're old enough.Unfortunately I can't click the ""yes"" button multiple times. I blame Gaben."
Positive,try fingerbut hole
Positive,Best fromsoftware game in my opinion.
Positive,"Should any new players find DS3 to be too hard, try Dark Souls II Scholar of First Sin. Seriously, the game seems so much easier after I gave up on DS2.  I figure it would take a long long time before I can again gather some courage to face the Gutter and Black Gulch..."
Positive,"Starting with v1.03.1 from April 18th the game isn't crashing anymore. I'll play and update the review when I'm done. I'm switching to a neutral stance for now.Old review:As of today April 15th, v1.03, the game crashes when nearing a bonfire regardless of graphic settings used (fullscreen/windowed, low lighting/shadows/shaders); location (Firelink, High Wall of Lothric); and activity (idling, rolling, walking, fighting):Unhandled exception at 0x0000000142093C49 in DarkSoulsIII.exe: 0xC0000005: Access violation reading location 0x0000000000000000."

Positive,"So you're thinking about buying this game, huh? Well, let me put this simply: Go the whole 9 yards. Get it, and the DLC too.This section is for those new to the series. If you've played a Souls game before, you should skip past this (unless you want some juicy insight). The Dark Souls series is based around action rpgs that take place in medieval fantasy lands, which have you embark on a quest for a mantle of extreme power and influence, which requires you to first become an immensely powerful being. You become more powerful both by leveling up your weapons via various forms of the upgrade material known as Titanite (and Dragon Scales!), and your character by leveling up via Souls, which is a currency that is used for just about everything. You will gain souls by either killing various enemies and/or using/bartering items you find along your journey. However, you will not automatically level up wherever you are; you will need to head back to a 'home base' of sorts, and speak to a lady who ""tends"" to it (unless you're playing Dark Souls 1, in which case it's at any bonfire). However, the catch is that if you drop your souls basically wherever you died (if you fell off of a cliff, it'll still be retrievable at the cliff); and if you are either human or 'embered' (which in this game it's the latter), you will lose this status as well, and need to use another item to gain this status once again. When you die, you will be returned to a checkpoint of sorts, known as a Bonfire. You light bonfires and rest at them in order to regain healing potions (of which you have a limited amount, that can both have the amount of HP healed increased via bringing a specific item to a certain kind of person/bonfire, or the amount of uses increased via either kindling bonfires for Dark Souls 1, or retrieving estus shards and bringing them to someone who can make use of them- such as Blacksmith Andre in Dark Souls 3) known as Estus (and also in Dark Souls 3, Ashen Estus), as well as replenish your current HP. Bonfires are immensely useful, as they not only serve as places of a brief respite, but also provide a place to fast travel to (save for Dark Souls 1, where you must get through half of the game to access this, and it only works on certain bonfires). They normally can't be rested at if enemies are too close, but also when other players are alive in your world, and/or when you are going into someone else's world. The aforementioned human/embered status allows for you to engage in about half of the online play (being able to be invaded, as well as and summon other friendly players), saving the rest for various items you will be able to procure throughout your journey- some being easier to obtain than others. While PvE (player vs. enemy) is nice in the series, PvP (player vs. player) is a high point for it. Try not to shy away from it much, because it's usually quite fun if you can manage to have a fair (or generally interesting) fight.This iteration of the Souls franchise is less like Dark Souls as we're used to, and more like Bloodborne; as you'll barely ever rely on a shield (unless you wish to die), and there's barely any only some semblance of poise. Though, to be fair, this is closer to what the head developer (Miyazaki) had in mind when he originally created the series (apparently).Even though Dark Souls 3 leaves all of us Souls vets vying for a simpler time, it has an undeniably addictive nature. For every time you might be discouraged, and/or wishing to quit, you will come to realize that both Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3 fill a niche of gaming that apparently can't be filled with other games. The fluidity of its combat is far greater than its predecessors, and although it may leave a bit to be desired (I still want ye olde poise!), it makes me realize that it creates an itch that I just can't seem to scratch no matter how hard I try to by playing other games. It's quite fair (for the most part), and an overall enjoyable experience- even if you're not having your hand held through the game. The PvE is, of course, somewhat repetitive if you've beaten the game before at least once or twice; but the PvP- that's where a lot of the excitement is. You just can't compare fighting AI to fighting against other players. As I mentioned before, it can be quite fair; however, be warned: minmaxing and twinking (getting the most bang for your buck out of a lower leveled character, and getting better gear from a better character to a worse one, respectively) are two aspects of the game that will heavily influence a majority of your time engaging in PvP. Some builds are far more powerful and effective against others, so be mindful of your playstyle and what kind of weapons/spells/miracles you use.I can only end this by saying I wish that there was more to it. Not more to learn, but content to play with. Not to say that this lacks replayability, or will age poorly- I have roughly 400 hours of playtime at the time of writing this, and I still feel like picking up my controller and playing it. It's immensely entertaining, and will no doubt be enjoyed for years to come. I only wish that there was more to do, or that the community could pick up where From Software left off, and create our own content to play- but it would be impossible to do so, with how the game is regulated. Though this may be the end of the Dark Souls series, Souls-Like games (such as Bloodborne) will hopefully be able to fill the Dark Souls-sized hole in my heart. I just hope that hole isn't a Dark Sigil."

Positive,"Dark Souls III as an entry in Soulsborne series, considering all of their past entries, I would conclude that this game showed (in my honest opinion) an amazing (best) visiual (outstanding bloodborne engine) and technical (optimized, 60fps) performance in the series. Atmosphere of the game still holds up very well, but not as fresh and having moments of repetition (considering the lore of Dark Souls it's somewhat understendable). Gameplay wise it feels faster, more dynamic. Variety of builds in this game is wide and complex, bosses are one of the best (Nameless King, Sister Friede and etc.) and some are quite poor (just a few). Glad to see this amazing conclusion to Dark Souls universe, a classic and shall we remember it with fond (sometimes harsh) memories.P.S. Thank You From Software for this amazing game and franchise. Let the sun shine upon those developers!"
Positive,"enjoyable for the first few playthroughs, not very replayable!some spoilers aheadpros and conspros - some fun bosses (NOTE THE WORD SOME) - none of the weapons feel useless - weapon arts are cool - rolling is solid - until ng+ there's a steady difficulty curve with only a few hiccupscons - some really shit bosses - weapon arts aren't as viable and spamming r2 - ng+ is a huge letdown besides the rings - level design is poor in certain areas but excellent in others, inconsistent.dragonslayer armor, the dancer, aldrich, even lorian and lothric, are all fun bosses that i enjoy. the problems are with some big letdowns in certain bosses, such as treebro and skeletor. those bosses just aren't enjoyable due to difficulty problems. tree is way too hard of an optional boss to include that early on, players have just only beaten the first 2 bosses, which are pretty much cakewalks to any experienced player. but the tree has some very unpredictable attacks and hits VERY hard for an early boss. the inverse is true of king skeleton, this dumbo has nothing that can kill you besides his BS smoke attack. he's pretty much the game's ""halfway"" point, so having such an easy boss for halfway through the game is a big dissapointment.level design is another flaw. some parts of certain areas just feel empty, while some feel very busy. many are strung together by bonfires, which on paper sounds alright, follow the path and find a bonfire - alright good. the problem is that some are way too close together and others are miles apart, leaving a long, long walk from bonfire to bonfire. this could be fixed very easily, but isn't. some areas are empty, too many times I've fought out of my way because ""there's gotta be something over there"" and there just wasn't. players should be rewarded for exploration, and while certain areas do, many areas don't.there also isn't as much freedom and I would have liked. many great rings and items are locked away until almost the end of the game, when players won't even get to use them. this is not fun and leads to many runs being same-old same-old builds.the game does feel rewarding, though. when the game does decide to reward the player for exploring or defeating a boss is does so generously, and gives powerful rings, spells, or even a plethora of souls. it keeps you interested enough to play to the end of the game.if the issues listed don't seem as though they will bother you, i'd give it a try on sale. i don't think it's worth full asking price."

Another annoying thing, for me, is that you can't get all the items without going in new game+.The weapon balance is a bit off. There are a lot of cool looking weapons with badass movesets, but not that great. One of the most OP weapon in the game is actually a starter weapon for the mercenary class.The camera in this game is pretty awful and you have the same button for running and rolling(you can't change this), so when you roll there is a little, almost unnoticeable delay, but can get you killed sometimes.The game has an action queue system. That means that almost every time you press an action button it waits its turn in the queue and you can't cancel the action if, for example, you want to roll in a middle of an attack sequence. This gets annoying if you make mistakes because if you attack a few times and then you suddenly want to roll, in order to avoid something, you are stuck in that attack sequence and the roll(or rolls) will happen after that sequence, even if you pressed the roll button a few seconds earlier. You have to think your attacks carefully and don't button mash if you don't want to die. On the good side, this game has one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a video game and some really beautiful landscapes. The maps are really distinct from one another with a good diversity of mobs and places to explore.If you don't care about being OP all the time, there is a big diversity in what builds you can have so it doesn't get boring so easily, even if you start the game over a few times. The game gives you a sense of accomplishment when you finally beat a boss that you were struggling with, but most of them, depending on your build, go down in just a few tries.Looking from every angle, the game is somewhat overrated, but certainly worth a play.▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃"

Positive,"Let it be said: I hate this game. I don't hate it like most games I hate though. I hate this game because it feels so good to play, even though every other second of the experience is pain. I think Dark Souls made me a masochist? 10/10, I will continue to endorse this game until the end of time."
Positive,"Such a great game, Loved it. For myself its everything i like and wanted in a game, to start with as anyone should know Dark Souls is a hard game and this one is really difficult. Yes there are some easy bosses but me having not played this franchise before i got killed by most things even some of the weaker enemies but i kept playing and got better each attempt , i do love a challenge in Video Games. I also thought the Story was fantastic even though there isnt as many cutscenes in this game only before a boss, after and in certain points of the game, which for me is really good because it rewards you in a way for getting pass a certain boss that you have been stuck on for a while or a particular area. I'm so excited for the DLC to be released and what the next Dark Souls game will entail. Hard game but when you finally beat that boss thats been causing you trouble with so little health left you feel so good and get more excited for the next boss you will encounter in this remarkable, Action role-playing game."

Positive,Aged like fine wine! strongly recommended!
Positive,I waited to post this review until after I killed the last boss but was excited to post it way before. After having just beat the final boss about 30 mins ago I can say that this game isn't as hard as people say it is. The game challenges you for sure but it's not insanely hard to beat. I would recommend getting some friends to play this with too it enhances the fun in this game.
Positive,"One of the best game I ever played. You should done at least DS1 to fully enjoy DS3.For me it 's not so difficult as DS2, way more like DS1. A good balance of each qualities of those two.Fights are impressive and the difficulty is definitly here without being absurd, only punitive as intended.DLCs are really worth it. Outstanding lore and difficulty.I can only make two complains: - usual laggy multiplayer- NG+ are fairly easy, more than the first run. Except for the DLCs."
Positive,"Easily my GOTY for 2016, a masterclass in hardcore action-rpg. The graphic engine update really helped this game along, many many veterans of the series say this is too casual and not as good as the others but I disagree, it's different but still challenging.Dark souls 3 uses an upgraded combat system/engine from bloodborne, it's faster, more aggressive and more engaging. It doesn't have any of the ridiculous difficult crap from the first game but is still very challenging. There's an enourmous selection of weapons and spells on offer to help you trek through lothric and take down your foes. I adore the gothic castles and locations in the game. Melee, magic, ranged, so many ways to play through this game. The DLC is also fantastic and adds lots to the story. I hope some day we see more Dark Souls games, I feel I need it in my life :)"

Positive,"The difficulty level and style of gameplay of the Dark Souls series I feel has now become legendary, often leading to other games being referred to as souls-like; moreover, creating something of a sub-genre of its own.To start off, I would highly recommend this game to anyone who wants deep character customization, and replayability. Think back to your days in the early final fantasy games, you spend 100+ hours developing your character only to get to the end of the game with nothing left to do, and only one area that maybe presents a moderate challange. With features like new game +, and an entire world of people to co-op or battle with, you have a game that will always offer you something to do with that character you spent all that time creating. To add to its challenging and enjoyable combat style, you have the ability to mix and match an entire armoury of weapons, shields, and magic that allows for the creation of nearly any kind of character theme that a person could conjure up.While all three games offer you a lot of options for character creation, each I feel provides greater focus on certain gameplay styles. The first being an unrefined game that for me offered the most interesting world, and the second which offered the smoothest gameplay and various combat enhancements, while the third enhances combat in a number of ways that if I'm not mistaken are unique to only this installment of the series.-Weapon Arts were options for most weapons that enhanced the ability of ranged weaponry, two-handed, and weapon & shield style combat. They provided additional abilities that are unique to certain weapon types: such as a quick-shot or triple-shot with a bow, to the famous samurai iaido slash, or special parry animations, to charging attacks and fencing combos.-Paired Weapons are the replacement for the power-stancing option of Dark Souls II; however, it limits you to only those individual weapons, unlike the power-stance option which could combine your own selection of weaponry. Although one advantage of this is that the paired weapons recieve buffs on both of their pieces as they are considered a single weapon.-A belt bar was added to your (pause-type menu) which gave you five more items that were easy to get to quick.-The ability to quickly revert back to the first item on your ten slots of items made it nice for finding your extus flask instead of going through the entire list of items you had equipped.-Password Connection Option allowed you to connect with anyone, regardless of level.So all in all they did add some neat features to this game; however, the smoothness of Dark Souls II was lost on this installment, combat feels more clunky and less flowing. The loss of power-stancing makes duel-wielding only a good option if a paired weapon is used. So as I mentioned above about each game providing more benifits to different styles, I feel that this game provided a much better gameplay experience for the following styles:-Ranged Weaponry-Two-Handed-Weapon & Shield-Specialist Spellcaster"
Positive,Greatest game of all time!
Positive,died on a dog once then called game trash and cried for 2 hours-host with 4 phantoms10/10 fucked vordts ass again
Positive,"Mechanically, it's everything I want from a Souls game. The combat is fast and satisfying, the weapon arts feel amazing. Unfortunately, a side effect of the speed is that magic and heavy weapons are near useless. Not to mention it runs fairly poorly. Trying to co-op can be a real nightmare, but that might be early release server issues. Hopefully, most of these things can be fixed in patches. It's a bit of a toss up whether your system will handle it at the moment. All these things considered, I do enjoy the game, and I do recommend it if you want a Souls game. I will update this if the glaring issues are fixed."
Positive,"So i guess I can say I've finally finished a Dark Souls game! Now granted I do have a little bit of experience seeing as I've completed Bloodborne, but tbh I found this to be a bit more of a challenge. The main reason I went on this journey through DS3 was because I can't play Elden Ring atm and figured ohh next best thing haha and I'm so glad that I did. This is easily one of the best rpgs I've played in years!Now I've attempted to play this game in the past on ps4 as well as Darksouls 1, but I could never get to far without becoming either bored from the weighty and slower feel of the combat compared to BB or just general frustration. This time though I decided to switch up my usual class builds in these kind of games and went for a pyro/melee hybrid and MY GOD WAS THAT FUN. Never really knew how fun the magic systems were in these games, because i usually just ignored them lol. Overall this is a really fun game that allows for a lot of build variety, and I can honestly see myself coming back to it for a very long time. Heck I'm already 6 bosses into newgame+ and doing all the side quests I missed the first time around!If you're a new player who is concerned about the difficulty let me just reassure you that while yes these games are pretty hard, they are in no way as impossible as some make them out to be. Having trouble in an area or with a boss? Go grind some souls and level up like any other rpg. You can be super over leveled if you want and also there are summons that sometimes can be a big help! I tried not to use any summons, but admittedly the demon prince was just too hard for me as a pyro. Ohh and my god is the DLC great here, very challenging but also they have the most interactive story bits in the game imo.  I can now say I'm no longer a Dark Souls virgin haha. I don't really fully know what the story was about, I mean I have somewhat of an idea but it's definitely a game where having some prior souls knowledge will help you follow along otherwise just youtube it like I did. Just like BB the environments are breathtaking at times, everything looks like a sorta water colored painting. From software might just be the best at level design in the business too. All the bosses and their surrounding areas felt top notch, I really love how the levels interconnect with one another once you find secret passage ways, doors, etc. overall great game 9/10 not quite on the same level as Bloodborne imo but pretty damn close! Now I'm gonna try Darksouls Remastered as a pyro!"
Positive,"TL DR: Dark Souls III is... good. Nothing amazing like the first game, and in my view it's better than the second, but it ends up being unremarkable. Its bosses are really good, but the combat often devolves into who can spam light attack faster to stagger the other one to death. I'd wait for a heavier sale for DLC, since the areas are pretty weak. ★★★★☆Dark Souls III is the closing chapter of the series, and it shows thematically. The age of fire and gods is fading, and the game's world is an amalgama of completely different places. The player is unkindled ash, chosen to destroy the three Lords of Cinder and linking the fire to restart this age. The world does feel like it's ending and its fire fading: pretty much all locations in the game are very bleak and lack some colour (something I'm not completely a fan of), and there's a huge eclipse towards the end of the game to drive this ""end of the world"" point home. There's locations which would be far away in DS1, now very much close to each other (part of these being more decayed DS1 areas, and one from DS2 in the DLC.) Some locations also feel very much from PS4 exclusive Bloodborne, a From title released a year before this one. Hm.The Bloodborne influence shows in combat, where it's a lot faster here than previous DS games, and there's no poise to not make you stagger like a bitch in heavy armour except when you're attacking with huge weapons. I felt I'd be completely wrecked if I was playing the game with a slower weapon, as after switching my slow Uchigatana for a pair of Twinblades the game started to feel a lot easier, since I could now stagger everything to death just by having faster attack animations. I had some pyromancies but I ended up mostly using the Carthus Flame Sword to buff my weapon, and fire orbs for support. I'm not sure how balanced this game is on PvE at least. Not very well, I think.I enjoyed exploring DS3's areas, though. Most are fairly large and fairly open, though a bit linear. The whole game itself, however is a disappointment: You only have 2 instances where you can pick an area or another in the whole game, a far cry from DS1's nonlinearity. There's a bit of bullshit enemy spam like DS2, ESPECIALLY the DLCs where I just gave up and ran through a lot of content because it was ridiculous. Having replayed DS1 this summer along with first playthroughs of 2 and 3, I'd say the first game still feels way more fair in this regard. There's fast travel between bonfires but they've toned down the bonfire frequency from DS2 slightly. We're back to having some shortcuts back to bonfires in some areas, which is really great.Bosses are easily the most fun part of the game, maybe provided you play the game with melee and preferrably not too slow weaponry, and with rolling and not blocking with a shield. Even though more than half the bosses in the game are fast-moving humanoids I didn't really get sick of that. It lacked variety in that regard, sure, but these fights all felt challenging. However, some bosses had way too much damage, or ridiculous 5-hit combos that if you don't dodge at first mean certain death. The fair bosses, however, are some of the best the series has to offer.Speaking of the DLC specifically, Ashes of Ariandel is ridiculously short, so not very worth outside a heavy sale. Both DLCs have visually amazing areas, but are a bit too heavy on enemy spam bullshit for me. The bosses here, however are some of the best, and The Ringed City's final boss is a perfect final boss to the entire series.Overall I had fun with DS3, but I never felt it was something truly great. It might just be that I played the first game first and nothing will ever feel the same, but maybe it's just that From didn't live up to it in the sequels. I don't know, but I really ended up enjoying all three games, and I'd recommend all of them. If you're new to Dark Souls, start with the first game and prepare to die!"
Positive,I cry a lot so it has to be good.
Positive,The best book i ever played.
Positive,Huh. it's a good game
Positive,"(Note: This is more of a comparison than review)I was extremely skeptical at first being a die hard fan of Demon's and the original Dark Souls. I even went as far as to return the game before hitting the 2hr mark since I found the control mechanic way too forgiving. I've come to expect a certain take on realism from souls games & my character hopping around like buggs bunny running away from elmer fudd w/ no end in site to my stam bar really put me off. Fortunately a work buddy threw up the cash so I could repurchase it because he wanted me to ""come around"". Well, I did, but not fully & no where near the experience I had with part one but if I'm comparing Dark Souls 3 on the same scale as every other rpg out their it comes in, easily, top 5 BUT...I never needed or wanted to compare the souls univers on the same scale as other rpg's because the draw for me was that it was in a class all it's own. This is, unfortunatly, not the case anymore but as it's still a completely brilliant game (just not another work of art) I can still recomend it without a second thought.Should you buy this game? YES!Should you expect the same level of vision as previous Miyazaki titles? definately not!If you've never played a souls game before then do yourself a favor and pick up the original Dark Souls.

Positive,hmmmmmm hmmmmmm..hmmmmmmmmmmm...hmm..oh you've wasted some time i see
Positive,"...So... 'ugh, ahh... I'm... I'm kinda carrying in grief (more on that later) inside of my belly one heck of a story revolving around the Souls franchise –   – and in particular, If I may,  this third and last installment, so I'm probably gonna be a... ahh... a little emotional and irrational on some of my thoughts – please bare with me 'til the end (Onegaishimasu) – just wanna put that in your head. So I've started my Dark Souls journey about three and a half years ago, but frankly I've known the series for years now, maybe even since the jovial-ing days of Demon's Souls which whooshed above my head for some really weird and not necessarily related reasons; the time for me to finally see what it's all about came around when the second game in the realm of Dark Souls launched – I've played it, hated its guts, and wanted to smash every inanimate object that layed innocently at my desk out of sheer frustration, despair, and pain. ""Why these mechanics aren't handed down to me like every other action RPG I've played in the past?"", I mumbled angrily. ""Why should I run again all way back to the boss from the bonfire? what's going on with this really weird checkpoint system?"", I wondered as I got stomped again and again by mobs while screeching and crushing my ALT-F4 combo buttons to death. After a few hours of wonder and constant death, I've decided to let my grasp loose, and finally set myself free from this awkward misery. I was ready to give up on this eternal experience for the sake of... nothing, really – boy, was I wrong. My salvation came a few years later; Discord launched, I've gathered myself around many new people I've never met before, some of them are... let's call them the worshipers of the ״Git Gud״ gods, and after a few talk sessions with these guys, some really good soundtracks that came straight from boss fights, and my shining desire to prove that I 'Gut Gud', I walked through Dark Souls 1 for the first time after years of aversion and hesitation; that was love in a first sight. Really, the saying ""catching a lightning in a bottle"" couldn't have phrased itself better than here – things that couldn't have worked in other games in such fashion, the minimalistic story and the Tolkien-like vibes of the lore, the genius level design that spider-web its way from location to location, the terrifying yet beautiful land of Lordran (it really seems that From Software’s concept artists and level designers have been motivated [from personal enthusiasm, corporate pressure, or both] to multiply the volume of detail by a huge degree from their collaboration with Japan Studio on Demon's Souls), the simple, yet unforgiving combat system – it's all been crafted here to perfection against of all odds. Really, a true lightning in a bottle. Dark lightning in a bottle. ...and that was, pretty much, the moment I was born as a long-standing fan of the franchise. The burning, forbidden relationship between us didn't stop there, as I got back to Demon's Souls, beat it thrice (and got to see where a lot of great designing points of Dark Souls 1 came from, like an early sketch for a dream project), got to Dark Souls 2, loved it, thought it was great despite a lot of the hate and confusion around it (now I think of it as a mash of Monster Hunter and Dark Souls [although it took me about two playthroughs to think that way]), then I swarmed into Bloodborne, which is, by the way, one of my personal GOAT's as of now, and then... at last, the time for Dark Souls 3 finally came. Uhh... the disappointment was immeasurable. Coming from Bloodborne and his great foothold, the leap-up from previous installments, or possibly the entire evolution of the franchise, didn't feel... you know, as vividly, or shall I say, noticeably, as I thought it would be. The faster-paced battles felt more intriguing and faster in Bloodborne, the level design felt lacking compared to Dark Souls 1, which the game heavily relies on unlike Dark Souls 2, and a lot of great mechanics from that game, strangely, didn't come aboard (like Bonfire Ascetics, the stances, and the faster growth in levels compared to the second game – which led to the option to test and create many different builds on the same save) – even the visual refinement didn't impress me all that much, as I've finished Bloodborne before, and his strikingly beautiful hand-crafted world drew all of my enthusiasm, and nothing was left for Dark Souls 3 in my caliber. It almost feels like I was, subconsciously, trying to compare the two all the time without really giving the game a fair chance, and in a fierce battle among bloody gladiators, only one wins – and the winner for me was Bloodborne. ...T-Then, then came all of the technical problems which relentlessly swallowed my interest in the game even further. Since I've suffered before from corrupted saves in Dark Souls 2 multiple times, which led me to backup my saves from that point forward without relying on Steam or From and their Cloud-Save system, I did the same for Dark Souls 3 – opened a new character, played it, backed it up, then came back to play it some more, etc. After a week of maintaining this routine, I got banned. It seems like From Software isn't very fond of independency, and so, I ""moved"" to the cheaters server, and I had to live with this shameful decree quietly, because the support didn't really care for my problem all that much. And from that point forward, I'm telling ya, it was like living inside of a wasp nest; cheaters invaded my world nonstop, messed with my characters with their mods or whatever – and got all of four of them corrupted in the process. So I literally had to play the first 9 hours~ or so five times in repeat in order to finish the bloody game, needless to say, with the most boring and uninspiring quick builds I could make, so even that got taken away from me. I always believed that my relationship with the franchise was outright abusive, but my experience with Dark Souls 3 was nothing short of FULL BLOWN STOCKHOLM. I finished it (really liked the Gael DLC actually, thought it was brilliant), but never bothered to come back for it again. I always wanted to give it another chance, like I did with Dark Souls 2 in the past, maybe to like it more in the process, and by that to bid farewell to this beauteous adventure, but I just couldn't bring myself to do so – the experience was that harsh and frustrating for me. It wasn't until very recently, which I got mailed from From Software on a support ticket from years ago (lel), which then I got informed that my ban was unjustified and it was lifted; and here we are today. So at the end of the day, I think it's a good game, I really am; It brings a final closure (I even dare to say – ""a final FANSERVICE"") to the franchise and ends it powerfully and immersively, it's just that my experience with it was so shockingly terrible that I had to take my step-back from it for a while. Maybe this time I'll learn to like it more, I'm currently playing it for the first time from my 'OG' account, and-  wait, what is this strange feeling?... A-I ... Do I finally enjoy playing this game? THE DAMNED DARKSIGN DOESN'T CORRUPT MY BODY AND SOUL ANYMORE!? I don't really know, but it's heck more than I had before, and I think that's a good thing. Probably."
Positive,"Amazing game. Thought I'd hate it because of how infamous the souls series is for punishing players and I expected rage inducing moments one after the other. I brought a friend with me because I much prefer co-op, and while co-op in this game is a little uncanny (The friend you wish to summon has to put his ""sign"" down in the same area as you) in contrast to stereotypical multiplayer games, it has birthed some of the most fun moments I've had in most of my gaming life.It becomes clear to the player early on as to why the souls series birthed an entire genre. The level, atmosphere and game-play design is simply amazing. To iterate this, I'll give an example. [Mild game play spoiler, no story spoilers. Talking about some game design. Skip paragraph if you wish to avoid this.] There is an area early on in the game where, as you come upon it, you are able to hear loud thumping footsteps as you approach a veranda. Below you, you see dozens and dozens of fallen knights, and a GIGANTIC knight holding a halberd circling a fountain. After you exhaust all your other paths in hope of finding an alternative, you realize you have to go past this area. The way the level design strikes dread into the player as you have to drop into this area taking some damage and feeling very vulnerable, as you are distracted by an item nearby, you grab it quickly before what you thought was a corpse strikes out at you. At this point, in my playthrough, I panicked a little bit and dodged backwards. Before I realized it, the thumping footsteps stopped and turned. It increased its pace and I knew it was barreling towards me. Slam! It's heavy halberd smashed into the ground as I narrowly dodge it, my jaw clenching immediately as I attempt to run away by all means possible. It doesn't even occur to me to attempt and fight such a gigantic monster. That, is how much of a rollercoaster Dark Souls 3 can be. Look at the level design I just described. Firstly, the player is taught to anticipate a strong foe with the use of sound and imagery. A large foe holding a huge halberd would intimidate anyone. The imagery of many fallen knights suggests this one knight fell them all. Then, requiring the player to drop down means that there is no easy way to escape. The player has to trudge forward. Lastly, the placement of an enemy next to an item which would likely spook a player, causing them to run into the large enemy is simply brilliant to me. On to a bullet-point breakdown:The good:+ Great combat. Game-play is solid and birthed a genre for a reason. + Adjustable difficulty. Not with an ""Easy/Medium/Hard"" menu, mind you. It's up to the player to decide the difficulty. Too hard? Call some friends in, use guides, farm more levels. + The game respects you. In turn, you must respect it. It doesn't hold your hand at all besides some basic controls. How you wish to approach the game is up to you. Dislike melee combat? You could always turn to a bow or magic. Don't think you can effectively fight anymore? You can always kite your opponents or simply run past them. + Amazing level design. Glad they added a teleport between checkpoints feature which was lacking in the first game(I only played DS1 and DS3), although the level design doesn't shine through as much, some levels still have it good. + Music is great.+ Voice acting feels very fitting to me. + Lore. Subjective, but I quite enjoy the lore. It has a huge air of mystery around it and the speculation is what makes it so fun. The atmosphere by extension is greatly fitting and enjoyable because of this. I typically dislike gloomy settings but DS3 makes it fine. OK:= PVP. I don't mean invasions, I mean PVP in general. It has it's fun moments but can be tedious at times. Especially invasions. Players who invade are either kinda new or veterans in my experience. I either dumpster them or get completely destroyed. I tried invading a few times but they quickly devolved into 3v1 or 4v2 nonsensical gank squads so far. So, some will like it, some won't. = Invasions as co-op players. Yea, I know, you are co-oping the game already, why complain? I guess some people would just like to co-op the game in peace and not get invaded. Wish there was an option to not be embered but still co-op with a friend. Sometimes I am just not in the mood to fight players and would rather just PvE with a friend, but am forced to do so. Just another facet of Dark Souls, I guess. Forces you to get good!= Co-op can be a bit of a hassle to figure out if you're completely new to the series. The game clearly was designed to be more of a single player option as some (if not most) enemies are trivialized with co-op play, but it still does depend on player skill. The bad:- THE MAIN BAD: HACKERS. Please protect yourself before you play this game. Get a mod like pvp watchdog or other things which vet players before allowing them to connect.- Some latency. As with all online games, things can get preeeeeetty weird when people are lagging out. When you get invaded by a lagger, you'll know what I mean. It's a minor flaw though I think. - Some enemy designs can be quite unintuitive or outright unfun to play against. Such as the  Prison wardens in the dungeons and Flail-axe dragons in the archdragon peak. Verdict: Absolutely YES. Love it. Give it a try. Deluxe edition for maximum value, refund it under 2 hours if you dislike it. It really isn't as rage inducing as you expect it to be, be patient and don't approach it as you would other games (especially Monster Hunter World, it gave me some bad habits). Still bad? Try it with a buddy. Makes it much more fun."
Positive,"Easily one of the best games ever made, and a worthy successor to the first Dark Souls game. Some of the most exhilarating boss fights of the series. The level design isn't up to par with Dark Souls in my opinion, but still really well done, especially compared to DS2. Some of the earlier areas like High Wall of Lothric and Undead settlement are somewhat lackluster compared to some of the later areas in the game that are absolutely amazing (Irithyll of the Boreal Valley comes to mind). The lore is also as deep and rich as the first game, which is another thing DS2 lacked. Thanks FromSoftware, for another masterpiece."

Positive,"My first Souls game. I was quite hesitant purchasing this as at the time I only played a little bit of Dark Souls, and to be honest, I didn't really enjoy it. So I thought I'd probably drop this game after a couple of hours. But my God, this game blew me away. Easily now one of my favourite games of all time. The challenges in the game are hard, but they're fair. So you never really have 'this level/boss is impossible' feeling.It also rewards you with many weapons, armour, spells and much more. This adds massive replayablity to the game as you can experiment with different builds. Oh, and the use of multiplayer in this game is fantastic. Also for summoning, out of the other Souls games I've played (DS1 and BB) this has the best summoning and multiplayer system. Though one problem I have is a common trend among the Souls series. It's the lack of information that FromSoftware gives to the player. I admit that during my play throughs I'd still have to google what a certain item actually does. However, some people may like this curiosity so they explore different items by themselves. An enjoyable experience either way. TL;DR: Buy this game."

Positive,"After 5 years of trying, I finally beat ludex Gundry todayI called my parents because I couldn't stop crying. I didn't know what else to do because I was basically in hysterics. For YEARS I've been trying to play Dark Souls 3 because I have really bad gas at night and everyone says Dark Souls cures all of your ailments and files your taxes for you. Well, that's been put on hold for a while because I just couldn't seem to beat Gungry. Until now. I came back to DS3 and finally figured out that the right analog stick turns the camera! After a few hours, victory was mine.I'm speechless. I cannot seem to place my words. My tongue is numb. I can't feel my teeth. Dark Souls is a metaphor for life because it's hard but when you do it good, it feels good. I'd also like to thank my high school music teacher for always believing in me. I can't stop shaking."
Positive,"Did you play Dark Souls Prepare To Die? If you did like me, then you most likely were just as hyped to see Miyazaki return to the franchise for Dark Souls III. And if you see the result, you'll see that he's still got the touch. Dark Souls III is a singleplayer adventure only compareable to the first game. It isn't really a game, rather than an experience. Dark Souls challenged it's players to learn the game in and out and master it's mechanics to overcome the numerous obstacles in their way. Dark Souls III reminds the gaming public, that you don't have to have a story to keep the player engaged and invested in it's gameplay and lore. The numerous throwbacks to the first installment can get a bit tidious, but the experience of playing it for the first time will remind you (or introduce you to) what it means to be prepared to die."
Positive,Praise the sun
Positive,Champion Gundyr is the best souls boss
Positive,"Originally, Dark Souls was an incredibly groundbreaking game. The balancing act between the immense difficulty and still having the game be enjoyable is something that few games have successfully pulled off, and Dark Souls 3 did a brilliant job of continuing that. The majority of the games bosses are very enjoyable and satisfying to fight, even multiple times, and even the earliest game enemies can still pose a threat to you at the end of the game, which makes the stakes feel much higher, and maintains a sense of tension in between boss fights, and ensures that the games never feels like nothing is happening. The games art style is as tasteful and fitting as the rest of the series, perfectly complementing the tone of the story, with a melancholy colour palette that feels mournful, but not dreary like some games with toned down colours can feel. The soundtrack to this game is absolutely sublime. I really cannot stress enough how good of a job Motoi Sakuraba did with this. Every single track is so good that you can easily listen to it independently of the game, and it adds tension and drama to every boss fight that is almost incomparable to other games of it’s type. However, the only issue I have with this game is how FromSoftware handled the multiplayer. In Dark Souls 1, the multiplayer system was pretty awful. It only worked about half the time, and when it did work, it wasn’t a  particularly pleasant experience. Then, in Dark Souls 2, they more or less fixed all the issues multiplayer had in DS1. They fixed their servers so that the connection was actually playable, they changed the summoning system so that invasions were actually enjoyable for the invader and the person being invaded, and they allowed people to keep being summoned in an area, even after they had beaten the area boss. However, when they got to Dark Souls 3, for some reason they decided to remove the best feature of Dark Souls 2’s PVP, the ability to still be summoned even after beating the area boss. Now, once you've killed the boss in that part of the map, you can no longer be summoned to other players worlds from it. I have no idea why FromSoftware made the decision to revert that change, but they did, and so it stands as my only significant criticism of this otherwise pretty perfect game."
Positive,"After 154 hours and all achievements cleared, I think I have a pretty good idea of Dark Souls 3's worth.As a video game it's an 8/10, as a Soul game it's a 4/10. Even Dark Souls 2 was better and I didn't even liked it in the first place !I'll go into details of what's wrong with this game if you're willing to go through my following wall of text.Oh, and I'm not gonna talk about the various crashes and wrong softbans that have plagued people since I've experienced none of both.Here's the biggest problem right away. It isn't Dark Souls, it's Bloodborne with a side of DKS. Don't get me wrong, I kinda liked Bloodborne but it's just a gimped DKS with more button mashing, little challenge and faster gameplay. Build variety, one of the strongest point of the Soul series, is nowhere to be seen in BB.So, when From Software decided to do DKS3, they probably looked upon their latest game that everybody was praising for inspirations. The DKS (including Demon Souls)  series has always been about careful decision and slower combat that allow you ample time to understand what you're dealing with and how you should react, from here it was in your hands to deal with what come your way. Too careful was a terrible idea and recklessness was a sure way to a quick death.In DKS3, none of this matter. Hell, even getting ""gud"" is optional :- Instant Estus chuging plus you get a lot of them very soon in the game.- RB to death anything and anyone. - Dodge all day long.- Fast roll for everyone.- More invincibility frame than ever before.- +40% HP while being Enkindled.- Poise is gone but enemies don't have it too ! Mash that RB button !- Hyperamor is a terrible mechanism and can be abused with laughable ease.With all that on your side, believe you me, it's rather hard to die. So forget about the idea of challenge right away.And if it's really too hard for you, you can summon up to FOUR phantoms to handhold you, no need for easy mode or actually play the game ! People will willingly help you get rid of that pesky boss and of those nasty invaders. 4 VS 1 (or even 5 VS 1 if you use 911-DARKMOON) is a sure way to be completly rid of the only feature that's moderatly exciting.You will quickly realise that From Software got tired of hearing complains about the nasty red phantoms that invade poor innocent carebears to murder them for Souls and giggles. Mostly giggles though.Anyway, tired of hearing all this Miyazaki probably said : ""let's give everybody the finger and turn PVP into an horrible snoozefest !""I don't know about you, but I've loved PVP in previous instalment, both as the invader and the invaded. It added a unique thrill to the game, even more so when you've passed the 500h mark and can play it in your sleep.So what's in it for you if you like PVP ? Let's split that from the invader and host side.As an invader :- You get ganked. A lot. If you enjoyed DKS2 ""Gank Squad"" that might be your thing though.- Prepare to be spammed to death.- New meta PVP : bait the host and his (jolly) cohort to their death like never before.- Jolly coop-invasion (when available)- The grieving opportunities are both numerous and hilarious. (Giant crab will be your new best friend if you invade for Farron, for example)- Tedious stand of if neither side grab the bait.- [Phantom summoned] [Phantom summoned] [Phantom summoned] [Phantom summoned] [Phantom summoned]- Get rekt by SL100 and +10 weapon phantom summoned through password matchmaking while SL 15.- Seek for 20+ minutes the host who's playing hide and seek before alt-F4 when found.- Variation : host alt-F4 when defeated or running out of summons.As a host :- Never fear for your life if you summon non stop.- You can take a nap.- Twinking is basically out the window, so no need to fear any unpleasant surprise.- +40% HP.- Double the maximum Estus of the invader.- Free estus everytime your pets phantoms kill an invader.- 911-DARKMOON if all else fail.- If you're alone, you're probably in for an honourable duel if the invader isn't a dick.For both :- Equip straigth sword/Katana/rapier and mash RB for easy victory (works in PVE too !)- Dark Sword all day, everyday if you're really terrible at this.- LAG- HORRIBLE LAG- Protip : the more you lag, the easiest you win.- [fail to join session]- [unable to summon]- Protip 2 : A little amount of lag actually double your I-frame while rolling.All in all, PVP is either very enjoyable (little lag, decent opponent that actually knows what he's doing, etc) or an horrible pain (god awful lag, 4 VS 1 equiped with the above mentionned Dark Sword, final destination).SPAM RB.Unto next topic.Seriously though, apart from a certain secret boss that is quite challenging (especially for the camera in the first phase), PVE is pretty much a joke. Little challenge, gimmick bosses (by the way, some bosses can be stun locked to death), forgettable enemies, etc.Nothing to see here. Even more so if you've cleared Bloodborne.N.B. : One memorable thing : ""OCEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEIIIIIIIIIIIIIILOTTE !"" that was hilarious and felt utterly dumbBloodborne went through here for sure. Lothric high wall sure feels like Yharnam and the dark sun of the last part of the game, along with the final boss arena, remembered me of the fight against Gherman.Now put DKS and DKS2 into a blender with Bloodborne and, tada, you got DKS3. Simple as that. Nothing really new and even if the level design is way better than DKS2, it's still terribly dull and déjà vu.My biggest beef though, in term of design, is against DKS3's music.DKS had a decent but forgettable OST.DKS2 had a boring one.Bloodborne had one of the best OST I've ever heard in a video game.DKS3's OST is just meh. Outside of the title theme and the one of Dancer, it's just displeasing and/or boring.BB had a really great music, it's not hard to see that probably most of BB's budget went into it. Plus, it brought back the fine art of telling a story all of it's own rather than just being a theme to a specific event (I'm thinking about the theme of Ebrietas and Ludwig among others).So when DKS3 hit the shelf I was prepared for a lot of downside but certainly not one on the musical level.When the title theme start playing for the first time I tought ""heh, that's nice. Good to hear that From learned for the best side of BB"" but then I heard the theme of Vordt of the boreal valley...And I had to turn down my speakers during P2. This bombastic choir and uninspired instrumental is horrible.Oh, I understand very well that it's made for the ""epic effect"" like some sort of wannabe Two Steps from Hell, but the fight is not epic (it's dull) and the boss is just dumb. Bombastic vocals while litterally spamming RB on the boss' ass is a lot of thing, but certainly not epic.Bloodborne did (let's call it ""empty epic"", it fits a theme but it's here to give a rythm or to support an atmosphere to a fight more than anything else) it much much better. See ""Living Failures"", ""Cleric Beast"" and ""The Hunter"".I know I'm terribly partial on the subject of music, but BB certainly set a higher standard than all previous From games Only exception might be Metal Wolf Chaos, make the office of the president of the United States great again and I sure wanted something of that caliber into DKS3 but, tough luck, all I got is this crappy OST ! Thanks From !Like I said before, DKS3 isn't a bad game. It's a decent game if you've only ever played BB or none of the previous Souls. It sure calls out to a broader audience than just the ""OMG so hard"" and ""Git gud"" audience of previous installments..."
Positive,Half of my playtime was spent grinding for ears.
Positive,"I'll be real. I was absolute hater of Dark Souls series just because I didn't like that type of games. Didn't like hardcore games at all and thought this game is not worth to play at all. BUT! After defeating a boss you are given an absolute push into the game. If you achive something in this game, defeat hard boss after numerous tries you just can't stop moving forward. After Dark Souls 3 I finished Dark Souls Remaster and Dark Souls 2 in one breath. Series is absolutely worth it and recommended to everyone."
Positive,"Just got invaded by ""SisterFister69""God I love this game.10/10"
Positive,people will give dark souls 2 shit for enemy placement ALL DAY but this game gets a free pass for doing exactly the same thing? still not as good as ds2 but its fine i guess
Positive,Praise the Sun!
Positive,This game gave me Stockholm syndrome.4/5
Positive,I guess it was an okay game before Lords of The Fallen (game of the decade) came out.
Positive,"This game is so fucking addictive it triggers the fuck out of me when i play solo but i cant stop coming back no matter how much it triggers me i have owned the game for a day and a half a have 30 hours on the game(I have a problem and need help) this game is enjoble solo but even more with freinds, if u dont have freinds u can team up with random people who are intresting. just dont give up on the game if u cant defeat the first boss just take ur time and play smart."
Positive,"this game is really fun if you play it whit your friend .at list this game have an option called ""new game plus"" and its very damn good because you can try it however  you want and it make the game harder every time you finish the game.this game also have PvP and you can try it with your friends because this make it easier and funnier.at list this game have a great story and perfect soundtracks.i highly recommend it.{!If this review was helpful to you, please give me awards. Thanks!}"
Positive,"The Game is a solid [8/10]:Must have to any fan in the series, Also I highly recommend the game to players looking for challenge:Story (7/10): - It's not your traditional story... not much is there Ashen one.  - Also this game requires digging to find out the quest threads, I have finished NG and I did not do any quests yet.Gameplay (8/10): [Boss Fights]  - I think that the Bosses of DS1/DS2 are much better than that in DS3. More variaty & interesting... - DS3 I did not feal that epicness of winning a boss battle. I think it's somewhat the easiest in the series. [Enemies] - In General: The world of Dark Souls enjoys some of the best enemies brought into Video games, the variety is great and the technices involved are also excellent on taking enemies. - I think that DS2 had the best variaety of enemies, with more unique approaches. - DS3, did not build on DS2 structure of approaching enemies especialy [SOTFS] version. - DS1 had these Black Nights scattered early and felt like a great challenge. the Metal Boar... DS2 had these big animal creatures and Knights as well... DS3 did not have much on that front. [NG+ and so on] - In General: DS games extend the replayability of the their games by allowing you to start New game Plus each time you finish the game. You can play differently, grow your character futher and even try different endings. this is a great feature from the Dark souls game that adds great value to the game. - Biggest dissapointment for me, just increased health / damage for enemies with added rings of +1... and so on. Sorry but DS2 SOTFS had a much more interesting NG+ with better changes... this is putting off.  [World] - In general: the Wold of Dark Souls 3 is well crafted and at some points brings a dark Fantasy to life. - I think that DS1 Had the ultimate connectivity were most maps are interlinked. While DS3 still felt too broad. - DS2 had very interesting areas and despite the feeling of disconnect between. - DS3 is like a mixed bag between the 2, it did not really surpace the world of DS2 and not it's as connected as DS1. - Some times it felt that the area's are also just too big (e.g.: The Farron poisenous Swamp). - DS1 Assylem return remains the best hidden area in the series. - Secrets are scattered however nothing felt revolutioanry.  [Death] - The challenge is in the death system, you must run to gain your  unspent experience (Souls) gained before you die again or you loose it forever! it's awesome.   - In general I prefered the hollowing in DS2 more than DS3/DS1. DS1 was too puniching with the humanity counter.[Multiplayer] - Best MP in a video game ever for me. I love the DS system. - You can summen people to help you and you can help others. - You could get invaded (part of the challenge). - You can join covenants to defend areas, attack people, or even to be summoned and defend other players when they are invaded. - The game's easy mode is it's co-up modes... - Other things make this game alife (and like with other DS games). you can see the ghosts of dead players, you can see the ghosts of players near you...Control (9.5/10) - This is still my favourate Action/RPG with solid & precise controls. - I did not play this with a keyboard & mouse as I only use KB/M for strategy / FPS. I enjoyed the game with an XBOXONE Controller. It feels natural with that. - Added Camera Control (8/10): - In general Camera Control can tend to be challenging especially when you are being cornered, however this is normal with this kind of games. - Overall it's still good.Graphics, Overall: (8.5/10): - Art Style: Dark Phatasy, a more crisp Dark Souls I style. - Optimization: I ran this game on my GTX 980 and it run perfectly on Max / 1080p - Atmosphere: Not as enhanting as DS1, however it's still good.Sound, Overall 6.5/10: - The game utilizes music at selected parts / areas. sometimes it gets too quit. - Boss Music fights is good though.... There is a lot to say about this game, just enjoy it for yourself."
Positive,"Unlike the second game, it looks/feels good and not as clunky/bad ported as the first game. That was my main concern. Other than that, it has a killer soundtrack and feels satisfying (The reason i play these games). Solid 8/10 cuz dying is fun."

Positive,"Very fun. I've easily played through 15 or so times using different builds, hybrids, weapons. Even doing the game solo vs. coop is so different. I still have many characters planned for the future and haven't bought the DLCs yet. I love this game."

Positive,"It's alright.It has mods too.So here is my run down of how i think of the game and TLDR; if you care---The game is fun, really even if you consider it the weakest on the series, it is still far much more fun than a majority of games.PVP is a far cry to Dark souls 2 days, but fun anyway. What is wrong tho? Barely nobody plays it now days. Those who do, are either die hard fans, hackers trying new scripts or anyone who has a connection that can only be described from the moon.cool game.Best souls game to date for me.Experience all the other dark souls series and i can firmly recommend this piece of art.The punishing and extraordinary rewarding experience is still there, packed with familiar aspects from the beloved dark souls 1, it is just perfect.Dark souls 3 also has the most memorable fights and encounters ever and i genuinely say it as the best among games.Plus the graphics ain't half bad, if you are looking for those kind of games. (actuality is among the most good looking)"
Positive,"Pro:SoundtrackCombat and overal controlsBosses (Some of the  best bosses in the series)Story / LoreContra: Enemy Designs (I mean. its mostly just Knights. Which isnt really bad but disappointing)Level Design (Its not bad, just not too much variaty besides swamps, castles and Catacombs)Invasions (Most of the time its just not fun unless u play with friends)Hackers (Get ready to get your savefile deleted by a random invader)Final Verdict:A 8/10 for sure. The DLCs have some of the best bosses in the series tooQuick Tips:  NEVER kill Andre the Smith or he will never upgrade your weapons again                  When you kill the shop lady the prices go up                  Firekeeper death has no concequences"
Positive,"Absolutely brilliant. The first Dark Souls has always been my favorite Souls game and I've been waiting for a worthy sequel ever since. While Dark Souls II is decent and Bloodborne is damn good, neither of them ever felt, to me, like a Dark Souls sequel, granted Bloodborne isn't supposed to be one. This game has all the atmosphere and feel of the original and it is great.Gameplay is incredible, there's a lot of different ways you can build your character and a lot of different ways to aproach combat. Tanking damage with heavy armor, high poise and a great shield; using light armor to dodge, rather than block enemies' attacks. There's also miracles, sorceries, pyromancies that can be used to buff your character, your weapons or to simply do damage. As for weapons: there's swords, greatswords, rapiers, axes, hammers, halberds, bows, crossbows, and I could keep going for a while. Basically, there's pretty much every type of weapon that you can think of and they all play in differently in every way you can think of. And all of these elements can be mixed and matched, resulting in dozens of different ways to play the game. Combat is very fun and addictive.The game looks beautiful; the environments look incredible; character designs look awesome, for enemies, NPCs and for the many different sets of armor and weapons you can use on your character. And it also is very well optimized and runs very smoothly. With everything maxed out on a GTX 970, i5 4690 3.5GHz and 16GB of RAM, the game ran on constant 60fps for over 95% of the time.As for story, the game continues the Souls trend of not giving you the story, instead making you discover it by reading item descriptions, paying close attention to NPC dialogues and speculating with the community, which is, in my opinion, a great way to present the game's story. The story in itself is also great.I've also been having a lot of fun with the multiplayer, a lot more than I did with the previous Souls games. Jolly Cooperation with fellow players is a ton of fun and dueling, which is something I never really enjoyed doing in the previous games, feels great. I feel like that has to do with the fact that there aren't any broken PvP builds, that make your character look incredibly stupid, yet other players won't stand a chance against them unless they're also using a similar build. Either that or those types of builds simply haven't been discovered yet, and I really hope it stays this way. I was able to kick ass in PvP using my normal PvE build, with a complete set of armor, an upgraded rapier and a target shield, without having to use any sort of cheese tactics to stand a chance, which is what always turned me off to PvP on this series. As in previous games, there's a pretty significant delay on PvP, and what that means is: basically what your opponent is doing on your screen isn't really what is happening, so sometimes they'll hit you and you'll hit them, blood will even come out sometimes, but no damage will be done. I don't personally find that to be a huge issue, it takes some getting used to, but once you do, you can have a lot of fun with PvP.The only 3 problems I have with this game are related to the NPCs. The first is that there seems to be a serious lack of dialogue from the NPCs, when you compare it to the orignal Dark Souls. I didn't take the numbers, but it feels like there's only about 1/3 of the ammount of dialogue that could be obtained from the original's NPCs in this game. The second problem I have is a problem I've had with the Souls series since it first began, and that is the fact that I hate how you have to clear the many areas of the game in a very specific order, to be able to finish the questlines of the NPCs. There's a lot of different areas and you can clear them in many different orders, and that gives you a lot of freedom to explore the game as you will, but all that freedom is completely taken away from you, if you want to complete the NPCs' questlines. And the third and final problem I have with the game are the NPCs themselves. There's not a lot of them and, honestly, half of them are just boring and don't have much to say in any way. Compared to all the awesome characters you met in the original, this is a big disappointment.Overall, I think it's a fantastic game. If you liked the previous games, particularly the first Dark Souls, you're going to love this one.EDIT: A lot of people are giving this game negative reviews because of the allegedly broken anti-cheat system. I must have played about 10 hours of PvP and I've had zero problems it so far. I haven't encountered any hackers, no items were placed on my inventory and I haven't been banned. Some people have also been giving me shit for giving this game a positive review and, well, I'm not going to give it a negative review on behalf of someone else's negative experience."
Positive,I have played all 3 Dark Souls and this one is my favorite. The combat is fluid and I always know what my enemies are capable of which means the challenge comes from reaction time instead of throwing things at you that you weren't expecting or can't do anything about. It's not easy compared to the other 2 but it is the most fair.
Positive,"If You are on PC, don't buy Dark Souls Remastered.. Just Play this."
Positive,"Well... DS3 is actually really really great especially with the level design, combat, and ambiance. It's like you're playing Bloodborne but you're not in decrepit Gothic, Victorian era–inspired city of Yharnam, instead you got medieval dark fantasy theme. The only thing i don't like from DS3 is the armor design. Just compare DS2 armor design with DS3, I bet 100% you'll prefer DS2 armor design. Like for example Faraam Armor when equipped in DS2 either your character is male or female, the armor suit perfectly with the character and look badass af, but when you equipped in DS3 you got this baggy loose armor oversize looking scooby-doo the freakin dumb ass character. AND...  The appearance of moonlight greatsword from DS2 has been changed in DS3 from cool blue emerald to plain steel  *i regret trade soul of oceiros with that wep, i should have trade with the spell instead* ... Well if you're looking for Fashion Souls and not that Bloodborne type of gameplay just try DS2 or DS1 But overall the game is definitely worth to try especially for every hardcore RPG players"
Positive,Does not open from this side.
Positive,"While it takes place chronologically last, it is a great starting point for those new to the series, as it can be a bit more forgiving than the first two games."
Positive,"i hate pvp. I suck at it.  i hate being invaded. i hate that there's a built in mechanism that encourages Griefers.but i love this game. There's something about he Souls games, the bleak atmosphere, the intense satisfaction when you finally beat a boss or claw your way to the next bonfire, they draw you in and they don't let go.  i've played them all, except Bloodborne, which is waiting on my ps4.Dark Souls 3 is one of the best.   try it.  you'll like it!for those who haven't played a Souls game,i feel compelled to say that these games are not quite as ruthless and difficult as the 'git gud' squad would have you believe.  it's a steep learning curve, no question.  but if a 55 year old  (like me) can figure it out, there's hope for everyone.  :)"
Positive,"Bring lube, your ass will thank you."
Positive,"Best game ever created, In my opinion.Do note that it's hard af (at least on the first few playthroughs), but if you really give it a chance, than many dopamine moment. Also Fat Bosses"
Positive,"Good way to pass the time while waiting for the Elden Ring DLC. It's still a great game nonetheless and has pretty damn good bosses, especially it's DLCs."
Positive,"""If you begin to reinstall Windows, you will not be able to return to journey because we didn't bother to have Steam cloud. Are you sure you wish to begin clean Windows installation? -Yes -No"" Nice backstab from publisher. RIP rings. \Ó/"
Positive,"Simply, a masterpiece. Came back after a goo couple of months to defeat the tutorial boss and ended up progressing a lot. This game is incredible and, well, here's a tip: NEVER GIVE UP! This game is made to be hard, but it's always possible once you learn how to play it; once you get used to the game, it's easy to kill enemies and have fun dying over and over again to the bosses because you progressed and achieved a different phase or such. Thanks for reading it, and may the flames guide your way."
Positive,"Main issue with this game is that it takes ZERO risks and if you played From's prior games it all feels like something that has been done before. That being said, this is easily From Software's most complete game. It's basically flawless and features some of the best bosses they've ever made. Yes, it is better than Elden Ring."
Positive,My favorite masochistic game.
Positive,"10/10, would die again"
Positive,JUST. PLAY. IT.
Positive,this game is aight
Positive,I like the feeling of impact when you hit things. It is one of the biggest reasons I keep on playing without it getting boring.
Positive,Yes this game has an amazing community that would never troll you ever. You can place 100% trust in all orange soap stone messsages left by other players to never lead you astray. The ones near random ledges that say seceret passage ahead are my fav. I find the coolest stuff. Just remember praise the sun!!! purple summons are sus as heck and gank the red ones!!! GLHF!!! AMAZING CHEST AHEAD!!!

Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is (supposedly) the final installment in Dark Souls series.I honestly don't know what to start with, so lets just go 1 by 1, shall we?[GRAPHICS]Decent, fairly good PC required to play. The game's locked at 60 FPS. Probably the best graphics in the series so far.[GAMEPLAY]In DS3 developers returned to old formulas. DS3 plays a lot like DS1, but with some major changes.Fighting is slightly more fast-paced, probably inspired by PS exclusive ""Bloodborne"". Definetely the fastest and action-packed game in Dark Souls series, but not too much so its not like this is a new Devil May Cry or anything.Power progression is fairly good, there's a huge choice of weapons and armor to choose from that fit different playstyles. Although some weapons are clearly better or worse than the others, by either having some kind of exploit or being straight up underpowered in their respective class.Armor choice also doesn't matter as much as it probably should, so light-medium class armor sets are clear winners most of the time, and otherwise Fashion Souls is open to you no matter your build.Explanation why - below.[CONTROVERSIAL MECHANICS: POISE AND DEFENSE]Poise was reworked in DS3 and, in fact, was reworked again post-launch.In DS2, for example, poise was a straight passive stat that was dictating how many hits by what weapon you could withstand without being staggered.In DS3 poise is NOT passive, therefore anything will stagger you no matter what's your gear unless you meet certain requirements. It is also not THE poise, but instead a defense stat that PROTECTS your default poise that you have no matter what you wear (so you can poise through things even naked, provided you are being hit with a light, weak weapon).The requirement to activate the poise: you swing a weapon that has what we now call ""hyper-poise"" and the poise activates somewhere mid-swing. Those weapons are limited to: maces (two-handed only), greatswords (two-handed only), halberds (two-handed only) and all of the ultra-great weapons.Also certain special moves of certain light weapons have poise too (for example straight sword stance thrusting attack).Every of those weapons' classes have a class-unique poise multiplier. In other words: 30 poise with a Greataxe means a lot more than 30 poise with a Greatsword.Oh, btw, the reason why am i explaining all that is because the game doesn't tell any of that you, at all, ever. So i'm saving your time here by preventing you from going to google to understand what the hell is going on.[The Defense mechanics controversy]Your survivability in this game is linked to TWO separate defensive stats: DEFENSE and ABSORPTION.DEFENSE is a flat stat that calculates first. The game compares damage dealt to you with your DEFENSE and block a part of that damage based on how big (or small) the difference is.The formulas for this thing are INSANE. Comparisons go something like ""IF (damage > defense by 50%): deal 200% damage"". This is an example, but that is basically how it works. Its absolutely MENTAL.But you shouldn't care anyway because ALL the armor in the game gives the SAME amount of defense no matter what. The only way to get more DEFENSE is by leveling up. So there's that.ABSORIPTION is simplier, thankfully. It just mitigates damage by a percentage. So if you have 20% absorption against fire - you will take 20% less damage from fire attacks.Calculates AFTER the DEFENSE. So its not going to matter much anyway. Just a little clutch.And that's it for core gameplay mechanics that you should know, but you will not know unless you google them (or read this review).MOVING ON.[BOSSES]Probably the best in the series. Majority of them are very well designed and fun to fight against. There are a couple of worst ones too, however. Usually the ones relaying on some gimmicks that have nothign to do with actually fighting the boss.There's not as many of them as in DS2, but more than DS1 i believe.Regular enemies: give or take. Some are too easy, some are too hard. Depends, really. The game relies mostly on making the enemy harder than trying to overwhelm you with numbers (although there's still some of that time to time, so be ready).[DIFFICULTY]Harder than Dark Souls 1 (but more forgiving), but easier than Dark Souls 2 (mostly because it doesn't rely on BS gimmicks and ganks as much as DS2 did).Actual difficulty is somewhat low for first 25% of the game, then a big difficulty curve happens and suddenly you are knee deep in your own death and frustruation. And it mostly stays that way for the rest of the game (but can be compensated with leveling).New Game cycles: do not add anything major to the playthrough. The enemies become slightly stronger and you can find +1, +2 and +3 rings in later NG cycles (NG+ and NG++).The highest difficulty of the game is reached by reaching NG+7 where enemies reach their maximum damage output and health bars.[STORY / PLOT]A (somewhat) direct continutuation of DS1. DS2 is only refferenced through items and some characters. People are still debating whether DS2 is in the past or in the future.A lot of questions are left unanswered, so be ready for that. Otherwise - its not relevant to the gameplay, so you can just ignore everything. Knowing the plot of previous games is not required.[PvP & ONLINE PLAY IN GENERAL]Invasions are still a thing.Invaders' matchmaking prioritises games with cooperators present (NPC or not), making the majority of invasions putting invader into disadvantage, which concists of multiple factors including:- invader is most likely to be outnumbered (9/10 cases), and being outnumbered usually means death in Dark Souls games;- invader is most likely to invade host of higher level than he is;- host has a +30% health bonus (from being embered, which is required to cooperate / be invaded) and also has full estus (healing) charges, while invader's are halved.TL:DR - Invading sucks, having friends rules and makes the game 50% easier. If you want true Dark Souls experience - play alone, unless some particular boss gives you a bad time (and there will be such bosses).Twinks are a thing, but they're not too strong and if anything they simply even the battle-field for themselves.[WARNING: HACKERS ALERT]Hacking in DS3 is fairly rare, but its a thing, and its a dangerous thing. The hacker can corrupt your save file (intentionally so) and get you banned from online play (but not offline play).IMPORTANT: Dark Souls 3 does NOT supports STEAM CLOUD. Saves are stored ON YOUR PC at hidden directory:C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming\DarkSoulsIII\RandomNumbers\File.sl2Make back-up copies of your save-file as often as possible (prefferably after each session, you dont even need to close the game to do that) so that you could restore things back in case something game-breaking will happen.[DLC]Dark Souls III has two DLC addons: ""Ashes of Ariandel"" and ""Ringed City"" with latter being the direct continuation of the former (so its best to have both, but you CAN have them separately).DLCs add new areas, new enemies, new bosses (2 in AoA and 4 in RC) and new gear (obviously) some of which is very unique mechanic-wise and often very good at its' respective class.Having both DLCs is recommend to have the full and true Dark Souls III experience.Overall Score: 89/100The game is VERY good, but it definetely has its flaws at certain aspects that make lives of such nerds as i am very miserable, because only those who truly love this game truly know what's wrong with it. And there's plenty of that. What are those aspects - you can decide for yourself once you play it, if you so desire."

Positive,"I, too, want to find my own place, within the fire keeper's bosom."
Positive,"There's something about Dark Souls 1 that I think will never be lived up to, when it comes to world design, item placement, and lore through discovery.However, as a game that is effectively a love letter to its progenitor, there's a warm feeling of nostalgia while working through Dark Souls 3, a spark of excitement each time you get teh chance to say ""Hey, I remember that.""Mechanically, Dark souls 3 is best in show for me, with an excellent middleground between the original, and the most recent Miyazaki game, Bloodborne.Absolutely worth playing for every build, every item, and every boss fight."
Positive,"A solid game offering challenge for people new to SoulsBorne and good experience for each kind of player. With it's dark theme, beautiful soundtrack and polished fighting system, it makes a really good RPG that is worth your time.Controller is recommended, however you can still play on keyboard and mouse that aren't bad either."
Positive,"I used to have a negative review of this game up because of my issues with the poise mechanic. At the time, I believed there wasn't one in game. This was for a few reasons. Firstly, the fact that the system was completely overhauled from previous titles. Secondly, the fact that the system they did have was semi-broken. And thirdly, a lack of communication on FROM's part about these changes.For those that don't know, poise is a value in Souls that stops you from being staggered when hit, which can cancel you out of your attack animations.The game has been updated a lot since then, and the mechanics at play have been made more clear. The system for poise is extremely convoluted, and it's difficult to understand the math, but it works now. The gist of it is that you only get poise enabled while attacking. The frames it's enabled on are based on your weapon, and the value is based on a combination of your weapon, armor, and whether you've been hit recently.Having played more than a thousand hours of Dark Souls 1 PvP, I think I understand why they made this change. In Dark Souls 1, poise was active all the time, so you could equip some heavy armor, walk up to someone to bait them into an attack, and just walk through it without staggering as you circle around them to backstab before they can finish their attack animation. On tanky builds, this was absolutely worth it if you got someone to take the bait, but it was kind of cheesy.I do still have some issues with PvP though. The poise system in 3 has the problem of making every fight feel sort of the same. If you hit somebody with your first attack when they're not in their poise state, or even when they are with some of the more broken heavy weapons, often you just hit the same combination of buttons to do the true combo on your weapon that does the most damage. Imagine if you were locked into a cutscene where you do your fancy combo of hits on someone every time you successfully land a hit. It can feel like that sometimes, since the new poise system heavily encourages unbreakable combos and limits the gameplay variety.A more important issue is the covenant systems. Specifically the Blue Sentinels and Blades of the Darkmoon. In DaS1, the Blades of the Darkmoon allowed you to invade the worlds of guilty players as a blue spirit of vengence (usually against players who invade and kill) and punish them. It was a lot of fun, and gave an alternate twist on the invasion system. The space cops could come to YOUR world and hunt YOU down.In this game, the darkmoon blades are split into two covenants. The classic darkmoon blades, and the way of blue. However, both of them operate in the exact same way. You don't invade worlds of the guilty. Instead, you invade active invasions to defend the host against an invader. Not nearly as fun. When you get summoned, nine times out of ten, the host will only want to double-team the invader with you, so you either have to fight him in an unfair way, or let the host die. Neither of which is very satisfying. Don't get me wrong, I think this is a fine idea for a covenant. As a powerful red spirit, it can be fun to cut down blue ones one after another while making your way to the host. Blue sentinels do drop more valuable items than the host, so even if it lowers the chances of killing the host, you are incentivised to target the blues first. Additionally, you get some estus back for each kill, giving you some fuel to keep going if you play well enough. All of that can make for a fun experience. My only question is WHY in GODS NAME did the darkmoon blades need to be an exact carbon copy of this. It's so dissapointing, both from a darkmoon blade perspective, and from a finger of rosaria perspective. Gone are the days when invading had real consequences. Playing an invader in DaS1 and having the darkmoons track you down to your world and fight you on your turf was a great experience. You felt like a wanted man, and an absolute badass if you could fend them off. As a darkmoon, there's no way to punish the guilty in an honorable 1v1 situation, unless the host of the world permits, and even then, they don't lose anything. Not even an ember, like they would lose a humanity in DaS1. It's all safely contained in the invasion. I really wish these two covenants were split to offer both the DaS1 and DaS2 blue experiences, but instead, they've opted for two covenants accomplishing the latter with no noticable differences.With all that complaining out of the way, the game is really solid. I've had a lot of fun making varied and interesting builds, just like my experience with DaS1. If you're not interested in the PvP like me, and the majority of this review was a massive waste of time for you, I'm suprised you're still reading, but I still reccommend the game. The PvE content is just as solid, and would be worth it on its own. All in all, it's an excellent game, and it would be a shame if you didn't get a chance to play it."

Positive,"This review won't focus much on story since I don't care much of that in a souls game.  I was gifted this game by a STEAM user, 1piecer. Shoutout to him, he's cool,Dark Souls 3 draws inspiration from all of its predecessors by borrowing heavily from Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2, Bloodborne and Demons Souls. I have played the first three of those game (never got farther than Father Gascogne), but I never played Demons Souls. The game has a lot of features from all those games but I can't say that I agree with all the features, areas and things borrowed from all those games.The game doesn't run very well on my Mac. I am currently running it at 720p on the absolute lowest with a lot of framerate drops. The graphics are quite good though, I would say I was genuinely impressed with how beautiful the world was and a lot of the details in it. Fire and a lot of effects look very good in the game. The boss and menu music in this game is phenomenal. I swear, its the only main souls game that I genuinely like the music in it. Very epic and gets you into the mood of fighting. The rest of the game is typical souls affair and doesn't have any real background music but I don't really mind.Dark Souls 3 plays very well and controls well. I primarily play with a controller for all the souls games, but for the short time I tried the mouse and keyboard controls, it wasn't bad. There are some new mechanics in the game that weren't there in past games like the ability to jump without rolling afterwards. Weapons arts is a new style of attack that depends on what type of weapon our character wields, they use focus points. Weapons arts seem to be more useful in PVP or one-on-one encounters with strong enemies. Dark Souls 3 also reverts back to a more traditional mana bar that lots of rpgs and Demons Souls had, than the use of charges for magic like Dark Souls 1 & 2 had. The game has a higher quantity of magic than in previous souls games but it seems like miracles, sorceries and hexes have been gimped while pyromancies have been improved. The former do far less damage than in both of DS3's predecessors.Dark Souls 3 favors a hub world with mostly independent levels like Dark Souls 2, and less like Dark Souls. Dark Souls 3's level design is constantly good and I would say that there is no outright bad level. I would say that after beating the game, my favorite levels were Cathedral of the deep, profaned capital, grand archives, Anor Londo and Lothric Castle. They had a lot more shortcuts than the other areas and didn't rely too much on bonfires. That's another thing from Dark Souls 2 that has bled into this game. While I like the fact that the hub world brings in all merchants to one area and allows for upgrading at one location and it also has it's own secrets and loot, I do not like the reemergence of leveling by using the firekeeper at the hub like Bloodborne & Dark Souls 2 and instead favored the use of leveling at a bonfire like Dark Souls.There is an abundance of bonfires in a lot of areas that could have done with more shortcuts. In general, the level design in DS3 is wide and less vertical unlike Dark Souls 1 and also unlike Dark Souls 1, you can fast travel from the beginning which follows in the steps of Dark Souls 2 and Bloodborne. This wideness makes a lot of the levels feel very large, which I liked but it cuts down on the amount of shortcuts in areas making me feel at times that certain areas like Undead settlement are generic. Most levels are not connected to each other like Dark Souls 1 either. Now, this isn't necessarily bad because I said that the moment-to-moment level design is good but I would have liked to see the series sort of return to the Dark Souls 1 level design in which a large amount of the main areas were connected to each other without the need of a bonfire. The areas I disliked were primarily Farron Keep. I am not a fan of the swamp areas in the souls series. I don't really like Blighttown or The Gulch. I really disliked that FROM still did not include a ring that allows the player to move at normal pace in the swamp. There is no real level that outright wowed me. In terms of linearity, some have claimed that DS3 is more linear than previous entries but I beg to differ. While it doesn't have the luxury of allowing the player to approach the same location from different entrances like Dark Souls 1, there are still enough optional locations for the player to get side-tracked off the mandatory locations and it is possible to reach late game areas from early on in the game. The level design of Souls 3 does get a lot better as I progressed throughout the game. Less bonfires littered all around and more use of shortcuts, and some areas use vertical level design properly.Souls 3 continues the tradition of having very good combat not only in the action or rpg genre but in gaming in general. It brings in some improvements the the existing formula but takes some rather large missteps. One of those missteps was the changing of poise to be pretty much non-existent like Bloodborne. This means that every weapon and every attack will stagger your character which is unlike Dark Souls 1 & 2. With the addition of faster combat than Dark Souls 1 & 2, this means that a large part of combat is either stun-locking your enemy to death or your character getting stunlocked till death. One or two particular bosses take this a bit too far with long combos and there a couple of enemies with long combos that don't give the player a rest which can get quite annoying. It is even worse in PVP with certain weapons that have good range and swing quickly. Another change that was influenced by bloodborne is the removal or armor upgrades and the increased use of rolling because of how little stamina rolling takes. I am not personally someone who plays the souls game in a very evasive manner. Bloodborne did it well being a new ip and having a more focused combat system, but I don't like it when Dark Souls 3 is encouraging and pushing me to play the game in a more evasive manner than when Dark Souls & Dark Souls 2. More additions from bloodborne are also the visceral attacks that can be done on certain bosses and enemies once they've either taken too much damage or their shield has been broken. It's done as a way of punishing people who overly block.New Game+ brings in new rings and new souls but isn't as robust as Souls 2. There are no new enemy placements, new boss-souls that bring new gear, or new red phantoms.The bosses are also sort of a mixed bag. A good amount of the early - mid game bosses are either gimmick bosses or are just easy. The game saves itself by having a lot of good bossfights later on. Most bosses this time have a 2nd stage that either changes the stage, or the bosses attack patterns completely courtesy of Bloodbornes influence. I like this addition of having a 2nd stage because it mixes things up in the fights. The downside is that it takes out the surprise from some fights that do have very good 2nd stages. I'd say that the bosses I enjoyed the most were lothric, dragonslayer armor, soul of cinder, nameless king, old demon king and maybe champion gundyr in that order.Covenants and NPCs don't stray away from what FROM has done in the past.Joining a covenant is now really convenient and only depends on getting a token from said covenant. Afterwards, all the player needs to do to switch covenants is to pick a different token in their inventory. It removes the ""betrayal"" system of Dark Souls and removes the need to fast travel back to a covenants area to rejoin.Co-op is nice and fast to summon to summon people but I have gotten into connection issues in the past couple of days. PvP is also a mixed bag. The push for a more evasive playstyle is there and everyone rolls around. Certain weapons are still there that stun lock the crap out of people and things like hit detection and ""phantom range"" are still very off in the game.will update after DLC"
Positive,ludex gundyr is way to aggressive for a tutorial boss haha hes like the Margit of DS3
Positive,No human sensation can compare to the feeling of beating a hard boss in this game.  Any accomplishment you strive to earn in life such as financial successful or relationships will never be as gratifying as what you can achieve in this stupid game.  Yes i had help with every single boss yet and have yet to beat the game.
Positive,"A game fit for the strategist in you, or the berseker viking you always dreamed you could be. Ripe with unique and varied landscapes, each with enemies fitting of their environment and lore. Numerous builds, opening up a multitude of ways to play. A world filled to the brim with stories of new and old, developing around you. NPCs each have their own unique quest line to follow, each allowing for varied endings to said quests. Different endings to the game, each achieved in their own interesting ways. Tough to a new player, yet satisfying. Bursting with references and call backs which build upon the lore of the previous installments for veterans.Along with a challenging solo game, this game implements easy coop with friends, for fun gank sessions when invaded, general help, and screwing around.  On top of this, it holds references to many popular manga and anime, such as Berserk and Angel's Egg, along with many more."

Positive,"This game and the entire series has just been an incredible influence on the kinds of games I enjoy. I'd be lying to call this one my favorite Souls, but this is by far the best multiplayer experience of the three in my opinion.  If you're looking to play Dark Souls with a friend, or invade to your heart's content, then this is the Souls game for you."
Positive,"I know my hours are very short on this version of Dark Souls 3 (I'm currently planning to finish the entire game on K+M) but I played multiple hours off the PS4 version & finished it too so I think I have a good grasp on explaining the game or at least an attempt at it.After 2 failed PC ports from Dark Souls: Prepare To Edition (RIP since Bamco decided to replace it with the god awful ""remaster"" that's basically a paid version of DSfix with bad lighting) & Dark Souls 2 (The Scholar edition has 60 FPS, good graphics and so on but the controls for both controller & K+M were wank), Fromsoft finally made proper K+M controls that requires no double clicking or weird key placements whatsoever.How is the final Souls game? Well for me personally I really enjoyed it and it returns the fast & fair gameplay that everyone loved about the original Dark Souls.While I'll miss a few minor features that Dark Souls 2 had (Bonfire aesthetics & very few UI item menu choices), overall it brings back mostly everything with a few new features like improved PvP for example.Majority of the bosses are really good (Very few bosses have questionable camera placements but other than that most of the bosses are really good), Lore & characters are better than the previous Dark Souls 2, enemies don't rely on horde spam to overwhelm you & whether you get the game on sale or not it's worth the price.I'll update this review whenever I refinish Dark Souls 3."
Positive,one of the best game i have ever played

Positive,"Ds2's servers are still better, specially at low levels... but, its a souls game, its good but it feels like something missing. I dunno what, but definetly somethings missing."
Positive,"If your a fan of the souls series this game is fantastic!  So far I've played 9 or so hours and I'm loving every bit of it.  For those who think it's just another bloodborne your wrong.  There is only one zone that is right out of bloodborne the rest is strictly souls.  The game is optimized very well in my opinion although I'm sure you will find a review or two that say it crashes and runs like shit.  I have had no problems what-so-ever running it 3440-1440 with g-sync enabled.  It's also a pretty good looking game too!  Their aren't a ton of graphical options to choose from but maxing them all out seems to get the job done.  One thing I found nice about this entry is that starting a bon fire actually saves you there unlike the previous souls games where you would have to sit at one.  This time around you get weapon arts which are a nice addition to the already great gameplay.  From what I've seen so far each weapon has a different set of weapon arts,  Or at least each ""Class"" of weapon does.  Over all if your a fan of the series this is a must buy.  I also have played this on PS4 and the game actually looks pretty good on console but where the two versions differ (PC) - (PS4) are the frames and the resolution.  The graphical side of things are pretty damn close.  9.5/10"
Positive,"I can't review this game...I love this game so much that I will be to buyist and can't give a honest review.It's my second favourite game of all time with Bloodborne taking the number one spot.The replay value is great!I've got:400+- hours on PS4.At the time, 170 hours on PC, but that will change.I absolutely recommend this game, it's worth the full price and more.There are also two DLC's.Ashes of Ariandel (Only recommended with sale, because way to short)Ringed City (Reccomended, a great challenging ending of the series)"
Positive,10/10 would get ganked again!:)
Positive,Tongue But Hole
Positive,I've played this about 2 hours now and I'm crying. I feel physical pain. This game isn't healthy
Positive,There's no need to see any reviews. It's Dark Souls. Buy it
Positive,"Now that I've 100%'d the game guess I'll say something about it.TL;DR: It's a good addition to the series, fun and interesting areas with decent challenge but if you played earlier Souls games it'll probably be pretty easy honestly, some mechanics don't work properly, pvp is pretty brainless because of it.Overall I enjoyed Dark Souls 3 a lot even if it had broken armor mechanics (I usually prefer a heavy build), I'm waiting on getting a better PC before I do more playing with different builds than the ones I've already chosen.  I found the game INCREDIBLY easy the second time around, I think the mechanics just take time to get used to.Speaking of mechanics, major mechanics flat out don't work, example is poise, which literally is non existant since the last time I played (since release), making heavy armor builds nearly useless aside from some defences, which most enemies will do 1/2 of your health in a single hit anyways even with most armors unless you have high vigor, the only instances of ""poise"" are with heavy weapons where you're much harder to be interrupted when swinging making them still usable, I did a great axe playthrough and it was pretty fun.Enemies also don't really have any sort of poise (excluding LARGE enemies which can't be staggered or are very difficult to stagger) making weapon types like the straight swords incredibly strong with its fast swing speed, low stamina cost and decent damage when doing a 40/40 build, I LITERALLY STUNLOCKED HAVEL WITH THE BROADSWORD 1handed like seriously, they're insanely common in PvP along side katanas, I have like 300 hours of DS2 pvp experience so I mean, I'm at least a little experienced with Dark Souls pvp and I find it completely brain dead in this game for the most part, favoring R1 spam is usually the most effective way to win and weapon arts are mostly pretty pointless honestly.  I can't really talk about magic as I haven't bothered using a mage or cleric build, i've heard faith is pretty lack luster, but iunno man.THAT ASIDE, the game is great looking and has a lot of good areas, I never found myself bored when travelling the lands, most of the bosses are pretty interesting (Although there's a lot of flame sword dudes, that's common) or complete shit, no inbetween.  A lot of the bosses are just chaotic for the most part making them feel similar.  The areas you travel are pretty interesting in general and are pretty well made with short cuts and bonfires, though they are kind of a straight line with maybe a split or two.  Anyone that's a fan or Dark souls 1 will probably appreciate it a little more than they did Dark souls 2 map layout.That said play style wise it feels like a hybrid of Dark souls and Bloodborne with faster paced combat, lack of poise and armor importance, valuing dodging over blocking and the ability to easily combo enemies.  Oh right, blocking is almost pointless with most shields as you can only block usually around 2 or 3 hits before being drained completely of stamina even with high stability shields.Oh and fix covenants, darkmoon took forever to max out."

Positive,"difficult but fair, and has a good replay value."
Positive,Do you want to end your life? If so this is the game for you. Also epic music.
Positive,"There are well over a hundred good reviews for this game out there, on Steam and everywhere else-- but I will say, if you want to get into the Souls series, THIS game is the perfect one to start at. Not to say the other games are worse, but this game definitely gets major points for being the most fluid of them all. Combat, weapon fighting styles, bosses and progression is all very streamlined, and the difficulty will gear you up for the previous games. The ONLY major complaint I have for this game that would be important for new players to know, pure-casting builds are not beginner friendly, and don't function well in the early game."
Positive,"So.. Dark Souls 3 was my first Souls game to play. As someone who likes to sit back and relax and turn my brains of when playing games (and would even choose Easy in games when it's a possibility), this game pushed me FAR outside of my comfort zone. The first time I gave it a try, I tried and tried at the Wall of Lothric, but ended up ragequitting. A while later I tried again and thought ""hey, I can also just run past some enemies instead of fighting them EVERY single time"". With this, I was hooked. All I thought about when not playing was Dark Souls. The movement, almost feeling like dancing and the rhythm stuck with me every time I stopped playing for the day. I died, a lot, sometimes asked for some tips from friends, but after 199 deaths I finished the main game and DLC. The memory of playing this game will stick with me forever. I recently started DS2 because of it (after a short break to just let it all sink in), and plan on playing DS1 Remastered after that. Can recommend to everyone that likes a challenge, but also for people that don't; the feeling of achievement will be even greater."

Positive,"Disturbed some Hollow that was praying,It killed all the nearby enemies while transforming into a nasty beast.11/10 would disturb prayers again"
Positive,"I was super hyped for this game, especially considering my favourite game of all time is Dark Souls. After seeing lots of the footage shown at events I was super excited to finally get to play it.As a veteran on the series and a huge fan, I can confirm that this is indeed a phenomenal game that tears the previous games apart mechanically and technically. The introduction of the mana bar, whilst I thought would make magic too overpowered, is balanced perfectly with the fact it splits off of Estus Flasks, so you have manage wisely.This is by far the best starting point for newcomers of the series, but don't expect a cakewalk. You've probably heard dozens of times the series is hard, it definitely is. I am a veteran and I still get brutally mauled every so often, there is constant punishing for those who don't adapt to the games mechanics.So if you just die constantly, how is the game fun? Well, there is no series out there that gives you a greater sense of achievement as this game does, eventually tackling down that boss that tore you a new one constantly is a gratifying and rewarding experience, and makes you feel like a superstar. If you ever get stuck, you can always summon friends or unknowns to come and aid you during your travels. Whilst this does ruin the sense of achievement by beating a boss yourself, it's still a great mechanic for those who just want to experience the game.The combat has been completely revitalised with new Weapon Arts, which give you more access to combos and buffs that has never been seen before, and it's a welcome change.The lore behind the series in general has always been incredible, but it ain't handed to you. You've got to search for the story, find the missing pieces and connect them. This is one of them games that doesn't hold you hand throughout the game. All it does it give you the basic tools and the controls, and off you go.Speaking of controls, my biggest gripe with the series in general has always been K&M controls, this game is clearly designed with a controller in mind, and honestly it functions just fine with one. If you ever feel like being competitive you can always do PvP duels against others online. This has always been a mechanic in the game that keeps players playing after years and years, the Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2 PvP community are still strong to this day, though I can admit this game has the best PvP yet, thanks to the weapon arts combos and how much easier it is to invade this time around.I haven't even talked about the soundtrack yet, the soundtrack in the other games are incredible, but this game has surpassed my expectations for the music. I didn't think it would be THIS good, it's that good that I play it constantly in earphones whilst doing work.Seeing as I am a huge fan, the final boss and the nostalgia I kept feeling in this game brought tears to my eyes, thanks to how well the game is presented and how it harkens back to the good old days, never have I seen a game present such emotion through the smallest things, and it hits die hard fans right where they live.Overall, this is THE definitive Dark Souls game, and one of the best RPG's ever made. Is it better than the other games? Well that's down to opinion. Personally it does everything better than every other game, though nostalgia could make Dark Souls top it for me, haven't fully decided. After the disappointment that was Dark Souls 2, Hidetaka Miyazaki had to come up with the real Dark Souls sequel, and he has delivered!10/10"

Positive,"Dark souls 3 feels like the lovechild of Bloodborne and Ds1.It plays really well, doesn't at all feel like it was rushed and provides you with that familiar difficulty that applauds skill and battle memorization. Unlike SOTFS where they just took the lazy approach and thought difficulty was simply adding more mobs to fight at once, Dark Souls 3 presents new enemies much like the first release.Experience nostalgia without feeling like you're playing the same game again, the connection to the other games are brilliant and sometimes very subtle, but so rewarding to see. Everything about this game just feels like it was done so right.The use of heigh in Dark Souls 3 offers a new expereince that the other games just didn't have, making you feel like you're ontop of the world in some areas providing you with a view of almost the entire game.I could go on and on about why this game is well worth it so ill just say this: If you are hesitant at all about buying this due to your experience with SOTFS (may have been fun but just not what you expected) or even just unsure about the game itself then I highly recommend buying this game.Thanks FromSoftware for creating this amazing sequel."

There will be times when you have the odd bulls**t death when some enemy kills you through a wall or you yourself end up invading into a gank squad.

I just finished the game for the first time and I'm in tears. Dark Souls is more than just an ""impossible and 0 lore game"". It's a handcrafted world, full of exciting new (and old) levels. It's all about dying 100 times in a row to a boss and finally beating him, nothing compares to that feeling of accomplishment. This game made me love gaming again, thank you FromSoftware."
Positive,"400h+ and all achievements, would recomend!"
Positive,Amazing game. About to play through again.
Positive,"Finally finished the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Dark Souls games. Quite the experience to say the least.Did every boss, DLC and optional boss/mini-bosses - worth it.10/10"
Positive,The greatest game of all time. Nothing more to say.
Positive,The Good Type Of Cancer
Positive,"Alright let me start of by saying, this game is definitely ""one"" of my all time favorites ! As i entered the souls genre with Bloodborne, and had a lot of fun with that, i knew i had to explore other From Software games, and let me tell you DS3 does not dissapoint! The game play on its own is really fun, and you can easily spend 100's of hours exploring new builds and experimenting around. DS3 has provided a tough challenge, but oh so satisfying when you beat the game! The graphics are really good, but the enemies and sexy bosses is what REALLY reels you in,XD. Prior to the game i wasnt into or rather i should say i was not aware of the lore, but i actually still really enjoyed the game! As of now im getting into the lore, and it really gives you that immersive experience. To know the lore of the lands around you, the bosses and enemies you slay! Now i will be moving onto the other souls games, in search of an even harder challenge, this time equipped with knowledge of both the games mechanics as well as lore! There is a PVP aspect to it, which also brings in a lot of hours, as that can get really addicting, especially with the Areana system. The invasion concept is also really cool and annoying at times, xd.Overall, great game, great mechanics,great lore, Two AMAZING DLC's, sexy bosses, and KINKY Weapons(with a really cool weapon art sytem). - 9.5/10 Only cons- Online bugs and issues"
Positive,"-10 out of 10-Do you like to die? check-Do you like dying some more? check-The new estus,magic system takes getting use to but this game is great. I havent got to play much do to work, but i do have a dual sword buff cleric on new game+. -Even with almost 100 hours on record and running the offline mode using a trainer to find all the items and hidden rooms. I died so many times and still haven\'t found everything. (inf. health? No prob The game will still find so many \""creative\"" ways to kill you x) )-There are annoying parts like constant invasions, but that just shows viberant community. So never go alone! until a invader shows and trashes you and your phantoms while you sit there and think to your self \"" why am i still playing\"" -Such a great series in all. Tough at the beginning, but when your \""get good\"" mode kicks in the game becomes cake."
Positive,"Right. Dark Souls. I may be ever so slightly biased when it comes to this series, I have played every game in the SoulsBorne series apart from BloodBorne. For me this comes second best to the original DarkSouls. The only reason this still comes as second best is that the world is not as well designed as the first game; It still has the 'Hub' Area, but nothing links together in such an impressive way, Which is what, at it's core makes the first game so good. The combat, enemy design, Graphical prowess, and of course, The difficulty makes this game a must play. Whether you have played the previous games or not, you will enjoy this. Like everything its not for everyone, But I urge people to check it out if they haven't already. 9/10."
Positive,Praise the sun!!!

Positive,"Fun. Is be hard, but very satisfying. Also be very beautiful."
Positive,I still love this game
Positive,"This is the best Souls game. A die-hard fan of all the souls games and a very happy buyer of a PS4 solely for Bloodborne. This game hits all the right notes in gameplay, tone, music and nostalgia. It takes a lot from Bloodborne; most notably, the weapons all have something special to them. The weapon art system gives a third dimension to every weapon and creates differences between weapons of the same type. The unique weapons and boss weapon are also exceptionally unique.They've also included just about everything I wanted from Dark 1 and 2. A few minor items I would've loved and at least one boss throwback to DS2 would've been nice. Of course, DS2 isn't remarkable, it's simply great and I would've liked a reference to a boss I've killed dozens of times. But all that being said, the amount of time armor, weapons, locations and simply lore implications made me throw my hands up in the air is incredible. All the new stuff is great as well and harkens back to what makes Souls special in the first place.DS2 was easy, DS1 was difficult and I'd say this game is hard. Hard, but brought down to challenging because the best part about this game is how tight and convenient everything is. Things just work and little touches they added simply to speed things up are great. The obtuse nature is not gone, but refined to making it only frustrating on your own accord. Those little touches are great, but the big touches like how easy it is to co-op and put work into your covenants is fantastic.The game is just perfect and all I could ask for is more. It's a great length, but boy do I want more of this. Even if it doesnt amount to much, I just want more of a reasons to never stop playing this game. Now, adddressing the performance. For me, I have a beefy pc and it's okay. It's 99% of the time between 58-60fps but there have been strange instances where it would drop below, to even 24fps. But these instances occured only a few times in my 67 hours and not during crucial moments. Same goes for crashing; I crashed twice, but it only happened when I was literally just standing around for awhile.In a couple months, this game will run great, just like with the insane Bloodborne patch that improved performance greatly and lowered loading times from 45 seconds to 10. Do I recommend this? To a souls fan, I cant recommend it enough. To someone going in blind, you'll love it, you may miss out on a lot of references but the curiosity and fascination remains because its all just so interesting. Play 1 and 2, play Bloodborned if you can and then be ready for the grand finale! I know this is suppose to be the final Dark game, but please, say it aint so or provide DLC until I die!!ps ADD AN ARENA"
Positive,"This is like riding a bicycle, but the bycicle is on fire and the floor is on fire and you keep asking yourself why you are still doing this.So pretty much my high school experience, 9/10"
Positive,"Great end to the trilogy. Perfectly challenging gameplay, deep hidden lore, fun enemies and level design. I recommend newcomers to play this before playing the first Dark Souls, because I think it will help to appreciate the first even more. The mechanics are more forgiving in this game (for example, freedom of movement in combat) as well as more clear and directed (the stuff that *shouldn't* be a mystery is not), and the quest lines are a bit easier to follow. When you are comfortable with the Dark Souls ""formula"" and understand the combat loop enough to not get burnt out, DS1 is easier to digest and enjoy.Also, don't compare the Souls games to each other. DS3 is just as good as DS1 in its own right. The game is more linear than DS1, and that's okay. The gameplay feels smoother than DS1, and that does not make DS1's any worse."
Positive,"I mean, what needs to be said about this game? If you enjoyed the first two, espcially DS1, then you will love this game. Perfect controls, amazing graphics, hard as fuck. Although it is easier than the first installment, there's some pretty gnarly enounters in this game, especially the DLC. If you know nothing about Dark Souls, that's ok. Jump in and let the game take you to pound town. Stick with it, learn from your mistakes and the game is rarely unfair, if ever. You can overcome anything in this game with any combination of weapons and armor and at any level, it's up to your skill to succeed. 10/10, will be playing this game unti l die IRL."
Positive,"If the dlc and optional areas are not included, this game is very easy. But if you play the full game along with the dlc and manage to complete it, it will be one of the best experiences you might have. The gothic elements and fast paced combat are just some of the key elements of the game. An amazing end to a true masterpiece franchise."
Positive,"DISCLAIMER: If you buy this for co-op, make sure your friend has a way to drop lots of souls so you can level up past 300. If you don't do this, you'll be targeted by PvP trolls who have optimized their builds in order to repeatedly invade your game and harass you. In my opinion, having an overleveled character won't impact your experience as much as those nuisances will. At this point in the game's life, you're better off playing with a friend you already know instead of trying to play with randoms.     That being said, I rate this game 10/10.     I originally 100% completed Dark Souls III on PS4. For newcomers to the soulslike experience, there is a huge learning curve. Nothing else on the market is quite like Dark Souls.It feels like being thrown from godliness to having someone plant your feet in the ground. In Dark Souls, you are nothing, and everything is better than you. It's your job to use your wits and overcome such profound weakness.     First and foremost, this game requires patience, ingenuity, and a ""never give up"" mentality. One of the most satisfying feelings this game can give you comes after you fail, come up with something new, and succeed. You have to stay sharp, remember your limits, and work with what you have.     The combat is methodical and intense. Button mashers should expect a great struggle, as pressing a button one too many times can result in death during the most simple enemy encounters.     It takes well into your first playthrough to fully grasp the number crunch that happens when you equip armor or level up. However, once you begin to understand why stats work the way they do, you'll start realizing how intuitive and sensible it all is, as if you were leveling up your own human body.     No challenge is impossible. Nothing is against the rules. If you're struggling, you're forced to analyze your flaws, perfect your techniques, or find new situational approaches. The critical thinking and willpower required to finish this game might even lead to self improvement habits in the real world.     The multiplayer aspect of this game has lived and died. Unless you follow my disclaimer directions, you're unlikely to have pleasant experiences.     However, playing this game with a friend is 1000% cooler. You get to dance around enemies, distract, find ways to compliment each others' playstyles, and take turns 1v1ing enemies. You'll get to have some great memories of working together to overcome challenges.     Think: ""Let me go first. While the enemies are chasing me, you can grab the items then attack them from behind."" Your friend runs off, gets swarmed and dies, you berate one another, laugh it off, and come up with a new plan.     It adds a whole new dynamic element to the game, and helps you realize how well simulated the world is. Some of my best memories from DS3 are of challenging my friends to do wild things, like fighting bare-fisted against late game enemies.     This game has a lot of content. You might find yourself spending hours creating your character, planning how to level up, or looking forward to the next weapon or outfit you'll find.     There are plenty of enemies, bosses, navigation challenges, and areas to explore.     If you have the insatiable thirst of curiosity, you might even spend most of your time reading descriptions and discovering how everything in the world ties together. If you're that kind of person, here's a tip: everything in DS3 exists for a reason, so there's plenty to figure out.     After you finish the game the first time, don't be afraid to look up quest or location guides. There are lots of hidden, obscure elements to Dark Souls 3 that one might never discover unless they read about it first.     Thanks for reading my review. Hopefully it will help a few late stragglers :)     Game hard. Trial and error. Feel good to win. Interesting world. Better with friend. Lot to do. Collect-athon.     Buy!"

Positive,"Dark Souls III has a lot of what makes Elden Ring so great, 6 years before Elden Ring. Elden Ring is still the better game (of course), but this game is worth picking up if you have a craving for another FromSoft soulslike."
Positive,"You probable need the dexterity of spiderman and have 10 fingers to even go past the 1st boss fight. I got stuck on the first boss and after spending an hour and a half dying with the first 30 seconds of the fight while not making a visible dent in his health bar, I tried to quit the game. Navigating through the confusing menus trying to find the option to quit took another 4 minutes. Got back to game after few months. Made it to 2nd boss and gave up after 15 attempts. plan to sell the game on ebay or something. You should have a warning label advanced gamers only.I keep screaming but God won't answer."
Positive,"A very solid entry in the glorious Soulsborne family.Gameplay is simple but has enough fine detail to keep you playing for thousands of hours.The lore of the world and its inhabitants is discreet, mysterious, captivating and often bitter sweet.Player interactions are some of the best out there.Music, sound design and overall atmosphere are also excellent.There really is something special about these games, and you should play ALL of them.Quick, go along now, find a copy for yourself!"
Positive,"My absolute favorite game. I have played DS 1 and 2 too and I can tell you Dark Souls is completely different from other games. It's really hard in the beginning, it doesn't have a tutorial. You have to explore the environment and find the right way to advance. If you choose to play online, you can summon other players into your game to help you, but keep in mind that you will open the door to players invaders as well."
Positive,this game is really hard but fun
Positive,"Took me 75 hours to complete on my first playthrough. Most frustrating game I've ever played, only game to ever make me smack my desk10/10 would recommend to anyone.Absolutely fantastic experience, nothing will beat the feeling of defeating a boss you've died to over 500 times.So much replay-ability with the number of builds you can createSoundtrack is insane, perfectly representing the different areas you're in, and different bosses you faceCombat is solid with attacks feeling substantial. Although some pvp back-stabs are a bit questionable (inb4 git gud)Overall world and level design is mostly spot on, with exploration being rewarded in most places, all locations are unique and interesting - except for the toxic swamps they can fuck off.DLC is worth it too, great additions to the gameplay and the story, with some of the best weapons and bosses in the game also being included, although Darkeater M'dear can lick my big toeMy personal favourite single player experience ( and I don't play many single player games because I lose interest quickly ), with co-op / pvp being an added bonus"
Positive,"Rating: ★★★★★Hours of gameplay as of review: 70No notable prominent phobias.Port: Solid 60fps at max with an Nvidia GTX 970 without modding or alteration to the game's .ini files. The first souls game with properly usable Mouse and Key Board controls. Full Steam Controller support with multiple action sets for Ingame, Menu and Inventory, as well as Developer presets.Summary: Must have for any souls fan. The best Souls game in the series and a fitting end to the trilogy without relying too much on throwbacks to previous dark souls games. From Software has done it again, so many weapons, so many armors, diverse bosses and a coherent land space design. The world makes sense as it was in 1, but with the superior Combat and Quality of Life changes of 2. Length: I'm really into PvP and Co-Op so I've been dragging it out and farming for armor sets, and weapons and helping people, and I've racked up 70 hours and still havent completed the game, the game has longevity, though I hear those who just want to get through the game have anywhere from 25-40 hours of content ahead of them."

Positive,"This is a truly epic journey, from your first faltering steps across gloomy cliffs to striding like a lord-slayer through Lothric Castle. Like all epics it has endless diversions, quarrels, unexpected companions, and great big fights. Dark Souls 3 is a fabulous game, and a fitting conclusion to the greatest trilogy of modern times."
Positive,"For the longest time, I always thought I could never derive enjoyment from a Souls-like game. But, this game changed everything, and by everything I mean, a very specific genre of games called souls-likes, and considering gaming is everything, then essentially it changed a small part of everything.Anyway morale of the story is, the game is surprisingly extremely gorgeous, there were quite a few jaw dropping moments when it came to the environment/scenery/bosses. I didn't even mind the relentless cycle of death to the same bosses, It made me adapt, learn and overcome. In most games your character progressively gets stronger and more powerful as the journey progresses, and even though that may be  the case too for Dark Souls, that isn't really the focus, in this case : the player behind the character improving is the real difference maker."
Positive,"Its abit easy but if you like to block, roll and poke people with a sword this is the game for you nothing bad ever happens to you in it and you will never want to punch your screen at all."
Positive,The community around Dark Souls is one of dedication. its hard to come by a game that can take all your time and effort from you and still give you the motivation to play even after you loose everything.7/10
Positive,2nd best souls game.
Positive,"If you have never had sex, this game is perfect."
Positive,Difficult but very good game.
Positive,Incredably hard but quite fun to be honest.
Positive,"I would say ""if you liked the previous ones, then you'll like this one"", but that wouldn't be true. Because this entry has more in common with Bloodborne and Sekiro, rather than the other Souls games, with faster combat, lower stamina costs and more aggressive enemies. So make of that what you will. For me personally it took way more time to adapt to the new rhythm of things than I'd like to admit, but it grew on me. Also multiplayer is way better than before with Embers actually rewarding you for going online. Other than that - it's Dark Souls, you know what you're getting into."
Positive,"Certainly a worthy game for anyone wanting an engaging experience. A person could go through this and any other game in the series and have almost no idea of why they do what they do, yet still have a blast. However under closer inspection the stories are rich and meaningfull"
Positive,This is by far my pick for the best Edition of the Trilogy.

Positive,This is one of my Favourite games. It really tests your patience at times.It is a really fun game to play.
Positive,"The most BORING Dark Souls game, where's the unnecessary bullshit jank that makes you wanna tear out you pubic hair like you're plucking a chicken or the dull and depressing looking world that makes you wanna cry and stab your eyes with a razor-blade? Truly a step in the wrong direction if you ask me."
Positive,"The best franchise of the past 10 (20?) years concludes with another great game. Devs try and try and try but no one gets close to how good the combat, visuals and sense of exploration is in the souls series. Nioh, The Surge, Lords of the Fallen and Dragons Dogma have some souls inspiration but they can´t even get near Myazaki´s scent for gaming and the aroma of mechanics brewed by his masterful mind. DS3 has some cool bosses and weapon arts are a fun new addition to the series. Honestly, even if it didn´t have anything new only exploring and fighting is fun."
Positive,"I've put off the Dark Souls series for a long time now, I couldn't see the appeal for it. After a sale, and a little research I bought the game. The moment I arrived in that graveyard I became completely engrossed in the story and the lore. I can't stand using a controller for any game, so I use keyboard and mouse for this, which has worked fine for me. The combat is very good, and fluid and the boss fights are the best I've ever seen. I also love how you can shape your character into whatever you want them to be. The game is visualy very appealing, and the world is absolutely gorgeous. If you are putting this game off, buy it like I did, I think you'd really like it.       10/10"
Positive,"My views on this game are very conflicted. While I think it is a fantastic game, all I can feel towards it is disappointment. It feels more like a greatest hits album or a fan fiction project for fans of the Souls series than a conclusion to Dark Souls. Every time I thought it was telling its own story, it turned out to be a reference to one of the other Souls games. There are Dark Souls references everywhere you look, some being completely needless. So if you thought DS2's allusions were too much, be ready for the ride of your life. It is actually tough to find story elements in this game that are not referencing one thing or another. Sometimes it feels like that's all the game's story is.Like I said though, the game itself is tremendous. It is perhaps the best playing, looking and sounding Souls game ever made and I absolutely recommend it to everyone - fans and non-fans alike - you will have a blast. I myself will probably play this for many hundreds of hours to come, but it will never replace what I have in my heart for Dark Souls (1)."

Positive,"As someone who is deeply enamored with the dark fantasy genre, Souls Series, and particularly with works such as Berserk, I can confidently state that Dark Souls 3 holds an incredibly important place in my heart. In my opinion, this game is truly perfect in every aspect, from its gameplay style to its combat mechanics, design, and even its soundtrack.What truly stands out to me about Dark Souls 3 is the incredible richness of detail that can be found in every aspect of the game. Whether you are exploring the beautifully crafted scenarios or battling against a host of terrifying monsters, there is a level of intricacy and attention to detail that is simply unmatched.One of the things that I particularly appreciate about Souls games in general is the way in which it manages to seamlessly integrate its story and lore into every aspect of the game. From the items that you collect to the enemies that you encounter, there is always some new piece of information to discover about the world. This creates a truly immersive experience that is both engaging and deeply satisfying.In terms of gameplay mechanics, Dark Souls 3 is equally impressive. The combat system is both challenging and rewarding like in other souls games, requiring a great deal of skill and strategy in order to succeed. All in all, I would say that Dark Souls 3 is an incredible game that truly deserves all of the praise and accolades that it has received. Its price is more than deserved for such an incredible work.From the biggest fan of the Souls Series on the universe,Alisa."

Positive,Fuck this game <3
Positive,"I had Anger Issues , Then i downloaded and started playing Dark Souls 3 . Now I have anxiety with more Anger Issues ."
Positive,"I can once again recommend this game now that online multiplayer is restored.  It had been taken down in response to an exploit, and the developers took significantly longer to restore multiplayer than they had led the community to expect from them.As far as actual gameplay goes, this is a really fun game to play.  The controls are very responsive, and when enemies kill you, it always feels like you know what you could have done differently in order to survive, whether it is positioning or timing or stamina management.  The PvE experience in this game is so fair that you can even make up for any deficit in levels or equipment by simply having enough skill, something that is almost unheard of in this genre.  That said, certain builds and preparation can make some of the boss fights significantly easier.Dark Souls 3 is one of the best cooperative experiences you can find in video games.  It is one of the few games where playing with - or against - random people on the internet actually feels good most of the time.  Getting into the multiplayer in this game is much easier than in the other two Dark Souls games because the items are available in the central hub and the password matching system is easy to use."
Positive,Most of my invaders didn't know you can't parry a Zweihander's two-handed swing anymore :^)
Positive,Difficulty With Friends = Easy   Difficulty on your own = Ultra Nightmare
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is obscenely good. It's not as well-designed as 1 in regards to story and world design, but is better than both 2 and 1 in terms of mechanics. If you're looking for a dark fantasy game that has a rich story hidden in details and environment then this is absolutely what you want."
Positive,"The BEST game I've ever played. Not only for its quality level designs, but also various PvP mechanics that were never seen from other games."
Positive,To withstand the physical and mental pain this game causes is if you are at peace with yourself. Otherwise you might throw your controllor at the screen in anguish and despair.

Positive,"You know, I really hate spending 60-100 dollars on a game, I got this and all its DLC for 21 in the deluxe edition on 75% off christmas sale, and well. I can genuinely say with my experiences now in the past recent 90 hours of gameplay, this game is without a doubt worth as much as you pay for it, whether it be retail price or sale price. It's endlessly replayable, endless playstyles you can choose, tons of loot, endless secrets, challenging battles and progression that MEANS something to you, even if you've done it a hundred times or more. Then the PvP, a lot of people don't like it, but god damn it adds such a lovely element to the game to be able to summon random strangers and have a blast without being able to communicate, and then cheese an invader, or get cheesed off a cliff, by the invader. Stunning game, great graphics, great narrative.Oh, and the best part of the game, isn't even the gameplay, which is stunning in and of itself. It's the dialogue, every character feels real, the world wouldn't feel complete without any of them, they don't talk a lot, but they say tons through their word choice, fully voice acted, with talented voice actors that drop raw emotion into their lines. Perfect game."
Positive,Amazing Dark Souls game. In my opinion it's the best of both DS 1 and 2 as well as several improvements. Not without it's flaws like any game but overall it's worth the $60 price tag for this game.

Positive,EDIT: Changed review to positive now everything is working again.When are servers coming back? Do not buy this game on PC until From Software and Namco Bandi actually communicate with thier community and get the game working again.
Positive,"Dark souls 3 is the best Dark souls because its actually enjoyable to play. The story revolves around a bunch of Lords not coming into work and your quest to find them, beat them and drag their remains back to their assigned seats. After which attendance is taken and you travel through the power of imagination to a that fire world from Chronicals of Riddick to fight the living embodiment of fire or some nonsense. The story itself is told to you by pleasant voiced white guys on youtube, which is a bold choice by the japanese publisher. Everyone speaks in Ye' olde Englesh depsite the fact that;1- England isnt a thing in The Souls Verse2- No other reason. The key to success in Dark Souls 3 is playing BIG SOULS. Whats BIG SOULS? BIG SOULS is when you eat everyone around you. Bosses souls can be made into weapons but fuck that you got macros to achieve. Word on the street is that there is a boss who got big by eating people? EAT HIM. Is that a guy he's eating when you fight him? EAT HIM TOO.  Whats that? One guy is possibly the legitmate son of the one god-king of this land, and is completely optional? EAT HIM. He rides a dragon? EAT THAT AS WELL. Dump everything you can into vitality and carry weight and watch as people just cant keep up. There is multiplayer but its garbage."

Positive,I died at the character creation
Positive,"Painful, yet addicting. Kinda like BDSM."
Positive,"To me, Dark Souls 3 is the best out of the series; I felt I spent less time dying to jumping puzzles, rolling off ledges during fights, being completely lost and running to boss areas repeatedly from Bonfires after dying. In other words, I felt I spent a lot less time dying to stupid things and more time dying to actual mobs and bosses in the game; which are certainly harder than usual due to the lack of poise and the pace of the game being faster.I will be completely honest, I really enjoy simply playing through Dark Souls 3 and have now done so multiple times and will be continuing to do so. There are very few bosses I find that are unenjoyable compared to the other Souls games and by far the best thing is that the level design is probably one of the best out of the Souls series - Farron\'s Swamp area is a massive pain though, since you dont have an \""Iron Ring\"" like in Dark Souls 1 and you will probably lack anti-poison items.It will be interesting to see what the DLC will bring to the table this time since after all very few would disagree that this was the shortest Souls game so far.Although while I was lucky not to ever get into contact with the problems involving Hackers and the softbans, I did have some problems with fps drops in certain areas and the lack of any real change in NG+s will move my overall score down because of these issues; which I cannot ignore.Overall though I think its fair to give Dark Souls 3 a, 8.5/10"
Positive,"(Jolly Cooperation has never looked this gorgeous~)Dark Souls 3 can be best compared to a grand piece of music.It starts off fairly slow, with a simple beat. (Well, boss)But as time progresses, as you push further into the story itself, the beat gradually intensifies with each boss you fell, until you find yourself lost amongst the games intricate level design, the heart-pounding OST, and the interesting cast of NPCs you can meet.In no way is this a perfect game.None of the Souls are really, they all have their flaws, yet they remain heavily enjoyable due to their unique style.I would even go so far as to say this game even surpasses Dark Souls 1, 1 which has reigned unchallenged for many a year now.I heavily recommend this to others, but mainly I would recommend this to people who have experienced 1. 3 borrows heavily from it, and I highly recommend either playing 1, or researching the lore before beginning 3.You will be all the richer for it, I assure you."
Positive,plin plin plon
Positive,"Third installment of dark souls series. A masterpiece. Mostly every aspect from older games is improved and refined. Dark souls 3 offers seamless combat fluidity, (for some) interesting storytelling, best multiplayer. I may say story has some plot holes and is kinda bland but dark souls was always about gritty and ungrateful storytelling, the main part was always the adventure."
Positive,"PvE is solid. PvP is full of jerks with OP weapons and ""git gud"" personalities.so yeah, ""Git gud"" or have not very much fun at all.PvE is nice.EDIT: I wrote this review after my first playthrough with a friend.Later in the game, I don't mind PvP as much. I've gotten a better grasp of how my weapons work, and have better stats. People twinking early game with endgame weapons was my primary issue.Still would rather not get invaded but later in the game it's more manageable, at least for me."
Positive,"I love how it is satisfying to smash and destroy bosses after they smashed and destroyed you a lot of timesAnd do not let people tell you that this game is too hard for you, just try it yourself"
Positive,Best game ever!!
Positive,hot  babes
Positive,Too bad PVP is plagued with lag.Overall a great game.
Positive,STORY TIME!Resurgence of players from that got the game during Humble Monthly.>Make new build because of of recently wiped hard drive>Notice every host I invade is kinda clueless>Decide to get Untrue White Ring>Invade and use said ring>Gain trust of host>Go through entire level >Seconds from the nearest boss>run backstab.exe>HOST OF EMBERS DESTROYED 10/10 would bamboozle again
Positive,"Not the best of the Series, but a very good game none-the-less. Good combat design for PvE and well balanced weapons for both PvP and PvE. A good game to play with friends for fun and to challenge yourself alone with. There's just one small caveat; The most recent DLC was deceptively short, not putting much out for PvE. But the DLC also offers the best solution to the PvP system by adding an Arena."
Positive,"Overall amazing, great exploration (Edit: since I wrote this review early on in my first play-through, I didn't really know what I was on about. There isn't too much exploration, especially in the base game, but their also isn't too litte. It is very linear for most of the game, usually with 2 or 3 paths through. The DLCs, especially Ashes of Ariandel, are more open than that and actually do have a great deal of exploration in them. Having completed the game with DLCs 7 or 8 times at the time of this edit, I can safely say that there is enough exploration to say that there is exploration, but my previous statement of ""great exploration"" isn't entirely correct) combined with varied and interesting combat it is brilliant. Various NPCs make it interesting, especially as most of them if not all do something good for you depending on what you want.TLDR; p good, walk around for a bit, talk to people, kill things. 8.5/10"
Positive,"People say it's hard but it really isn't, also don't be too discouraged if you don't have a controller because it's still not that bad. Only complaint is how fighting multiple enemies with small weapons is nearly impossible and extremely unfun."

Positive,This game explains why i am single.
Positive,"A fantastic return to form for the Souls games. Unfortunately still not perfection... so close every time. Nonetheless, a very worthy sequel to one of the greatest games of all time."
Positive,"As a product in and of itself, Dark Souls III is excellent. Were it not for the monumentally stupid decision to remove poise, the fundamentals of the game would be by far the best in the series. Actions are faster, recovery seems more natural, healing is back to just being estus flasks, and magic uses a pretty ingenius mixture of the Demon's Souls mana bar and the estus flask system. Covenants no longer require a ring slot and can be switched out at anytime. The game is beautiful, with significantly darker coloration and lighting than Dark Souls 2. DS3 also gets rid of one of my least favorite aspects of DS2, the terribly ugly font. (The menu system is a bit worse, though not by a particularly noticeable margin.)The level design is for the most part great. Even when it is not quite so great, it is leagues above the worst levels in DS1/DS2. Enemy placement seems to have finally returned to a more natural and fair level--in DS3 you regularly fight more than 6 enemies at once, but it never feels quite as ridiculous as it was in DS2 because the enemies are designed with this in mind. I should note however that some enemies break this mold, and that is not the only thing that they break. There are a small handful of enemies in the game that seem to blatantly ignore collision and conventional movement mechanics, which can make them seem unfair. This is most noticeable in the game's various dogs, which constantly clip into walls. There was even one point where I was exploring an area above a basement and a dog floated through the ceiling of the basement and jumped at me. I have a screenshot of an instance where I was playing with my friend and a Valkyrie enemy literally spun himself right into the inside of a wall and got permanently stuck. I would accept this kind of thing in a game like New Vegas, which has a more humorous universe, but in a game like Dark Souls, this lack of polish is kind of shocking. It's like the gargoyles in Anor Londo from DS1--if they didn't fly right, why put them in the game at all. In spite of this I would still say DS3 has better enemies than any of the other souls games. The Evangelists, Irythlll swordswomen and Demon Pyromancers being particularly capable and enjoyable enemies to fight.It's only with perspective of the previous games that DS3 reveals some pretty pervasive flaws. Tonally, the game is a complete mess. Dark Souls 1 was about a world crumbling to dust, Dark Souls 2 was about desolation and the hopelessness of an endless curse. After finishing it and all it's side-content, I...honestly don't know what Dark Souls 3 was about. Areas have vastly different stories and justifications, which is good, but also bad--it literally feels like you're walking through entirely different worlds, which is not helped by the linear world design. NPC stories are complete absurdity, the only character in the entire game that mostly acts within reasonable standards is Siegward, who is quite literally Siegmeyer with a different name. I would be more ok with this if the NPCs were vendor-lobotomites like Majula in DS2, but not only is it a chore to even find your vendors, but many of them can actually reach a worse state of being by completing their questline. This includes the ""good"" endings. I can very well imagine people never finding the miracle vendor during their first playthrough, they are so out of the way that it is outright ridiculous. (More reason to believe that From hates Faith builds, I guess.) The hex vendor is also extraordinarily difficult to find, though I can at least understand this as hexes are supposed to be end-game level spells.The game seems to want the player to spend a long period of time around the Firelink Shrine, which is why you can only level up at the firekeeper unlike DS1. This is also the likely reasoning for why there are far more bonfires in this game than any other souls title. Yes, even DS2. Tension is effectively murdered by this. And for what, I wonder? The Firelink Shrine is very annoying to navigate, significantly worse than the hub worlds in any of the previous game. Walls are everywhere which makes it hard to ever get a complete grasp of where the vendors are. I should also mention that the Firekeeper in DS3 is by far the worst hub lady in the series. I am starting to get very tired of this archtype, they rarely offer anything at all other than things the player should already be able to do.Speaking of archtypes, I don't actually mind the ""fanservice"" in the game, which is a common complaint. I don't exactly think it's brilliant storytelling, but for the most part the archtypes in the game are clear improvements to the characters they orignated from. Hawkwood is the only Crestfallen Warrior in the series that I can actually tolerate. Patches' appearance in the Cathedral was one of my favorite moments in the entire game, and I find it hard to take seriously anyone who complains about his reappearance when it was done so well. If this really is the last Souls game, I can understand Miyazaki wanting to give some finality to his favorite creations. The stuff that is new in the game is extremely compelling. Nearly all of the bosses in the game have excellent environmental storytelling. I also loved that all of the bosses in the game, even the really bizzare ones, had a clear impact on the world around them. This compared to DS2's constant feeling of ""Why am I fighting this guy again?""I must mention something about the endings:First of all, they all suck. Second, it's insulting at this point that putting out the first flame is not a default option. It is made blatantly obvious throughout the game that linking the fire is not a good idea, and yet we need to find some eyes to talk to people about it. It should have been made an option by default the second they wrote Lorian and Lothric's dialogue."
Positive,"I think the original Dark Souls is better, but this is very good too."
Positive,"In my top 3 RPG's of all time. Combat, artstyle, atmosphere... everything is just masterfully done. Best game I have played in years, possibly ever."
Positive,"I just realise I did not make a review for this awesome ""best souls game of all time"" and my favourite ARPG to date. Dark Souls III a dark experience where we can find beauty on sadness and shadows. Yes it does not have the same precision on hit boxes like Elden Ring and also does not have crouch or leap mechanics, BUT it has everything else, including a unique experience each zone with almost no boss repeating. I recommend this to those who want a complete journey on a fantasy world with incredible loot system, itemization and layouts. It's not an open world experience, but it's a masterpiece experience. 535 hours? I will play more for sure again!"
Positive,"I finally 100%'d this game after 200 hours. It may be old, but it sure was a journey going through it. I've been playing this game since 2017, and I am actually surprised at how active people still are- I still get the occasional invasion and I still find people to summon for boss fights.At first, you'll find it insanely difficult, but as you progress and get better, you'll find that beating the bosses only takes a little bit of patience to dodge the attacks and take it one hit at a time. It may seem daunting to lose all your souls but you'll get to a point where they don't actually really matter that much.This game is a masterpiece, I played through it 4 times and still enjoyed it every step of the way. Even if its age was showing at times, it is still a magnificent work of art.I recommend that you play it now, especially with the price.9/10And A fine Dark Soul to you!"
Positive,"This game is living up to the expectations of the original Dark Souls game.  Personally, I'd like to view this as the second installation in the series, but one can only be so lucky.  If you were a fan of the original Dark Souls, you'll be satisfied with the level design (Thank YOU, Miyazaki), combat system, and interesting new NPCs.  The environment looks beautiful and lots of unique and fun armor combinations.  However, there is a fly in the ointment.  The PC port performance is utter trash, and understandably from a game developers point of view they build these ports within a vaccum, using only a few hardware systems, until they release it to the public where there are countless numbers of hardware and software configurations.  With that being said, time heals all, and I'm certain there will be incoming patches to fix many of the common performance issues and bugs customers are discovering.Even with the performance issues, my experience playing this game has been astounding.  FROM has done an excellent job rounding off the corners on many features the original Dark Souls had but executed poorly, or was compromised in the name of finishing the game on time.  Namely, the magic, stats, and combat systems.  These systems were OK in the orginal title, but they could've been so much more.  With Miyazaki back at the helm, Fromsoft has updated that structure while maintaining the consistent, well-balanced and re-playable gameplay system for RPers, Speedrunners, and PvPers that we players have come to expect from the franchise.I've got to say, I was very apprehensive about the new Focus Power (FP) or 'magic bar', but surprisingly, it works really well with the addition of weapon skills/stances.  It gives purpose to magic (both lore-wise and combat-wise) to all character classes.  The original 'you-only-get-this-many-uses' structure seemed rushed and unpolished, but it worked for what FROM needed to accomplish within their time constraint.  This new FP system is much better.  Players now have two estus flasks, alloting charges to each however he sees fit.  One recharges HP, the other FP.  So, if your character isn't a magic user, allot all your charges to HP.  If your character has healing spells or powerful magic, allot more to FP.  Its a great system!Once again FROM has redefined what stats do, and for the better.  One of the biggest problems in Dark Souls was the Resistance stat.  Nobody ever used it because it was far less effective to point into it when you could point into Endurance or Vitality.  Besides, it didn't do much armor couldn't already provide.  Endurance used to increase Stamina and Equipment Load.  Now it increases Stamina and Lightning and Bleeding resistance.  Vitality used to increase max health, now it increases Equipment Load and Physical Defense and Poison Resistance, where Vigor now increases max health and Frost Resistances.  Attunement increases your slottable magics while increasing max FP.  Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence and Faith are still basically qualifier stats.  They provide Fire Resistance, Decrease Casting Time & Fall Damage, Magic Defense, and Dark Resistances, respectively.  Dark Souls 2 also changed how stats worked, adding an additional stat, Adaptability, and removing the Resistance stat entirely.  However in many ways, it fell flat.  It created another qualifier stat on top of Str, Dex, Int, and Faith, especially in PvP.  The Dark Souls 3 stat system is truly well-balanced and it will be interesting to see what the 'optimal' PvP level will be in the game.The addition of Weapon Skills has provided an almost endless opportunity for PvP character builds.  Shields now provide access to unique combat moves depending on the shield and weapon type by pressing the L2 button.  Some shields parry, some shields bash, others allow the Weapon Skill of the right-handed weapon.  Without the shields, simply two-handing the weapon will allow the same functionality for the Weapon Skills.  These Skills can range from a temporary Damage boost, to unique move sets, to special magic attacks and it all depends on the weapon your character is wielding.  The Skills cost FP to use, so even quality builds will have a choice between alloting FP estus or developing their Attunement stats, garnishing the idea for simple pyromancies or heals.  There are also now inherent 'dual-wield' weapons where normal ""two-handing"" of the weapon actually allows your to dual-wield.  No more hours of farming or multiple runs to find two weapons of the same type!Upgrade paths have been updated to fit in bit more variety.  You will find new Heavy, Sharp, and Refined, along with Deep, Simple, and Hollow upgrade paths.  Heavy upgraded weapons freeze scaling on Dex and increase scaling on Strength.  Sharp does exactly the opposite.  Refined scales for both Strength and Dex, but decreases the base damage of the weapon to a greater degree.  Deep upgrades add Dark Damage, Simple upgrades add magic damage and adds FP recovery (I am assuming with every successful hit or kill), and Hollow upgrade is quite strange.  Not only does it increase your Luck stat while Hollow, but it also scales with Luck.  Makes for a very awesome plausibility for farming-based weaponry.Overall, I'd recommend the hell out of this game for any Dark Souls fans.  It's brought so much polished-ness to the genre and is a great way to wrap up the series.  If you're on a tight budget, wait till patch 1.1 is released to avoid the frustration of performance issues and then buy the game.Cheers."

Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is, hands down, one of the best game i've ever played. The massive amount of coustimization that there is in this game is a big part of it. You can start out with one of many character types, and change your approach on what your character specializes in throughout the game. Every single fight has so much more life to them than in any of the other souls games. And the fact that the environments flow together so well adds to that experience in combat. Dark souls 3 is not nearly as frustrating as any other souls game, but at the same time it is more difficult AND more fun than any other souls game. I'm not saying that this game isn't frustrating, there is a good chance that you will have that moment where you will rage quit and send your controller sailing into the wall. Though I have not done that, it surley is tempting at times. This game's replay value makes up for it's flaws in every way, those flaws being difficulty spikes and NPC invaders that are extremely overpowered later on. Even after I beat the game and new game plus, I still wanted to go back and start a new game with a different character type and see how it played out differently for me. This game origionally took me 35 hours to beat  WITHOUT Archdragon Peak, the Consumed King's Garden OR any of the DLC's. This was because I kept trying to find new ways to fight and level myself up. I guess you could say... the game isn't hollow! Terrible puns aside, here is my rating: Praising the Sun/10, best game ever. Now prepare to die, a lot, For the fifth time in From Software's series."
Positive,"Amazing game ahead,but visions of rage..."
Positive,"I got the game since it first launched. Bought all the DLC. Played from the first day until the day that most of the unkindled finally burned out.Gameplay wise, it's still the same Dark Souls. The combat is rewarding. To be honest, if you fail at it, it's because you keep rushing in and not thinking. Only spamminh whatever the attack button is and not changing tactics. On the other hand, people who take their time to learn how things work wil be rewarded well. That said, it's still not a hyper fast paced game nor is it a slugfest, but it can be either with the right playstyle.On the bright side, any slow moments are rewarded by great attention to detail on the maps, lots of secrets and breathtaking views. I personally love the ""after the end"" feel of the game.The community is a mixed batch. A lot of people do have some pride and honour. There have been countless times i was invaded and have invaded where the ""Enemy"" and myself challenged each other to a duel with no estus or cheese tactic. There was no system to force either party to abide by those ""rules"", yet most people follow it. In many cases, when a 3rd party comes by to a duel, they'll often sit out and let the duel progress. Some hosts, players who summon phantoms, even create makeshift tournaments. Though, if you try to break duel ""rules"" in any form, expect full retribution from both your opponent and any bystanders who also honour those duels.On the other hand, there are still hackers and cheese builds. There are toxic people who only want to kill. There's also the infamous gank squad who hunt in numbers... but they're all not too bad as long as you don't invade. If you have the first DLC, you can duel in a fairly fair battleground.Tl;dr, get the game. On sale or not, it is worth it."
Positive,"Arguably my personal favorite, due to the combat changes and the uniqueness of each weapon and playstyle, plus the smoothness and nimble gameplay.The level design is on a breath-taking level and the nostalgia from meeting with recurring characters from the first game and once again visiting familiar places is purely ecstatic.While there are some frowned upon changes, which not everone agrees with nor welcomes with open arms, in my opinion the game is an absolute cherry on the top of the souls series and worthy to be the final souls game."
Positive,"Pretty much a ton of Dark Souls 1 areas of the map redone 1000's of years in the future, really cool and nostalgic going back to these areas and seeing what has changed over the years.

Positive,"The greatest challenge of Dark Souls 3 is not its enemies, but its obscurity. Learning to navigate its convoluted system of stats is made no easier by its insistence on jumbled terminology. Health potions are Estus Flasks, and maximum health increases through Vigor instead of Vitality, which increases carry weight capacity for some reason. Magic potions are Ashen Estus Flasks, and the player is an Ashen One, which means undead, but not the same kind of undead as friendly NPCs—though still just as perfectly alive-looking—and not the same kind of undead as the enemies, who are Hollows, but the player can become Hollow. Also, being slightly on fire increases max health by thirty percent, but then murderous, red ghosts can appear out of nowhere and start rolling around. And while that’s only the tip of the crazyberg, don’t expect Dark Souls 3 to explain any of it. Its tutorial level consists of splashing about in puddles and reading brief descriptions of console controls before a 15-foot, armored death machine slaps your face right off your head. And it never gets any clearer. What little is explained in game is done so in maddeningly esoteric dialog, so instead the player must minimize the screen over and over and over to try and make sense of what the game is saying through other people. This is a tremendous weakness. It is said that this confusion is intentional, but that does not change the fact that consistently having to leave the game in order to understand it is an outright failure. I wouldn’t blame anyone for being discouraged from playing Dark Souls 3 due to its clunky, unintuitive nature, but I would strongly urge them to stick with it. Because once the online community helps make sense of the bullshit that the developers wrapped this game in, it is revealed to be a very enjoyable experience.It’s a 3D action RPG dungeon crawler reminiscent of the old school Castlevania series. It’s also deeply beautiful, with sprawling labyrinths of gothic architecture, and plenty of overlooks from which the player can gaze across a jungle of towers and crumbling stonework. The visual presentation is simply masterful, and enemies are no exception. There are so many variations, each with multiple attacks/abilities, and all of them well-crafted, whether curious, creative, or often downright unsettling. Though it seems with so much careful attention to visual detail there was less room for sound design. There is very little music in the game, most of it occurring during boss battles, and most of it entirely forgettable.Experience points are replaced with souls, which double as currency, and leveling up is as simple as spending an incrementally increasing amount of souls to improve a single stat point by one. Souls drop on death (along with all enemies respawning), but can be recovered should the player return to where they died, so long as they do not die again before collecting, in which case the souls are lost forever. In this way, every bit of progress feels fought for and earned, and the urge to explore is weighed against the caution of large numbers of souls; it is a very compelling balance. The ability to leave messages on the ground for other players allows for a sense of camaraderie as the player is warned against impending ambushes, or alerted to hidden treasure, and also empowers a group of spirited preteens to write, “try jumping,” at the edge of every fatal cliff.  The story is an absolute joke. There isn’t one, not in any real sense of the word. Narrative is delivered to the silent protagonist from the various NPCs in an awkward Shakespearian dialect, and so many of them speak in a disinterested monotone followed by disjointed laughter. Motivations are left in the dark, character development is nonexistent, and characterization is incredibly poor. Even after seeing the brief ending and watching all the others online, I could not tell you what’s going on in Dark Souls 3, and truthfully, no one can. It’s all just speculation, which again is said to be intentional on the part of the developers, and again, is an utter failure. But that’s ok; this game does not need story to function. It’s not about that so much as it is exploration and gameplay.Gameplay is hack and slash through and through. An arsenal of medieval weaponry, both practical and ridiculous, is lootable or purchasable, with competent design and upgrades allowing even weapons found early on to remain effective until the very end. While there are some clearly superior weapons, Dark Souls 3 seems to largely favor personal style over a narrow power progression. It is possible to specialize in magic as well, but while there are many useful defensive and utility spells, offensive spells often overlap in usefulness, if they are lucky enough to be useful at all. It is more likely that one or two spells found very early on will remain primarily used throughout the entire game, making magic much less varied and interesting than weapon focused builds. Defensively, players are able to block, parry, dodge, or rely on their armor. Blocking, which requires any shield, eats through stamina and will leave the player staggered without heavy investment in gear and stats, but is very reliable in terms of execution. Parrying, which requires specific shields or weapons, will stun an enemy, allowing for a powerful riposte attack, but has a very small window of execution, combined with the fact that attack timing is different, not only for every enemy, but for the multiple attacks available to each enemy, and not all enemies can be parried. Dodging is just free invincibility. It takes stamina, but can still be performed infinitely with no stamina left. It requires no specific equipment, nor stat investment, can reposition the player for flanking, and every attack can be dodged. Armor is… really more for looks than anything. Sure, there are different absorption values attached to different armors, but enemies hit so hard, always staggeringly hard, that being hit at all is not sensible. Just pick what makes you feel pretty and keep dodge rolling; it’s simply the superior defense.Bosses should get some special mention for Dark Souls 3. Many games today eschew traditional elements of boss battles, but Dark Souls embraces them. Bosses should be difficult; they should hit hard; they should be intimidating, preferably with multiple forms, and these bosses are all these things… if the game is played solo. It is fairly simple to play co-op with others online, or even NPCs, which utterly trivializes bosses. There’s no downside to playing with others; it’s just a way to completely strip the game of difficulty. But even when playing alone, the invisibility spell trivializes any non-boss encounter. Truthfully, I was disappointed with the ever proclaimed difficulty of this game. Having now beat it myself, I can’t help but sigh at all those mewling articles online demanding that Dark Souls 3 have any easy mode, when in fact it needed a hard mode."

Positive,"Dark Souls III is without a doubt the best entry in the trilogy of games. Dark Soul I and II are both bereft of problems and issues with quality that DSIII deftly escapes, leaving an incredible experience that rivals Bloodborne, one of the best games of the eighth generation of consoles. It's also a solid finale, with a good sense of closure that will stick with you.* PlotDark Souls III is much like it's predecessors in that it's vague. Little is explained to the player, forcing them to make logic connections between plot threads to reach answers. The enviroment itself tells a story, requring the player to make judgements based on what they see, hear and read. Item descriptions hide chunks of lore that explain everything from character identities and outfits to who they are and what they want. The plot itself is sparse, though some lategame revelations had me reeling. Overall, it's a good ending to the franchise, and i'm eagerly awaiting the DLC to wrap up some of the games' missing story threads. Dark Souls III's biggest problem in the story department, then, is that it refuses to stop jerking DSI off. The amount of references to Demons Souls, DSI and DSII feel incredibly awkward a lot of the time. Some are good, like characters being direct references to people in the first two games yet taking on new roles and personalities, and others are just pathetic ""praise the sun!!!!"" stuff. It takes you out of the experience when theres such a frequency of them, and it also feels like the creators aren't carefully referencing their other material as they are copying it. The tasteful Demons Souls references are a nice touch however, and show that FROM has not ignored their first game in this style.* DesignDark Souls III has some of the best designed levels in the series. It's challenging without ever feeling unfair, and I died a number of times due to my own incopotence. Levels loop back around on themselves, revealing shortcuts, hidden areas and more with rather incredible abandon. The game will hide stuff from you very easily, and will often reward your troubles with loot or something else. The secret areas of the game are VERY secretive, requiring a hell of a lot of patience and careful exploration to uncover them all. The enemies are also a challenge as well, and some of the tougher ones can require multiple tries until they're vanquished. Despite this good, Dark Souls III really feels like it holds your hand some times. The frequency in which there are bonfires feels incredibly patronizing at times, and the game never feels like it's really challenging you with the scarcity of them. It's rare that unlocking a shortcut feels good, but when it does it feels great. The game is also obviously unfinished once more. While not to the rather extreme extent of DSII, it is painfully obvious that this game couldn't fit everything it wanted in, and that the developers were running out of time. One example of this is the games runtime (20 hours), which is incredibly short compared to DSI and II, though this isn't a problem as the game never stops being good- even the hardest, most frustrating areas are much better paced and way more fun than the worst areas of DSI and II., meaning the game never drags through terrible areas like Blightown or the Undead Crypt. Another irritating thing is that many of the improvements from DSII, from online to gameplay, are completely removed, setting the legitimate evolution of PvP in DSII back a few steps. Magic has also been nerfed quite a bit, and I feel like it's become too costly to use. Melee seems to be the way to go, and it's sad to see that only a few playstyles can really work given DSI's incredible flexibility in this regard.*EDIT*After discussion with friends it's become apparent that this balance issue has gotten out of hand. Magic is still useless in comparison to swords, Pyromancy still needs heavy tuning, and slower weapons like greatswords are useless due to their average scaling, meaning they won't do as much DPS as a straight sword. However, none of this is as bad as the poise problem, which is such a glaring and horrible oversight. I won't discuss it here, but suffice to say that poise functions much different in this game than in the second and first, and it's a terrible substitute for the function in the first game. From needs to get their shit together and fix these issues because it's starting to become a serious, game hampering issue. Also PvP is hot fucking garbage, is super unbalanced, etc.* GameplayThe gameplay of DSIII is very much refined from the first two games. DSIII is faster, tougher and better than the first two games. Enemies are stronger and hit faster, requiring careful dodging and percise strikes. This makes for an incredibly tense experience in every single encounter, and makes the game incredibly fun against even the average mook. Bosses are better than ever, with some of the most creative and interesting fights in the series. Covenants are back and a lot of them are quite fun, with some classics from the first game returning gloriously, and the game allows you to switch them on the fly, going from glorious Sunbro to backstabbing Rosiarias Fingers in the matter of moments. This game also reintroduces the magic meter from Demons's Souls, but with an added twist- weapons can now perform special attacks which drain this bar. These moves can be anything from a guard-breaking upward swing to sending out a stream of fire, and they make each  normal, special, and boss-made weapon feel incredibly unique and add to the playstyle of that weapon. Now a sword and board user can be much more dangerous as he can easily break your guard, and spear users can become even deadlier with their horrificly long gap closing attacks, to say nothing of the incredibly cool and badass special attacks of the boss soul weapons. The gameplay is overall a massive improvement on DSII.* PresentationMusic is as usual fantastic and LOUD, though not to the height of Bloodborne- some tracks do come close, however, such as the amazing final boss theme ( DON'T LISTEN TO IT IF YOU HAVEN'T BEATEN THE GAME BECAUSE IT CONTAINS SPOILERS) The game also looks stellar, boasting the graphical improvements of Bloodbornes new engine to create some excellent locales. Many of the games locations look absolutely stunning, and contain some really excellent enviromental design. The game has a lot of technical issues, however, and whenever I entered a new area the game would horrifically stutter. I've also heard that the game has a lot of other techincal problems, so stay wary if you don't have a good PC. The game ran pretty well, and never dropped below 30 FPS for my game running on High, so just be careful.*OverallDSIII is an excellent conclusion to a great series, and I eagerly await the DLC in order to see what else FROM can squeeze in to what could be one of their strongest releases. Until they fix the problems with magic and builds, however, this will remain a flawed but fun game.8.1/10> Pros-Excellent design-beautiful world-fun, deep and satisfiying gameplay> Cons-patronizing design in many places-technical issues-many playstyles are bad, only a few can really carry you"

Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is the most polished Dark Souls game yet because it has obviously learned from the mistakes of Dark Souls 1 & 2. And yet Dark Souls 3 is also the least interesting Dark Souls game because there are few weird and strange enemy and encounters.  I love Dark Souls because you must defeat difficult enemy by learning the game and taking risks so you can be rewarded. Well, Dark Souls 3 doesn't have many super difficult enemy, most of the game is pretty similar and there very few interesting rewards. Unlike in Dark Souls 1 & 2, I wouldn't say playing online is recommended anymore. There is maybe two or three difficult bosses if you are offline only.  When you are playing online in ""ember"" form (aka human-form or unhollowed), you rarely get invaded and you can easily summon skilled players to be your allies so you can destroy any invader & boss. It's not interesting when you summon a Sunbro ally who defeats the boss while you watch. I would have to place my summon sign so I could help others defeat that boss a few times so I could feel some satisfaction from the boss fight. And as always, using a gamepad is strongly recommended.TL;DR Dark Souls is more Dark Souls and I cannot say I didn't enjoy Dark Souls 3 even though it is the least interesting Dark Souls game. For Dark Souls newbies I would recommend you try Dark Souls 2, maybe Dark Souls 1 if you want a challenge. And for Dark Souls Veterans:- The world is more open than DS2 (less linear)- Weapons are very balanced- convenant variety- offline friendly- very few rage inducing enemy- very few rage inducing enemy- the easiest Dark Souls game- the shortest Dark Souls game- The least variety of Bosses- there aren't any serious consequences to the covenants- All magic is mostly useless for damage until you have very high-level sorcery- Magic is far too slow for PvP- online friendly - a few connectivity improvements since DS2- The world isn't as open as DS1- Camera is still retarded"

Positive,"Excellent game so far. Difficult and fun. In contrast of some other reviews, I have had no issues with crashing, frame rate or other bugs....so far.As a reference, I am running DS3 at 2k resolution on an AMD GPU."
Positive,wow this game is hard but it's kind of cool how theyre just like ok so what it's hard its only hard cuz ur not used to it getused to it and then itseasy! wow just like real LIFE. DARKSOULS IS REAL LIFEexcept someimtes u stay dead when u die irl :(
Positive,"While this game is basically a giant fanservice pack, it's an undeniable improvement on the concepts that Dark Souls and Demon's Souls brought to the table.◘ Controls feel much smoother compared to DS1, and animations are more fluid and lifelike than DS2.◘ The reintroduction of mana-based casting allows for more flexible spells (but see below).◘ Weapon designs, while somewhat lacking in their special abilities, are very well done and the sheer variety of movesets rivals DS2's arsenal.◘ Lore for the setting is more focused, allowing the full story to be more easily parsed by players interested in understanding Lothric (albeit at the cost of some conflicting info).◘ NPC plots are very fleshed out, making it rewarding to play through their subplots. It does require a guide to finish all NPCs' subplots in a single playthrough though.◘ The soundtrack is incredible, with no bosses sharing a track (something the older games did).◘ System requirements are fairly low, allowing for easy streaming.◘ The game has a brutal sense of punishment.◘ Multiplayer is much smoother by comparison to older installments. As a special bonus they added the password system from Bloodborne to make co-oping much more tolerable (and removed Soul Memory).◘ The changes made to spellcasting enable a mindless playstyle in PvP, something DS2 handled slightly better.◘ Connection issues do still occur, particularly when you're not the host, and these issues have been in the game since launch.◘ Some serious bugs still exist, ranging from minor exploits (like quickly quitting out to prevent dying to gravity) to major problems (various out-of-bounds being used to ""cheat"" in PvP).◘ A plethora of enemies in this game have ""unfair"" mechanics. While these issues existed in older installments it's particularly pronounced in this game due to changes in the gameplay.◘ Nearly the entire game has no guidance, necessitating a wiki or walkthrough, which invites spoilers.◘ The reliance on fanservice can make this game feel very unwelcoming for new players.◘ Modders and Cheat Engine users can utterly ruin the game, as the anti-cheat in this game can hit their victims through no fault of the player (example: A modder can force PvP with a non-modder and just jump off of a cliff to flag the non-modder's account as a cheater due to details involving the XP system). The only fixes involve Family Sharing or keeping an abnormal amount of backups for your save data and reverting the save immediately after a modder shows up. Bandai Namco will reverse a ban, ONCE AND ONLY ONCE, provided you delete your character's save data.◘ This installment is largely more linear than older games. While there are optional areas the only honest sequence break is gated by a boss a majority of the game considered to be excessively difficult (and that boss is a late-game fight despite being available after clearing the tutorial).◘ Much like DS2, DS3 loves throwing a swarm of enemies at you all over the place. It isn't as egregious as 2, but there are honestly some areas that are just teeming with too many enemies.◘ PvP has less depth than DS2, and when you're not dealing with modders you're fighting a legion of gankers.I'm putting this here as a separate note: The DLCs are absolutely worth it. The story and fights they contain is almost on par with the Old Hunters DLC for Bloodborne, or the Shivering Isles for Oblivion. The base game os a solid experience on it's own but the DLCs together turn Dark Souls 3 into a genuine treat to play."
Positive,game is challenging enough and has so much fucking fan service and lore and then you have plin plin plon.need any other reason?
Positive,"not hard, play"
Positive,game got gud
Positive,i like the water
Positive,The most optimized dark souls game.
Positive,"This game is not a game. It's a challenge with a game around it. It's a fullfront balls to the walls death machine and it knows it. Your only saftey against the world is a sword, a shield, an estus, and rolling. You will cry, and rage, maybe even quit the game. But you'll come back, again and again, and before you know it, your in the final moments of the fight with the soul of cinder. And you hit the second phase. And when i hit this phase, i hadn't played any other souls game. But once i went back to the first, and then replayed this, the piano is almost exactly like qwens. That's a fucking incredible detail, and it goes to show the dark souls devs put a lot of care into the story around you. And if you quit this game, i got one thing to sayGetgud10/10 would get gud again"
Positive,"I have too many hours on this game....I also use a keyboard and mouse to play! Don't bite my ears off for it! D:LOVE this game!!- It's a tough game to get used to and if you don't take your time with it the first time you play through, you're going to die many more times than if you gave it the cautionary approach.- It's OK to look up how to defeat certain bosses, how to find certain hard-to-find npcs, and how to get all the Titanite Slabs in the game because they can be very easy to miss and you DO NOT want to miss them!- If you CAN'T beat a boss, summon a buddy or random player from the ground to help you out! Or go solo and learn the boss attack patterns; whatever suits your fancy :P- Dodging should be your primary way of not getting hit, shield is only used for last minute defenses and/or parrying if you can pull it off.- PVP will always be a thing that pops up! My suggestion there is to spend your souls on leveling up on your first playthrough; whenever you kill a boss or accumulate a large number of souls, port yourself back to the Shrine and spend them on leveling up and/or materials like enhancement mats or consumables (Can look up what you'll need most as you go through the game) Losing souls is always a bummer, but if you have no souls to lose, then it's whatever! :D- If you have a summoned person with you, you're more likely to get invaded by a RED PHANTOM so just keep that in mind. Also fighting red phantoms raises your battle prowess so I take it like an extra boss fight.- If you get invaded at a bad time, A GOOD STRATEGY is to run back to a bonfire area, rather than keep going ahead, that way if you die, you will respawn right next to your souls!! <3- This game is tough in beginning, so always assume you will have to rerun through the areas a few times, but it get easier as you play more!- I am NOT a pvp person, but I player so much PVP in this game!! Some players have an unwritten ""Code"" of respect and it can be really interesting when you meet those people. Just don't ASSUME every person you fight will follow that Code!- Block hackers who invade by going to your Steam's Recently played (with) Shift + TAB and it'll be on that screen, and block the guy who invaded (HINT: If they have less than 100 hours is a pretty good indicator that they didn't spend the time to ""Git Gud""!)- Heavy Armor is not always the best armor. I use Standard Knight's Armor for my late game pvp and I win the vast majority of my fights in it.- Stamina is great to focus on so you can get it to 25 or so when you first start out as it's how you do anything in the game!- Vitality is not worth investing in just so you can wear heavy armor!- This game in general needs to be taken in as a game you can't rush through- Take your time, plan ahead and you won't die as much, and WHEN you die, the impact will not be so bad!- Enjoy Dark Souls! Hope to see you out there!"
Positive,Hope my thanksgiving rolls are as good as this game's rolls. roll
Positive,"To be honest this game is far too easy, there really just isn't any challenge.Not a good spiritual successor to Candy Crush."
Positive,"Remarkable level design, except the annoying lava pools that don't have anything to do with logic.Did I mention the insane level design?"
Positive,Door does not open from this side. 10/10
Positive,"IN my opinion, better in every aspect than Dark Souls 2 and an improvement of the awesomeness of Dark Souls 1 with a plus, bloodborne engine."
Positive,"Another great souls game, thank you BAMCO"
Positive,"I definitely played this game too late, and I should have been interested in it a long time ago. It's a great game that has strengthened my passion for Souls-like games!"
Positive,Got this as a gift from a friend. Really damn annoying that I can't play with him without some random try hard invading every five minutes and killing me as well as him. A game can be hard without being unecessarily tedious and annoying. If you're not looking to play with a friend/online then this games pretty great.
Positive,"I'm not a huge fan of the Souls games. I can't say that I've played any of them to completion, or that I know how anything really works. However, I love Dark Souls III compared to the original and II. The combat feels faster, but not too much so. The addition of passwords for Summon Signs make this game a more co-op friendly experience, and that's great! The environments are pretty cool, the graphics are nice, and the game is well optimized."
Positive,"From what I have seen and heard of this game (Regrettably quite a bit) This game is up to standards with the previous installments with a compelling sense of discovery and unique feel to it i have only experienced with the souls games.Dark souls is one of, if not my favourite series. Naturally I was devistated to find the third addition to the souls games to be unplayable. The frame rate is appalling even with low graphics specs. If 16Gb of ram, 2Gb AMD graphics card, Windows 10(64bit), i5 Core processer (quad core) isnt enough, I dont know what is. This is a personal expirience, many other people are able to play with no problems even with lower specs. I do not wish to deter people from this game, I simple want to give people some warning and hope they are not as unfortunate."
Positive,no way.... the game is getting more popular recently and deluxe edition sale is now 2x more expensive than i got it for.. wow. demand and supply is real...
Positive,i punched my monitor
Positive,"The lore, the gameplay, the characters, it's all so fascinating!!!"
Positive,still here... hand it over. that thing your dark soul
Positive,very challenging. much atmospheric. AAA/10.
Positive,While this is the third game in the dark souls series i believe it is a good place for new players to start getting into the series. Also great for long time players who can enjoy the many easter eggs and references to previous games as well as seeing the continuation of the souls series.
Positive,"Ya know, I'm not sure I understand the hate and dislike about this game ""It ♥♥♥♥ed up the lore"" There was lore in dark souls? I mean there is lore but its not heavy lore like the kind seen in fallout and minecraft.I throughly enjoyed this game and exploring everything it had to offer, while it did lack some things from the previous dark souls such as the lonesome feeling you get when wandering the barren wasteland it makes up for with stunning visuals.This game may not be the master piece everybody wanted, but I liked it. And to me thats honestly all that matters"
Positive,"Where do I begin, where do I begin..Dark Souls III: a game that has dramatically changed my life more times than my friends have dramatically changed their Discord pfps. Alas, it all began on a fai, ever since my friend steam-shared it with me a couple years ago. I had obviously heard of the game for its notorious difficulty, but I had never considered playing it, EVER. I was a filthy League of Legends player (and still am, kind of) who had only played a couple Pokemon and Mario games (and Minecraft :D) prior. Why would I ever consider playing a Dark Fantasy Action-RPG like Dark Souls III? Well, apparently it's predecessor was hailed as one of the greatest games ever made, and this one was similar, except up-to-date and faster. Soooooooooo I tried it, and WOW! Frankly, I'd never gotten my ass handed to me like DS3 had, let alone by a video game. I gave up soon after, like I did whenever losing a bunch of ranked games on LoL. What's the point? Where's the fun in this? What kind of insane person purchases a video game only to be severely demoralized by said game minutes later?A few weeks passed. I was bored, and didn't have anything better to do, so let's play DS3 again, why not! After a 132849378298213253 ""YOU DIED""s, I came to the conclusion that this game simply wasn't for me. It wasn't made for a player like me. Ok, one last try, just one more . . . Wait . . . Did I actually just kill that? Wait, WTF, I actually did it omg. How tf . . . Uhhhhhhhhh . . .That was amazing. Ultimately, it was that feeling of beating that enemy/boss/area after hours/days of hard work that had me keep playing. And from then on, I became a Dark Souls Fanboy :D. Ok, the end, go ahead and read reviews that actually CRITIQUE the game on its story/gameplay/depth/etc . . . TL;DR Just buy the game; don't give up; PRAISE THE SUN !"
Positive,"Hands down the best one in the series, everything about this game is great, mechanics are really fun, combat feels great.This game is a must play."
Positive,"A fun and fair game, unless you are invading."
Positive,You can clap.

Positive,YOU DIED .
Positive,An amazing masterpiece that i always end up going back to play. because it's that good. never gets old. i love this game from the bottom of my heart
Positive,I have been squading up with some irl friends and I have been having the most fun in a game I have in a long time. It is just really fun to chill with your dawgs in a call and take down some bosses. I am also playing on mouse and keyboard too. Controllers be damned! FYI if you play on mouse and keyboard for some reason the sensitivity is super high. IDK if that is the game my dpi (1600) or raw accel which I use for cringe FPS games. buy this for fun times solo or with friends.
Positive,"This game is so engaging, fun and frustrating at the same tame. It makes you fail, learn on your mistakes and comeback again and again. I'm in love with the the combat system, visual and overal style of it, it's beautiful 10/10. Possibly the best game I ever played. (Beat it to 100%, worth every minute)"
Positive,"This game is something...else. I was always interested in the series b/c of the artwork and cool looking bosses. But it took me years to finally buy and play it. Yepp...this game teaches you to stay aware. Just buttonmashing will kill you.Since it was my first game of this genre it took me several hours to just survive long enough to reach the next boss. Yes, the game is very hard, yet very rewarding when you finally beat that ()/!""§)! guy, because you finally found out how to fight him.A couple of hours later I am finally a bit more brave in encounters. Feels so good to realize you are actually improving...Dark Souls 3 offers a quite linear world to explore, beautiful sceneries - handcrafted with love and melancholy. Also many little, missable details about former games which lift ""environmental storytelling"" to new heights. But most things will be kept cryptic. Same goes for the lore. But luckily there are quite some cool content creators who explain the stuff on YT.So how to rate this game? Almost as difficult as the game itself, haha.On the one side, the level and enemy design (especially bosses) are a rare sort, since you really feel Fromsoft put a lot of thought and care into it. Underlined with some exceptional, classic pieces of music.On the other hand....the inventory management can &""§/( my socks. Like really...that needs improvement for sure!It's frustrating sometimes...but fair. The enemies do punish wrong behaviour hard, but each type has a weakness you can exploit. Same for bosses...mostly.Even when you jump into the two DLCs the quality of design never falls off...it rather becomes even better and better.Who shall play it? People who like a challenge. People who appreciate thoughtful design. People like me who are stubborn and don't mind dying...Once the game gets you...you will see other games with different eyes. It's more than a game - an experience!Surely it has some minor flaws but it's still in my all time top 5 in my 30 years of playing various and plenty types of games.Bonus: the mod creators are insane in a very positive way. You can dump many hours of gameplay to explore them.Dark Souls III is more than a game. It's a feeling. A challenge. A teacher and a storyteller (without telling a story). And maybe even your dad...who knows..."

This Game is challenging and not for the faint of heart, It will definitely without a doubt make you mad a few times but that crave to want to complete whatever part you're on or the need to find out whats next will always keep you coming back for more. I cant even tell you how many times I've started this game over after completing it and i still love it as if it were my first time every run I play. Of course you have to play it for yourself to see why i sound like a high school girl who was just asked to prom lol. I simply love this game it will always and forever be my go to game."

Positive,This game is an all time classic game. I have played it for quite a few years and always enjoy the experience.
Positive,"got gud, beat game, 10/10"
Positive,"Dark Souls III is in my opinion the best out of the trilogy. Very nice graphics,tough boss fights and,compared to the other ones,nice gameplay and actually feels very good with no delay (which was a big problem in DS I + DS II imo). I recommend playing this game if you're into hard games! (You can also smash bosses with your friends which is a nice feature but I wouldn't recommend that because the fights get pretty easy by summoning others and that neutralizes the idea of the game)"
Positive,"My first Dark Souls game and it wont be the last of them I'll play.This game is frustrating at first but you get the hang of it when you get further in, so dont quit when the goings rough.You will die, its a mechanic of the game. So far I am having alot of fun playing and I suggest that you should pick it up for a couple reasons.1. Magic and melee are both fluent and fun to play with their own playstyles to master giving a sense of replayibility.2. Awe inspiring bosses and the lore around them make it a epic experience. 3. Cool graphics.4. Various ways of PVP (even if sometimes clunky) in the forms of duels and or invasions.5.  Playing with friends is always fun too.6. THE MUSIC. THE MUSIC. THE MUSIC!My only complaint is that there is a large learning curve when it comes to playing the game and or understanding stats. It might just be me still being kind of new but some of the stat calcs go over my head.In conclusion this game is a masterpiece and is worth a buy. Just be Prepared To Die."
Positive,"We all remember the sunny Anor Londo of 2011 and the Shrine of Amana of 2014. And we're glad and sad they're gone.But now...DARK SOULS 3What features it got b****?Great graphics.

Positive,"Wow, just wow.This game is just one of the best singleplayer games i've played in a long time. The combat, the scenery and the lore.Only complaint i'd have would be in the combat, for the kick is w+m1 (or forward+light attack)So happy my friend gave it to me, but i felt guilty so bought the Season Pass."
Positive,Could this be a fun?Praise the developer!
Positive,I died 7 times before the game finished downloading. 10/10

Positive,"Slash, Die, Run, Die. Repeat."
Positive,"I have never played anything like this.  I picked this game up a souls newbie.  After my first playthrough i have to admin I was missing out.  The game had been hyped up for a long time by my friends who were seasoned veterns of the Franchise, and when it arrived it lived up to the hype for new players  like me and my friends.  The game and gameplay are fluid and work well.  There is a wide varity of movesets and lots of bosses and enemies to kill and explore.  every area feels like a whole new experience and this Dark Souls experience has been one of my new favorite gaming Experience! The Pros and Cons is below.-It is challenging and rewarding-Unique variaty of weapons and armor-A player based story with a few possible endings-Replayablility with the New game system (Will Update review upon completion of NG+ and NG++)-Multiplayer is fast to sync and fun with up to 8 people at once (Normally 2-3) in your world.-Framerate and graphics are spot on for what i would expect.  Some people one the forums are complaining but most of my friends and I have not had too many issues with this area of the game.  Each area definitly gives off its own unique experience with lighting and backdrops.-The Invading System can be fun, but is also annoying when you are constantly invaded over the span of a few minutes.  When you start an area, and die, or reset at a bonfire, it leaves an oppertunity to be invaded again in the same area, and it can be frustrating dealing with the same area and getting stuck by invaders.-The Ban waves of the game are insane.  I have seen people get banned before even getting to the title screen, and getting banned for no reason other then some drivers for controllers or anything out of the normal.  Seriously please fix this.-Minor Spoiler The last boss is not the hardest by far, its sad in my opinion that an optional boss is harder then the final boss (even looking at global stats you can see less beat the Nameless King or Lord of Cinder)Overall I think the game is very fun and worth the money paid for and especially excited for the DLC to come out.  I will update this review periodically.  As someone who has only played Dark Souls 3, i recomend this for casual gamers and even if you rage you can enjoy the gameplay and learning from your experience makes all the rage worth it in the end.Praise the Sun!"
Positive,"Such a great game, one of the few capable of leaving you speachless. Before i bought this i had never had any experience with this type of genre, and i didn't really like it either. However after buying this and playing though, killing some of the most badass bosses and using some badass weapons, i regret not purchasing this earlier. This game deserves every penny given to its creators and everyone thats supports it. Please buy this game, but note u need tough patients and great skill."
Positive,"After peeking under the Master's tattered loincloth, I have decided that this is indeed a masterpiece."
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is one of my all time favorite games. If you're up for the challenge, you'd be stupid not to play it."
Positive,Thank you dark souls.
Positive,"I thought it would be an easy game before I started it, since I had 80+ hours of experience in Dark Souls 1. I WAS WRONG. Suprise attacks and tough enemies still got me in the 1st playthough, but overall I would appreciate the producers for maintaining such high standards(difficulty) for a Souls game. You won't feel the estasy of slaying of boss before you died a thousand times on your way to the fog wall. I really appreciate the idea that there are more bonefires(checkpoints) now, however, it is still kind of painful to travel back to firelink shrine to level up when you have plenty of souls. Only one thing to notice, PVP of this game sucks. The invasion always happens when you don't want it. However, I believe co-op is fine, as a pain-reliever for new players."
Positive,I got this game thinking. what am i doing? i know im going to dislike it with all the enemies and how difficult it is.   but soon after i started playing i couldnt stop playing it. i currently have 78 hours and i bought it within the week. it has by far been one of my favourite games now because of all it has in it. all the enemies you can defeat and the enviornment you can discover.(THIS IS HAS NOW BEEN FIXED) UPDATE: The developers recently shutdown the servers while they try to fix a malicious bug within the games netcode.A large company such as Fromsoft shouldve had this fixed by now since its been a month and a half. So largely they have shutdown the servers and have removed most of the replay value in this game whittling down the community. Its likely that they havent fixed the issue yet because they want sales on their newest title but this is still inexcusable. Until this issue is fixed i will be changing my review from Positive to Negative as this is a complete rip off.
Positive,One of 3 the best games I've ever played
Positive,"The Dark Swoles Experience.For every death, do 10 push-ups.Git Gud or Get Ripped."
Positive,Your objective is to murder the 4 casuals who were too lazy to light the fire again.
Positive,PLAY THIS GAME NOW
Positive,"This is without a doubt the best souls game in the series. Not to say that the other games don't have some better aspects, but Dark Souls 3 takes the cake. There is a small problem with hackers in PvP, but nothing too serious, I have over 800 hours logged and have only had a handful of hackers invade my world. I can't say enough good things about this game. The graphics are on point, the gameplay is immersive and exciting and the difficulty is challenging but fair. I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone."
Positive,"As a relative neophyte of the series, Dark Souls 3 feels like the most accessible episode of the series. Gone is the shrinking health bar of DS2, gone are the non replenishing consumables of Bloodborne and the bosses' health pool seems to have been lowered a lot.Unfortunately, i felt like a lot of the areas were too small, and shortcuts too frequent, and the overall result was a diminished feeling of challenge, and with it satisfaction. Oh, and some ""look at me i'm so old-school"" mechanics that should just die are still there, such as unmarked phantom walls that you will need a guide to spot.That being said, Darks Souls 3 remains a great experience, with the variety of approaches that you can take at every challenge set before you, the great level and enemy design and, finally, visuals that live up to their name.+ Traditionally great level and enemy design+ Solid skills, weapons and armor balancement+ Fast paced, enjoyable combat+ The most accessible Souls+ Stable framerate and great graphics- No 21:9 support (Fixed by my man Kaldaien)- Lack of challenge for veterans- Too much missable content without a guide- Repetitive environments (Thank you DLCs)4/5"
Positive,"I never played Demon Souls and didn't like the orignial Dark Souls when I played it on xbox. I tried Dark Souls 2 about two years ago and wasn't really enjoying myself. I gave up on the series, not understanding what everyone loved about these games. I felt lost and confused and when I would look online for help I was told to just 'get gud.' A few weeks ago my friends started going on a DS bindge, eagarly awaiting the remaster. On a whim I decided to join them and I'm so glad that I did. This game struck a cord with me that hasn't been stuck since The Witcher 3. I sank around 80 hours into this game in two weeks. In my personal opinion if you're not sure about dark souls this is the game you should start with."
Positive,"DARK SOULS™ III, in my opinion, it is probably the best and challenging rpg I've played in 2016-2017.Pros: It's a challenging game with a very interesting and deep lore.The game has a very rewarding combat and loot system that is easy to understand and learn.It is very pretty both visually and audibly.It's a long game so you'll have much to do and learn.Cons: It's not as challenging as the first games.It is very directing so you don't get to explore thet much.Can be grindy sometimes.If you summon another player for a boss (there is summonig system in the game that lets you summon other players) it can get very easy and not as hectic and much less of a challenge than if you played it yourself.Despite the cons that I mentioned It is a really great game and I can tottaly recommend it!9.7/10Melun Approves"
Positive,"To me the sleekest Souls experience on PC and some of the best value for money I have gotten, even if I did have to buy a controller just for Dark Souls."
Positive,"This game is awesome. When you killed a boss, you will be satisfied for certain."
Positive,"The game itself is phenomenal even with some of the cheap tricks a lot of enemies pull, plenty of trial and error but souls at the later stage are a huge grind to farm if you want to invest in long term builds to carry you into new game +. The gameplay is smooth and so fluid, the boss movesets really do characterise them as people as well and often times you'll find yourself surprised by any new moves they pull out when they're desperate. It provides layers to boss encounters that feel like either some have an ace up their sleeve or others use their basic moves but in combinations that both make sense but also bump up the fight difficulty. It is unfortunate that the game still has restrictions on random players joining based on level because for people living in regions far from the game's servers hoping someone finds your summon sign is common if you want to repeat bosses. Especially since there is a system in place to scale down player levels to the host's level. Regardless most of the game I experienced alone, and a good amount of sections and bosses I tried to finish with friends and randoms to experience what co-op was like and farm sun medals and the community is fun if you actively avoid elitists. Invasions as a system is still the same, still constant, but I've barely encountered any cheaters. Thanks to the invaders who've given me free items before fighting me though. <3As someone who builds for strength and to be somewhat tanky I'm still pretty sad that shields aren't all that useful for blocking, more reliable to dodge but some have their handy passive quirks so it isn't so bad."
Positive,"Great combat tarnished by uninspired, overly grimdark art direction and some really stupid retroactive changes to the lore of the first game."
Positive,"From Software always does the same thing over and over again but they do it so fucking well god damn.Dark Souls III in particular is a very polished experience, a great conclusion to the series with incredible designs, music and boss fights."
Positive,"the game is phenomenal, great difficulty. the online services were down but now they're back!i originally written a review saying that if you wanted to play the multiplayer for this game, it was unavailable because of an RCE (remote code execution) exploit and elden ring during the time. but they're back now so i'll just say straight up, get this gem of a game, it's really fun and challenging and will make you a man"
Positive,I love my swamp
Positive,"Protagonist is so afraid of darkness, he kills everything he see to light another bonfire."
Positive,"This game is truly gruesome and a true test to ones ability to overcome setbacks!Perseverance is king! Best RPG 2016? Possibly even best game 2016? :-)This was my first real playthrough of a Dark Souls game and i realy loved it!Just finished my first run after about 40h of play time, and cant wait to get in to NG+!Not a whole lot of story driven RPG games makes you whant to instantly replay them, atleast not from my experience. There´s so much to do and so many choices to make, choices that affect the main and side story of the game and its characters in ways i dont know yet. This makes me whant to get right back in to it!The level design is superb and its fun exploring al the nooks and crannies in the search for hidden goodies! Visually the game looks extremely good and sometimes i spent several minutes just looking at the scenery.The fact that the game wont ""hold your hand"" is also refreshing to me. No quest loggs or minimaps to guide you in the right direction. You have to explore and listen to the dialogue from the NPC´s to figure out where to go next.I hope to get some friends to play the game aswell so we can do a full co-op playthrough. I think that would give the game a whole new dimension where you can build your character in ways that wouldn´t be possible for a solo run (100% Bow focus for example?). We will see.... :-)And i haven´t even started to test the PVP-side of the game, apart from afew invasions from other players.The variety of builds and the overwhelming amount of gear to try out is also a real treat!10/10 Will definitely play again!"
Positive,may The flame guide thee
Positive,"I can't actually play the gme BECAUSE I PLAY ON A FUCKING SHIT ASS LAPTOP, but I actually have about 100,000 hours of this game on the playstation so I actually do kind of like it"
Positive,"Game is fantastic, it really is what we were expecting from this 3rd chapter of Dark Souls but sadly, this year like the last one for us pc gamers, many and many games were terribly ported or poorly optimized and Dark Souls 3 isn't an exception, altough it runs smoothly me and many other players occured into many game crashes, driver crashes and pc hard freezings. You may say (at the time of writing) that i only have 1.8 hrs of gameplay but in this little time i crashed 3 times. Sadly i strongly recommend waiting until everything will be fixed. Other than that i can only say positive things about the game.1# Review update: i found temporary solution which 100% works and i've been playing 5 hours without crashing, turn off anti aliasing, msaa, shadows and set lighting to low and play windowed, everything else you can keep it on high/ultra."
Positive,try fingerbut hole
Positive,"Getting a bunch of display driver crashes, but that will most likely be fixed in due time. Otherwise great for any dark souls fan, or anyone for that matter."
Positive,Loving the game. I just made it to the title screen
Positive,cool game very anime
Positive,Tbh better than elden ring?
Positive,"I think it has some of a the best bosses period, the fast paced and fluid combat compliments them very much. Another thing that elevates the boss fights is the boss music, there are so many masterpieces within this one game it's actually insane.As for the areas, which is my favorite part about Souls games (bosses being a close second), most of the areas are very unenjoyable to traverse like Farron Keep, Cathedral of the Deep, & Irrithyl Dungeon for ex. Now the game does have a few areas I LOVED like Irrithyl Valley, Ringed City, High Wall Lothric, & Anor Londo. It was so cool revisiting places like Anor Londo or going down to the Smoldering Lake and seeing Capra Demon and Stray Demon carcasses, I was so happy to see all the callbacks to DS1 and even DS2.That pretty much sums up my feelings for DS3, I have no problems other than a lot of the areas.  9.5/10 | My fourth favorite Fromsoft game following Elden Ring, Sekiro, and Dark Souls 1."
Positive,"It starts out rather slow, but quickly becomes clear that there are so many different combinations of items, gear, stat-types, and exceptional mapping which varies the way you can play.The player interaction system is one that 'should' have been implemented in previous free-roaming games, but never was. Player messages, pvp and co-op is available, ranging from invasions to helpful players, and without it the game would have little replayability or retention value once completing it.It's pretty extensive as well as original. The DS mappers have always made amazing 3d environments that have unique architectures not generally seen elsewhere, which can make for a good playthrough even if you disable online mode."
Positive,"First and might be the last Souls game I play, but I am interested in playing the other games now I got so mad at this game that I literally broke my headphones in half and broke my controller cable when I slammed my controller on the ground......But it was all worth it in the endFinishing Dark Souls 3 felt like an accomplishment rather that me having an empty feeling when I finished a game that didnt challenge me.The game made me mad but a challenge was what I was looking for the whole time, because that feeling of overcoming something that was so against you released a surge of dopamine that felt so good I finally know what it means to praise the sun ( and the lord, since Im christian)You will die again and again and again and again, only to come back and evetually succeed......and then get your ass handed to you again once or 100 times more.Get this game? Only if youre a person whos into  games with many mechanics to fidget with.....I got introduced to this game through the Dragon Age games since the weapon upgrades were equally as important and survival depended on top notch management of your gear of you and your party. Be prepared to experiment as when something doesnt work youll have to be adaptable enough to use everything the game gives you at your disposal at that given moment.Most importantly, Dark Souls is not hard as long as you realize that you are suppose to fail to figure out what works and what doesnt. Once you get that through your head, youll have alot of fun actually instead of frustration."
Positive,"Amazing game, though I still have a soft spot for dark souls 1. Champion Gundyr best bossScrew you MidirI dont like that I have to kneel to a blondie for level up everytime smh.Game was 10x better screensharing to friends.If you like invading people in farron keep or catacombs and such you are EVIL :(I miss onion man already."
Positive,this game sucks
Positive,"-Extremely difficult.-Died +1000 times, if not more.-Rage quit more times that I could count.-Confusing Story-Uninstalled the game...-Reinstalled the Game...-Got Gud-Game is a Masterpiece.Score: 1000/10"
Positive,"Fun game.But!It has two major downsides that ruin the experience.Camera movement is just idiotic and is mostly the reason for ending up dead so often.And being dead so often is made worse by the stupid respawn method used by this game. Every time you die you are spawned near the bonfire, health is full but all enemies are back and you need to go all over the same trouble again, as many times as you die. And you tend to die a lot.So you end up spending too much time playing same battles and fighting same enemies. Gets frustrating and boring very quickly."
Positive,"Type: Single Player/Multiplayer Real-time Third Person Action RPG.+ Great level design, art direction and lore elements sprinkled throughout the world.+ Vast array of weapons and Armor to choose from, allowing for a wide range of playstyles.+ Challenging, but fair.+ Considerable variance in boss, enemy and character designs.+ An eerily grievous atmosphere.+ A bombastically fantastic soundtrack. + Infinitely replayable.+ Tight controls and faster combat than it's predecessors.- Poor camera controls if using a KBM setup.- Some RPG elements largely feel redundant compared to it's predecessors. - Some odd decisions concerning spell/miracle/pyromancy scaling.- Even to the adept, most of the bosses won't pose much of a challenge.- Netcode issues can lead to problems during online play.- Some areas feel incomplete/rushed.- Some environments feel a tad too familiar to each other.- Odd combat redesign choices by the devs (i.e. Poise, backstepping is literally useless, KEEP ROLLING ROLLING ROLLING etc)Get this if you enjoyed: DARK SOULS: Prepare To Die Edition; Nier: Automata; Hyper Light Drifter; The Witcher Series; Bloodborne; Lords of the Fallen.Far from a perfect game, Dark Souls III feels like what Dark Souls II should have been. This is in some ways the most refined Souls game, but falls short of hitting greatness due to a few missteps. This game plays it safe, but will appease both newcomers and veterans of the Soulsborne series. Buy it."
Positive,the milk truck
Positive,"Dark Souls is like a sneeze that just won’t come out. You know it won’t come out but you keep on trying anyways. And, when it does come out you feel so much better"
Positive,THE ONLY BUILD YOU SHOULD DO IS A FATTY BUILD AND PUNCH EVERYTHING WITH YOUR HANDS LIKE A MAN CAW CAW
Positive,The dark souls of dark souls of dark souls
Positive,Still my favourite FromSoft game.
Positive,expensive for 2024
Positive,"The souls series was  just breathe taking, the feeling you get after beating a boss or getting through  a tough area is just so rewarding. Though out my many characters I learned there is more to these games than the difficulty. There is mysterious lore and many fantastical themes within them. But if you want a very polished Dark Souls game then this is the one. Don't knock the other games though because they are just as amazing."
Positive,Took me a literal hour to beat the first boss and I get worried about the bosses everyone says are super difficult.*Beats Crystal Sage 1st try EZ*10/10; people will never believe me again.Edit: Also found all bone shards in my 1st playthrough :D
Positive,"peak souls experience. I would say this is the best souls game in terms of how consistently great it is. the bosses, world, lore dlc, etc. there are little to no faults in this game and i highly recommend this game to newcomers and people who havent played this game already."
Positive,"its not that hard ,and is pretty fun"
Positive,this game is very relaxing!
Positive,visions of geometry dash...
Positive,awsom gam wanna kill mi self
Positive,"Playing on PC, the game is extremely difficult for me, but starting to play it on my Steam Deck I began to swallow the game on the fly. I don't know why, but playing this game on this device is much better. I finally started playing games that I had long ago abandoned for whatever reason. The game is challenging and addictive at the same time. Difficult in terms of gameplay and some of the bosses, but addictive in its atmosphere"
Positive,"One of the best games I've ever played, and one that taught me about perseverance and never stopping the fight. The atmosphere is nothing short of amazing, and the variety in the areas is amazing. The later areas in the game are incredibly diverse and beautiful, and this extends to the DLCs. The exploration is risky but rewarding and the hidden areas are concealing everything, from embers to bosses. Speaking of which, bosses are the highlight of this game. Hard, unforgiving but almost always fair. With the exception of very few, most of them are good, some are great and a handful are genuinely the most amazing fights I've had in a game. Tons of fun and frustration, very replayable especially if you respec and change your build and a weapon and armor to fit every taste. If you're not afraid of dying, respawning and fighting again, then the game is for you. May the flames guide thee!"
Positive,"I initially had a hard time getting into the Dark Souls series, specifically when I tried the first game on PC. However, when my friends suggested we all play Dark Souls III together, I reluctantly agreed, and I'm so glad I did.Dark Souls III boasts gorgeous environments that create an immersive and atmospheric experience. The game's stunning visuals and art direction will leave you in awe as you traverse its diverse and detailed landscapes. Each boss encounter is uniquely designed and offers a challenging yet rewarding experience that pushes your skills to the limit.The game's tight controls make every movement feel responsive and precise, ensuring that you are in full command of your character. This precision is essential for navigating the game's unforgiving world and engaging in its intense combat encounters.Dark Souls III is a true masterpiece. If you've been hesitant to try the Dark Souls series, I highly recommend giving this third installment a chance – you might just find yourself hooked!"
Positive,"has a boring and limited early game compared to the previous two entries but my issues with it end there. love this game to death and always will. hell, i think i'm one of the only people on the planet who thinks this game has (or maybe had) better pvp than dark souls 2 (and elden ring but duh). was worth skipping school to play the midnight release back in the day.love you, dark souls. was a fun run. you meant a lot to me."
Positive,y is this still 60 dollar after 6 years???
Positive,This happened to my buddy John
Positive,goat game goat game
Positive,+ You can praise the sun- storytelling and ending sucks
Positive,لذيذ ويأكل بالمعلقه
Positive,"Great game. BUT, BUT is filled with hackers, so never play online sadly always play offline so low life scum cant fuck with you. you can enjoy one the best games ever made by yourself."
Positive,"This game is actually amazing there are a few bosses in this game that will make you rip all your hair follicles out tho. Not b/c they are hard but rather very annoying I'm looking at you Midir. Those bosses luckily are very much so overshadowed by the amazing bosses, nearly all the lords of cinder are amazing fights most notable would be the Abyss watchers and the Lothric Princes both amazing fights sound track, play style, and visuals wise. A challenge but not so impossible you give up. So good they are memorable and will definitely stick out when someone ask me about this game. Another amazing yet sad thing about this game is the NPCs somehow these goofy guys who have 0 meaning to me in real life have so much emotion behind them especially Siegward I love my little onion boi. I played this game with a friend the whole way through and god was this a memorable and enjoyable experience. I would do anything to play this games main story for the first time with that person again tbh. Overall I know this is controversial and I know some losers are gonna throw a fit about this but I have enjoyed this game so much more than I did Elden Ring. The pvp on this game is more enjoyable, the map design is much less overwhelming keeping your want to play at a high, the visuals are on par with Elden Ring in every aspect, and the music is so much better. I definitely recommend this game for full price."
Positive,I don't like this game
Positive,good uhhhh game patches can eat a dick and elden ring isnt real see you in february
Positive,"The most active PVP and yet it's actual stinky garbo, sonic the hedgehog lookin dudes just rolling away from everything like lord im not tryna play mirrors edge"
Positive,Good Game. With or without friends
Positive,"dark souls 3 is good,"
Positive,is good man
Positive,The menu music is good and the fire keeper is hot
Positive,too hard Asylum Demon too hard no beat it. game dumb
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 was my first experience with the series and I bought it this past December on the steam holiday sale, DLC included.I read a few user reviews and decided to finally give it a shot after hearing about it all these years. It didn't disappoint. The game provides a very deep sense of satisfaction for me, something I haven't experienced with video games in a very long time. Getting through a boss after hours of trying or reaching the next bonfire made me feel incredible. It reminds me of those old hard as hell platformers like Castlevania. The delay in attacking is reminiscent of the whip mechanics in Castlevania as well. I was also captivated by how depressingly beautifully the game itself was. The environments, the enemies, the bosses, the music, the story. It all just really clicked for me. It also did something many other video games haven't made me do, which is be extra considerate of my decisions. Don't get too greedy with attacking, know when to dodge/parry, read the enemy's movements carefully, etc. You can't just brute force your way through it. I consider playing the game a form of meditation. Gives me time to reflect on my life and the people I've met along the way."
Positive,"Thanks to Dark Souls 3, all other games now dropped 3 review points."
Positive,My character looks like the spawn of satan.
Positive,"Hand it over, that thing, your steam wallet cash"
Positive,"easy, Bloodborne better tho"
Positive,"This game is a religious experience. Not for the casual gamer. Your patience, your mental fortitude and your will as a man will be put on trial during this play through. A game for a true masochist."
Positive,fun game very easy and beginner friendly
Positive,"Give me a bigger challenge next time, this game is easier then New Super Mario Bros on the DS smh."
Positive,Just. Don't. Give. Up..This game is wholesome and I truely believe that community has higher IQ than normal people. Try it but don't forget the first sentence of this review. Visuals and music are pure art. It has a variety of weapons and some of them are from previous souls games which will bring you tears of nostalgia. Enjoy and never give up.
Positive,very nice 10/10
Positive,rather kill a boss twice than jump on that god damn tree
Positive,hard af. but fun
Positive,Brazil the game.
Positive,"A casual, family friendly fun for the whole family!"
Positive,"Ahh, $λit here we go again..."
Positive,gam is gud
Positive,"Best Get Good game out there, lot of customization available"
Positive,"This is my first darksouls game and i can recomend it to anyone looking for challenge and a test of patience,the bosses are awsome and many pretty places to look at :D"
Positive,"I loved both DS1 and DS2, and DS3 is a nice evolution of the series."
Positive,"Fantastic follow up to DS2, I was a little late to the party but can highly recommend it."
Positive,"Very good game, yaes. 10/10 Big Bonk Weapons only"
Positive,make frown turn upside down
Positive,"I love the challenge and difficulty of this game. Nothing will ever beat the feeling you get after spending hours trying to beat a boss or get through an area like this game does. Thank you Miyazaki for delivering a final farewell to an amazing trilogy. I know you didn't have a hand in DS2 but you incorporated some elements of that into this to really make it feel like a genuine part of the Dark Souls universe. I have nothing but praise for this game. I hope anyone who reads this finds it helpful and that you shall engage in some Jolly cooperation! Also, Blessing of the Moon upon your journey."
Positive,"The First Flame quickly fades. Darkness will shortly settle. But one day, tiny flames will dance across the darkness. Like embers, linked by lords past.Ashen one, hearest thou my voice, still?♥"
Positive,It's Dark Souls Can't Go Wrong. Easily One Of The Best Games I've Played
Positive,It is a good game I had like 200+ hours on it on xbox cool beans
Positive,"Get ready to fuck Dmeons of the Deep up. If you play with Aldritch The faitfuls possy your scum. Enjoy with friends as well. IM SORRY pebble stone, most important to throw enemies graves. Much Shame to him and his Kin."
Positive,Fun to play but can be very difficult if not prepared well enough
Positive,after having played the first 2 games in not sure where people got the idea that this game is easier
Positive,"I'm a huge fan of the Souls series, and I purchased this soon after its release but for one reason or another, I never bothered touching it until roughly a month ago...Dark Souls 3 was a bittersweet experience for me. As I journeyed through the world of Lothric, I noticed bits and pieces of the past (Lordran) scattered about and it filled me with a sense of overwhelming sadness. I saw things that were reminiscent of the first game  or outright were from the first game, but dead and/or rotting. It made me want to back and play the first one again...Bar that fact, I feel that the PvP in this addition to the series was more solid than Ds2, but less appealing than Ds1 which I know many people will disagree with. Many things were tweaked or added/removed and it made PvP a bit too simplistic for me although I still partook in it a bit and still do, (I rotate between this and DsR now). The stories of all the games and piecing them together through item descriptions and lore always enthralled me and still does to this day. The world of Souls remains to be one of the most mysterious i've come across with all of the games i've played. Overall, with graphic presentation, gameplay and story in mind, I give Ds3 an 8.5/10."
Positive,I want to die
Positive,It's okay. Just beat the first boss.
Positive,"Awesome game. Worth playing if you want a bigger challenge. As well as having a great plot/history along with the trilogy, the gameplay is incredible, great bosses (gael ftw) and renewed DS1 smithing and weapon system. 10/10"
Positive,"bruh, good game get it and play it yourself"
Positive,It's good. That's all i got to say thank you for reading my review.
Positive,VERY GOOD VERY NICE VERY DARK VERY OP GIT GUD
Positive,Has alot of replayability. It's an overall fun game
Positive,It's good i like it
Positive,You ever get to that point where you just wanna lay down and cry?
Positive,"I can feel Satan physically tearing my a-hole open from this game... 10\10, would get a pounding again."
Positive,"I am an atheist,but this game genuinely had me looking in the bible for help.11/10 would make 50 reddit posts about how much i hate The Dancer again."
Positive,"Enemies stagger you a lot easier than you can stagger them now, it's not exactly as good when it comes to variety in builds as DS1 and DS2,and it has somewhat less satisfying PvP. However, DS3 improves nearly every other aspect. Great graphics, decent matchmaking system and good perfomance. It's also officially supported by Valve on Linux, through Steam Play, though I have yet to try that."
Positive,"Don't you ever just love a game so much that you hate it? Well, look like DarkSouls3 is the game for you. Wield giant ass swords to kill outrageous sized bosses as you journey on your way to link the fire. Or maybe you don't want to link the fire and just be surrounded by darkness. Your choice. But no, the artwork and OST are amazing. It's a very fun game to play with friends. Either y'all are going around ganking invaders or having a boss clap your cheeks in one swing I highly recommend this game for anyone looking for something new or a good challenge."
Positive,"Personally my favorite dark souls game in the series, I've played all the other dark souls and this one has my favorite mechanics, graphics and boss fights. If you're thinking about buying it then don't think twice and get it."
Positive,"Love the Souls games, always have a fun and frustrating time lol. This one is very intuitive and in-depth with a lot of creative enemies, from basic mobs and elite mobs to the different bosses.  Definitely would recommend this to others."
Positive,"This game is challenging, but not hard or impossible.I highly recommend this game and its season pass. (Do not buy the ashes DLC alone its not worth it)The boss fights are thrilling and can really test your patience once you start having trouble with a boss.If you plan on playing this game without a controller or just for the online play I'd highly reconsider purchasing this game.When I played through DS3 I didn't have many issues with the game besides Online Servers dying for no reason and the game crashing for no reason I can find be these were rare. If I had to rate this game I'd rate it a 8/10 with a controller and a 6/10 without one"
Positive,"Are you ready to die? Dark Souls III is a tough as nails game that will test your mettle with its terrifying bosses and nasty jaunts between bonfires. The gameplay is a lot more refined than first game; parrying and pyromancy aren't as broken and require far more skill than Dark Souls 1. If you have played DS 1, you'll notice quite a few more bonfires here than in that game. For many, this'll be a bit of a turn off, but rest assured that much of the first game's difficulty is still intact. As a sequel to dark souls, dark souls iii far outshines ii and is a fitting conclusion to the beloved trilogy."
Positive,GREAT FUCKING GAME
Positive,i like to play this gme
Positive,best game buy it on sale now
Positive,10/10 would praise the sun again
Positive,"Really good game, i have writen this review purely for a badge."
Positive,I want to cry
Positive,"A wonderfully, well-made game. Aside from it being Dark Souls, it's also full of fashion to play dress-up, which we know is very important in our video games.Killing a Lord of Cinder while wearing a white fluffy dress with no defensive stats? Yes. This is how games should be."
Positive,"TLDR: I am very happy with this game's story and mechanics. Plus it was a good way to rap up the series that is Dark Souls.What can I say, other than it is everything you would expect from previous Souls games with a slight hint of ""casual"" flair throw in to appeal to a brouder player base. Of course, this doesn't mean it doesn't have its share of up-ticks in dificulty to still try your patience and see if your really a determined Souls player at the core of your being.Standout parts from the rest of the series:- Best search mechanics to help you play with your friends- Coolest concept with combining Demon's hub area w/ Dark's open world mechanics- Probably the best upgrade mechanics for weapons in the entire series- DLC not for the faint of heart but doesn't drain your soul like II's did"
Positive,"after 2 full years the game still has a game breaking bug where the hitboxes do not move from their spawn points, do not buy this game until the devs get off their lazy ass and actually fix the bug that so many people are having.EDIT: after having to change my cpu and motehrboard i finally managed to get the game to boot up, only to be met with a white screen, after several hours i fixed it, aaaaaand i met another issue. my character wouldnt move at all, after yet again several hours i got the game to work.i will now give a proper review based on the working gamethe game is about as fair as pitting a lord of cinder against a crippled downy, enemies have infinite stamina infinite sprint, can combo endlessly, enemies have 10x more health than you and kill you in two hits. is the game unfair as fuck? yes, yes it is, however it is beatable, it sure is satisfying to kill the fucker cucker that killed you 50+ times becuase he used an un-telegraphed attack and insta killed you (yes im talking about you oceiros you asswipe) .the gmae is also much MUCH easier and more fun if youre playing with a friend, until you cmplete the boss in that area then you cant summon them in that area anymore.the game is riddled with bugs and hackers, as usual the makers of the game give as many shits about fixing the pc game as i give shits about offending people, absolutely fucking none.if you like a challenging game (a game where your attacks are literal wet wank tissues) and can overlook the major flaws mainly stemming from the devs refusing to fix the game and hackers then youll have a good time (aka youll get your ""dark sign"" ""pillaged"" by everyone)."
Positive,"TLDR; Depending on what you come to Dark Souls for, you'll either love it or hate it. If you come for amazing storytelling and tight combat, you've come for the right place. If you come for competitive PVP and Castlevania exploration, DS1 or 2 is probably better for you.Pros:Fastest, most responsive combat. The delay between button press and action is significantly lower than previous games, making combat intense and rewarding. Strategy is still required though, as enemy attack patterns will punish button mashers. Simply put, the meat of the game is really, really fun and doesn't gets boring.Best art direction of the Souls series. Everything from enviroments to bosses has fantastic detail and consistent design motiffs. It feels like a real, living world, and has none of the jarring, inorganic art direction of DS2. This has the added bonus that you're always able to tell where you should be going next.Hidetaka Miyazaki's storytelling is on point like never before. If you care about the story outside of the player's actions, this game has it in spades. More than any other Souls game, the mechanics and themes complement each other with elegance and precision.Joining and leaving covenants is so much easier now. Instead of having to meet with the leader of a covenant everytime you want to join or leave there's now an equipable item. Completing covenant quests can be rough though, as there's almost no one playing anymore.Cons:Pvp isn't the highlight of the series. It's fun if you're not heavily invested, but I know for more serious pvp players there are some major concerns. It's still decent enough that I find myself booting DS3 back up just for invasions though.Servers are kind of dead. Seriously, the only time I'll run into other people is on weekend nights.Very restricting about how to proceed for the first 15 hours. Even after that, there's only really 3 paths to take. Because of this, the game is quite a bit shorter than previous dark souls games. My first run through only took about 50 hours to beat.The Dark Souls series does very little to protect against cheaters, this one is no different. Not as rampant or as frustrating as in 1, but you will encounter them.Maps aren't as sprawling or open as 1. This isn't as big of a deal as it sounds like though, because the encounters throughout the world are very well spaced and timed, and you don't feel like you're being railroaded into playing the game a certain way."
Positive,9/10 too many people using Estus during duels
Positive,"I will preface this review by stating that I would undoubtedly recommend Dark Souls III to anyone who is even considering purchasing the game. I initially had bought this game only because it was on sale and the dark fantasy intrigued me. I went into this game knowing next to nothing about the Souls series of games, besides the reputation it has for it's unforgiving nature. Needless to say, I was thrown into this game head first.My initial thoughts of the game were fairly neutral. Most of my time in the first area was spent trying to ensure that I was progressing along the path intended by the developers. The map seemed a bit too open to the point where I would doubt if I was even going in the right direction, however, this was one of the first RPGs I had played in a while, so I could have just been overly cautious. Despite this I had made my way to the first boss, and after many deaths I finally killed it. The feeling of accomplishment I felt then is one that I still feel to this day whenever I down a boss. At the time it also felt reassuring; I was actually progressing.There are many aspects that helped make Dark Souls III a memorable experience to me. The game play itself without a doubt is unforgiving, but it never feels unfair. If you get hit by a boss, you timed your roll wrong; if you get jumped by a group of enemies, you should have played more cautious and defensive. The story itself is pretty hidden, but your short term goals and objectives are always clear. If you put in the time and look in the right places though, the game rewards you with more lore and story. All of the NPCs you meet through the story are memorable and unique. Completing their individual stories presents you with everything about them, from their motives to their personalities. On top of the elements I mentioned before, the environment is outstanding throughout the game. This is mostly accomplished through the music and the breathtaking backgrounds.My last reason for recommending this game is because of it's replay value. After sinking hundreds of hours into this game, getting every achievement, and completing the DLCs, I still find myself coming back to this game. Whether it's to try a new build or weapon in the PvE content, or just playing PvP for fun, I still get enjoyment out of this game. If you are on the fence about buying this game because it's on sale, you like RPGs, or even just because the dark fantasy genre intrigues you, I would without a doubt recommend this game. I bought this game impulsively, not knowing what to expect, and it ended up turning into one of my most memorable game experiences. Dark Souls III is one of my favorite games of all time."
Positive,"Never has any game made me piss myself, then promptly taken my head and rubbed my face in the recently soiled carpet. 10/10 Delightful Experience"
Positive,Pretty good game.
Positive,Anyone that loves the 'souls series will love this game. Definitely a must try for those die hard dark souls fans out there.
Positive,"Its tilting and fun at the same time. i wake up and want to hate myself for playing it! but all inn all, its a GRAET GAME!"
Positive,God Like Substance
Positive,"This game is amazing.I wrote a detailed, explanatory, lengthy recommendation, but I feel that it diluted the essential message I wish to convey, which is both the first line of this review and the only remaining part of said recommendation.Buy it."
Positive,"Actually one of the best games, I ever played and I played a lot of games. Trust me.."
Positive,Sale price; very nice
Positive,drink estus in pvp
Positive,she aint to shabby
Positive,This game is really well done. It is satisfying to play and has a good balance of challenge and progression.
Positive,"Combat the best in series, just wish the level design was as strong as DS1 (or even DS2)."
Positive,"An extremely great starting point into the franchise, as this is what I used it as.  Not the best of the Souls series, but definitely up there.  Stuttering is miniscule, but has fluid gameplay that punishes you for making a mistake.  Overall, a solid entry into the franchise: 8/10"
Positive,While not the best souls game ever. Still amazing and a love letter to souls fans everywhere. Plus no terrible lootboxes or microtransactions. So good on you from software for not being terrible like some other million dollar companies.
Positive,Praise the sun!!! \o/
Positive,"like this game, hope for more of these games."
Positive,very good game
Positive,"The game itself is graphically impressive and seeing as the past 2 games had great mechanics it was simply all poured together to provide a great experience; I truly loved it and what drove me to play it was the simply satisfaction of exploring and memorizing every key aspect of the game which is something I would never think of doing; providing multiple runs of the game and all out enjoyment. However with that being said I most likely wouldn't have been as inspired to beat it without the simplicity of multiplayer. It's one thing to roam these treacherous lore filled and despair-filled lands but with a friend humor simply pours into this odd mix to serve as some sort of medium of all things in this relation; and at that the game itself can prove semi-difficult without someone to aid you. Overall, though in any audience this works out perfectly due to a sunmmoning system present in previous games; along with the large playerbase as of now that provide that helping hand oyu may need throughout the game; but in all this game is simply driving and something I haven't experienced in awhile. I'd definetely reccomend it for it's complexity and understanding of itself overtime proving itself to be worth every bit of money poured into it. Coming from the second game I can understand why people would take the first game over any other ""souls-like"" game yet it simple just adds onto the flavor of this series and partially makes it what it is all binding together in odd relation and being a series that I can't easily depart from after deeply putting my trust, effort, and time into it."
Positive,10/10 would cry again.
Positive,"Favorite game, Love simulator( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
Positive,Got killed by a Pus of Man through a floor.10/10
Positive,"Out of the Dark Souls series I - III (+Expansions), this was the one I enjoyed the most actually. Dark Souls I does have a better and more intricate level/map design that I would have loved to see in Dark Souls III. Other that that it's a great game that lives up to the souls series!"
Positive,SANITY IS FOR THE WEAK!
Positive,A  masterpiece.
Positive,The best end to the best series ever.
Positive,Quite literally the best game I have ever played in my life. I have so many hours invested in this game and they were all well spent. Words can't express how much I love this game.
Positive,"This game is easily the best game of 2016. It is a great ending to the souls series. Dark Souls 3 is my first souls game. From what I've heard it is the hardest. After 4 playthroughs, I think I have played enough of the game to give a good review. ( I have not yet played any of the DLC). I am going to be revealing minor spoilers so be wary. Lets start with a list of the features I liked and disliked.+Difficulty LevelThis is the first game that I have ever played that really challenged me. My first playthrough was basically an abusive relationship. The game would hit me, I would cry about it and quit, but eventually came back to it after an hour. The first few areas had me thinking, ""This isn't so bad"". Then came the Abyss Watchers my favorite boss in the game. Holy shit that was a hard fight for me. And that is my favorite thing about this game. The fact that is excrutiatingly difficult. +MusicI am a sucker for instrumental music, and this game extremly delivered. Walking into my first Gundyr fight, when the music kicked in, it was a moment that I would remember for a long time. When I was fighting the Abyss Watchers, and they combined together to put up one last fight, the violin solo made me feel pity for the curse of the Watchers. The music is really amazing in this game.+/- Level DesignThe level design for this game is really unique, and it really does not hold your hand. It is highly possible for you to miss entire areas of the game, and exploration is key. I do not know how I feel about this. I like the style the game is going for, but it sometimes is annoying to miss an item. The side quest are somewhat hidden, and it is best to double back on an area to make sure you did not miss something. On my first playthrough of the game, I missed a lot of the items, and ended up looking up some of the locations. Having to do that took some fun out of the game, and it was annoying. The world it self is highly detailed and looks amazing. The locations do make the game world seem a little small though.+/- StoryIt is possible to play through this game and not know anything about the story, other than you have to keep a fire from going out. It is sad that the game does not tell you more, because the story for the game is really intresting. Most of the story is hidden in item descriptions, and vague npc dialouge. I would suggest looking up a video explaining the lore for the game if you plan on playing it, though be wary of spoilers.+/- Enemies and BossesThe games Enemies and Bosses are pretty unique. Each area has a specific set of enemies that the player has to learn to defeat. They are designed well. The Bosses are really awesome. In the begining cutscence, the Lord of Cinder are displayed as these unique and badass super people who you have to kill. Almost all of their fights are challenging (ahem Yhorm) and are entertaining. I wish there was a feature that allowed you to fight the bosses again individually, but the closest thing we get is a new game plus system. I played a playthrough of new game plus on my strength build, and it was a joke. Having end game gear against enemies who are slightly buffed makes the game downright easy. It may just be easier with a strength build, but I would stay away from it.+/- Weapon and Estus SystemThe game changed the system which Estus flask and weapon upgrading works. For Estus, you find shards which can grant you additional flask, and undead bone shards, which make your Estus heal more health. I really like this system. Your Estus flask sort of ""level"" with you. I like the weapon upgrading system. I like how there is different types of titanite for boos weapons and normal weapons, and also how you have to devote a titanite slab to get a weapon to +10, which there are only 8 of in the game.  My only gripe with the weapons are the weapon arts. I think they are a cool way to make every weapon feel unique, but some weapons have seriously underpowered weapon arts.Meh -The Invasion systemThe pvp in this game is okay. I personally found that it was an annoyance to be invaded while clearing areas that are hard enough without another player making things more difficult. Though it was really entertaining to be right at the bonfire and then a deadly duo including Aberdolf Lincler ruins your day. I do like the summon system. I used it to help other players defeat bosses that I really liked to play against and that they might be having a hard time with. I have really enjoyed this game, and I feel that it has ended the series in the best way it could. It gave intresting enemies and bosses, beautiful levels, an intriguing but somewhat hidden story, and a good weapon and estus sytstem. I would highly reccommend getting this game, as it will be well worth your $60."
Positive,"I used to not be a  fan of the souls series, I tried to play each of them starting with DS1 and ending with Bloodborne, and each and every time I just got mad and gave up. Then Dark Souls 3 went on sale and a friend wanted me to get it so we could play together, so I caved and bought it only expecting to play maybe 1-2 hours of it and then return it. Things did not turn out that way though, I fell in love with this game, and only a week later and I have put 30 hours into it, if you look at my other games you'll see how much that really is for me. To be honest, I was in a bit of a slump as there were no games that really caught my interest (at least since Fallout 4) I would just buy a game, play maybe 5-9 hours and lose any desire to continue playing. I love the complicated lore, the amazing scenery, and above all else, the overwhelming challenge. I named my character Hugh Janus, made him an obese black man, and a face esembling a cows clitorus, and off I went on one hell of a journey. I think I may go back and replay the other games in the series, only after I am done with this one, because I have to say it has quickly become one of the best games I have ever played. I know how it feels to be scared off by the reputation these games have earned, and you will want to give up at times, but if you just power through and see what waits after that boss, you'll want to do the same for the one after that, and the one after that, and so on. If you ever feel like you can't do it, just do what I do and think, I've made it this far, might as well keep going."
Positive,Only played it for abit but its good
Positive,I'm glad Fromsoft finally brought the back online after keeping us in the dark for months. Great game sunk far too many hours into it. I will continue to sink hours into it.I'm not an addict.
Positive,"This is just a beautiful and totally unique game. As a newcomer to the Dark Souls series, I was frustrated but the estoric mist around this game and its story made me want to keep at it. The approach to PVP is creative and unique. You can tell the creators had a unique and artistic vision. I have never been less upset about spending $60 and buying a season pass."
Positive,"""Gives me Conniptions..."""
Positive,"Its a fucking nice game but the pvp is shit, laggy as fuck, buggy as hell, netcode is made from pedophile fecies."
Positive,Already makes me want to kill myself.
Positive,-joined Watchdogs of Farron Covenant-got summoned-got in to a 3v3 fight-won-best game ever
Positive,"Having not beaten 2, I can safely say this is what dark souls 2 should have been. Great addition to the souls series.Edit: having now beaten 2, Dark Souls 3 feels like a more direct sequel to 1, and yet all 3 games are great."
Positive,"DARK SOULS™ III lives up to its name. The game has an amazing story, captivating visuals, very in-depth combat, I can go on for awhile but continuing on with the review. I have beat New Game in a little over 30 hours. Yet, there is so much more to this game. There is all of the weapons and armor to collect. Sadly you can't upgrade armor like the other games in the DARK SOULS™ series. I digress, there are many ways you can allocate your points to give a certain ""build"". With every DARK SOULS™ game it is rich with backstory and lore. DARK SOULS™ III has references from other DARK SOULS™ games. PVP is a large option in DARK SOULS™ III but it's not required. Enough of me praising the game now it's your turn, what's your decision is DARK SOULS™ III worth your money?"
Positive,"A long time ago, in a world deep in the darkest ages, hellish fiends ruled over this land. But one man will rise up and raise a whole lotta hell! Bandai Namco entertainment presents a brand new chilling adventure. Dark Souls Three! In a story of brutal retribution and redemption, a man must fight his way in an epic journey acrossed this land to hold onto his mortality. For that he'll need souls, many...many souls! No where to hide, no where to run, the only way forward is to fight back! Again! and AGAIN! AND AGAIN!.....aaaand...Again. When you pick a fight with the devil, you'd better be stronger than hell! Dark Souls Three! Available on VHS on april 12th!Best movie I ever played. 10/10(seriously though whoever's idea it was to make that trailer is a genius)"
Positive,"Oh greetings traveller !I see you are looking in the reviews section. Are you still wondering whether you should buy this game or not ?If you enjoy a medieval-type setting inspired by the gruesome anime Berserk, then look no further !As you would expect with every Dark Souls games :- Extremely challenging and rewarding. - Beautiful and haunting world inhabited by monsters and backstabbing friends (rip).- Great combat mechanics and unforgiving foes (your mistake is your doom).- Plenty of customizations and weapon/armour upgrades. - Unique stats progression.Still unconvinced ? I doubt it."
Positive,"As many From Software games, Dark Souls III respects the player and doesnt hold your hand throughout the entire expereince. It's a changelling game with a much rewarding gameplay. I would not recommend to gamers that dont enjoy a struggle now and then. This is not a game for the faint of heart, but once you understand the mechanics and lore behind it all, it is a very enjoyable and thoroughly satisfying game"
Positive,"Dark Souls III is a tough one (no pun intended). After the mess Dark Souls II was, this is a strong send-off to the series, and by all means a great game. But as I was playing it I noticed there was something different, something Dark Souls had that this didn't. I think than problem comes from familiarity. When I first played Dark Souls I was new to the series, everything in that world was unknown to me, and that's when the Souls series is at its best. When it catches you off guard, when you don't know how the enemies will react, when it makes you think in ways most games just don't.Dark Souls III just doesn't deliver that for people who played the previous titles. From Software played it too safe, and it shows. The game doesn't surprise you in the way Dark Souls did, enemies are too familiar, some of them reused from previous titles. Traps you might find around the map are also predictable. Even art direction in some areas is brought back from past work for the sake of ""fan service"".I also don't like the direction From Software is taking in bosses and some combat encounters. Making you fight against 2, 3, 4 or more opponents at once without a chance of taking them out one by one feels unfair, and you can tell some bosses are clearly designed to be played in co-op. As someone who likes to beat the game by himself this is definitely a step back as I don't get the chance of a fair fight against my opponents. It also is a really cheap way of making the game more ""difficult"" for the people asking for tougher encounters. This is not the way to go and I think From can do better.If you are a fan of the series and just want more of the Dark Souls we already know, you'll love this game. Overall this is a great title, but for the ones who are looking for a new experience it looks like we are going to have to wait for a bit longer."
Positive,One of the greatest games i've ever played...
Positive,"Amazing game with some good challenges. Personally though, I think it is more fun playing with friends but it depends on your play style and your personal preferences."
Positive,"""Why"" ""Wtf"" ""Ok"""

Positive,"New to Dark Souls, got to say this game blew me out of the water. Great gameplay, great graphics, and a rich lore. Whats not to love?"
Positive,"I am supposed to write a review to receive the Steam badge, so here it is.This game is very okay."
Positive,we need more games like the Dark Souls Series for PC
Positive,"I'll whine a little and then recommend it:-The Bloodborneish enemies hit faster than you, they move while starting the attack, they move while ending the attack. They have homing charging attacks that might or might not do damage only at the end of the charge, or throughout the animation, it's a guessing game per enemy. All the while you're stuck with slow weapons, without poise, with shields that usually just slow your next swing and eat your stamina. How they ""fixed"" it is that dodge rolling costs barely any stamina.-All kinds of weapon infusions, yay right? Nope. Many coals needed for infusions are very late game and there might only be one infusion material till the very end of the game. Yes, including grinding. Oh yeah and other upgrade materials open up way late too, because f uck you.-There's maybe 2-3 weapons per category that are actually viable. Not ""pvp"" viable. ""Viable"" viable. Some of them need several bosses cleared. And yes, lance is again at the very end, vanilla dark souls 2 style.-To be a caster, you have to be dedicated to it, making you a one-trick pony. Mana estus takes away healing estus. Stat requirement for decent miracle damage is 50+. And you can't just tank through it because:-Heavy armors suck ass, no matter what kind of tweaking they make, since it only matters for pvp.-HP stat cap is 27. It does go higher than that, but does nothing.Ignoring all that it's enjoyable, IF you make a spammy light attack build (I suggest twinblades), IF you use medium armor, and IF you wiki where the stoneplate rings (the real armor) are. Doesn't that sound replayable mmhmm."
Positive,dank souls is dank. that is all

Positive,"Is Dark Souls 3 too easy for you? Remap the controls to Dark Sous: Prepare to Die Edition keyboard controls like I did. Come on, don't be a casual."
Positive,"I love this game series i really do, although the whole idea of people getting banned for pretty much nothing was an instant turn off i still bought it. and its good, its as tough as a dark souls game should be. i love the pvp even though i suck at it."
Positive,"Who said these awful words and thumbs-downed the game?Bring him to me and show the cruel face!Oh, you pre-ordered next of Souls?Support them, wanted to? And play at launch?Then here’s a bonus: crashes show,No matter your PC is high or near such.Gameplay is great, and other stuff works fine,But when you try to rest under the fire heat,The Souls crashes almost every time!So praise the Sun until the devs put it on feet…Oh, it is mine… I was behind this all along!A mirror brings the face… It’s cruel, but handsome…Oops, feast of nonsense! Revenons à nos moutons,I’m ready to say “Yes” about DS3 and “Welcome”! But! There is wide and juicy but!First, I don’t know what with the mentioned crashes now:Then, if the Lightning quality is Max the ones popped up.So, Lights to Low. Despite it, DS3 looks nice and keeps its wow.That’s how I played the game. It’s bought for fun and not to f… worry about different technical problems, yep?And second what I want to say is that the content’s weak.The previous Souls are complex games, a difference between.But this part is like DS1, its essence’s not unique.Expanded? Deeper? Vice versa, they’ve compressed everything…Well, all in all and in conclusion, we have a rare pure role-play.The gameplay’s highly seasoned, lures us to praise the Sun.Dark Souls 3 does not deserve to be a cast-away,It’s an enjoyable, gorgeous game, but not a flawless one."
Positive,"This game has tested my inner 'gud' and has pushed to git it, over my 6 playthroughs to get all the achivements I've obtained 100% in this game and am still playing it. I've met so many interesting people as well as freaks across my adventures and I'll never forget each and every one of them, praise be upon the Father of Giants for he has given us the strength to git gud.Unfortunatly it is only a matter of time until I become a salt baby on the forums but I have not broken yet as every meta I have adapted too, BRING ON THE DLC! DARK SOULS 3! 10/10"
Positive,Do yourself a favor: Play this game.
Positive,I died 10/10
Positive,"Truly a magnificent game. Dark Souls to the core, hard AF and also so, so beautiful.Definately worth its money."
Positive,"The Dancer and the Nameless King, :D go for it!"
Positive,"First things first: - The vast majority of people complaining about technical issue, are people that upgraded from W7 to W10. Not that should be wrong, but it's known that's a lot of problem about W10 overlay  when you upgrade from 7. Believe me, I was one of this guys complaining about crash, low frame rate at some point, etc. Even with the ""fix"" ( reduce lightning to low ) I still had some problem with frame rate ( dropping to 10fps at times ). The true fix  was tweak the nvidia control panel settings and change priority from Quality to Performance, and solved the problem, in another games as well.That being said, now about Dark Souls 3.It's IMPOSSIBLE to get the same vibe, feelings from Dark Souls, but still a very good Souls game, much better than 2.Graphic wise, DS3 uses Bloodborne engine, so you cannot expect graphics par games like The Witcher 3 for instance, but it's a really good looking game, the background, the vistas from a far is truly gorgeous. Irithyll anyone?The gameplay is a mix with ALL Souls series and the new touch with weapon skill was very well realized, but the game still have a lot to offer to casual and hardcore player, but this time with much more multiplayer content, even more than SOTFS, and this is a good thing. Even being possible to set a password and play with your friend only if you will.The art and lvl design try to catch too much from DS1, looks like an attempt to repair the damage caused from DS2, but still fun to see Anor Londo once again and a lot of references from DS1.DS3 is a MUST BUY if you are a Soul fan, and  chances are that you already purchased the game if you are fan. BUT, if you're new to the series, buy Prepare to Die Edition."
Positive,"This review is my opinion of dark souls 3 written after killing every boss and finishing my first playthrough. Warning: long review, non-native English speaker, mostly praise. While dark souls 1 is my favorite game of all time, dark souls 3 can easily be my top 4 games of all time alone, despite my love towards the franchise. It’s sad to see that dark souls 3 is the last game for its series, but I look forward to play its DLC and more awesome games made by From software.Boss fights: there are about 20 bosses in total in dark souls 3. All of them are not easy and require a lot of death to figure out the right strategies.  The satisfying feeling that I get after mastering the mechanic after countless death and finally beating the bosses is what makes these fights great.  Every boss fight has its unique theme, music, and they all have different phrases when the bosses become more powerful. About half of the boss fights are designed really well that are really memorable. Several boss fights have reached the level of epicness that I have never experienced in any other games. Theme/graphic/music: the world of dark souls 3 is dark and beautiful. The world is full of details: different designs for the thrones of lords that match their lore, cells that are full of decayed bodies but still tell stories of their prisoners through furniture and items, areas leading to bosses and boss rooms that amplified the power of different bosses… The world is as pretty as some other games like the witcher 3 and farcry, but the music is better in my opinion. The music for different areas and boss fights are so in tone with the game that makes me even want to go back to fight the bosses again after so many death and finally beating them. Bosses may be strong, but they are not as strong as the tones created by the piano and violin in those music. Interconnected world: dark souls 1 has most of its worlds interconnected to each other. This level of world design has never been reached by another game for so many years after the game came out. While dark souls 3 has not reached the same level, it is obvious throughout the game that the developer tried to make maps interconnected. As a result, there are a lot of shortcuts that connect different sections of the same area or different areas that would not normally connect to each other. Finding those shortcuts enriches the experience of exploring the world.Weapons/armors: while weapons and armors are similar to DS1 &2, 2 important changes are made. 1. Each weapon now has a special attack that used mana to cast. This makes weapons more unique, and it would have greater impact on PVP than PVE. 2. Weapons can be upgraded, but armors and shields can no longer be leveled up. This greatly reduces the defense of mid-late game characters. Leveling up defense items and tank a lot of hits is no long an options in DS3. This change makes mid-late game PVE more challenging, and it can create a lot of build varieties in PVP. I think people call this the return of the fashion soul. Lore: while the witch 3 has the best lore and storytelling among all the games, souls game focus on actions, and DS3 chooses the right approach to tell its story. The game doesn’t tell its story directly. The player needs to learn about the story through hints around the world. It’s easy to miss the details of the story if not paying attention to item descriptions and connecting the dots between dialogs of NPCs. To me, this is the prefect approach: the action of the game is good enough, and if the player wants to learn more about the lore, it is free to do so, and there are plenty to learn. The story of dark souls is simple yet complicated, and dark souls 3 finally completes the cycle of the whole story. The faiths of god, fire, humanity, and undead are all depend on the choice of the player.Return of the old elements from pervious souls games: several areas of the game and characters have returned from pervious souls games to dark souls 3. This is truly amazing for a souls fan.   Combat/difficulty: combat is faster than pervious souls games and more punishing. Weaker defense and spells make it hard to tank a lot of hits or stay in safe distance to spam magic. Again, dark souls focus on actions, and there is simply no better games in the market so far in term of action/movement of the character. While I wishes some bosses have more HP and leave less open windows for the player to attack, the hard ones are hard enough. The first boss(tutorial boss) is actually challenging for me: a not-so-noob player, and it really showcases the principle of this game: dodging and timing. Dying a lot and losing all the hard earned souls is mandatary, but that is how a soul game should be played. Co-op: while I didn’t choose to co-op for any of my game progression, co-op and invade are easy and fun. I did tried some PVP, and it seems there are very few pure casters since spells are much weaker in DS3 comparing to DS1 and 2. People use spells mostly for buffs. In short, dark souls 3 worth its full price, and it’s definitely one of the best games I’ve ever played. I tried to explore the world as much as I can during my first playthrough, and I’m sad it “only” last for around 60 hours. It was such a good time for every single minute I spent on this game. I’d definitely suggest anyone to play this game. Also, try to play the game with minimum guides/coop for progression during the first playthrough. It will make the experience much better."
Positive,This game is amazing and really deserved all the awards that it achieved. Sad that it is going to be the last of the the souls series. I Purchased the deluxe edition with the steam controller and am really happy to say that the controller works really well. would have been cool if the controller came with a dark souls deluxe edition skin on it.
Positive,"Within nearly two weeks I've almost clocked in the same hours in Dark Souls 3 than I have in Dark souls 2 Scholar of the first Sin.  Don't get me wrong, it's an excellent game, but I got to the final boss and beat it in six days, less than a week!  And that's after I grinded for 30 sunlight medals and leveled up my character.  Granted that I missed an area or two when there was a fork in the road, but considering that it was optional and I got to the final boss and beat it with little to no difficulty, I was somewhat disappointed.  It may be because I've played the others that I'm used to the difficulty, but some things have been gradually scaled back compared to the other games.  For example, if you get poisoned, you'll barely notice it happened, it's only the two times where toxic comes into play that you will worry.  My other gripe about this game is that it feels like a re-hash of Dark Souls one because of how similar things are.Regardless, there's still many new areas to explore, more fluent and stylish fighting, and plenty of time to GIT GUD.If you have ever played a souls game before, continue on with the series and play this, and if you're new to the story it's also a good place to start."
Positive,"Note: Basically requires a controller. I personally reccomend an Xbox One controller. I have a steam controller but I just dont really like it.Game is visually stunning, and grabs your attention right off the bat and keeps you playing. Whether it be for exploring every nook and cranny in an area, to figuring out how to beat that boss that you keep dying to, this game has a lot of content. Definately worth the money. There are stories and people saying they were banned for using controller mappers / hackers invading their game and corrupting their save files. This has not happened to me yet, hopefully it doesnt but I cannot say my opinion on this matter. It would certainly be a waste of time for this to happen and would certainly make me stop playing for a while."
Positive,Dank Souls 3for every death smoke one bowlget gud or get baked
Positive,"This is an excellent game, but don't get me wrong, it's not at all easy.  This game is about challenge, and what really makes it great is the way you fight.  Getting hit is actually whatever it might be actually hitting your character.  It's not like some RPGs where you press a button and it says 40 damage to other player. A spell, arrow, bolt (crossbow), or sword all alike will need to physically hit your character.  This is where the real fun comes in.Do you dodge? Hold up your shield? Try to hit first?  Maybe you can even time a Parry, then hit the other guy for a lot of damage.It is HARD, it is unforgiving, but it's not impossible.  It's challenging, and it's worth it.Nevermind the awesome atmosphere, the variety of monsters, the different challenges as you go on..  If you haven't played earlier in the series, I recommend starting Dark Souls: Prepare to die Edition, and don't forget to get DSFIX to fix some visual issues with that game."
Positive,"Alright then, with the issues mostly smoothed out I can give this game a reccomendation. The game doesnt crash for me anymore, and runs pretty well-a far sight from launch week. Dark Souls 3 looks pretty good, runs at 60 FPS, and while there are bugs here and there as well as visual ticks for the most part everything is fine. The PC settings are solid, and the game looks gorgeous-unlike DS2 it feels huge and connected, with lots of attention to detail in addtion to the pretty graphics. Covenants are easier to swap between allowing more experimentation, the design is top notch and the music is some of the best in the series in my opinion. I went into this game not expecting all that much more than DS2, and as of right now its a contendor for favorite of the series going against Dark souls. If you were burned by Dark souls 2 I can say this game is far better than that one and its worth the dive. If you have only played 1 and are considering trying 2 first, I would reccomend just skipping over it-theres little relation between the games and I think this one is far more worth your time. So far I've been having a great time with it and I would wholeheartedly reccomend it to anyone looking for another souls game."

Positive,"Game's a masterpiece. Though probably the easiest of the souls trilogy, this game will still kill you a LOT, but whenever you die it's YOUR fault. YOU did bad. The game is arguably the most fair souls game of the three due to great level design and the most fluid controls in the series. The story and atmosphere is 10/10, and the music perfectly complements each boss fight from grand epic choirs that make you feel like a badass to more somber movements that seem to root actively against the player and mourn the dying boss. Can't recommend enough."

Positive,"Even at (most) times the game is challenging to point of frustration, DS3 is extremely rewarding. I've enjoyed it on every playthrough.Most of all, I enjoy the challenging aspect of the game.Character building and item variety is interesting, This offers many ways to progress through the game.Even if the DS world is dark and gloomy, it is really pretty.Two cons I do have:- the story is not told in traditional manner. Instead of direct narrative approach, story is more presented in flavor texts, and with the state of your surroundings. The story is still really confusing to me. - the game is not too enjoyable to backseat. Especially if the spectator has no experience with the  game. This games from the fact that you will run same corridors over and over again, to give another try to a bossThis game most likely will frustrate you, but does offer rewarding feeling of mastery. Hopefully you have the patience to see the game through :)"
Positive,"Disclaimer: I have not played the other titles in the series, so for fans of Dark Souls, I cannot compare. I also had no interest in the PvP aspect, although fighting invading players with a buddy was a fun random event.That said, this is easily one of my favorite games. The challenge of combat coupled with the risk of death made exploring the intricately crafted levels an incredibly rewarding experience that rivals the Elder Scrolls titles. The versatility of the in-game currency's uses makes defeating enemies and looting the world feel satisfying. Items and equipment almost always come with delightful tidbits of lore, and each new enemy or zone brings new weapons and armor to upgrade your character in meaningful ways, beyond simple stat boosts.That was another thing that stood out to me about Dark Souls: the upgrade system helps keep your weapons viable against the progressively tougher enemies you encounter as you move through the game. My favorite weapons to play with were the flashy and aggressive twinswords you can get at the start of the game -- while I did experiment with dozens of other weapons (from rapiers and classic sword-and-shield, to more exotic fare like claws or whips), I always came back to my trusty starter weapons. Because skill/practice was often more important than the stats, I also found more freedom in customizing my character's appearance. I wasn't limited to the ""best"" items, and could play the game comfortably with items I liked for visual appeal.It's probably stupid of me to wait this long to mention combat, but it be like that sometimes. Combat is the center of Dark Souls gameplay, and there's very little you're going to be doing outside of fighting enemies, save perhaps walking around in a place recently cleared of enemies. Dark Souls is probably best known for its difficulty, and I've definitely felt my share of frustration. Having friends come in to join the game alleviates this significantly, though if both players are encountering a boss for the first time, it can still be pretty grueling. The diversity of enemies and combat techniques, as well as the high skill ceiling, made it a fun system to engage with over and over. It feels really, really good to master combat. Re-exploring familiar turf likely still brings its challenges, but the diminished threat of familiar enemies makes you feel like you're becoming a stronger character on your own merit rather than the strength of your stats.Lastly, I have to mention the aesthetic of this game. The bleak, somber, and [obviously] dark nature of the world and its characters was an instant draw to me. Everybody -- and everything -- you meet is either undead or a demon, something I'd never seen done before. Dark Souls' take on undeath hit home better than any other IP I'd seen (looking at you, Warcraft). Everywhere you turn, the setting reminds you that this is a world that has stagnated for a long, long time. I loved that.I could go on. I really could. It's an excellent game. I wish more games shared some of Dark Souls' less-celebrated qualities of worldbuilding, equipment, exploration, and replayability."
Positive,This game is good
Positive,The pacing of this game is pretty damn exceptional. Extremely fun game.
Positive,"Dark Souls III - the latest and last in the Dark Souls franchise, and oh boy is it worth it.Dark Souls III, compared to its predecessors, is a fast-paced third person RPG revolving around one goal - to defeat the Lords of Cinder and return them to Firelink Shrine, in the name of Linking the First Flame. While lacking a ""polished"" tutorial, Dark Souls III is designed so that you learn through two things - fighting and dying. Be it to a common Hollow or to a machete-wielding giant, death is the greatest teacher in this game. So, prepare to die - a lot.While more linear than the first two games, Dark Souls III makes up for this with a fleshed-out story; provided you seek it out. The game won't hold your hand during your adventure, so it will not do so for the story - beyond what cutscenes and dialogue there are. The majority of the game's lore can be found through item descriptions and various NPC questlines (some better designed than others). Combat is probably at its best in the series - with the introduction of Weapon Arts, new life has been given to weapons otherwise defined by their moveset. Some may be pleased to know that Poise is no longer the juggernaut it once was, and only applies in PvP. Instead, Hyper Armor frames - which provide an immunity to stagger during some heavier weapon attacks - have replaced the standard ""poise-to-win"" meta that drove the original Dark Souls.My only complaints - the removal of the Blue Eye Orb, password summons beyond maximum area level range, and the gutting of Covenants.Removing the Blue Eye Orb was a bad decision on From Software's part. Rather than the original intention of the Blades of the Darkmoon and Blue Sentinels Covenants - to appear in the worlds of invaders as avengers - these two ""protector"" covenants have been reduced to automatically summoned phantoms to kill invaders. This only occurs if the Host has the Way of Blue Covenant equipped. This has made the grind severely more reliant on the connection to a Host, and is not on-demand vengeance for an invader who has killed a host.Password summons, while good for uninterrupted co-op, have derailed the PvP scene at any Soul Level lower than 145. Gank squads consisting of a host and over-leveled phantoms are commonplace. Despite the downscaling applied to phantoms, it is not enough to give a solo invader the upper hand in PvP. This feature should have been restricted to summoning players only within the level range of the current area (as non-passworded summons function).Rewards for completing the grinds (and they are grinds) for the various Invader covenants are lackluster at best, and some Covenants are either quickly replaced (Blue Sentinels with Blades of the Darkmoon) or share turn-in items with covenant-less invaders (Dark Spirits as opposed to Rosaria's Fingers). There is only a single co-op covenant - Warriors of Sunlight - and the other covenant that can participate in co-op is made up of wildcard players called Mound-Makers - those equally willing and able to kill you as well as help you to the boss. Altogether, Covenants are worth it for completionists, but those just wishing to finish the game can safely ignore them.I'd give the base game an 8/10. If you can get past the initial lack of explanation, try new things, and read descriptions, Dark Souls III is a game for you. As for the DLCs - they are incredibly worth it, offering access to PvP Arenas (unlocked through a drop in Ashes of Ariandel or by completing a NPC questline in the Ringed City), new weapons, and delivering a solid finish to the Dark Souls series' story as a whole. Don't buy the Ringed City on its own - Ashes of Ariandel's story is vital to understanding the Ringed City.Overall Rating: 8.5/10."
Positive,Heckin fun. Solid replay value.9/10
Positive,Very nice casual fun.
Positive,"The first time I got this game, it was too strong for my computer, even on the lowest settings. I later found out I did not have enough VRAM, which, if you dont know, means basically I was crashing fairly quickly, every time I opened Dark Souls 3. Two things kept me around; The very common autosave, which meant everything I did was saved save for maybe a fight or two, and just how good this game is. I spent my first 150 hours just *suffering*, crashing every 10 minutes, sometimes right after bossfights, fast enough that I lost all the progress. I got discouraged, but just how much I love Dark Souls, in particular 3, made me come back. Another 10 minutes. Get just a bit farther. I hit a wall block around 3/4th through the game, and wanted to scream. That boss made me want to crack my eyeballs open. But thats the thing. No matter how much he infuriated me, it only determined me to get farther. Few bosses will flat out destroy you before phase 2, meaning you will almost always at least get halfway, before dying. It always says ""you got this far, do it twice!"". Some bosses just seem unbeatable, and then you pull through, and destroy them. I havent even played Dark Souls 1, and I love this. I did play DS2 and Bloodborne, didnt get very far in either, and I am glad I knew beforehand DS2 is a black sheep among the souls games, so I knew the others werent as. . .floaty. Everything has lore. I have only played Dark Souls 3, and even by extension, I have learned a ton of lore. This might be because there is a massive amount of nods to DS1. DS2 is a bit kicked to the side, but it has a few nods here and there.For me, Dark Souls 3 is a masterpiece. It has its flaws. But thats the important aspect of games. If a game has a lot of flaws, the rest of the game had better be good as hell to make up for it.I had a friend that quit because of how much shit this game throws at you, and all the hidden stuff the game will never flat out say. The only reason I might have stayed this long is because before I went in I read up on a lot of stuff. I found out what makes most people quit before I went in, and this probably lowered the whole shock of everything for me. All I can say in regards to the rating? 8.5/10. Its a great game, and I think anyone should give it a try. More of a try than most games, for just how hard and unforgiving this game can be. If you can push through, what remains is a fantastic piece of work."
Positive,"Fear not, the dark, my friend. And let the feast begin."
Positive,Fantastic Game!!! great story and great challenge all the way!!!
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is now one of my top RPGs of all time. It can be quite difficult at times but to be honest it is fair as long as you can learn from your mistakes. I loved Dark Souls 1 but this is a even better game. The feeling you get as you level up and defeat each boss is exilerating. There is nothing like it. The fighting feels nice and each hit is amazing. The lore behind the game is deep and interesting but very hidden. Even after finshing the game and playing new game plus about 5 times, I still want to keep coming back for more. This is a must play for RPG fans that are looking for a new challenge or just a new RPG to get into. If you're looking to get into the Souls games this is a great place to start as it is a bit easier than the first game and it is a much better game in the long run. 9/10 before DLC, 10/10 with DLC."
Positive,"so i have finished the game together with all dlcs and i have one thing to say, i am hoocked. this game was kinda my life for a week or two. now i am preparing to go into ng+-for mouse and keyboard users such as myself, this game shouldn't pose a challenge. it is easy to get the hang of the controls and i found no need to make any changes myself-now this game is the type of easy to learn, hard to master. the basic controls are easy to learn, but throughout the game new little mechanics will pop up, helping or hindering you against new foes.-speaking of which, the enemies in this game are amazing. each area has new enemies with different attacks, making memorising attack patterns a must. of course there are exceptions, like rats been in every sewer like area and some ram like creature been in 2 areas (can someone pls eplain why they are in such different enviroments?)-there are many weapons and armor sets you can collect. but armor is pretty useless in this game, at least that is what many people and i have discovered. just put on the armor that makes you look the most badass. all weapons have a special move that vary from healing to defense to damage and buffs. (i am not including magic because i have yet to actually make such a character)-the multiplayer of this game can be a real upgrade to the game or a real downside. there are 2 gamemodes (3 if you own any of the two dlc). there is the friendly phantom, which is used for players that want help with a boss or area in general and there is pvp, which is self explenatory. now there is a feature called invasion, which is when a red phantom (the pvp guy) invades your world. they will try to kill you. note that invasions happen only when you are embered, something that you will find out in the game. point is, you are safe as long as you not embered.-there are also covenants. these can either act as ways to assist the player (with bosses or against invaders) or they are pvp covenants, which is where you are summoned to another world as an invader to kill the ""tresspasser"" of an area. doing these covenant ""duties"" rewards you with ites and spells. please note that the following covenants, some of which are pvp and others co-op take quite a while for you to be summoned to various reason. the covenants watchdogs of farron, darkmoon blades and blue sentinels.-bosses are all very nicely designed and all have their own unique patterns and fighting styles. where as others might be slow but strong, others can be fast and nimble, but still strong as all hell.-now the thing that casuals like me are waiting for in this review. is the game hard? yes, yes it is. is it as hard as it shows in most youtube videos? no by dear god it is not. the game is difficult, and will leave you pissed off at many points, but none of the bosses are impossible to beat. even if they are for whatever reason, you can summon other players to help you out with the boss. it is what most soul veterans on youtube say, tough but fair.-a few words for the dlc. in my opinion, it isn't worth it full price, but if you can grab them at a discount or the season pass at a discount it really is. one dlc adds an area which is a very different but welcome change in enviroment, taking you to a snowy mountain type area, where as the other dlc takes you to a more familiar setting. both dlcs add quite a few new spells, weapons and armor sets with their own unique abilities.overall i will give this game a 9/10."
Positive,"Probably the easiest Souls game in the series and supposedly the last.I jumped into this straight from Dark Souls 1 because I heard that it has a lot more to do with that than 2.I haven't played 2 or Bloodborne even, but if 2's supposed to have more artificial difficulty and if Bloodborne is much faster & more dodge-focused then 3 sounds like a cakewalk in comparison. Bloodborne isn't technically a Souls game but looking at the gameplay it really may as well be with just a few different mechanics and name changes.Playing with a KB+M is very possible but the game's interface is very heavily designed towards playing with a controller as usual. You can at least play with both KB+M and a controller simultaneously if you feel the desire to switch it up.The plot's straightforward; slay the mentioned names and link the fire, again, at least if you want to. The lore's big and learned through reading item descriptions as usual and of course you can piece together certain events that have happened by reading the lore and following some things you see in the environment.The scenery in the series has always been neat to look at. A lot of areas you see in the distance tend to be places you've just walked on or will walk on which is always a neat way to show how sizable the world is. Unlike Dark Souls 1 though the world's a lot more linear and fewer maps are connected to one another. From beginning to end it feels more like I'm walking through a tunnel with only a few side-paths here and there. The level designs are pretty alright & can get clever as well as the shortcuts & contraptions. Because of linearity however the shortcuts are only really useful for the current area which is basically until you beat the area boss. By then you've already moved on to the next map so the only good reasons usually to go back to a particular map is to invade, be summoned for co-op, and look for possibly missed loot.I also think that there are way too many bonfires this time around, especially when bosses always spawn a bonfire after they've been defeated, too. It could be that it only looks that way to me due to how linear this game started to look. Some bonfire placements hardly make any sense. An example of this is where late in the game you beat a certain boss, it spawns the obligatory bonfire, but moving forward 20 steps or so there's another bonfire with not even an enemy in between making the one you took 20 steps for practically pointless.Only a little after the very first boss fight of the game you end up in a new Firelink Shrine which is now Demon's-Souls-esque hub of sorts where practically all the NPCS you meet in your journey end up if you allow them. I personally don't find most of the NPCs interesting and only a few really have any actual quests on 'em. Some of the NPC's quests are so specific that you'll most likely need a wiki or guide to complete them properly. It doesn't help either that some quests can abruptly end another without notice.Instead of the mechanic being a reward for going through a tough journey, you gain the ability to warp between bonfires practically as soon as you light the bonfire in Firelink. It makes the game look a lot smaller than it is but it's at least convenient.The gameplay's more focused on speed when it comes to attacking and avoiding damage even though the mechanics don't exactly suggest that.The game has a habit of throwing hordes of enemies at you and a lot of 'em can do frantic combos too making encounters like that more annoying than difficult, almost encouraging you to cheese through some areas through unconventional means. The beefier 1-on-1 focused mob enemies are a lot less stressful to try to beat. They can be crazy tough and tend to have an attack for almost wherever you go but they're a lot more fair to try and deal with so long as no other force joins in to harm you. The same goes for the bosses (save for 1 or 2 where a clone-esque enemy spawns).Mechanically I think practically all the bosses are designed pretty well, at least when faced alone. Plenty of them are considerably easier in co-op because every boss can be easily distracted just by doing a bit of damage to 'em. Practically all bosses attack fast and do combos & attacks for all angles so you really have to pay attention to what they do. Dodging in panic can be punishing & the same goes for badly timed heals which they tend to notice if you try to heal up and by then they'll usually try to interrupt that by having some kind of gap-closing attack.You find a weapon that best suits you, or use the right one that's best for the situation, or both.There's a hefty variety of equipment to customize yourself with based on your current build and/or personal preference. Each weapon now has a ""Weapon Art"" and depending on the weapon in hand it's either going to be a self-buff or a fancy attack with some more useful than another. Weapon Art uses the new Focus Point mechanic, which can be restored via Ashen Estus Flask, which is acquired at the start of the game. For melee weapons, you need enough FP to make a Weapon Art attack effective. For self-buffs & spells, it's best to just think of FP basically as ""mana"".In the games I've played in this series the only weapons I ever get truly accustomed with are large swords/greatswords, which aren't too slow and doesn't deflect from big shields when two-handed. I don't know much about other melee weapons, spells, & even the new FP mechanic as I barely use 'em.  I've also got very little experience with shield-usage or even ""heavy"" builds as I usually just try to dodge-roll from everything with light/semi-light armor so I don't know what to say about all that and this popular ""poise"" issue.Instead of Humanity now there's Ember, which boosts your max HP by 30% and allows the usual online play of summoning someone and being invaded though you don't need an Ember yourself to be summoned. Hollowing is a progressive matter and you can't turn hollow in this game anymore unless you go through specific actions and then die a lot. Hollowing doesn't prevent you from anything now and reversing it requires more specific actions, a little more to permanently remove the ability to be hollowed. Even then you're only able to have the ability to be hollowed once per playthrough and the only good reason for doing it is for reaching an ending.Online play can get interesting but it can also be an absolute mess because some people's connections can be bad enough where it starts to look like they're running in place.There's a password system but its only purpose is to match you up with others who are using the same password so you can only be summoned by them and vice versa. Normally the game matches you up with people who are in the same level range as well as have a weapon with similar upgrade ranks, regardless whether or not they're the same type, but the password system disregards all that. Whoever is summoned in that manner though will have their stats match the host's, though I'm not exactly sure how. You can still be invaded regardless whether or not a password's been set.You can summon up to 2 co-op phantoms and be invaded by one dark phantom. With a certain item it's 3 co-op phantoms and 2 invaders. From my experience most of the people I've invaded have a phantom or two with them, making me think that the the majority of people that play this game are either bad enough to always want a partner with them and/or they've got friends to play with. Still, co-op with someone up to the boss and trying to screw someone over through invasions can be pretty fun. People complain about being interrupted from invasions but I'm pretty sure that's the point of it.There are a lot more things I feel like saying about this game and there are likely things I missed despite 4 playthroughs.It's not the best Souls game I think but it's still a decent one."
Positive,"Good game, Havent played a Dark souls game before but have played Bloodborne and this felt familair and was easy to get into, The overall game so far hasnt been that challenging but some areas definitely are, also it can be quite easy to miss quests."
Positive,"Like many of us who played this game, I was fairly new to the Dark Souls franchise. Playing only a little bit of Dark Souls, and none of Dark Souls 2 or Bloodborne, I had no idea what I was getting myself into. Having heard from some friends that this game was a bit easier on the ""noobs"" this time around, I gave it a go. I, as I found out later, had chosen one of the hardest starting classes for a newcomer, the thief. As I approached the first hollow in the cemetary, I was fairly instantly powerized into a fine shower of blood and viscera. Perspective thus gained, I realized that this was not Skyrim. Swinging wildly at the enemies as caution is thrown to the wind is not a valid strategy in DS3. After making a promise to myself to not use youtube to find out how the game worked, I started the ""learning out of desperation"" method of training. I died over and over, but after I had finally mastered the art of sidesteps and dodges with my tiny little knife, I had a realization. This was one of the first times ever in gaming in which I had absolutely no qualms about dying. Yes, I lost the in-game money, but at the same time I became more and more aware of what I was doing wrong and exactly how I could fix it. This game is hard, and at many points unforgiving, but unlike playing a game where the AI is simply cheating, the enemies function under the same rules and restrictions the player does. Because of this you don't die simply because the enemies are cheating, you die because you haven't learned how to fight them properly yet. This game not only has a great story and interesting world, but solid gameplay and great replayability, in both the new game plus modes, and a fresh start with a new class. The modular nature of weapons and armor and the leveling system means players can change how they play no matter what class they are. Because of all of these things, I give Dark Souls 3 a 9.5/10."
Positive,"Don't get mad, get good instead.If you got good, get gooder.4/10 no Solaire in this game"
Positive,"Finally finished character creation, now I can finally play this game."
Positive,Thank you kanye very cool
Positive,Treasure ahead try purchasing
Positive,10/10 like csgo but with swords and shields.
Positive,Love it! love the dying over and over and over part!
Positive,"This game is absolutely amazing. There are so many hours to be had in this grueling adventure. The armor is sweet, weapons are cool, bosses are awesome, and the enemies are some of the most horrific looking creatures in the Souls series to date. My only real complaint is that they played it pretty safe. The bow controls are as clunky as ever and gameplay is mostly the same, except for the new weapon arts. Regardless, it's a fantastic send off for a revolutionary series.It's the best Souls game to date."
Positive,A simple and relaxing game to cool yourself down after a long day at work.
Positive,wish it never ends
Positive,This is Dark Souls..And that's it.10 speedruns SL1 / 10
Positive,I genuinely did not expect the servers to ever come back
Positive,"Stunning graphics, great bosses, fantastic gameplay, immersive world with great music. The game is simply amazing and a must buy for Souls game fans. Never played a Souls game? Well, prepare to die."
Positive,Prepare To Die.

Positive,"Coming back to this after 2 years of not playing it, this is the only game that sucked me into a nonstop 5 hour long session. Gotta get the DLC now!"
Positive,"Goated game, easily my favourite Souls title, only drawback is I don't really like the Ariandel DLC"
Positive,This game is a masterpiece worth every penny regardless of how old it gets.

Positive,By far the most amazing and difficult game you will ever play
Positive,"I've steadfastly defended Dark Souls 2's merits against people who call it the low point of the series. Even with my love of the second entry, however, Dark Souls 3 is an improvement over both previous games in the series. Like all the other games, however, it comes with many caveats...and some are more visible than others.Visually, Dark Souls 3 is an upgrade over both previous entries. From Software has finally created a PC port that isn't inherently awful when it comes to looks, and even on low settings (which I was forced to use) the game looks gorgeous, with vibrant lighting effects, detailed character models, and amazing views. However, the game's color palette relies too often on grays, browns, yellow and dark green to convey its oppressive atmosphere, which also consists of a lot of castles, rather than wilderness: I'm not looking for Kirby, but more blue or other bright colors would have helped break up the monotony, especially in the later parts of the game. Characters still don't move their mouths when they talk, which is as disconcerting as you'd expect.The sound design continues to impress, with excellent boss themes that vary between epic orchestral bombing and slow, tragic farewells.A few well-used ambient musical threads set the mood well in the hub areas. Voice acting is well-done, encompassing a wide range of accents and speaking styles. The voice actors manage to capture subtle shifts in tone and tongue placement that accompany amusing or tragic situations, and is the best in the series without question.The game is finally, for the better, less vague when it comes to communicating its mechanics and story. There's still plenty to decipher, discover, theorize on and debate, but the basic threads and gameplay mechanics are finally made clear for all to see. As with previous entries in the series, each location offers tidbits of lore that feed into a larger story or the main plot, often coming to its conclusion in the form of a boss battle. The main plot incorporates so many events from all across the world that it's almost impossible to find a thread that isn't connected to the main story, for better or for worse.The characters are as interesting as you'd expect, especially at first, although some of them seem static, lacking characterization due to not having a questline associated with them or having one that is easily missed.  Cornyx and Karla are the biggest examples of this, although Karla can be excused due to how late in the game you find her and her already-interesting status as a Shard of Manus. However, the few that do have complete questlines are some of the most interesting characters in the series, and the story-relevant bosses are all compelling (and sometimes horrible or tragic) people.Speaking of bosses, most of them are quite good. They're either interesting characters, difficult challenges, enjoyable fights, or all three. I felt that a few too many of them were humanoids, especially towards the end, which is ironic given how similar this statement is to the (usually baseless) statements made against Dark Souls 2's bosses.  All of the lategame bosses, except for Oceiros, Ancient Wyvern and, arguably, the first phase of the Nameless King, are humanoids in armor, They're still interesting encounters, but having them all at the end is slightly stale.Gameplay has been largely unchanged, but the changes that have been made are important. Exploring areas is the same that it's always been, requiring you to struggle through traps, ambushes, and the lack of a map (which does wonders for memory training as you plot a course through some of the more mazelike zones).Combat is faster, taking more inspiration from Bloodborne than DS1/DS2, though blocking is still a viable tactic, and bows/greatbows are finally useful for more besides luring enemies out due to increased damage and speed (crossbows are still, unfortunately, useless). The addition of ""Focus Points"" (mana, in other words) turns out to be a good choice, as nearly all playstyles make use of it since it governs special weapon skills, not just spellcasting.Speaking of casters, spellcasting has been nerfed into oblivion. I normally wouldn't complain about that, given the status of spells in Dark Souls 2 at launch (i.e. they were ridiculously overpowered), but near-uselessness of spellcasting discourages multiple playstyles. Furthermore, the absence of poise means that strength-heavy playstyles have reduced viability since hyper armor is much harder to find, and any old dagger can stunlock you even if you're wearing the heaviest armor in the game.These changes feed into the worst part of the game: the PVP and Covenants. PVP is a complete joke, with a huge abundance of gank squads and legions of stale, identical builds due to the imbalanced nature of fast weapons in a meta where poise does not exist. Though lag is less of a problem than it was in Dark Souls 2, some baffling changes (like not being able to get invaded if you've beaten the boss of an area) make finding certain kinds of PVP much harder. Auto-summon covenants are completely broken, even with several patches to try and alleviate the issue, forcing you to farm for covenant items if you want the rewards (or the achievements).I spent over ten hours farming for items for the  Blades of the Darkmoon/Blue Sentinels . I was never summoned to help someone. I never want to see a Silver Knight again.However, invading as a wild-card Mound Maker or summoning your friends (or being summoned by them) works remarkably well and is great fun. The addition of a password system makes it even easier to find your friends.In some ways, Dark Souls 3 feels like it's got a bit of an identity crisis. It doesn't know if it wants to take the combat of Bloodborne, the PVP of Dark Souls 2, or the world of Dark Souls 1 and just tries a little of each, to mixed results, instead of finding a way to balance all three or try something new. The PVP takes many of the improvements from Dark Souls 2, but decisions that make it more like Bloodborne or Dark Souls 1 result in some of the worst PVP in the series. The combat is fast, like Bloodborne, but removes the viability of slower builds and other changes minimize the usefulness of spells. The world is so attached to that of Dark Souls 1 that it feels like Dark Souls 3 doesn't have a story of its own. Instead of building on, or leaping off the steps established by Dark Souls 1 and 2, the first is focused on almost exclusively.  However, the ways that the story does tie into Dark Souls 2, with the Profaned Capital, Yhorm, Aldia, Smouldering Lake, and two of the game's four endings are impressive.In the end, Dark Souls 3 is a great game and the best in the series. It tries, and generally succeeds, at taking what worked from previous SoulsBorne games and putting them together, but not without serious issues. If this is really the last Souls game (and I hope it's not), it's leaving on a successful, but divisive note.Pros Excellent music and voice acting Impressive visuals Jaw-dropping bosses Interesting characters and stories Some new mechanics (Focus bar, primarily) change combat for the better Massive, mazelike zones with a huge amount of deadly traps and enemies Fun community and co-operative playCons PVP and Covenants really kind of suck due to poor performance or gameplay changes No poise contributes to previously stated problem Game lacks its own identity, struggling to balance between previous entries Lack of diversity in viable builds Game doesn't change for NG+ LOTS of grinding for rare items for covenants Muted color palette Linear path through most of game Got sick of seeing cathedrals"
Positive,"Amazing game so far. Loved Dark Souls, but found Dark Souls 2 quite hard to get into. Dark Souls 3 feels a lot more like true Dark Souls sequel than DS2 did, to me.Visually there has been a major upgrade. The game looks great. Same awesome creature/boss design. The base game seems pretty big. I'll definitely grab the season pass at some point though. One of the only games where I feel like the season pass is worth getting.It's been a long time since I played a game where I found myself looking forward to the next time I would get to play it (probably Dark Souls). It feels good to have a game that is worthy of my time. The Dark Souls series may be challenging, but it never feels like a chore to play through, which the majority of games I have played in recent times have felt like. Most of them have also felt like a waste of money as I lost interest in them before I got my moneys worth. Definitely getting my moneys worth out of Dark Souls 3.Whether you are new to the series, or a veteran player, I'd highly recommend this game.Only negative thing I can say about it is that I am experiencing a persistent stuttering issue (I have a i7 4790K, 16GB DDR3 1600 RAM and a GTX970 4GB. The game is also running off of an SSD). It doesn't really effect the gameplay too much, but it isn't exactly ideal, either.I am not sure if it is network related, or possibly sound related, or will be addressed with new graphics drivers. I recall a similar issue with Dirt 3 that was resolved by installing some 3D audio software. Might hunt that down and try it as a fix.Anyway. Yes. Amazing game so far. Love it!"
Positive,This game is playing amazing on my computer. It runs perfectly with no crashing or anything wrong. Streaming the game is also awesome and it seems there are plenty of people playing it just fine it seems. Not sure why others are having problems. Looking forward to more Dark Souls 3 as I go along.
Positive,BEST GAME EVER! I only wish there was more things in it.
Positive,I've never been a masochist in my life until I play this.
Positive,"well,its been a long time since the game came out and still,its my favorite game ever,nice graphics,good gameplay,especially the soundtracks and boss fights are so badass....Update: in terms of pvp, this game sucks"
Positive,10/10 Would get ganked again!
Positive,"A life changing journey, hours of content for the price. Magnificent.Fabulous game, fantastic series. Buy now."
Positive,I used the red eye orb.
Positive,Hardest boss here is the camera. 10/10
Positive,"The best FromSoftware Game and everyone who played & liked Elden Ring should play Dark Souls 3, since it's actually even better."
Positive,the dark souls of dark souls sequels
Positive,Ever wanted to die over and over again? Do you hate yourself? Do you want to be as addicted to a game as much as drugs? get this game. Do you want to retain your sanity? don't buy it. But Still Buy it either way.
Positive,Better than the second one. But not as good as the first one.
Positive,"If you like Demon's Souls, Darks Souls or even challenging games then this is for you. I loved this installment in the series and am happy to be playing the whole game again and again :). Worth my money.Also after a few patches now the online seems to be working smoothly and I no longer have trouble making my phantoms enter the boss area."
Positive,"god I am a fucking addict and I keep dragging myself back to this awful, facetious franchise. I put off getting this one for years but here I am! and I try so hard to find something else to do but every two weeks I'm right back here where I started. Every I log in I feel like I did /something/ wrong for no reason and I have to create an entirely new character and put another 80 hours into unlocking everything absolutely perfectly minmaxing my levels so I can use my whole favourite build and then everything I could possibly need to counter some other psychopath online, and even if I am not doing this out of insecurity I have to do it because suddenly I should have been investing in hard counters I didnt even know I needed like the pontiff knight curse my fucking life. I need to be institutionalized. Don't be like me"
Positive,"Dark Souls III.Prepare to Die...againand again...and again,and so on.This has improved over Dark Souls II, returning to the aspects of Dark Souls I with a mix of the other previous games all together, with well needed changes.For example; you want to coop with a friend?WELL NOW YOU CAN!There is now a  summon password feature which allows little to no hassle in finding your buddy for some jolly cooperation.Ontop of that, the combat feels faster paced than the previous titles, not as intense as Bloodborne, but pretty darn close. There is defintely some impact felt when you smack someone or something with the weapons, really well done.Graphics wise; the game looks beautiful, although the framerate does dip a bit in some areas and when autosaving.In short;Yes."
Positive,Dark Souls 3 has been an amazing adventure it's a game I can keep putting more and more hours into and still enjoy every second. In Dark Souls 3 I love the references to the first and second games in the series they bring back great and terrible memories. Overall I would say Dark Souls 3 is a titan of medieval fantasy RPG's with its challenging gameplay to its emotional story telling with every monster big or small being able to kill you and every little detail having the deepest of meanings. So yes I would say buy this great game and be amazed at how it can surprise you with every twist and turn it takes. (IMPORTANT) The only thing I would say is play Dark Souls 1 first otherwise you miss a lot of the important plot points in the game.
Positive,"Лучшая игра серии, исправляющая проблемы предыдущих частей и заимевшая от них же только лучшее......чего не скажешь о сломанном ПВП, которое просто кишит читерами и лагающими игроками, по которым удар регистрируется в лучшем случае спустя полсекунды, а бывает и целых три. Максимально убого и неинтересно, хотя справедливости ради стоит отметить, что поначалу будет действительно фаново, но потом - нет."
Positive,So at 63 hours. I'd say I'm very satisfied with the game. Very hooked on it. First game like this I've played.
Positive,Don't get yourself killed. Wouldn't want to see m'work squandered! hehehe.
Positive,worst game ever would recommend 10/10
Positive,if you cant beat the first boss this game isnt for you
Positive,Still no father mask 0/10
Positive,"This game is highly recommended if you want to challenge your existence on this earth, this game also supplies you with many swords and items you will need to kill these bosses, the game is confusing which is why youtube.com is needed alongside this game."
Positive,"DS3 is what got me into the Souls franchise. Now not only do I love DS3, but DS1,2,3 and Sekiro; amongst many other ""souls like"" games (Code Vein)If you like third person RPG action, where every point matters, and the bosses are rough you will love this game.As for it being ""dark souls 3"", I always suggest this as the first souls game new players should start with. Since its on a new engine, and more ""new player friendly"" with mechanics, you won't get lost. But that is not to say the game holds your hand.TL;DR the game goes on sale for 20$ for the deluxe version frequently, GET IT!Update: Lets hope this get the Labor of Love award! The game totally deserves it"
Positive,Elden Ring if it didn't have a half baked open world and painfully mid lore
Positive,i hate homosexuals
Positive,The Firekeeper responds to your gestures.1000/10 this is the Souls game I always wanted.
Positive,"Great game, but how about some cloud saves?"
Positive,I regret sending Greirat to Lothric Castle(ಥ _ʖಥ)
Positive,"i like this games PvP more than the previous 2 souls games however it's not better than Elden Ring PvP.Buy it you wont regret it, over 10k players online after 7 years."
Positive,"The hardest game I know, and the best of all, sure. You can git gut or ask for help, but never give up and take your own time. Worth the price.5 stars for that art (bugs and fu**ing hackers included)☼ PRAISE THE SUN! \[T]/Still alive in 2020 <3"
Positive,"Juego extraordinario, como los otros de la saga. Es difícil, pero quizá, y salvo momentos puntuales, algo menos que el dos (y decididamente menos que el primero).Echo un poco de menos no poder customizar las armaduras pero en general, muy bueno."
Positive,"Gotta be one of the best games I have ever played. Hard, but completely fair combat (you will need a new 'B' button on your controller after beating it). Cool lore, great atmosphere, amazing sound design, great soundtrack, funky armour, good variety of weapons, and just a fun game. Just don't give up at the start skeleton."
Positive,"This is probably my favorite video game. One of the very best character action games of all time, and with so many ways to replay! The multiplayer is tons of fun, especially co-op. Where else can you wordlessly convince a whole game session of strangers to dress up in matching pope outfits and equip flame gauntlets and run into a danger zone and all explode after using the HELLO stone 300 times? Where else can you invade another player and spend 30 minutes trying to find them, and when you finally do, you're both so impressed by each other's respective hiding and seeking skills that instead of fighting, you dance around each other, chug all your estus, and commit mutual ritualistic suicide with clouds of deadly mercury? Dark souls 3 is one of the best horror-action RPGs of all time, but the multiplayer is one of the best comedy games of all time. Nothing else (aside from sometimes other souls games) comes close to this kind of wild and fleeting anonymous multiplayer magic. It's also incredibly beautifully art-directed, the music is pretty good, the sound design is incredible and satisfying, the feel of controlling the character is near perfect in how weighty but responsive it is, the story is fascinating in how it takes the existing lore of dark souls and twists it and recontextualizes it, and the RPG systems are really fun to figure out and all feed back into the gameplay in cool ways. It also has some great level design and by far the best boss fights in the history of video game. I will never forget finally beating Darkeater Midir or Sister Friede after hours of gradually mastering every movement and reaction and attack. Very few games can inspire awe, joy, triumph, fear, and hilarious laughing fits, but this one does all of that. Absolute Game of the Century."
Positive,"its an amazing game, once you figured it out. until that point, it is hell"
Positive,"Good stuff!Edit: After 5 years still good stuff!Edit 2: 8 years, still good stuff!"
Positive,They fixed the servers!!!!
Positive,Best of the 3 souls game for me. Online community is still active and it's pretty fun cooperating with others!! PRAISE the Sun!!
Positive,Fantastic game and a series as a whole.
Positive,10/10 gameFun asf when it's challenging
Positive,"Thank you, Dark Souls"
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is like a sinful love, on one hand, it's the perfected peak of Dark Souls with a plethora of amazing bosses, and two amazing DLCs. On the other, it doesn't feel as creative and new as the other two. And ofc roll spam. Still has a special place in my heart."
Positive,"This is a playable game, if you patient enough, u will find so much thing to do in this game, so many NPC to interact, also many questline"
Positive,If only every game could be so grossly incandescent. Praise the sun!
Positive,Praise the sun!
Positive,"DS 3 is a nice game to play to cool down after a rough day of Slime Rancher.  An absolute must buy, ages 5 and up."
Positive,this game fucking sucks. ive been modding it for 600 hours now and my brain has several centipedes in it
Positive,Hardest game ever.But very entertaining.
Positive,Excellent game.Horrible community.
Positive,"I had many reasons to kill myself before this game, now its only one reason, this game. Thanks Dark Souls!"
Positive,"Discouraged at first as i struggled to kill the first boss and killing Andre the blacksmith ruined my first run, on a second run the game gives a sense of satisfaction once clearing a tough level with many enemies ruining your day. The game has so much depth and is without a doubt difficult but very enjoyable when you watch yourself improve and progress."
Positive,"Fix the hitboxes, have dedicated servers, and fix poise, than you have a pretty solid game. Pvp complaints aside, I love this game.  Buy it."
Positive,Melhor jogo da From. Masterpiece.
Positive,"After playing this game twice now, I can say without a doubt that it kicked my ass both times around. Did I enjoy it? Yes. Yes I did. The characters, story, world, all of them draw me back in no matter how many times I see that dreaded ""You Died"" screen. By far, a better experience than DS/Prepare to Die/Remastered, but I can't say anything about 2 as I haven't played it yet. The PVP feels far less clunky than the first and the rolling and attacking take up less stamina than DS 1, making the game a bit more bareable.All in all, game good. Buy it. The DLC is quite worth the pricetag as well, they each add a new area and at least the second one adds multiple challenging bosses."
Positive,get gud skrub
Positive,worth the money 100%
Positive,Died 10 times on first boss10/10
Positive,"I'll get straight to the point. When they announced Dark Souls 3, my first reaction was ""ok cool, but so quick after the last game?"". I didn't have high expectations, but Dark Souls 3 is in my opinion the best game in the series. It is the most polished, the most balanced, the most EPIC. And it is not just a masterpiece in its own right, it is also a fantastic finale to the series for tons of reason. I won't spoil anything, but the final boss of this game is the best bossfight of all time in my opinion, in EVERY aspect.Dark Souls 3's world design is more linear than Dark Souls 1's, but it still offers at least the same amount of exploration, secrets and optional content. This is great, because it doesn't sacrifice what made Dark Souls 1's world design so special, but at the same time is more guided and balanced. Also because of that the game feels more like a journey from A to B with lots of different branches and obstacles. The level design itself is easily on the level of Dark Souls 1. Often you will arrive at some high point in the world from where you can see most of the other regions, so you always know at what part of the world you are, you are always orientated. This is just great and shows how much planning went into the design of the world of Dark Souls 3.But that is just the mechanical design of the world, visually it is also really unique, although some areas might resemble Bloodbourne, but I can't judge that, because I never played Bloodbourne (I have no PS4). No region feels like filler, every region has its landmarks and epic locations. The only little dissapointing thing is that some enemy types you encounter very early in the game keep appearing throughout the whole game. One of those enemy types is also not that interesting, although if it was just a simple enemy for one area it would be fine. It's not that big of a problem, it is the only criticism I have for this game actually.What I really love about Dark Souls 3 is how they handled the exploration. Item and weapon placement is very clever this time around unlike Dark Souls 2. The time to the next weapon or armor is always short enough that it doesn't get boring, but also long enough that it still feels special and like a reward. Also they removed all of the useless items from Dark Souls 2. All items you find in Dark Souls 3 will be useful to you more or less, depending on your class, but it's not like you find tons of items and always think ""why the hell do you give me this?"". One of the items you will find a lot by exploring is crafting material to upgrade your weapons. Because the world is more linear, the developers could also balance these crafting materials better. You can't get a super upgraded weapon early on, just accelerate the process a bit by exploring and finding secrets, but at some point the developers will give you a lot of the materials of the tier you are currently supposed to be at.There is normal titanite, twinkling titanite and titanite scale. This is also great, because the upgrade system in previous Dark Souls games was unneccessarily complicated. This streamlines the process without sacrificing depth. Also the infusion system has been overhauled and streamlined without sacrificing depth and there are more options now, even if you aren't playing some exotic character or mage/cleric/pyro. Maybe there are too many options to be honest, but this wouldn't really be a problem.Another thing I love is that there isn't a boss every hour like in Dark Souls 2. The motto clearly was quality over quantity. You have to fight hard and long to get to the new boss, and because of that, every bossfight feels special and thankfull the bossfights themselves are all really well made. Every boss has a unique and epic looking bossfight room and the soundtrack is AMAZING too. I just hoped the Lords of Cinder would be a bit more difficult, they were actually among the easier bosses of the game, maybe that is intentional, but it isn't really a problem, because they are still challenging and epic.Apparently online pvp, convenants and all that stuff also has been improved, but I only played offline and don't care about covenants, so I can't judge that. One last thing I want to mention is the selection of weapons and armors in this game. It is just awesome. It's like a ""best of"" of the best armors from Dark Souls 1, 2 and some new ones from Dark Souls 3. From all armors I found and bought, like 70% of them are so good I can't decide which one to use, the others are also really good and don't feel unneccessary, unlike Dark Souls 2 where you found million of different armor pieces from shit enemies which looked like garbage. Again, quality over quantity, overall there are less weapons and armors than in Dark Souls 2, but every single one of them is great.At the end Dark Souls 3 is the most polished, most balanced, most epic entry to the series. For me it is actually even better than Dark Souls 1, and that means a lot, because Dark Souls 1 is also a 10/10 for me. What made this game truly special though, is the final boss. Definitly worth buying at full price."

Positive,"Haven't felt this scared for my life since I got permanently indicted for killing Gwynevere, and It isn't even the invaders that have me scared.10/10 would cower behind a shield like a newbie again"
Positive,"I used to describe the Soulsbourne games to others by saying that they are ""games that hate you.""  I've come to realize that that's not true though.  They are games that respect you; they expect that you're perfectly capable of figuring stuff out, and so they give you the tools you need and then let you figure it out from there.  Souls games punish the arrogant, but if you come to them humble and willing to learn then you will find them to be some of the most rewarding experiences in gaming."
Positive,"​So I'm a rabid fan of the Dark Souls games. There's no denying this fact, not from me or anyone else. I was hooked the moment I played Demons' Souls so long ago, bought a Playstation 3 ​specifically ​to play Dark Souls, pre-ordered Dark Souls II without a second thought, and ordered a steam-controller specifically to play Dark Souls III, which I pre-ordered as well and marked on my calendar the day it was coming out.Basically, if you're looking for an unbiased source on this game's quality, you will not find it here. If you're wondering what a diehard fanboy thinks of this game, carry on.Spoiler alert: I LOVE it. From the lore to the gameplay to the design, I'm as much in love with this game as I was with all the previous Souls games. I love the dark, gritty, decayed worlds of lost sanity that make it seem like your character is wandering through a masterwork art piece. I love the hidden lore that is difficult to pry apart and uncover, granting only glimpses into a deep pool of history, like we're some sort of Dark Age's knight glancing at the ruins of the Colosseum, wondering what beings could both create such wonders and yet not avoid their own demise. I love the brutal, relentless combat that makes you fight for every inch and punishes you mercilessly for stepping a fraction out of line. That adrenaline rush when you're invaded, that sense of accomplish when a boss is defeated, that ever so slow but sure grind out of the pit of hell you've been thrust into only to find the pit never ends as you've become one with the madness.Essentially, Dark Souls III brings back all the best parts of the Dark Souls series and adds some flair of its own. Firstly, it's easier to invade in this game than in previous ones, and covenants aren't as binding as they once were. Players can switch freely between covenants and play for whichever team they want. DS3 also did a better job than DS2 in allowing players to level up their weapons and gear more freely, granting them more options on a single play-through. DS3 eliminated the Soul Memory concept from DS2, which has allowed for twinking to happen again, but it's not that bad in my opinion. I kind of embrace the challenge myself, and even look forward to making anti-twinks, so to speak. DS3 has also added the new feature of weapon arts, which is really a great concept that I've quickly fallen for.But beyond that, it's pretty much the same game, and I'm so, so happy about that."
Positive,"Came for the challenge, stayed for the community. This game was my intro to Fromsoft and at this point I've played all their Souls games with the exception of Bloodborne.Beautiful art direction, amazing boss soundtracks, excellent level design (with very few exceptions), and surprisingly good voice acting. Lore's even pretty mesmerizing though you probably won't think much of it your first time through. Multiplayer is hit or miss, I don't recommend worrying about being serious with it until a couple playthroughs in.If you're unsure about the difficulty, ember up and summon a friend - the lack of voice chat makes it all the more fun. And don't worry about checking forums or wikis - the community is actually very supportive and welcoming, and dare I say unusually mature for a video game fandom."

Positive,"♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'M SITTING AND CRYING. I'M READY TO WRITE A BOOK, MY BEST PHANTOM IN DS. At the new bonfire I found a golden summon of a guy with the nickname something, I decided not to walk for a long time to call for help, he had a fairly standard set, but at the same time he found a spell that took control of any mob. We fought our way through a bunch of monsters, then he showed me a shortcut, and our fight with the giant, where we both almost died, because we had to out-aggro him, you should have seen it. And so after 10 minutes of exploring the loki we reach the room of the leader of the marauder covenant. But you can't enter there while you have a phantom with you... and he takes some special sword and uses its special ability on ctrl, dealing a small amount of damage to himself, piercing himself with this sword (Most likely it's a buff damage or something like that). I see this and don't quite understand what he's doing, he stops and points to the door to the covenant room, like go there. And he pierces himself again, I try to show him with gestures to stop, but he only points to the room again and continues piercing himself with the sword... I couldn't do anything, he was dying before my eyes. And so, when he dealt the last blows to himself, I could only bow to him. He bowed in response and pierced himself for the last time... 10 out of 10, the experience is better than in visual novels"

Positive,"Great game, out of the three from software games I've played(the other two being Sekiro and Elden Ring) Dark Souls 3 stands as in my view the overall best and is just generally a banger game, would recommend. Also praise the sun!"
Positive,this is a masterpiece that i will keep telling tales to my children and grandchildren about it and i will encourge them playing it i finished the game more than 10+ times and i still never get boared easily one of best games of all time <3
Positive,"I beated dark souls 3, and I can say without a shadow of a doubt it is one of the best games I have ever had the privilege to play. I only started playing the dark souls series about 6 months ago, after completing Elden Ring a second time, and I can confidently say that these games have became my most favorite games of all time. I recommend this game to anyone who wants a fun and challenging experience. Here i am hoping Miyazaki makes dark souls 4 lol. whether it happens or not, i can say that I will never regret getting into this series. Thank you Miyazaki and everyone who worked on this masterpiece of a franchise that to many people will consider it one of if not the best game franchise of all time."
Positive,"SPOILERS AHEAD I still find it difficult to form a clear impression of the game, considering that I started my journey with the Souls genre at the end of last year, specifically with the first  Dark Souls Remastered  and  Bloodborne  at the same time (which I will likely return to most often). So, through this writing, I will finally try to reach some consensus.I suppose it all started with Elden Ring. As I began playing, from the very start in Limgrave, I realized, ""No, this won’t do; I need to understand all of this from the very beginning."" Since I didn’t have access to Demon’s Souls on PS3, it was easiest to start with Dark Souls Remastered. As I mentioned, I played Bloodborne simultaneously, partly to overcome my relative dislike of the medieval setting. Despite everything, the dark fantasy setting completely covered this. But the Gothic Victorian setting, Lovecraftian horrors, and numerous plot theories added their variety to the gaming experience. So, what happens if you add even more horror, sorrow, and a sense of inevitability to an already existing world of unavoidable encounters with death? The answer is Dark Souls 3.For context, I will compare it with Bloodborne not only because I played it before Dark Souls 3 but also because these games were released almost at the same time - 2015 and 2016. With the involvement of the same studio and game designer, and at the same time the  CREATOR, FATHER OF THE GENRE, PROPHET AND MESSIAH, PRAISE THE SUN, MIYAZAKI IS A GENIUS! While playing, I was constantly accompanied by the thought that Dark Souls 3 is like being asked to recreate their Magnum Opus (Bloodborne), and everything turned out just right, but... And here ""but"" is not from a negative point of view, but from the point of view of questions that arise. It might be good to break it down into short sub-points, namely:MusicBossesPlotI bring this point up first because, as it became clear to me, music is a reflection and reinforcement of the overall atmosphere. Dark Souls 3 is grandeur and epic. The eternal confrontation of Fire and Darkness, atmosphere, and drama... which are not always a full reflection of the events happening. For example, with Vordt or Pontiff Sulyvahn, there is tension, but there is no change in mood during the battle. The mood of the two bosses does not match the themes playing parallelly. This cannot be said about Friede, Midir, Dancer, or Twin Princes theme. Meanwhile, a year earlier, in a hundred percent ratio, the horror, anxiety, pain, and madness of Yharnam were conveyed. The main disadvantage, in my opinion, was the lack of correspondence between what was happening and what was sounding. This creates a kind of dissonance, making it hard for me to recall a truly captivating melody from Dark Souls 3.I won't stay on how important bosses are for the series and will move on to my opinion. It is immediately noticeable that the bosses are calm, and balanced, each with its approach and key to solving a particular problem. Everything would be great if it did not violate uniqueness and authenticity. Namely - borrowing from (forgive me I didn't mean to) Bloodborne.So, basically:   Friede  is  Lady Maria  on steroids  Midir  is a pumped-up  Amygdala  (not even  Kalameet  or  Ancient Dragon )  Slave-Knight Gael  is  Orphan of Kos  +  Martyr Logarius   Curse-Rotted Greatwood  is  The One Reborn   Oceiros  is  Blood-starved Beast   Lorian and Lothric  is  Ludwig  (that one is a direct hit in my heart)I emphasize that this is not bad at all, each of them has unique abilities. However, the high similarity and borrowing of certain mechanics or movesets somewhat simplifies the understanding or personal approach to overcoming the bosses.I can't complain about the plot because it is wonderful. Many references to the first part, the gradation of the world's degradation as the main part of the game progresses, and interaction with secondary characters is simply magnificent (especially the engagement option - personally, I liked this turn the most). And a wonderful kind of borrowing. Just as we find the Abandoned Old Workshop in Bloodborne, in Dark Souls 3 we have the Untended Graves, where, as for the Doll, we find a comb, so for the Firekeeper we bring her eyes. Quite a cute borrowing, in my opinion.It may seem that above I mentioned facts that I consider more shortcomings for Dark Souls 3 than anything else. Actually, no. It's just the impression that  too much was taken  from what already exists during the creation of certain ideas. It's not Bloodborne on PC, it's not better or worse. It's just... in some places very similar.Answering honestly whether it's a great game - yes, whether it's interesting - yes, whether it's worth playing more than once - undoubtedly. But, the only thing that makes me sad the most -  is that I played Bloodborne earlier than I played Dark Souls 3."

This is basically like the marvel movie of the series, well that's kinda mean, I don't really watch marvel movies. I mean I haven't even seen infinity war or any of the avengers films. Only like Captain America and Iron Man 2 I saw. I think if I were miyazoko, I'd have a better name for this game. I'd call it Elden Ring One, like battlefield 1. And Elden Ring would be Elden Ring 1.5, I think that would be a better representation. Thumbs Up because it was a dark soul, and it gave me a dark soul, I have three dark souls now, all three dark souls."

Great game, great atmospheres, great views, great cutscenes and most of all, great mechanics.

Positive,Masterpiece of a game! It's the most polished of the Souls games and has two of the greatest DLC's ever made. It's definitely worth picking up
Positive,"Do it, We're not all bad. ;)"
Positive,"Dark Souls III is a return to what players love, it has a lot in common with previous Souls games, which can become a bit of a drag for those feeling a little burned out from what has almost become a semi-annualized series at this point. Some environments feel very familiar to previous entries, and a fair amount of enemies make their return without any notable alterations. At times, it can feel like shameless fan service, or an attempt to induce nostalgia in the hearts of players, but for the most part Dark Souls III successfully reminds players why they fell in love with the series in the first place, without resting on their laurels in creating the third entry.PROS:✓ A return to the series roots✓ The best mechanics and overall gameplay in a Dark Souls games✓ Character customization options ✓ Gorgeously dark and atmospheric world✓ Retains the excellent, tactical combat system✓ Best enemy variety✓ Improved a lot of flaws DS1 and DS2 had✓ Magic is now much more useable and fun✓ NPC questlines are the most accessible and the most rewarding out of the whole series✓ Epic soundtrack✓ Visuals look fantastic✓ DLC bosses are awesomeCONS:- Can be on the easy side, unless it's your first souls game- It’s all a bit familiar now- Reused DS1 content"

Positive,"I ended up playing this on playstation so that is why my hours are so low.This is the greatest game ever, aside from sekiro. You should try it."
Positive,"With Dark Souls II feeling more isolated from the first (But by no means a bad game), Dark Souls III hones it back in as the true successor to Dark Souls. Everything about this game is amazing. As expected, FromSoftware have had time to refine the beautiful combat system that makes Dark Souls what it is, and in this instalment, it does not disappoint. Everything is much smoother, with omni directional rolling and a wider variety of unique weapons and spells, everything feels so complete. The boss fights in this game feel very open and free, often with the boss itself being the tether that pulls you into your movement with well timed dodges rather than environmental events. Furthermore, the DLC feels like the cherry on top, featuring an absolutely, indisputably unmissable final boss, that compliments the main game final boss like peanut butter and jelly. This game and it's DLC are a must-have, but by no means should you skip out on the original Dark Souls. This game is close to perfect, but it is not a reason to overlook the classic, which I can easily say is my favourite game of all time. Go play Dark Souls, then come back and play this and it's DLC. Play how you like, run it solo, play with friends, or play with strangers, after all, you can't beat some jolly cooperation. Explore the world, find yourself tinkering to perfect your build, or go for some good old classic fashion souls, but most of all, Prepare To Die."
Positive,After thousands of hours of Dark Souls III on PlayStation i can confirm this game has shrunk my brain capacity to that of a farmyard animals.Best video game of all time.
Positive,"Super fun, amazing bosses."
Positive,"Its just as good as people say. I am a late comer to the souls-like and started with elden ring. And surprisingly, it does pretty good in comparison. Coming from elden ring, i do miss the convenience of a map and a compass. Pretty easy to get lost in some areas like the marsh of Farran Keep without a sense of direction (took me over 2 hours just to find my way around the place). But other than that, the game does live up to its fame. The game strikes a perfect balance between difficulty and satisfaction (once you overcome the hurdle). This is the difference between a well made game and a souls-like wannabe like Nioh 2. Just look at the basic enemies in each area. Every single one is completely different from the others. They have unique move sets, skills and weaknesses/vulnerabilities. The game teaches you to fight them without any hand-holding. I died to the first dancing knight of Irythill about 10 times. And then i never died to them again (not even when they appear in a group of 3). And the bosses!! Oh the Bosses!! I am sure people have made hour-long videos on youtube about the ingenuity of the bosses. The world building and story-telling is awesome. Shortcuts to boss battles or any difficult encounter only serves to increase the player convenience without creating meaningless hurdles like making them go through 50 enemies again and again every time they die to the boss (I am looking at you Nioh 2). If you haven't played a souls game, give this a try. It is a difficult game (you WILL die... SEVERAL TIMES), no doubt; but i can assure you that you will play it again and again."
Positive,Play this game if you hate yourself
Positive,"Ako mojeh da eba taq igra bih  - If I could f*ck this game, I would."
Positive,"After my experiences with Elden Ring, Dark Souls, and Dark Souls II, I expected a lot from this game. after all, i couldn't stop hearing about how amazing of a game it was from countless comments, posts, and videos on the internet.And yet, even with these very high expectations, Dark Souls III blew me away. The Bosses, Level Design, Music, just everything was cranked up to 11. I can't think of many places where i thought, ""this is designed terribly"". Combat has a great flow(as always with souls games), every boss was fantastically designed(except Deacons of the Deep, the only boss i thought was really mediocre.), and i have to again mention the music. The music in this game is just.. godly. It really adds to the feel of many of the bossfights, especially the final boss, when i heard  Plin Plin Plon  in the background of the theme.In conclusion, Dark Souls III is a masterpiece, and i urge anyone who's looking for a challenge to play it."
Positive,Never thought dying could be so addictive :D XD
Positive,Solid Dark Souls game! very fun big sword go swoosh
Positive,"Dark Souls III is honestly one of the best games I have ever played. I came to the Souls series after beating Elden Ring, and after beating both DS1 and DS3, I can say that I love the linear feel to these games so much. In a quick summary, DS3 is already worth playing just because of the bosses. The bosses in this game are unmatched, and each one feels extremely unique and genuinely fun to fight. The areas are unique, the weapons and armor are sick, and the story is outstanding. DS3 makes you feel a sense of loneliness and darkness that only the original Dark Souls can rival. The few issues that DS3 have are very minor, and are covered up by the rest of the game. DS3 is how a sequel should be done! Critically, this is probably incorrect, but in my opinion, Dark Souls 3 is a masterpiece!(If you're coming off of beating Elden Ring, Dark Souls 3 is probably the closest Souls-game to it. They're combat and environments tend to feel similar.)"

Positive,"Best Souls game? No, Very fun game? Heck yeah.Ds3, being the most recent ""Dark souls"" title definitely feels much more beautiful graphics wise (can't beat Majula/Heide's tower of flame) when compared to older titles, along with handling better than the previous ones, even with all of its flaws (god-awful dog ganks or normal ganks, (Irythill and Irythill dungeon in particular), unfun invasion just like previous titles, as many awful bosses as previous titles, etc), however you rarely feel as though these issues hinder the game as it is just that good of a game.All in all, a fantastic game with some obvious flaws, flaws which are mostly all alright to deal (with no game-breaking bugs in general).However, having absolutely adored the world and lore of both Ds1 and Ds2, I have to say that Ds3 definitely feels the worse of them all, with both of these aspects which seems to have taken a backseat compared to gameplay, which can be an improvement for most people, as I do believe that most players look forward to the gameplay more than the lore and world design."
Positive,"Although it is not my favourite FromSoft game, what DS3 may lack in world building, (although the lore and scenery is superb the world feels built around you and - in my opinion- DS3 is less immersive then the likes of the other FS games) it more than makes up for in the boss fights and the AMAZING DLCs. I have at least a thousand hours on this game on console and it never ceases to provide me with quality entertainment.The last fight of the Ringed City DLC - and the Souls series- is so beautifully poetic. DS3 was an astounding write off to these games and manages to maintain a strong Souls identity while re-vamping the combat system, and exploring the identity of the series- with its new perspectives ob hollowing and humanity itself.One thing that has always bothered me about DS3 is that it feels incomplete without the DLCs. The ending can feel sudden, and the last boss fight of the base game is painfully mediocre.8.6/10"

Positive,"This game has made me it's bitch. I've been a fan of the souls series for years from a distance but lacked a controller to actually play the titles until recently. Let me tell you: Life. Changing. Play through. I am obsessed with how this game plays both solo and with friends, it will throw you on your ass over and over again until you've got it and once it clicks, you're showered in rewards and a million new ways to manipulate the enemies and environments. I started Elden Ring which is just as rich if not more in play but I find myself coming back to DS3 simply for the feel of the game mechanics. What can I say besides praise the sun, broes. I'm a changed (dark) soul after 69 hours in this bad boy"

Positive,"Incredible souls experience, I am really glad I chose to enter the genre with this,Visually, the game is actually stunning. Like I am playing it what... 6 years after release? And yes, close details, monsters will show the age but cutscenes? Sceneries? Those are so good-looking, that I just had to press screenshot button.Soundtrack is epic and cool. Probably best moment was during last boss fight when piano starts playing. I was touched deep in my soul by that.Finally, gameplay. It is souls and I have literally almost zero complaints to it, everything works as it should, bosses are difficult by the right amount (I was telling myself over and over again ""If it was not for this mechanic"", which means basically well structured boss fights). Worst problem was with camera (especially felt this problem with Midir), which sometimes unlocks or spins weird way and got me killed.Second problem were lags, my game sometimes just froze 1-4 times for like 10 seconds. Really annoying.Overall, solid experience I would recommend any hardcore player."
Positive,"Within the shadows of Dark Souls 3 lies a realm of unrelenting trials, where the embers of challenge burn brightly. The intricate design and profound intricacies paint a bleak canvas of perseverance and discovery. With each encounter, one delves into a tapestry of triumph and anguish, forging ahead through the abyssal landscapes. The interwoven complexities allow diverse pathways to mastery, beckoning players to fashion their fate through varied builds and strategies. Yet, amidst the unforgiving brutality, a haunting beauty emanates, etching an indelible mark upon those brave enough to tread its desolate paths. In Dark Souls 3, the crucible of hardship births an experience steeped in unparalleled satisfaction and relentless allure. (dragon slayer can suck my toes)"
Positive,"what i liked:+ brilliant world design and connectivity. from software is well known for this aspect of their games and dark souls 3 isn't an exception to it.+ exploration is worthwhile with a lot of optional content, secrets, items and many more to be found. it is basically one of the best games in terms of exploration i've ever played. the maps are big enough to give you the feeling of freedom, but linear and small enough to provide a rewarding experience which won't get repetitive at any point in the game.+ combat is obviously one of the major selling points of this series and it's playing out so well in dark souls 3. really can't complain much, but keep in mind there will be some clunky and odd combat moments, like when you strafe an enemy in combat and punish his hitbox with a backstab.+ an impressive amount of the boss designs were well designed and diverse. dark souls 3 had some of the best bosses i've ever played. friede for example (screw you haters, she's awesome) and gael is probably one of my most favorite bosses of all time.+ enemy and boss variety is decent and the amount of reused content isn't even worth mentioning.+ there is a lot of build variety to be found with many viable weapons and spells. ranging from different types of weapons to several schools of magic. i've had a blast trying out different weapon and greatswords were my absolute favorites. style, damage and stagger.+ interesting and well thought out lore, but as usual for games of the souls series, it's kinda vague and hidden all over the game. definitely worth diving into and the use of a wiki is highly recommended.+ timeless graphics with some minor flaws, which won't matter too much. the artstyle is pretty impressive like all modern from software games are. despite the graphics are looking kinda outdated, the atmosphere is insanely good and the scenery is quite impressive. sadly some the blurry backdrops far away hurt the overall quality.+ orchestral soundtrack and an atmospheric sound design making the game quite scary while delving through these tainted and monster infested dungeons.+ there are some memorable and iconic npcs with interesting quest lines, like the onion knight, londor crew, greyrat and patches, but sadly others are a tad bit uninspired and it feels like they're simply in the game for the sake of being a merchant or a teacher.+ fair bonfire placement is holding the run back at bay.what felt debatable to me:~ some of the hit boxes are kinda odd, i have to admit.~ swamps are no fun in this game (or in any game honestly). constantly slow walking through muddy ground and slow rolling. the cherry on top are status effects like poison (which is kinda fine due to the low damage) or toxic. it's manageable tho if played properly.~ questionable controls for jumping.what i disliked:- the covenants were straight garbage in my opinion. pvp servers are basically down since early 2022 and items / achievements are tied to the covenants.10/10"

Positive,"Dark Souls III is an amazing title, filled to the brim with some of FromSoft's best bosses, music, art, and more! It's also the closest souls title to Bloodborne available on PC (at least in my opinion), so if you like that game, you will probably also like this game, too. I would highly recommend that you play Dark Souls: Remastered before DS3, though, just to give yourself an idea of what this and the later FromSoft Souls games are like (I know Sekiro, BB, and Elden Ring aren't apart of the Souls Series, but they all feature very similar mechanics).Overall, it's a phenomenal package and you will definitely remember this game for years to come after completing it (like any FromSoft game, aside from DS2)! My only major complaint are the lack of Keyboard and Mouse key/button prompts (Yes, I prefer Dark Souls with it and I am sure there are many other people like me), but otherwise, I have nothing else to complain about!93/100 - Some S tier stuff!"

Positive,"Never played Souls genre. Got in touch with it cause I will be buying Elden Ring.Its overwhelming at start but once you get the hang of it,it is actually a really good game with a lot of in depth storylines / mechanincs / questchains.Cant wait to finish it and try DS 1 & 2.If you are asking yourself if it`s worth it: I would 100% suggest you to try it.Just keep in mind that patience is key to success in this game."

Ainda mais sendo uma pessoa que desiste fácil quando há alguma coisa desafiadora, Dark Souls me fez contrariar esse instinto e é EXTREMAMENTE recompensador depois de 6 horas do Nameless King comendo a minha bundinha, finalmente matar ele. É igual droga, cuidado crianças. Mas sim, melhor jogo do mundo, melhor souls, só minha opinião importa."

While the 2nd game is not liked by everyone, the 3rd game is without any doubt the best Soulslike game for many, many enthusiasts of the genre."

Positive,"~SPOILER FREE REVIEW~Not gonna be biased coz I actually 100% this game. The perils of this game has now come to rest, and finally I can sleep in peace knowing that I fully completed this game.DISCLAIMER - NOT SHAMING ANYONE IN THE DIFFICULTY SECTION.. PLEASE DON'T KILL ME :(Gameplay: SOULS BORNE GAME! So, please, DO NOT complain about the controls. This game has good gameplay, you run through areas, following the story, kill enemies, get to bosses, clap the bosses, get to next area etc. The controls are responsive and I can rarely blame the controls if I ever died. There were some points where I would question hitboxes of enemies, but they aren't that many. Overall, solid gameplay, just GIT GUD at rolling and maintaining stamina. Seriously, sometimes I feel that having the liberty to roll a lot just kinda breaks some bosses, but it's balanced coz some bosses, they make your stamina bar look really really small coz no matter what you do, you'd run out of stamina real quick. Story: Ever heard of story being told via reading Item Descriptions? Well, that's how you decipher the major parts of the story. The story told to you is via small cutscenes and you figure out what is going on. Basically, you fill in the blanks, but there are a F*** ton of blanks. I would recommend playing Dark souls 1 (first) coz the story is better.. I'm not saying the story of this game is bad, it's just not a masterpiece, but it is amazing. I bought the season pass too with the deluxe edition and trust me, that was worth my money. The DLCs were great, they had absolutely good lore, areas and boss designs (except a few enemy designs of course) but overall, worth my money. Bugs - NOMultiplayer aspect - I didn't engage with multiplayer much? Because I think this is a 5 year old game and the playerbase is dead? I did get invaded a couple of times, not much, and later due to the RCE exploit, RIP DARK SOULS SERVERS.. So I was playing offline and grinding covenant items (which btw, broke me)Difficulty - Listen to me. THIS GAME IS MEANT TO BE HARD. PLEASE DON'T LET THAT TURN YOU OFF. And tbh, the game wasn't hard for me.. Yea obviously, the game was hard in the beginning when you are figuring stuff out, IT IS MEANT TO BE HARD. The satisfaction you get from completing this game, ok, not the game, but the satisfaction you get for killing bosses who beat you down, is just off the roof. This game tests your patience. 1 wrong move, and that can throw the fight against a boss, or even a normal mob. I threw so many fights when the bosses were a few hits away from death. Be Patient. You will beat them eventually, just, don't be greedy. If you are some whiny, crappy journalist type of guy who just cries while playing easy mode and or judges games based on their difficulty and or just like OMG THIS GAME SO HARD ITS BS, don't even consider playing this game. I am not shaming you, I'm telling you that this game is not for you. This is when you should consider your taste in choosing video games. You don't like a game, you don't have to play the game, and or hate on the game. This game (for those people who don't know) have a system where when you die, the souls you have on you, drop on the spot or near to where you die, and you respawn at the last bonfire you rested at (basically checkpoint). You die one more time before getting those souls, well, say goodbye to it. This is meant to be a way of teaching you that you made a mistake the first time, and you died then, this time, when you were given a chance, you didn't learn from your previous mistake and made the same or a different mistake again. This game doesn't have BS difficulty, it is just meant to be that way.Music - SPECTACULAR MUSIC DURING BOSS FIGHTS100% COMPLETION DIFFICULTY - 7/10 - HARD - COZ OF THE FARMING YOU GOTTA DOFINAL SCORE - 9.5/10 - AMAZING Good Luck my friend, and Don't You Dare Go Hollow :)Praise the Sun"

Positive,Freaking Love this game. Seriously one of the best releases of 2016.
Positive,point down meta
Positive,most from games are Akin to skyrim meaning no matter what console i have dark souls is on there
Positive,"You wont be dissapointed. Exceptional story, music, gameplay, characters."
Positive,"Days 2 of trying to kill Vordt of Boreal Valley／ﾌﾌ 　　　　　　 　ム｀ヽ/ ノ) 　）　ヽ/ ｜　　( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°）ノ⌒（ゝ._,ノ/　ﾉ⌒7⌒ヽーく　 ＼　／丶＿ ノ ｡　　 ノ､　｡|/　　 `ヽ `ー-'_人`ーﾉ　　　 丶 ￣ _人'彡)"
Positive,"Would i recommend this game for new players or previous souls players? Yes. Would i recommend this game for people looking for long-term replayability? Absolutely not. An amazing first playthrough experience, which quickly becomes saturated and boring due in part to the extremely linear level design and little early-mid game build variety. Imo the worst souls game overall, but if you're looking for a fun 40-50 hour game or to pvp, go for it."
Positive,"It's the worst in the trilogy in my honest opinion, but i have enjoyed every minute since pontiff sulyvahn and even though its my least favourite in the trilogy it has got to be one of the most fun games I've ever played. if you enjoyed dark souls 1 and 2 the faster combat and the overwhelmingly linear approach might be hard to get used to but it is excellent once you arrive in the irithyll of the boreal valley and doesn't slow down. 8/10"
Positive,Fuck nameless king
Positive,"One of the best games I've ever played. I love Sister Friede btw. Best Girl, Boss, Fight (imo) <3"
Positive,i am the one who paints
Positive,"Good game ahead,therefore try."
Positive,Hard but fun
Positive,"woah big boss, lot of troll, need to roll. do your best is not good enough for this game. it one hardcore lovely game."
Positive,The End of Fire And The End of my life too
Positive,I would rip off a baby's face to forget about this game so I could play it all over again. Shit's great.
Positive,souls that are dark
Positive,"Amazing game with a splendid story, I would recommend it to anyone that seeks a challenge and has some time to spare"
Positive,dark souls 3
Positive,"Played this game for hundreds of hours on console so decided to re-buy for pc. Absolutely love it, both on and offline features are enjoyable. Can't recommend this enough for someone who wants a challenge, or even if you're not. The whole aesthetic, the visuals, the soundtrack, it's a whole experience and I've loved it all throughout."
Positive,"Ok i absolutely love this game. It has a mix of fighting, exploring, and it even made me sad when... sorry i dont want to spoil. In addition i love the way you can fight and dodge attacks and use various different weapons and potions. Every boss is fair. Wait.... There is this boss called ""Darkeater Midir"" he is well, he is a bull**** boss. This is the boss and the ONLY boss that is unfair and it is a stupid boss and he is almost impossible to defeat good luck."
Positive,"After like 3 years of putting it off i finally decided to do dark souls 3 and every boss, i have a few notes.note, i was using a sharp caestus with a miracle build doing this1: ashes of ariandel is really fucking easy, and sister friede is easy if you have a weapon that doesnt attack every 4 seconds (UGS)2: ringed city is full of enemy spam that do 1000 damage and have like 3k+ so its just a fucking slog3: midir sucks ass and very much feels RNG based idk how i killed his ass with caestus first try4: im never gonna stop playing with caestus."
Positive,wher elden ring...
Positive,"It's a great game, play it."
Positive,"Dark Souls III was a solid-ass entry to this series. As the finale of the Dark Souls series, (so we're told), it pakcs a punch. From the very beginning of the game, facing off against Iudex Gundyr, up to the very end, taking out Slave Knight Gael, there wasn't a moment I could put this down. This is another one that I bought after already getting all achievements on PS4, and I still have 100 hours in it on PC because it's just that good. The game is much more fast-paced than its predecessors, and there's hardly a moment to take a rest when you start a playthrough. The co-op was also improved a ton in this game, simply requiring a password to play with your friends. Overall, this game was by far the most advanced in quality of life changes, and as a result, feels like it has the least ""bullshit"" moments where you die out of seemingly nowhere or from some buggy game mechanic or area.Cinematic playthrough here:"
Positive,I LOOOOVEEE ITTTTTTT :)
Positive,This shit is really impressive
Positive,After playing this game for free due to steam family sharing for 216 hours i can confidently say this game is kind of fun.
Positive,A thick knight killing shit 10/10
Positive,i hate this game bu t its pretty
Positive,"I LOVE THIS GAME, NOTHING I LOVE MORE THAN GRINDING SOULS TO IMPROVE MY STATS/TOOLS & KEEP RETRYING BOSSES UNTIL I SUCCEED. I HAVE NOT FINISHED IT BUT I AM THOROUGHLY ENJOYING IT. THE VISUALS OF THE GAME IS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING & THE SCENERY IS SO EERIE YET COMFORTING. I DO IN FACT WISH I LIVED THERE. 10/10 BUY IT!"
Positive,"Fast, u need to finish this masterpiece before Elden Ring came out"
Positive,прикольно и классно но комьюнити слабое.
Positive,it's always fun to come back for both pvp and pve never gets boring with a big variety of builds and setups.
Positive,Muito bom. Dark Souls te prepara pra vida. Toda vez que você cai ele te ensina a levantar e ser trouxa o suficente pra ir lá apanhar denovo! Que lição!
Positive,I hate this game
Positive,really just the dark souls of high-fantasy action RPGselden ring please come out my will to live is fading
Positive,"If you want to relax and have a great time, give this one a try you won't regret it ! 10/10 would rest at bonfire again !"
Positive,elden ring is waiting
Positive,Liar aheadTherefore thrust
Positive,this game is the dark souls of dark souls play now or promptly be executed for crimes against humanity also ik where you live i give this game a dark souls/dark souls
Positive,I am bad at it. I despise this game with my entire being. i hate this game.
Positive,Praise the sun
Positive,This game is kinda good :)
Positive,I hate this game
Positive,"Dark Souls has always been one of my favorite franchises, Dark Souls 3 nonetheless is an amazing piece, with great graphics, top tier gameplay and incredible sound design. Would recommend it? Most definitely, it's a superb experience. And contrary to popular believe, it's not hard, just needs patience to learn how to play it"
Positive,"I have just finished ng+4 and now have all the achievements, and let me tell you. I might have 156 hours and I might be not experienced enough to call myself a good dark souls player but this was one of the best games I have played in my life yet.It drives you forward as you keep dying and trying again and again as you learn through failure and this is the feeling I have been looking for this whole time. Achieving something you are battling for, something you kept trying on doing feels better than sex.I sat through the whole credits when got the dark soul achievement."
Positive,Miyazaki pls have my babies
Positive,fun game but dancer of boreal valley can suck my dick and balls
Positive,Good game to relax to.
Positive,Better than maths
Positive,"Nothing beats the feeling of getting killed 15+ times by an enemy and then finally killing him , just to die to a guy hanging on a roofWould die again!"
Positive,Dont Play if you have Anger issues like me...
Positive,This is the type of game where if you change your PC roguelike mode is activated and you NEED TO START ALL OVerrhjfgkjsh ngiojsdrhgio sdhgoi . Good.
Positive,"Да, иногда можно и попутешествовать, но нельзя бродить по миру вечно.Даже тебя наверняка кто-нибудь ждет дома."
Positive,i hate those hp sucking women in irithyll dungeon
Positive,"The pinnacle of the series. If you haven't played another other Souls games, this is the one. Not nearly as hard as it's made out to be, just learn patience."
Positive,praise the sun! \o/
Positive,"game hard me noobnvm guys, i got good 😎"
Positive,"hard, not the game tho"
Positive,"Definitely the best Souls game for its complete package - very replayable. Definitely worth given that its on sale. Story is second to only Dark Souls 1 and online is great too. Combat, movement, and sandbox system is best in the series in my opinion. Good as lad but frick Midir.Also give bloodborne a pc port."
Positive,"It's just one of the greatest games that have ever been made, an absolute masterpiece of game design and dark fantasy literature.I've had a few special words to say about Dark Souls II a couple of weeks ago but Dark Souls III is just a classic, there is no way I will be able to convey my emotions or thoughts about this game in this small text box.+ it has one of the best soundtrack albums in gaming history imo, really this game is something else and even though this is my 4th or 5th playthrough -I don't remember really :< but it's obviously my first on Steam- I played through it with the same anticipation and addictiveness."
Positive,"after spending thousands of hours in this series, i know is is th emost love-hate game for me for many reasons. some of the worst bosses and areas and the best bosses and areas. controls and movement, action etc. are 100%. possibly my favorite dark soul game. play it if you are interested. ."
Positive,pvp makes this games replay ability endless if u aint trash
Positive,"This is not a race, this is a marathon.   You will lose, but to quit is to accept failure by default, which is the ultimate loss.   By tackling the adversity, by challenging yourself, through planning, resolve, and memorization, you will perfect the art of adaptation. This game is merely a reflection of your own survival in an equally cruel world. Will you fall by the wayside or will you choose  Pyromancer  and laugh your way through the game? That is the ultimate question.  You will choose Pyromancer, you filthy swine."
Positive,Very good game very amazing now pls give me dlc i am amazing
Positive,"I wasted 100+ hours on this game and I'm not cursed yet, I guess thats a W."
Positive,Play the game.This is a threat.
Positive,hit with sword
Positive,Best souls game !!!
Positive,"This game is wrong on so many aspects such as:This game is super hard and the reason of that is probably my fists dealing only 1 damage,The first boss of this game Iudex Gundyr is just so hard to beat on my 97th attempt(76.5th hour) i finally got him"
Positive,It's just like animal crossing!
Positive,fuck this stupid game
Positive,10% pain20% pain15% concentrated power of pain5% pain50% pain100% reason to remember the P A I N
Positive,Pain and suffering.good game :)
Positive,I want to die
Positive,10/10 would die again
Positive,Hello my name is Joshim 26 and i was still living by my motherDark Souls 3 is a really good game.After i beat this game many attractive woman came to me. I was a giga chad.This game is good. It has a good dificulty and a good gameplay. It is worth a buy.Because of this game i have now a Girlfriend. Thanks Obama
Positive,"Probably the most replayable entry in the series because of how linear it is which can be good or bad depending n how you see it, you won't get the sprawling interconnectivity from DS1 but you will get the best boss lineup in souls and a very replayable game with a lot of fun playstyles."
Positive,"Absolutely great game. Exceedingly frustrating at first, especially if you're going in blind. After you get the hang of it though it becomes extremely addicting and very fun, especially for hardcore gamers who like a real challenge. The bosses and the lore of the game are very deep and it makes it that much more fun when you truly understand the bosses you fight and understand their lore and where they fit into the story. 10/10."
Positive,This game tickles my taint
Positive,Almost smashed my wardrobe to bits. 10/10 would ng+9 again
Positive,yeah its pre gud people
Positive,"People say it's hard because you die a lot. I say dying is part of the gameplay. If you die a lot, you aren't doing anything wrong, you're just learning how to progress. It certainly doesn't hold your hand, and it's one of the harder games out there, but don't let the difficulty scare you away."
Positive,"Fine challenging gothic/dark fantasy metroidvania with an emphasis on melee combat.Not as hard as everyone makes it out to be but I might have been very over leveled the whole game.I don't think its really worth $60, especially as someone who prefers story based RPGs. The combat is fun but NOT realistic as some people like to describe it.Pros:-Well made / few bugs- PvE feels balanced- lots of outfit and weapon varietyCons:-anime feel/way over exaggerated -some enemies should not respawn but do (looking at you summoners in the ringed city)-graphics are a bit outdated-very poor keyboard and mouse support (no keyboard button prompts, only controller)"
Positive,It is a FromSoftware game.Hidetaka Miyazaki worked on it too.There is nothing more to say.
Positive,this game is harder then jeffrey epstein in a kindergarden. 10/10
Positive,needs more sun men
Positive,"Based Dark Souls 3.This is a game with replayability in mind. It's not as immersive as the first game, and it's not as experimental as the second game. It's the refined formula of the series. It's made for interacting with other players. If you haven't played any Dark Souls yet, this isn't a bad place to start.It has serious depth.If you two hand weapons, you get a strength and damage bonus, but lose the use of your off hand.If you one hand weapons, you risk enemies and other players attacking through your attacks, but have more mobility. If you choose spells, you get AOEs, powerful missile attacks, and can enchant your weapons for tons of damage. But you lose mobility when you have to refill your mana and recast.You can also min-max your physical attributes by using items for buffs. Or limit your level to negate the drawbacks of your character.This is a game for people that like to plan builds. Stats are interconnected.What I enjoy most about this game, is all of these mechanics are sourced, and they don't feel like novelties. They don't borrow from old frameworks. IE. this isn't a reskinned God of War. Nothing close.Also, because of this depth and replayability.. I believe this is the best soulsborne game released yet."
Positive,"Why aren't you playing Bloodborne!Seriously though, this game has some of the greatest bosses in any souls game, especially the DLCs."
Positive,Has the best bosses of the series in my opinion. Can't wait for elden ring!
Positive,it gud game yuo can use big hammer or cool spell. 10/10
Positive,"Praise the sun, it's a really good closing to souls series, the overall level design & boss mechanic is really good"
Positive,best game :D
Positive,"I AM FUCKING LOOSING MY GRIP ON REALITY, MY LIFE DOES NOT LOOK REAL ANYMORE AND I AM GOING INSANE.10/10 would recomend"
Positive,I refunded this game once. Now I praise the sun.
Positive,the plunging attack is the best move in the entire game also dex builds my balls
Positive,git gud or die trying
Positive,"Finally something challenging that made me stress and try hard to win every battle. It's the first souls game I have played but so it's a new experience for me. I was tired of all the hand-holding in ,any modern game and unless you play multiplayer games you won't find many that test your skills quite like this one (except others in the series and a few others that I can count on fingers of my one hand). I haven't completed it yet and I have two more bosses to beet (namely Nameless King and Soul of Cinder) but I really anticipate it."
Positive,this game is SO EASY i dont know what the corndog you guys are all on but you guys must be smokin some goooooooooood corndog if you think this game is hard. ITS SO CORNDOGGING EASY. HOLY CORNDOG why do so many people complain about how hard this easy corndogging game is. LIKE LITERALLY MADDEN NFL IS PROBABLY HARDER THAN THIS CHILDS GAME.
Positive,"Dark Souls is such a touchstone for the video game industry that journalists’ constant references to the game have become a meme. Word-of-mouth buzz and a marketing campaign led by the tagline “Prepare to Die” saw Dark Souls become an unlikely hit in 2011. Seven years on, the price is still being paid. There have been two sequels, an endless array of merchandise, an army of writers and video-makers dedicated to dissecting the game’s mysteries and now Remaster.The game is famous for the wrong things. Dark Souls is an inversion of the kind of stories games usually tell. It constructs a meticulous dark fantasy world in which almost everything is trying to kill you. The challenge lies not in conquering it but in surviving it and trying to understand it. It is opaque, even mystical; true comprehension always feels just out of reach.For those familiar with the game, playing through again is a stark reminder of just how flabby Dark Souls’ imitators, and even its own sequels, have become. The world of Dark Souls is almost one landmass, with few loading screens, and the way it intricately twists around itself is an architectural feat. The spaces are cramped, the enemies placed like chess pieces. No video game world feels quite so solid, so marvellous to unravel and so plausible as Lordran.A major part of this is the weird and unsettling aesthetic. Lordran is a ruin, an abandoned remnant of what was once the gods’ playground. The bosses can be inscrutable monsters, but more often they are mighty wrecks of eras long gone: a giant wolf guarding her master’s grave; two knights standing guard in the throne room of a desiccated reign. Eventually, you’ll meet the greatest minds, the shapers of this world’s history, all mad and feral."
Positive,"try finger, but hole"
Positive,It's pretty good
Positive,when the fire keeper is sus (′ꈍωꈍ‵) sussy baka
Positive,Its just a little bit vexing some times
Positive,"Finished main story without dlc. It feels really different from previous parts in a good way. Mobs are pretty unique from area to area and require different approach. Game really punishes you for mistakes. Level design is great, like you never get lost and have idea where to go. Lore-wise, there is a lot of references to first part. Some bosses are quite challenging. Easily best souls part for me.DLC Update:Expected to be as long as in previous parts. A bit dissapointed. Ashes of Ariandel boss is hardest bost I ever met in this series. After that boss everything feels easy xDP.S. I wish the game explained better things like: soft caps, i frames, elemental resistances and how scaling works (I only found out in elden ring that DEX buffs casting time and overall has higher scaling than STR)"
Positive,So easy. You literally have an invincibility button you can spam every second. How do you even die
Positive,I must say this is a great game and will probably still be thriving up until 2024 but I have to tell the people reading this that this is not a game for casual players and that if you are a new Dark Souls player you might want to watch a few videos and tips not spoilers but tips and I remind you that this is just a great game and you should play it. I hope this was helpful and I hope to see you in he dark souls world!
Positive,this game is great i got loads of hard ones and released a hard amount of loads the characters are dangerous but applealing to my labido to the point were i am now darksoulsexual and will only fuck my wife if she dresses as one of the villans from this spleugous game
Positive,It's like all those anime with overpowered protagonists.Except you're not the protagonist.
Positive,S O U L - C R U S H I N G <3
Positive,"if you're a masochist or just really good at really fucking difficult games, you're gonna love this. bruh i can't even get past the first boss. i've tried over and over and i just end up putting the controller down in complete defeat. if i hadn't bought it on sale, i would've refunded lmfao. beautiful graphics and great lore, sfx and bgm are insane as well! this is the first game that's had me on edge and actually caused my adrenaline to act up while playing. taking a fat break on playing this though, it got me hella stressed. gonna wait until i have the patience and dignity to try again... and again... and again.. and aga"
Positive,"Jogo RPG com a melhor jogabilidade da franquia Soulsborne, com gráficos muito bons (principalmente considerando que foi lançado em 2016) e nem é pesado.Para quem gosta de PVP, o sistema ainda está bem ativo. Já, para quem não gosta, dá para desativar o modo Online, caso queira recuperar a forma acesa (equivalente a restaurar a humanidade) do boneco (pena que, com isso, você se sente um pouco ""sozinho"" e não consegue ajuda por Coop). Se quiser jogar no modo online com um amigo, prepare-se para ser invadido várias vezes.Mais completo que os demais da franquia (inclusive as DLCs são ótimas) e você pode rejogá-lo várias vezes para seguir caminhos diferentes de quests (não são muitas, na verdade), obter diferentes recompensas e atingir finais diferentes (são 4 no total, mas exigem uma série de condições).Possui uma wiki em português. Aconselho a acessá-la para aproveitar melhor o jogo (a não ser que não goste de spoiler).Considero-o o 2º jogo mais difícil da franquia (apenas perdendo para o Bloodborne). É, também, menos emblemático que o Dark Souls 1.Vale muito a pena comprá-lo, mas fique de olho nas promoções, que são constantes e incluem as DLCs."
Positive,"DS 3 has a good atmosphere and the fights are challenging, but fair. I had some frustrating moments, but it was fun."
Positive,pontiff did nothing wrong
Positive,"Thank you, this game keeps me alive, the struggler it made me learn that how to facing a life as 20s, thank you dark souls"
Positive,My friends join my game to watch me struggle with 3x health bosses
Positive,"""I wonder when Uncle Gael intends his return. I hope the new painting will be to him a gentle home.""When you think you've beaten the game, but it's quite the other way around."
Positive,10/10 so much better than fucking elden rings
Positive,Much better than Elden Ring.
Positive,i like pain now
Positive,Go on a quest to find your own Sun... Praise the Sun!!
Positive,"was in a horrible place before i put 200 hours in.. life changing, im in a even darker place."
Positive,"It feels very hard at the beggining (espacialy if this is your first fromsoftware game) but ohhh boyy,  if you fight through... It becomes one of the most rewarding experience you can get from a video game. Do not give up. And if you fail, Fight again!+Greate game to start fromsoftware soulborne genre.+Deep and meaningful story.+Beautiful world setting and above decent graphics.+Diverse Gameplay lots of rpg build options.-Might trigger some anger problems.9.5/10"
Positive,"I liked the one part where i died it made me feel funny, and i liked it..."
Positive,"Already played ds3 on xbox, it was amazing. God the Dancer is so fucking hot holy shit pls let me see bobs."
Positive,Farron Keep is smelly
Positive,in the 3 hours i've played i've only beat the tutorial
Positive,"It's a Dark Souls game I mean come on, why would anyone give it a negative review.....Do not conclude my level of skill to my amount of hours played... I did try..."
Positive,"Very good, very hard."

Positive,GOOD GAME BURT PONTIF SUS XDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Positive,love it so much
Positive,Hard but fun : )
Positive,dark souls 3 is best game and  buteful stores in the world thanks steam
Positive,"It is a masterpiece. Very solid design in during whole game - graphics, physics, difficulty, epicness. 9/10"
Positive,"It's a very good game, especially with the fast movements and the varied environments/bosses. I can recommend for people who do not immediately give up and ask themselves what the hell is this, I only die in this game. P.s, I love you Midir from Ringed City DLC"
Positive,"From Software tried to integrate almost everything criticized for Dark Souls 2 and praised for Bloodborne, and it was very successful in this masterpiece. Returning to the series, director Miyazaki's experience from Bloodborne has a noticeable impact. Everything aside, it is the best RPG game I've played so far, with its enchanting atmosphere, magnificent boss fights, and epic orchestra. It is by far the best game of the trilogy for me."
Positive,"Pretty nice game, had so much fun playing alone, AND WITH FRIENDS PvP can be a hustle, but pretty fun if you get the hang of itThe souls series are an experiment that we should all try, it can teach us so many things like never giving up, always trying to become better and better and beating our hard difficulties So yeah, if you have never played a souls game, You're in for a treat ;) Have fun and enjoy!"

Positive,i love when john became the dark soul and gael said give me your dark soul in dark souls 3
Positive,"If you like getting your shit pushed in when you totally hit the dodge button then this game is right up your rectum. Experience hours of mind boggling ""That's bullshit I totally hit him first!"" but then the infamous YOU DIED shows up on screen. In total 3 words GIT GUD SCRUB"
Positive,"I hate this game, I love this game."
Positive,Definitely the hardest game I have played but definitely one of my favorites.
Positive,"Yes, indeed. It is called Lothric, where the transitory lands of the Lords of Cinder converge. In venturing north, the pilgrims discover the truth of the old words: ""The fire fades and the lords go without thrones."" When the link of the fire is threatened, the bell tolls, unearthing the old Lords of Cinders from their graves... Aldrich, Saint of the Deep... Farron's Undead Legion, the Abyss Watchers... And the reclusive lord of the Profaned Captial, Yhorm the Giant... Only, in truth... the Lords will abandon their thrones... And the Unkindled will rise. Nameless, accursed Undead, unfit even to be cinder. And so it is, that ash seeketh embers."
Positive,"This is my favourite game. It's is the best game I have ever purchased, and I enjoyed my time with it. I started playing a couple years back, and it helped by being something to do in a rather unhappy time in my life. I remember coming home from late night shifts at my job, and just spending a couple hours in the evening just playing dark souls. It always felt surreal, and I found solace during those evenings.I feel that I have to mention this something. I regret attacking Hawkwood, I thought he was a bad guy. Turns out that he's just a sad guy. It was one of the only NPC's I didn't get to spend time with throughout my first playthrough. All the NPCs are well designed and have good intertwined backstories.Sometimes the Internet would stop working, and I wouldn't be able to play online. I once missed the achievement for the crystal sage because of the internet. PvP and Co-op is a pillar of the overarching Dark Souls III experience, and I have spent countless hours playing with others. I've enjoyed helping new players online, and I've enjoyed throwing dung as a Spear of the church till my opponent suffers from toxicity. Slowly but surely,I have managed to kill all the bosses in the base game solo, through patience and practice. I genuinely think that this game has been a stabilizing aspect in my life during some rough times. Nowadays, it's the game I go to when want to relax and just feel alright. I always know that I have the beautiful worlds of lothric and ariandel waiting for me when I need them.Ratings for Dark Souls III:Gameplay: 9.5 Plot: 2/10  Lore: 9/10 (To be honest, most of the time. Lore>Plot)Loading Screen: 10/10 (This is the benchmark for all other loading screens, as it familiarizes the player with equipment)Art Style: 9/10As a Game in General: 10/10 (This is the benchmark for all games)As an RPG: 9/10As a Soulslike: 10/10 (By definition, FromSoftware made the benchmark for soulslikes)"
Positive,A long time ago I had this in shared library.. I remember I couldnt even defeat the first boss xD
Positive,It's the Dark Souls of video games.
Positive,My favorite of the 3 souls games. I would argue it's also the best one for beginners to any Souls-borne type games!
Positive,"Hard game, really worth the effort. Definitely try it out if you'd like a challenge from a really polished game."
Positive,"John Souls the Third goes on an adventure to make a bunch of siblings who hate each other, a 4 meter tall man, a weird slug looking thing and crippled twins sit on very fancy chairs so he can kill god and set himself on fire, with the help of a blind blonde woman, a short guy with no legs, an old lady who snorts ashes and a chad blacksmith10/10 would die to Nameless King again"
Positive,try finger but hole
Positive,"man so good fixed my marriage wife loves me now, kids happy thanks michael zaki"
Positive,"Game was good i guess. If you get to the big dragon at the end, I'm pretty sure they just added him as a practical joke and you don't and shouldn't fight him."
Positive,It is CBT in the form of a video game but in the end. it's a good game all around.
Positive,"This is one of my favorite games. A little bit hard but a very good game. And of course the graphic is also awesome.If you start playing with it, you can't stop. Okay sometimes you will rage, I think, but all in all this is a really good game. So I can only recommend it."

Positive,"It is honestly one of the first games I sunk so many hours into.The gameplay may be slow at first. You WILL die a lot first time playing this. But don't let that drag you down. The reason why so many people fall in love with the game is because of the overwhelming odds against you. Because if you don't quit and decide to overcome them no matter what, when you finally do the feeling of satisfaction is unparalleled to that of most other games."
Positive,"\[T]/Well its more dark souls. Now in a environment more comparable to Bloodborne.The environments are looking awesome and are huge and detailed. The level design is excellent, as in the other games, as all areas are connected to one another. The bosses have awesome desings and are way faster and ferocious. Also weapons and the different weapon arts feel a lot better. Sure the dark souls series is hard, but not as godly hard as a lot of players, especially game journalists say (except the Nameless King, but he is a optional boss so...).I played all soulsgames, except demons souls and all are challenging. But when you learn patterns and try different weapons etc. its easy. As soon as it ""clicks"", youll be faster in the next new game plus run than you expected. For me personally, pvp is always the most interesting thing anyway. Playing hide and seek during invasions, or just have some pvp fights, gets never old. The game overall feels like a huge fanservice for longtime fans of the series.DLC's:Ashes of Ariandel is a bit short. And the last boss (Sister Friede) is really the only outstanding part imo. The environments are good, but thats all.The Ringed City has one of the best environments in the game and good bossfights. It gives an impression of the grand scale of the city, but you only really visit what amounts to outskirts, what is a bit disappointing. But has one of the most annoying enemy you will ever play against, (Angels))."
Positive,"This game helped my reaction time, not just for this game but others!That is why I recommend this game."

Positive,my wife left me after i started playing this game
Positive,A masterpiece <3I took a break from MMORPG games because of the toxicity and politics.  This game has been a therapy to me.
Positive,"What a journey, it is indeed a beautiful, difficult game. It challenges you since the beginning, but its rewarding and it grow on you, a couple deaths in and you are already hooked up, It has one of the most well designed and hardest Bosses of the series. The story its there for you to find, you must read items and read dialogs to find pieces of information, I think this add to the grueling world of darksouls.This game its a masterpiece, whenever you are fighting a boss, dodging a giant arrow on anor londo or simply invading someone on multiplayer it will leave a memorable moment.Praise the Sun!."

Positive,"Dark souls 3 is one of the best games i have ever played. after playing dark souls 1 and 2 prior to this, getting to experience the finale to this series was amazing. the gameplay in dark souls is unlike any other game i have ever played after my first 10 minutes of gameplay in dark souls 1 i got enthralled in this universe wanting to know every small detail about the world and its inhabitants. dark souls 3 really ups the pace of combat compared to the last two games which is a good thing and the bosses where extremely challenging and engaging. there where so many iconic characters and locations through out the whole series. honestly i would recommend this game to anybody 10/10 near perfect game. ""Praise the Sun"""
Positive,"If you hate yourself and like difficulty in your life, this game is for you!"
Positive,great chest ahead
Positive,Plin Plin Plon ahead
Positive,DARK MEN 3
Positive,Definitely recommend this game. This was my first soulsgame that I have played and it was a wonderful experience. Progressing through the game is difficult but rewarding.
Positive,if you love pain and suffering then this is the game for you! it also looks so much better on pc. I came from consoles to pc and my friend bought this game for me and I haven't been able to stop playing it.
Positive,"Never in my entire life have I been so unhappy, upset, distraught, yet thrilled, amused, and hard at the same time. I have lost my mind in the near 100 hours I have spent that sometimes I hallucinate that I am in Lothric. The bosses are some of the best I've fought, the view is fantastic, and the music is just breath-taking. The lore is another rehash of the other Dark Souls games with a sprinkle of their own ideas. If I could, I'd play this game with fresh new beginner eyes so that I can feel something again. This is one of the games that is ""Must Play."" My one issue is with PVP. Fuck PVP."
Positive,its not that hard
Positive,"Going 99 strength is a valid playstyle, I promise."
Positive,Best game in the trilogy.
Positive,"death ahead, don't give up required ahead!"

Positive,"This was my first FromSoftware game. Before going into it, I always thought Dark Souls was a franchise for people who had extreme amounts of patience and will power, but after just a few hours into the game, I could see how my thoughts couldn't be farther from the truth.This is not a game only for people with extreme reflexes, perfect eyesight and inhuman reaction times, but it's a game for people who are willing to learn from the it and adapt. Hell, I don't even have good reflexes and I was able to play it. If this is your first time playing Dark Souls, this is absolutely a good place to start.If you are having doubts about picking it up because of what you hear about difficulty, don't worry, it's not as hard as game journalists and other people make it to be. It can be hard, but only if you are not willing to adapt and learn from your mistakes.Praise the Sun!"
Positive,"DS3 was the first souls game I've encountered and man am I stunned but how incredible the game is. I not only had an amazing experience with the game but it also introduced me to the world of SoulsBourne. Quite frankly there's nothing bad I can say about the game except maybe once in awhile the player may get lost in the maps since some of them are quite confusing if you're not great with remembering locations. Other than that, the combats are great and I love how the game allows you to have a variety of builds to choose from and that completely changes the way you play the game, but that's just the element of souls like games. Some players may get frustrated with some of the boss fights but I gotta say most of them are pretty interesting. Although the final boss (not dlc) may be a bit underwhelming after beating the nameless king, (The most fun I had with but also ironically the most I struggled with.) it was still an interesting boss fight. The lore are compelling and it really changes the way you look at some of the characters in the game. The graphics are stunning and the character designs are amazing needless to say. DS3 may not be the most challenging game in the series but I still had a blast and it truly is a timeless masterpiece."

Positive,Best game i ever played.
Positive,"OK FINE! Dark Souls is a good game... blah :) You, the internetz, are right...I just needed to be in the right mindset.Hard? Not really. It does change it up that you lose your exp (souls) when you die (if you didn't comment them.) If this was a normal game with auto-save, then people would just blast through the game.I wish the textures were of higher quality, but it is an old game at this point. (also mod'n it can get you banned.. so i've not     played around with that.)I still don't like Demon Souls... :D"
Positive,i want to kill myself
Positive,"A depressing world, inhabited by depressing characters, filled with depressing stories, accompanied by a depressing soundtrack and an even more depressing lore. Yet it is one of the best games I ever played.Dark Souls 3 is a game that doesn't tell you much about its story outright and you have to figure a lot of it out by reading item descriptions and finding hidden characters which I think is well done in this game. A lot of it is up to interpretation and some things require knowledge from previous titles but even if you don't know a thing about the story you will be able to beat the game.The bossfights and the generally high difficulty are the things Dark Souls 3 is mostly defined by people even though the other aspects are just as great.Bosses have a high difficulty, beautiful design, fun moveset and they all interact well with the world and its story.You know a boss is great when it takes you 2 hours of attempts to beat it and your first thought is ""I want to fight that boss again."".The soundtrack is mainly focused on the bossfights. Each boss has its own song that fits the mood and story. It is hard to describe the soundtrack apart from saying it is one of the best. You just have to listen to it yourself while playing the game.The RPG elements are well done but sometimes feel a bit lacking.You have a huge variety of builds due to the various weapons and stats you can use to customize your character. Many of the weapons lack a big moveset however there are also many weapons that offer fun movesets.Almost none of the ""fun"" weapons offer customization apart from upgrading its damage.You are able to use the weapon of every boss you defeated but only have a limited moveset compared to the boss who used this weapon before I still had so much fun spinning around the bossfights and areas.Your character can wear a variety of clothes and armor. Some of the sets are those the bosses used.The areas have a great design and lots of secrets which increases replayability. Graphic and artstyle make the world look so beautiful.Coop/PvP is still alive 4 years after release. It is easy to find fight clubs and you can clear areas and fight bosses together with other players. Interactions with other players are mostly friendly and honorable since most of the time people won't just run up and try to kill you unless you get invaded.Dark Souls 3 is a great game in every aspect. The game has a high difficulty, is often unforgiving and you have to figure out a lot on your own but for me it just made the experience so much better. Few games are so memorable and fun.98/100 - Would wipe this game from my memory so I can beat up old people to sad music while cosplaying as the Abyss Watchers for the first time again."

Positive,mnogo e trudna mamka mu ne znam dali shte q prevurtq
Positive,This game is basically Dark Souls.
Positive,"Well before buying this game I was pretty frightened about the game's difficulity. But I really wanted to play so I bought and saw that it's not really hard. I mean it's pretty hard but an avarage player can experience it. The most frightening part of the game is losing your souls but its not that big of a deal. First of all after you die and lose them, and if you don't die after respawning you can retrieve all of them back. And if you die before getting them you actually feel free to die becouse you have nothing to lose. So bosses are not that frightening after you die a couple of times. The game's atmosphere is so nice and eventually passing a territory is so setisfying. Enemies are usually equal with you. They usually show the same affects and responses with you. No one has any advantage against the other.  That makes this game difficult. You usually feel like you are dueling with each npc. Even the lamest npcs can be really harmful. But if you concentrate enaugh and develop a strategy for each part and enemy you can beat the hell out of them and reach the other bonfire(checkpoint).The game is really much of it. And I recommend you to play online becouse this game's multiplayer is really good I think. I mean its harder to play with friends but You can leave messages and see the messages of other players wich saved my life more than a couple. But dont take them too  seriusly couse some trolls leave messages that can cost you so much. And its pretty much all. I really loved this game and  it seems like I'll continue playing for a while.(I did)"

Positive,So good. Took me 2 years of on and off playing  (~40 actual play hours).
Positive,"This game is the best kind of love/hate relationship. All the cursing, rage-quitting, hand-wringing, cold-sweating, cheap shots, one shots, sadistic game design tendencies, overpowered invaders, etc. are worth it for those rare moments when the pixels align and you experience a golden bliss of heroic accomplishment (or sneaky exploits). This is the Dark Souls experience. 125 hours (and counting) well-spent."
Positive,"One of the best Action RPG ever, the game could be a little longer with more 1~2 mandatory bosses and FromS and Bandai could still be supporting the game or even making new contents"
Positive,"After 7000 hours (offline, because im a speedrunner) i can definitely say, this is one of the games ever made. 1/10 (1 because of the Nameless King)"
Positive,It's so interesting i couldn't get into boss fight without summon.

Positive,"It's Dark Souls, if you're already looking into the third installment, you've most likely already invested into the series. Beautiful music, beautiful environments, difficult enemies, the works."
Positive,"great game, cool visuals and rewarding difficulty"
Positive,"Probably the best game I have ever played, at least best RPG. A lot of people say that Dark Souls is the hardest game series out there but if that is why you are afraid to buy this, don't be. Dark Souls is difficult, yes, but it does difficulty in a perfected and unique way. Dying can be frustrating but that is why it is so integral. It is that want to beat that boss or to clear that area that brings you to claw your way from enemy to enemy. And when you finally do this difficult task, you feel like a god. The sense of relief and joy you get from beating a hard boss is incomparable to any other game."
Positive,"My favorite video game series of all time, for now. If you never played any game of the series, don't listen to the talk about difficulty, it's not a rage game. I bought this game because everyone always talked about how good it was, but it wasn't my type of game. I am usually bad at dexterity-based games and didn't enjoyed difficult games. After playing it, action games became my favorite genre.The best way to describe this game or any in the series is by saying it's a journey for you, the player, and I mean you, not the character you created. You will go through an experience that might change you by the end of it, or at least change the way you see video games.Buy this game if...- You are a video games aficionado. It has legendary game design, and will definitely add something to you. It's all about the controls and gameplay.- You are an art snob. Do you like abstract storytelling or films? Everything in this game is made to evoke very specific emotions. I wouldn't call it thought provoking, just that it's very good at evoking specific feelings and causing an impression.- You are a fan of the series. This game is not like the first one. It has the best boss fights and the most polished controls of the series. Doesn't have the legendary level design of the first one or the variety of the second, but it has the best feel.Don't buy this game if...- You don't want to commit. It is the antithesis of a casual game. If you just want to turn on a game and feel good, this game won't do it for you, you have to put effort into it."
Positive,Not dark souls 2 but I can stomach it
Positive,Does not open from this side
Positive,"Probably one of the greatest games I've experienced. Can be annoying at times with the constant dying, but with that dying comes the experience to learn from your mistakes and makes you in turn stronger. Also single out enemies makes it easier. Learning boss attack patterns so that you can know when to attack/dodge/parry etc. This game is truly a gem. I have no more to say, except try it for yourself and don't give up. After all the blood, sweat and tears. There is a feeling of completeness. I have nothing more to say except that this is a MASTERPIECE.""Noble Lords of Cinder... The fire fades, and the Lords go without thrones. Surrender your fires, to the one true Heir."""
Positive,"Jolly Co-operation! Invaded a world as aldrich and came across to the host, summons and even dark sipirts were just Gesturing after passing items back and forth."
Positive,"some people say dark souls is a hard franchise, as in, very difficult, but i think its a learning experience, every corner you take you learn how to get better, how to avoid adversities and how to better fight in pvp.But, what kept me playing this for nearly 2000 hours was the artwork, friends, and specially all the dark stories within this game, they tend to be beautiful in a dark gloomy way, of course you could just learn it all at once and call it a day, but i personally fell in love with the enviroment and playing this with friends through co-op.Overall this game was one of these games which has helped me cope with my chronic depression, its never gone, even if i'm in therapy or having medication... but this game was a good way to reconnect with family and friends, and even though i recieved or sent rare friend requests, made some good friends as well."

Positive,"It is a lot faster than Dark Souls 1 and while it is missing some of the strengths of the first game, it is way more consistent and an excellent entry for newcomers. Much of it’s identity is based on Dark Souls though and playing it before will have a great effect on appreciation for this title.(Note: This review will be only for the main game. The DLCs will be covered on their own)So Dark Souls 3 is the third of the series, but there are some interesting factors to it:1. Dark Souls 2 was not made by Hidetaka Miyazaki and with Dark Souls 3 he made his glorious return. Dark Souls 2 is still the black sheep of the series and his influence was greatly needed.2. In the meantime he had worked on Bloodborne and many creative ideas and design choices from that game influenced Dark Souls 3, making it a somewhat fresh experience.3. There is no third bullet point. I really just wanted to use the number 3.And here we go again:Dark Souls is based on combat that focuses on just a small number of enemies at the same time. You got your weapon, a dodge roll and maybe a shield in your left hand. If you ever saw the gameplay of any soulsborne game: There is absolutely no change that is really noteworthy in the fundamentals. Yet still everything changed by one thing that penetrates the whole game, if you compare it to the titles that came before:Dark Souls 3 is really fast. After coming from Dark Souls 1 I realized that many things I had learned were still applicable, but I needed to train my reflexes to catch up with the enemies. This was quite the experience and another learning experience also reached me really fast:Shields are not good and you will want to dodge as often as you can.This was quite frustrating and I still think that stacking defense and trying to go for well timed blocks is another strategy that at least should be viable. Although armor provides stats, most of the time it is pretty useless to go for any better armor. Rip tank build, at least I dearly miss you.Here a link to explain some of the problems (math heavy)https://www.giantbomb.com/profile/ltsquigs/blog/dark-souls-3-breaking-the-tank/113034/So we sacrificed at lot, but what did we get for it?The best bosses and areas in the series in terms of fighting. Dark Souls had hiccups and places like Lost Izalith were absolutely atrocious, because of a rushed production. Dark Souls 2 is just a rushed game that did get many things wrong.Let me tell you two things.First thing: Every boss has a second phase which makes any encounter even more epic. Not all of them are fair and sometimes they will kill you in a cheap way. Most of the time they enrich the fight and the former of the weakness of the boss gets covered. So you always need to think about how to properly react and never get cocky.Second thing: The areas themselves are well designed. You do not get spammed with enemies and their placement feels natural. Often I tried to think about how to engage the group ahead, before I initiated the fight which gave another layer to the combat. Musashi would be proud.The design and atmosphere still absolutely hit the right beats and Miyazaki found even more color palettes. Cold ice can combine with religious medieval churches or a castle with it’s defensive and functional mechanisms has been overrun by undead so that it feels lifeless and full of dangers. If I had to criticize anything I would argue that there is overabundance of blue and white while green, yellow and red are somewhat underutilized (in the case of red it makes sense from a narrative standpoint, however it takes from the design of areas).The enemies themselves have improved most of the time, but I was sometimes missing that sense of grandiosity or surprise. Dark Souls 3 is absolutely the most consistent and also the least unique. Some designs just feel really safe and combined with borrowing identity from the first game the feeling of encountering something absolutely unique is not encountered as often. This is absolutely nitpicking, I just wanted to express this.There is just one thing that really annoys me:The areas are just too excessive and not as interconnected as in Dark Souls 1. This meant that I had a really hard time to memorize anything about any area in any form. I still could draw a map of the first game, because everything was more or less really organized and no map was bigger than it needed to be. Dark Souls 3 may be more authentic, but for me it was just more tedious.Dark Souls game/10Would recommend again watching VaatiVidya every single day.Yet again it proves to be the weak point of the series. Honestly I could not really recount any track from the game and say which boss/area it belongs to (except one ofc). This is honestly somewhat disappointing and bored me. Maybe the idea is to not use music excessively to not overshadow the gameplay itself, maybe there is another reason I am not seeing. Still I can’t bring myself to praise anything about this OST except the good execution.Dark Souls 3 is a great game and offers the most well rounded experience from any Dark Souls game. Dark Souls 1 suffers from a quality of decline after the first half, Dark Souls 2 has made many things broken that were not in the first game. In the end I am perfectly fine with the game and I felt satisfied beating the boss. It just did not hit the same highs I had when I played the first one. Maybe my expectations were wrong or too high. In the end I am not disappointed, just not really impressed either.If you liked this review, make sure to check out my curator page at https://store.steampowered.com/curator/31884377-If-It-Is-Insane/Thanks for reading"
Positive,"Very funny game, it is very funny because it makes you go insane and schizophrenic and makes you fall in love with the firekeeper and gives you feet fetish. But a very funny game indeed!"
Positive,It's a good game.
Positive,"Note: I have spent a good chunk of time playing this game on another platform prior to playing it on PC. I also compare this game to previous ones in the series a bit. Good Aspects+++ One of the best (possibly the best) combat systems I've experienced in an Action-RPG. If you get hit it feels like your own fault. If you land a hit it feels like you outsmarted your opponent. When you defeat a boss it feels overwhelmingly satisfying.++ A ridiculously huge variety in terms of weapons, weapon movesets, armor, spells, etc. You can make all kinds of different builds for your character.++ A hauntingly beautiful soundtrack that inspires you to not back down.+ Playing online - both for co-operative play and PvP - has seen huge improvements in comparison to previous titles in the series. Faith-based healing builds feel much more viable now and chain backstabbing from the first Dark Souls isn't an issue anymore, for example.+ Parrying/Riposting feels the most satisfying it has ever felt in the Souls series. Mixed Aspects~ Weapon Arts: while these give weapons more of a sense of unique identity they aren't as balanced as they could be (some are just flat out better than others). A bit more variety with the weapon arts themselves would've also been nice but this isn't nearly as noticeable of an issue as the first.~ Estus Shards/Undead Bone Shards: while I personally prefer this system in comparison to the first Dark Souls an argument could be made that you still get too much of it. This feels okay to me due to the balancing nature between normal estus and ashen estus flasks (to restore FP for weapon arts and magic) but it's worth mentioning.~ The world design is fairly linear with how you proceed through the various areas. Previous games in the series had varying levels of ""Metroidvania"" elements to them that are mostly lacking here. You can still do certain things in a different order but it's not nearly as common an occurrence.Bad Aspects- Power Stance from Dark Souls 2 is gone. This is somewhat made up for with the dual wielding weapons but it doesn't have the same versatility.- The game relies a little too much on previous games in regard to weapons, armor, and lore to stand completely on its own. This is a fairly minor issue and could be seen as a pretty controversial statement so I will not elaborate on it further, however.Score: 10/10"
Positive,its just too easy
Positive,"Lovely game. This was the first time I tried a game of this genre and I absolutely loved it. The story is deep and its really hard to figure out the lore but thanks to youtube videos and theories, it was possible to understand it without effort. It starts off confusing and difficult but once you get the hang of it you'll get addicted. Also this game is known for its hard boss fights and it is possible to die more than 20 times to a boss but once you kill them, the satisfaction is insane lol. There are a looooot of things the game doesn't teach you right away and you'll have to experiment to find out stuff. I'd recommend this game to anyone who doesn't give up easily."
Positive,"If you don't have any experience with souls games yet... Wait!? Why are you doing this? You don't like yourself very much, do you? This is only for people, who are psychopaths and masochists. Prepare, that you will cry, yell, you will tear your hair out of your head, if you have any left, but if you stay, you will be rewarded with a great storyline, with such a dark atmosphere and unique gaming experience, that you will not find anywhere else. I almost forgot, prepare to die!"

Positive,"Being honest this is one of the best games of the century, perfect combat and difficulty. I'll be honest this game has lots of replay value. I'd say rating wise this might as well have the same awards as skyrim as it's so good in my books 10//10."

Positive,"I got myself into the Dark Souls franchise when I played the remastered version of the first game for Switch, it was the first time I played a game like this, an enticing experience that captivated the player with such a beautiful environment, a great story and a challenging difficulty. After finishing the first game I felt somewhat empty and hungry for a similar experience, knowing that there were 3 Souls games but with not so much money I was really happy to find this game on discount, and when I played it, man it really is an amazing game. so much places to explore, so much attention to detail and the story that just kept on giving, I saw the return of NPCs that were on the first game and I was charmed by the Firelink keeper, the variety of weapons and the skills they had for each one, dialogues with the bosses when you both lose or finally beat them after several tries kept me captivated. This game was also the first one that even after several years of its release I was able to enjoy it online playing against and cooperating with other players, I sure am glad that there's still a community that keeps on playing it. I've finished my first playthrough completing all of the bosses and left my character at the Firelink Shrine of my second journey, I'll be sure to return one day to experience again this amazing journey. Play, have patience and enjoy the ride."
Positive,"This is a game i truly did not think i'd enjoy, a scenario that is rather common amongst the sekisoulsborne fan/player-base. it's just such a well crafted (except for the Shrek part(s), fuck swamps, fatrolling around a large area with like 15 enemies scattered about isn't a challenge, its stupid and grows more and more obnoxious on each subsequent playthrough) experience that i'd absolutely recommend it to anyone willing to put anywhere from 40 to 1000 hours into struggling through this incontestably shining gem of a game only to look back and see just how far you've actually come in terms of skill and understanding (if you actually try to get better that is, getting assistance for certain bosses or encounters is an option i myself used on several occasions through my 1st almost completely blind playthrough, I haven't since then due to my gradual increase in skill level, plus the Astora Ultra Great Sword helped out a little bit i gueeeeeeess lmao (I legit had no idea it was meta for PvE until I was checking the wiki for info on builds and misc stuff on my NG +1 run)) It goes without saying that Dark Souls isn't a game franchise for everyone blah blah some wont even make it past the first boss (I gave my sister the best starter ""class"" and an hour to beat Iudex Gundyr.... she left my room 55 minutes in, never making it past phase 1) and end up calling it quits or refunding the game if able, in some cases they go on to decry FROM SOFTWARE for their game design and difficulty, a viewpoint I found (and still find) to be completely idotic if you understand the purpose behind why they make the games they do the way they do.... I'm getting way off topic. Anyways, the game may not always be completely fair, you may get lost in a level or section for waaaaay longer than you should, you'll die a F*CKTON on your first run through the game and a good portion of that 30-50 hour runtime WILL be spent running past the same enemies over and over and over and the sooner you accept this reality, the sooner you'll get the fun part, actually realizing how much progress you've made thus far and probably simultaneously realizing how much more you'll have to deal with until you beat up the final big bad. tbh idk if anything i said makes sense or if it even works as a way to get you to buy it and rn i dont feel like re typing this at all. so im ending it off here.Very good, Very challenging, Veeery fun, Very swamp wai- GODDAMMIT! F*CK OFF SHREK!8.5/10 has a little something for everyone, except bitch asses who cant git gud"
Positive,"Great game and will remember forever our time beating it to 100%, with my best friend."
Positive,"Very fun game, challenged me alot but pls remove giant fly!!! Pls remove curse rotted greatwood shitty boss shitty design but final review 9/10"
Positive,"Difficulty:Is Dark souls HARD? Nope I don't think so.A lot of action RPG in highest difficulty is harder than DS ( like GoW )Not to mention in DS you can choose to fight or flee when encounter strong enemies(except bosses)DS reward player who thinks before action and pay attention to details while punish HARD to those running around like a brain dead hollow.Boss fights & Musics :Oh my, it's just unfair how astonishing those experiences can be compare to other games.IDK how to describe it but when the second phase (or third :) ) of boss theme kicks in the feeling of adrenaline flows through your veins is just AWESOME.If DS says it has the second best boss fights probably only Sekiro has the balls to claim he's the best.Last part : AtmosphereDarksouls' graphic is BAD, even GoW running on PS4 looks better than DS running high with reshade on PC.But i'll still give visual experience a 8/10 because the art style and the atmosphere is just PERFECT.You can really feel the world is slowly dying and everything seems to have no hope.You are tasked on an impossible mission to achieve god knows what.Hostile environments and deadly enemies / traps make you want to give up.Some did and became Hollow.But if you try once again, the bonfire might just be at the next corner.The constant pressure from the atmosphere is what makes this game good,but the relief after you reached the next bonfire is what makes it perfect.No matter how dark it is, there's still bright lights from the fire make you keep going.Conclusion:Dark souls pretty much murdered every other action RPG games except BOTW and GoW for me.I'll give it a solid 10/10 for offline, 9/10 for online because kinda broken matching system.Good luck fighting a +10 everything SL10 tryhard at the early stage of game.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣤⣤⣄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠻⣿⣿⣿⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⣯⣿⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢹⣿⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⣿⣇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢻⢺⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⡏⣧⣀⣀⣀⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢶⣿⣋⣟⠭⣿⣿⠟⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⢻⣿⣭⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⡏⢮⣳⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢻⡿⣦⣿⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢿⠢⣽⣅⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠸⡆⢤⣿⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⣸⡟⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢷⠸⣞⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⡏⢧⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⡄⣿⣷⠀⠀⠀⠀⢻⡈⢣⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣇⢸⣿⡆⠀⠀⠀⠀⢳⣬⣧⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢹⡈⣿⣧⠀⠀⢠⡄⣸⣿⣿⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⡇⢹⣿⡀⠀⢸⢧⠟⢹⠇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⠸⣿⡇⣠⠋⢾⣾⢸⢀⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⡖⠀⠸⣿⣶⣿⣷⡏⢰⡿⢿⠏⣸⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⡇⠀⣴⢋⣿⣿⣿⠇⡟⠁⣏⠀⣿⣧⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣰⡞⣏⢦⠇⢸⡿⢿⠋⢀⣤⣀⡘⢦⡟⢸⣆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢹⣿⠃⢀⣴⡆⠀⠀⠈⣹⣿⡷⠆⠀⣧⠈⢿⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢠⠜⢁⡴⠋⡀⠙⢄⠀⣰⣿⣟⠓⠀⠀⢉⣴⠋⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣤⢰⡏⡠⠊⢀⡴⣇⠀⢀⡞⠉⠛⠀⡀⢀⣄⣩⠌⠙⢦⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣸⣿⢣⠶⠖⠊⢀⣈⠉⣹⡷⢀⣴⡯⠔⣛⡵⠁⣠⡏⠸⣆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢹⡿⢿⠟⠀⣰⡞⠉⣿⡷⠇⠃⣠⢴⣶⣾⡋⢀⡴⣽⠁⠀⠘⣏⣀⢰⣆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣠⣶⣶⣅⣠⣶⠀⠒⠟⢁⡴⠋⠀⠀⠀⢹⣿⣿⡋⣧⢸⡇⡏⣀⣀⠀⠙⣿⣉⠙⢤⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣠⣴⣺⢿⣿⣿⡛⠛⠿⠿⣯⣷⡲⣶⣟⣻⡀⠀⣠⣿⣿⣖⣸⣨⣿⠿⠛⣻⣿⣶⣾⣾⠇⠀⠻⣄⠀⠀⠀⣾⢟⠿⠿⢶⣮⡙⢏⢢⡀⢠⡌⣿⣿⡿⠟⡿⢳⣼⣿⣿⣿⣾⣿⣧⣤⣤⣤⣿⣿⣭⣿⠁⠀⠀⣀⣈⣧⠀⢺⣥⢿⠾⠿⠿⠿⡿⠚⢋⣠⠯⣿⢉⢉⠻⠾⠛⢿⣿⠻⠿⢛⢋⣤⣯⣭⠽⠶⣾⣻⢿⣻⢿⠶⢛⣻⡿⢽⠄"

Positive,If pain was a video game.
Positive,game gud sword go swoosh and yellow man go sun
Positive,Have to say Dark Souls 3 is a masterpiece with incredible graphics and animations.And the story line is obscure but attractive.Love this game.
Positive,This game is so hard its angering. i cant deal with this people invading me all the time. these bosses are to hard to fight. Why make a game that takes 400 hours to beat? It doesnt make sense... 10/10 would recommend.
Positive,Kaksin käsin ällää bozolle
Positive,"Probably one of the better games I've played. There isn't really a defined gameplay style/type everybody follows in this one, (considering that shields aren't ridiculously overpowered this time), and there are a lot of references to other Souls games, like the Washing Pole and the Uchigatana. The gameplay is really polished, and the bosses have very well designed movesets and attacks. Also, to anybody giving this game a bad review (I know they're not common but they happen) because they can't get past the first boss, this isn't the game for you. That boss is probably one of the easiest ones in the game, the only easier I can think of being Deacons of the Deep. (This aint flaming or insulting, its simply warning people of the dangers ahead. Mods dont kill me)"
Positive,"Best game I ever played at.At least this is the perfect lieBecause this ain't the best souls part of the series, but a pretty good partThis is only my opinionMy favourite part is Bloodborne (In the souls series: DS2)But very nice to play, better than playing online MP games, with full toxic kidsIf you die, obviously that'll be your fault in 95%The other 5 is just the game's bullshitBut actually one of my favourite gamesI'm a bit disappointed, cuz there won't be any other souls game in the series, in the futureBut for a finish, perfect.Oh, one more thingIf you finished playing the vanilla, and you beat the DLCs too (if you buy them)Try some other mods from nexusmodsI recommend Cinders and Champion's AshesI think these are the best mods.Thank you for reading, mays't thou thy peace discover!"
Positive,"my third favorite game and, one of the most well made games of all time. perfectly conveys the themes of the series while maintaining staples without feeling overly intrusive or retreading too much on old ground. perfected the combat the souls series has been working on within all the games, bringing elements from bloodborne, with faster paced combat and healing while moving, to create a much better flowing system then any souls-like before it. some elements of the combat (as of 3/6/22) are better than elden ring's combat system, with things like katanas not returning to sheathed mode when using the combat art and holding LT in ER. the pvp in this game is the best part, facing off against other players for souls is an amazing experience which allows for growth on playstyle, experimentation with playstyles, giving more variety to gameplay and making things much less predictable in a game which can often be repetitive (if  youre bad). for me this game will remain the definitive dark souls game, even if it is not as groundbreaking or genre defining as the first, it is the truest dark souls game. 10/10"
Positive,Gives me 𝐂 𝐎 𝐍 𝐍 𝐈 𝐏 𝐓 𝐈 𝐎 𝐍 𝐒
Positive,yes if ur depressed it makes u moire depressed and it cancels it out so then u feel nothing
Positive,"Dark Souls III is a game that will truly be able to stand the test of time.Take on the role of the Ashen One, a soul who is destined to overthrow the Lords of Cinder in order to save the world and prevent the darkness once and for all. Or will they?Become a Knight, a Sorcerer, a Pyromancer, an Assassin... whoever you want to be! Dark Souls III has so many weapon, armour and ring choices that you can play the game how you want to, and spend souls to level up the character the way you want.The appearance of Dark Souls III is truly a sight to behold. From Software did a fantastic job at being able to capture what a cursed and rotting dark-fantasy world would look like. Ready the screenshots!When it comes to the question of PvP, it's usually a game of who's more experienced or who has a higher soul level. Of course, this isn't to say that all high level players are professional gamers, but they may have a significantly increased chance of survival (typically because of higher HP/Stamina). Same goes for experienced players on new characters and players with strong weapons/armour.Story-wise, the game has amazing lore and a strong story that can still be theorized about to this day. The PvE in Dark Souls III can be frustrating at times, but if you persevere, you will overcome. There's a reason why the Souls games are considered some of the most difficult games in the world!Overall, I would strongly recommend this game for anyone who is looking for a fun, challenging, adventurous dark-fantasy escape."
Positive,easy peasy would recommend easy game.
Positive,I've never died ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Positive,"Dark Souls III is a great souls game with lots of depth and replay value. Lots of PVP and coop PVE opportunities. DS3 is different is various ways, some for better some for worse. The poise system from DS1 is no longer in place, instead poise comes mostly from weapons and is only in place during certain swinging animations. I preferred the poise system of DS1 personally. Enemy design is a bit different in DS3 than DS1--all the enemies (including hollows) are always close to twice as tall as the player, which I think is a means to make the player feel small and fragile. But I think the design was still a bit superior in DS1. But at it's core it's still a souls game. It's fun to play definitely worth the purchase, though there may be times of frustration."
Positive,super good game i would love for more dlcs and extensions and for bloodborne on pc immediately+elden ring release this year and make it harder and gangster thanks ill pay the 80 dollars for the game friends at fromsoftware!!!!!!!!!! pls more dlc for ds3 pls pls will pay cash
Positive,dark souls more like easy souls
Positive,you can wear a big hat
Positive,My personal favorite souls game. The tightest gameplay of the series with the best bosses and music in the series. The last dlc's end is a great cap on a amazing series.
Positive,fuck yes one of my favorite games

Positive,Salad Souls 3: The lords of Crust 8.5/10
Positive,"I didn't want to play this, because ""dying a lot"" doesn't sound like fun. You could say I lost a bet and had to play it. Completely fell in love with the game.The story and music is absolutely amazing, the scenery is breathtaking and the feeling of finally defeating that one boss you were struggling with for so long is epic.You will not regret playing it :)"
Positive,"First time playing a souls game and really loved it. Played co-op with a veteran friend wherever it was possible on my first run so got a good hang of the game without getting brutally punished. The game is tough and punishing, but it always makes you come back for more. Cons Half baked support for keyboard+mouse mapping. On Screen instructions are displayed for controllers everywhere and takes while to get used to if you are playing with Keyboard+mouse."
Positive,"First playthrough: (when it realeased) verry good game, the difficulty isnt that hard compared to the others, i completed the game in about the first 8-9 hours, alot of helpful guides online and fun builds you can try out, playing it with friends is also avalable which is fun, i personally am banned from multiplayer, beaucse after a while i began using exploits, and got abnormal stats on my character which got me banned, not salty well deserved, overall fun and good game, out of all the games this one is a solid 2nd place 8/10edit: (67 Hours) I went back to play this again and i got my ass kicked, like everyboss tok atleast 4-5 hours atleast and i hated every moment of it, BUT it was fun and challenging and i still havent beaten that playthrough lmaoedit 2: (210 hours) after seing my game being reset and just playing arround until like 120 hours ish, i took it upon myself to finish what i started in my second playtrough, i hopped on twitch and this game i beat the game with bosses taking average of FIRST timing the to maybe 10-15 minutes, i finally beat all the bosses i struggled with (twin princes and nameless king), i must say after finishing it i felt empty as i had completed what was a bane in my existence, i would recommend this game for anyone interested in great lore, views and scenes, and near perfect boss music and design, yes this game has alot of random bullshit that kills you but when finishing it, euphoria hits. plan is to start streaming the dlc and see if i can beat the bosses therewill stream it ofc at {LINK REMOVED}(Twitch.tv/PurpleRexbot).Edit 3: (270 hours) After coming back to this game on my 24 hour stream, to get all the endings AND playing the DLC this is my favorite game of all time, All the bosses are well designed, their individual arenas and soundtrack compliment them so well and the soundtrack reflects the bosses past and what they have been through, even the past of the npcs and their quest are amazing and tie in great to your runs!you can easily build whatever you want and complete the game, as everything works, even a broken straight sword, the art style also compliments this game so well, entering Irithyll for the 1st time 2nd time 3rd time, it never gets old, i always stop to take in the gorgeous views and design of this game, this game will always be close to my heart 10/10 changed my life."

Positive,"Dark souls is like eating the worlds hottest pepper for $500. If you do it youll get the bragging rights, the satisfaction of doing it and the money. But eating that pepper is very hard and painful and takes a long time to finish."

Positive,"Quite simply the best game I have ever played. Everything about it is just incredible. If you've been turned off getting it because of the reputation of crushing difficulty, you'll come to realise it's not an unfair difficulty, and mastering a boss or mechanic will bring satisfaction like no other game. Trust me when I say that beating and mastering this game is an experience I've never had before, and it is absolutely astounding."
Positive,"I've got 300+ hours on this game on console, and it's good enough I felt like buying it plus dlc on pc.

You'll be glad you did."

Positive,"The ultimate masterpiece.Ah, Dark Souls. What can I tell you about Dark Souls III? One could not tell the brilliance of Dark Souls without embracing it. I can tell you about the amazing world, the magnificent creatures and the incredible storytelling. Yet, if you truly want to experience the Dark Souls, you have to dive into it and embrace it as a part of your own. Through misery, seek happiness.The amazing world, the magnificent creatures, the incredible storytelling, those are a part of the Dark Souls experience. However, they are not the most important factors. The most important element is the notion of living. We are living in a world full of technology, full of supplies, full of entertainment to the point of abundance. Yet, we couldn't help but feeling so useless, so helpless trying to stay alive sometimes. Fyodor Dostoevsky once said “The mystery of human existence lies not in just staying alive, but in finding something to live for.” Are you living your life, truly? We are nothing but a mere rock on the road, whatever happens to us, does not matter in the grand scheme of the universe. Then what are we living for?Through the lens of Dark Souls, a world without hope, we can finally seek an answer to that question. You found yourself in a depressing world, filled with monsters made out of ""hollow"" people, those who lost the will to live. You are told to slay all the Lords of Cinders to become a great being to link the fire, in an attempt to better this world. But, when you look at this world, this depressing world, do you still want to link the fire, you question yourself. After you kill demons, lords, princes, gods, in the end, how does it feel like? After 15 seconds of feeling proud of your achievements, ultimately it does not matter. You trample on other beings to gain your power, to finally link the fire, yet this act is futile. Fire fades, darkness rises. You have been trying so hard to finally achieve a futile goal to save a worthless world. In the end, nothing even matters, even your existence.I can relate a lot to Albert Camus's ""The Myth of Sisyphus"" after playing Dark Souls. Much like our existence in the real world, our existence in the Dark Souls world does not matter at all. It's a futile act, trying to roll a boulder up a hill, only for it to fall down and do the act entirely again. However, if you take on another perspective, maybe like Sisyphus learn to enjoy the mere act of rolling the stone, we could as well find meanings in this futile world. You can find people in the Dark Souls world so precious that you want to save them. You can find corners of beauty lurking in this worthlessly hopeless world. You can finally enjoy yourself, even if they are only small things. Just like in real life, Dark Souls is the path to find yourself and your position in the world. You will experience misery, suffering to the point of wanting to kill yourself. But, LIVE!  ""Live!"" is the only thing Dark Souls taught me, yet this simple thing is the core essence of everything. To live is to not go hollow, to live is to find yourself in this world, to live is to finally find a purpose for yourself, not just staying alive.Don't you dare go hollow.Yuu Raskolnikov"
Positive,The Ashen One approves 👍
Positive,one of the easiest games i've ever played.
Positive,i got softbanned
Positive,yeah it cool
Positive,Just as good as the first one and second one. Gameplay is a lot more fluid and story is just as interesting. It's not really as hard as everyone says. Highly recommended.
Positive,Ds3 is the best in the series for me <3 bosses r too good and memorable. Praise the Sun !
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is my absolute favourite game, I played it hundreds of hours on the PS4 and just had to get it on PC for some challenge runs. It's fast paced combat and (for beginners) challenging difficulty is even after over assumably 900 hours of playtime still fun to me. I can also highly recommend all the other games in the Soulsborne series."
Positive,This game is hot.
Positive,Fun game! It makes you want to break your computer but once you defeat the bosses it’s very satisfying. Recommend getting this game with a lot of friends and you will enjoy it.
Positive,top dms rapaziada
Positive,Praise the game!
Positive,Hesitation is defeat.wait wrong game
Positive,Easy game to chill on
Positive,"You'll hate the bosses when you fight them the first time. But, once you have finally defeat them, you would always come to the conclusion that it was rather easy and all you had to do is git gut.10/10 would Smough bosses again"
Positive,This is not for casual players i can say that i didn't play the first 2 dark souls games. I want to say games combat mechs are really good but everyone knows that and storyline is not a simple thing to know if you know games origins you'll not regret to buy it.
Positive,If you enjoy getting raped again and again get it
Positive,gg easy game for relaxing.
Positive,str build go donk
Positive,It's the best in the trilogy in my opinion.The most fun and complete.
Positive,"I'm not going to say many things about it, bcs there is lots of comments talking in depth about it.I like the fact that this game is trully testing your skills (memory, reflexes)Iconic RPG, it's a must go for every RPG LOVEREven if you are not into RPG that much, you have to try it at least 1 timeThe only thing i don't like that much is, even if you choose a class you can end up play as another. Don't have something representative for that class, just the starting items that you can buy/farm later.Overall is a worth to play game."
Positive,"DarkSouls III is very different from its predecessors for the simple reason that the level design is much more linear than in previous games. And that makes the experience more enjoyable from my point of view, even though I loved the first and second games in the license. Apart from that, everything that makes the DarkSouls license what it is, is found in this one, only more accomplished. The game looks great, the gameplay is fun and customizable. Battles, bosses, level design, attacks, staging, cinematics, bestiary, quests, pnjs... Everything is mastered to perfection. The feeling of power is crescendo and the DLC is overpowering. The experience is concentrated (unlike Elden Ring) and each new encounter brings its own share of excitement. It would be even better if, during cooperative play sessions, the game recorded progress for all players. And if the quests gave more hints. Thank you for porting BloodBorne to PC. 20/20"
Positive,its good if you hate your self
Positive,"Cash me outside Pontiff, how bou dat."
Positive,fungame good times
Positive,I enjoyed this game through my tears. I'm a casual but I'm pretty motivated to git gud at this game.
Positive,I stabbed some dude in the ass and he died instantly
Positive,deathable scenes.. you can have it
Positive,"Its hard. but dear knights, always remember to not be a D.I.C.K. Dex is Cancer King. Strengh is the way to go. If not, use more Strengh. Also, my Sexlife is so much better. I get fucked by this game 100 times a day. Much better than any gamer girls my mans! get this game!"
Positive,good game first time through and love the twin princes swords you can combine on second play through but there's little to no replay-ability.The multiplayer is decent too and i find (at least right now) there's not allot of hackers. 8/10 would be 10/10 if there where maybe more boss swords and items you could combine to make something good but hey its a solid game deffoes worth full price but if you wait for discount its way better for the value
Positive,this game got me harder then my ex girl friend 10/10
Positive,Very entertaining and you dont have to worry on the game being short or easy
Positive,What a great game.
Positive,I guess it's alright.
Positive,"Dark Souls III is honestly one of my favourite games of all time and such a good ending for the games. Even after finishing the game I keep coming back to it to play it with friends, or just to learn new things about the lore of the game, which there is so much of. Basically, if you like RPGs, enjoyed the first Souls games, and are up for a challenge, I definitely recommend this game."
Positive,"I have been playing since Demon's Souls, and I have grown an emotional attachment to these games. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this game and any of the Souls-borne games to anyone looking for a difficult game. The difficulty is perfectly balanced, it's not cheap difficulty but it is possible if you try."
Positive,"My favourite game that is currently available on Steam. A flawed masterpiece with amazing combat, and some of the best bosses and soundtracks I have ever experienced. The lore is also one of my favourites, I pretty much love everything about this game, I have very few gripes about it. Definitely a must play."
Positive,"By far one of my favourite games of all time. I originally had this on Xbox and upon getting a good PC I instantly bought the game and the game looks stunningly beautiful on high settings. The game is well created, all the areas connect together fluently and the combat system is great. In conclusion, I believe that this game is definitely worth the expensive cost and is well worth the play."
Positive,"Absolutely great, if you have the money, THIS IS A MUST BUY! I recommend it as much as i can."
Positive,It's an amazing game! \[T]/
Positive,yeah its pretty good
Positive,playing this game is an emotional car crash
Positive,"Dark souls 1 is a video game that proves that games can be art, and it is a masterpiece. Dark Souls 3 never quite reaches that level in design. However, Dark Souls 3 does have tighter controls, and more fluid combat that leads to it being a more fun gaming experience that can be replayed many times. It's also easier to introduce your friends to the genre with this one."
Positive,"This game is a technical masterpiece. From game play to atmosphere, Dark Souls reigns supreme and puts other action/rpg titles to shame. It has been years since the latest instalments release, yet no game developer outside of FromSoftware has been able to replicate the things that make this series so compelling. Would I recommend playing it? No. God no. This game is not 'fun'; only a masochist would actually take pleasure in playing this game. I have finished this game 3 times on Xbox and have almost completed it here on PC (just defeated the NK). Playing Dark Souls is not what a normal person would consider 'fun'. I only play it because it is unique and because of the satisfaction it provides once I have overcome a particular boss. The fact of the matter is that this game is much to frustrating for a casual audience to enjoy. No matter how highly you regard something, no matter how fantastic the product is; no rational person would stake anything significant in betting that a stranger would enjoy Dark Souls 3. If you are an extremely patient person, play this game. If you are looking for the best single player action RPG the industry has to offer, play this game. If you are a masochist who likes to be outmatched constantly, play this game. If not, do not bother. It will only be bitter. tldr: Is it a great game? Yes. Would I recommend it to you? Probably not."
Positive,Best Souls game in my opinion. Has the best from Dark Souls 1 improved to be funnier to play and re-play. Fantastic lore and game mechanics. Almost endless possibilities to play the game. PvP is fun and there is still people playing the game.
Positive,"Truly, like it's predecessors, a masterpiece. If you love challenge, fluid combat, amazing world building and Dark Fantasy, then this game is for you! Thanks to many different weapons and spells, the game never feels the same if you decide to try out a new build and play it again. Nowadays it's rare to find a game with this much replayability. Also fun as a co-op game with friends!"
Positive,One of my favourite game ! best way to enter the souls serie for me.
Positive,Finally im able to play this masterpiece properlyGreat Franchise <3 hopin to see Demon Souls comin to Steam someday
Positive,"I have played this game on all consoles and on the PC. With that in mind when I say this game is good... I mean it! There is so much to do in this game and the two DLC make it even better. Say, do you want to make a character who whips people to death while also making fountains of lava erupt from the ground? You can! Do you want to make a serious character with a cool backstory who uses a rapier infused with crystals? Yet again, you can. Do you want to be Zeus and Conjure up A GODDAMN LIGHTNING STORM ALL WHILE LOOKING LIKE AN ACTUAL ONION INFUSED KNIGHT?! you already know what the answer is... HELL YEAH! I guess what i'm saying is yeah the community can be really toxic and yeah the bosses can be hard at times but I feel as someone with an over 1000 hours (If you didn't remember I also played on Xbox and PS4) that this game is one of the most addicting, fun, creative, and really funny at times. This is also not even the hardest game in the series so if you are looking for a really big challenge try out Dark Souls 1 as well as this. I really hope this helps someone decide on whether they should get this or not. Good luck if you do buy it and its your first time... Because you WILL need it."
Positive,"If you hate long hand-holding tutorials and yourself, then this is the perfect game for you!"
Positive,I'm just speechless
Positive,"I've wasted so many hours of my life on this game and I don't regret a second of it - I'm sure I'll waste many more on this, too. Amazing gameplay with so many different playstyles that somehow all intertwine into a balanced PvP system while keeping the game enjoyable and difficult enough to make me exit the game in a rage but quickly restart within a few minutes. My favourite game to date."
Positive,Try tongue but hole
Positive,Best game kill guy and sword
Positive,Thank you Dark Souls.
Positive,best dark souls game
Positive,"I have no words to describe how much i love this game, awsome as fuck"
Positive,"This game is FANTASTIC, It has an AMAZING COCKKK!"

Positive,If you hate yourself this game is great.
Positive,One of the most complete and best game I've ever played.
Positive,I hate this game it ruined my life
Positive,I noder good game
Positive,Personally I prefer Dark Souls 2:Scholar of the First Sin....but Dark Souls 3:The Fire Fades is what the young kids are playing nowadays so I play this 1.  All 3 games are masterpieces when you include their DLC content...btw...NO PAY TO WIN...NO MICROTRANSACTIONS....From Software created a whole new genre with these gems and you won't regret playing.  Have patience as you learn the mechanics...and understand that nothing is explained.  I recommend struggling through the 1st playthrough and looking at guides for the rest.
Positive,Game is great for first time playthroughs. PvP can be very fun but is poorly balanced. Solid 8/10EDIT: Archthrone Demo is goated
Positive,Masochistic but beautiful
Positive,yesedit: 900+ hours in and I can confidently say that I hate this game
Positive,Wasted 3 hours of my fucking life trying to parry pontiff sulyvahn.Would recommend.Would do again.
Positive,"Git Gud, with that aside very fun game all souls games are good games."
Positive,"BEST GAME EVER! A ton of glitches and bugs though, true raging material, BUT still best game ever, beautiful story line if you get into the hidden lore and such, extremely fun and addictive gameplay, although sometimes bad too. Overall best game ever. Once you get into the DLCs which are most certainly worth buying, gets even better, but also harder :D"
Positive,"This game is good, you should get it."
Positive,Gotta be one of the games of all time
Positive,best game ever
Positive,"Recomendo muito !!!, um jogo que é para pessoas que buscam um desafio e uma história fascinante, jogo 8/10"
Positive,My favorite souls gameI highly recommend this game for uwhat will this game offers for u?1-the best soundtrack in the entire series. 2-the best boss fights.3-u`ll drink estus fast and roll even faster than Ds1 and DS2.4-cool npc.5-cool areas(there`s no bad areas in this game) at least not like blighttown in DS1 & DS2.6-beautiful and hot firekeeper to support ur heart.7-good weapons there`s a lot of weapons in this game and each weapon has it own playstyle and abilities.8-magic and pyro and Miracles are so much fun to use and grind.9-beautiful level design. so what are u waiting for?
Positive,You've played for 340 hoursWould you recommend this game to other players?
Positive,"It's like a drug. It hurts you so bad, but you become addicted. Then you have a heart attack due to the stress the drug puts on your body."
Positive,Love a challenge? Then DS is the game for you. Loved it since my first play through.
Positive,Its a damn good game
Positive,Best game ever just get it.
Positive,Darksouls (1-2-3) has ruined all other games for me because it's so good..
Positive,"use sword make guys go bye bye, fun!!!!"
Positive,Best game of all time.
Positive,fire keeper is best waifu
Positive,"play and suffer, YEs, get it"
Positive,Simply the best game ever created
Positive,"First time playing this series and man ol' man this game never gets old. Instantly started off dying over and over again and at some point I had enough but playing the game more and more made me realize that without dying and losing souls constantly the game isn't played right. That's why I kept playing and now it is seriously one of the best games I've ever played and I only have 9 hours in it. Amazing game. Good job devs, definetely recommend!-10/10"
Positive,fun game. pvp is cool and story is :O
Positive,its basically dark souls
Positive,i hate crabs
Positive,Gameplay and Co-op is fun as hell
Positive,The only reason I would tell someone not to play this is if they don't have a controller
Positive,"It beats you like an old housewife, but I keep coming back."
Positive,"Perfect,            10/10 and praise the Sun!"
Positive,"""If you fall down seven times, stand up eight. That's the cry of the undead. It's not a matter of life or death. It's about what breaks first - your will or the barriers in your way.""An anonymous abusive relationship simulator you will love for a long time, because there will be always more coward players and their over-leveled friends to bully. But rewarding a brave host which fights until the last bit of health with a few embers and other goodies is just as fulfilling."
Positive,it is really fun game and anyone can beat it if they try hard enough
Positive,Dark Souls will stretch Your ass hole very big
Positive,eu devo me odiar por platinar esse jogo
Positive,"There's a reason this game has its own sort of genre (SOULS) because as an RPG game, this may not appeal to many. Dark Souls is a game that either clicks with you or it doesn't. You first of all should have a controller bc KB bindings are ass. You play the role of an ""unkindled ash"" who is basically seen as a peasant and you have to bring the Lords of Cinder to their throne by brute force to break the curse of your kind. Story exists but it's mostly given in terms of lore so you're actually playing a game, not watching a movie. You roll to evade attacks with invincibility frames (or can block using a shield, costing you stamina) or parry an attack, enabling you to land a critical hit and then offend using a strong attack, light attack or special attack. And that's it. You go through many areas fighting some weak skeleton mobs or witches, to face a more dangerous mob, such as a knight, to then go to a boss fight where you could either breeze through it or respawn at the closest bonfire and get your ass handed to you 30 times. 19 bosses excl DLC or 26 incl DLC, and some of the bosses are actually fantastic. If you embrace yourself in to the atmosphere, this game is scary, difficult and exciting Dark Souls is a game, though, where you know nothing so maybe a few videos might help you understand how to upgrade your weapons and healing. The areas have a foreboding atmosphere, the music is very orchestral with choir and chants (hee haw hee) so if you're in to that, then the music is stellar, the boss fights are amazing, the enemies are meh, the story is kind of deep but it's just lore and the game is fun. It's a crazy experience where you start off raging and end up appreciating the journey. Took me probs 70 hours to beat the main game and DLC since I died a lot and explored the areas. Huge game. I would recommend, NOT to all but to some. For me personally, outstanding fucking game, one of my favs of all time"
Positive,It's the Dark Souls of souls-like games.
Positive,"Even if you received this product for free, you paid for it with your hope during the utterly desperate battles.  Now your hope glands are resting in From Software's clenched gauntlets, giving out laboured screams and occasionally farts.  You didn't know you had hope glands.  You didn't know they could pass wind.  There is no turning back from this masterpiece.  Watch the movie at  to view true highlights of the Dark Souls variety, I, II and III."
Positive,Took me 193 hours to complete the tutorial.
Positive,"If you haven´t played a single soulsborne game, can you trully call yourself an epic gamer?"
Positive,Fuck this game
Positive,"DS3 is a game of valleys and peaks, down through dungeons and up over castle walls. It's a plummet into places we shouldn't be--an escape from places we don't belong.But of course, we fight our way through the darkness, and find our way out. There are a few stumbles along the way, but in the end, Dark Souls III is well worth the riveting climb.This is the third in a series of dark fantasy role-playing games known for their brutal difficulty and unforgiving nature. It gives minimal direction and little room for error. As with its predecessors, playing Dark Souls III means accepting two extremes: recurring defeat, and the reward of breaking through it. This is a game that recognizes the value of perseverance, tearing you down before it pulls you back up, reinforcing the spots where it broke you, preparing you for that next valley just down the road.The world itself is a disconnected series of detailed areas--some sprawl outward, while others stack on top of themselves, folding back and looping around in intricate webs. It's a testament to the level design that discovering a bonfire checkpoint is as important as levelling your character or defeating a challenging boss. In this dangerous world of swamps, prisons, and undead villages, every milestone is a victory.Returning to the Firelink Shrine hub world in order to level up character stats, weapon quality, and the health-imbuing estus flask seems tedious at first, but as time goes by, you'll recruit helpful companions that set up camp at your base, granting useful items and buffs throughout your playthrough. Bonfire checkpoints strewn throughout Dark Souls III allow for easy fast travel, and returning to Firelink becomes a welcome reprieve from the surrounding world.This macabre locale has subtle stories to tell--enemies on the Road of Sacrifices behave defensively, only attacking once attacked. Giants bow their heads in exhaustion among the rafters of the Cathedral of the Deep. A sense of mystery pervades Dark Souls III's gloomy world, and there's a confidence on display that's often missing from many modern games--Dark Souls III has secrets, whether you find them or not.It's also impressive how Dark Souls III strikes a balance between exploration and guidance. There's usually more than one path you can take through the world at any time--to new bosses, secret dungeons, or new areas entirely--but never too many that it feels overwhelming. The level design encourages wandering without losing focus.Obstacles come in a variety of grotesque forms along the way: hulking giants and feral dogs; ancient knights and suicidal monks. Each enemy is a unique threat, and in groups, they grow more dynamic and punishing, demanding a flexible approach to combat. Dark Souls III is also clever in the way it plays on your false sense of comfort: many deaths come when you underestimate an enemy you've killed dozens of times before. The danger is always lurking. In the long run, survival requires patience.This is true throughout--there's a certain cadence to the combat, a certain pattern to each enemy, that's only discernible when you take time to observe it. Some enemies are weak near their sword arm--others are vulnerable from behind. Instinct may tell you to dodge every time a knight retracts its spear, but wasting stamina could lead to a quick death, forcing a restart at the most recent bonfire. Dark Souls III doesn't just teach you new skills--it forces you to forget ones you've already learned.The combat fluctuates between measured duels and frantic fights, but it almost always manages to keep things fair: you may be outnumbered and underpowered, but defeat is usually your fault. Sometimes, however, Dark Souls III breaks that rule. The camera often struggles to adjust in tight spaces, and the lock-on mechanic can be capricious, especially against Dark Souls III's more mobile, aggressive enemies. In boss fights that require precision, an imprecise camera becomes all the more of a hindrance.But what impressive monstrosities these bosses can be. In fact, several display more creativity than any others in developer From Software's RPG lineup. These creatures play on your expectations and force you to adapt. One boss fight pits you against a crowd of pyromancers that inches toward you, hinting at its weakness with subtle visual cues. Intuition tells you to keep your distance, but it soon becomes clear you'll need to enter the fray. It rips you out of your comfort zone at a harrowing pace.Despite the nuance and novelty of most bosses, however, some stick to familiar ground. Deja vu kicks in during several fights, when the monsters display move sets similar to those that came before them, diminishing the creativity displayed elsewhere. I brought down Pontiff Sullyvahn, the Consumed King, and even Aldrich--a boss the game purports to be one of my major targets--with tactics I had used hours earlier. These enemies feel recycled. They feel repetitive. The skin may be different, but the beast remains the same.One glaring design misstep involves a boss requiring a specific item to bring him down--that is, if you don't want to spend half an hour whittling away at his health. There is an earlier, obscure side quest that removes the need to use that item. But many players might not stumble upon it. Dark Souls is at its best when it rewards your growth, and tests your character's hard-earned experience. This boss fight doesn't--it has a very specific solution, despite the path you've taken to get there. This enemy, and the repetitive bosses, fly in the face of the progress you've made. They repeat patterns you've already mastered.So too does the overall level design of the late-game hours. Whereas most of Dark Souls III makes uses of labyrinthine corridors and trap-laden outdoor settings, these areas lose their design appeal as the game comes to a close. I expected Dark Souls III to carry me through imaginative fights and engaging treks as my character reached the apex of her skills, but instead I felt disappointed. I had come all this way with her, and aside from two fantastic end-game bosses and a handful of inventive secret areas in its waning hours, Dark Souls III seemed not to erupt, but rather, fade slowly into the fog.But by and large, your growth is respected. It's that thread--that near constant sense of progress--that leads to Dark Souls III's greatest moments. We create our travelers. We make them stronger, faster, more resilient, turning them into fighters as we too learn the intricacies of this foreboding world. We can't slay the final boss until we conquer every enemy before it, so by the end of Dark Souls III, we've truly mastered something. That's a special feeling."
Positive,While i was trying for 100% achievements some thing called Covid appeared idk.. anyone ?
Positive,"Fun game to play and very rewarding to ""git gud"" at. You will find yourself wanting to pull your hair out on numerous occasions, however. The game teaches you a lot of important skills that will help you in your normal life. Patience, awareness, resolve, perseverance, and stress resistance. After putting in some hours you will see yourself improving as well as your equipment. There are so many builds that you can go for in terms of leveling, weapons, and armor that you select. This game has great replayability, co-op, and PvP. Very in-depth in terms of lore and gameplay. There is never a dull moment in this game and it will always keep you on your toes. On top of all of this, this game has amazing graphics that still holds strong after being released 3 years ago. It's on sale right now, so give it a try!"
Positive,"I am sure that you have already discovered something about Dark Souls. But, If you have not played it yet, I must describe some brief details about it.It is difficult.It is more troublesome than you believe it could be.Not correct, I swear you that it will be the hardest gaming encounter of your lifetime.The message ""you died"" will become your typical screen picture after every failed attempt of boss killing.Nevertheless, finally, when you will entirely complete this torture the only way you would go is to launch the button ""start a new game"" because you would not be able to break this addiction.IwHtH's score:9/10Graphics:5/5Gameplay:5/5Story:4/5Optimization:4/5"
Positive,I like being a havel monster; it's fun. You should try being a havel monster. edit: proper grammar :)
Positive,"Dark Souls III is such a good game it feels really polished, i've only played DSR before this and it was really cool seeing all the references from DS1, the difficulty of this game is over exaggerated especially on the initial NG, i beat NG and NG+ with not that much difficulty and didnt summon for the majority of bosses. great series that has a steep learning curve but once you get passed that it becomes very very fun."
Positive,"Absolutely amazing game, the soundtrack makes me cry myself to sleep at night, challenging yet rewarding."
Positive,"Fear not the dark my friend, and let the feast begin."
Positive,You're not a man until you play this game.
Positive,Dark Souls 3
Positive,The best PVP and PVE game if you like a challenge and a good time
Positive,finally beat the tutorial boss
Positive,"Bought this game a year ago and spent 2 hours trying to beat the tutorial, gave up after that. Picked it up again and this game is amazing, not for the weak."
Positive,is pretty good
Positive,It is so good! I love to play it!
Positive,"At first I was a bit sceptical if I would enjoy this type of game. And I must say, I'm not regretting it at all! I'm pretty good at containing my anger so I haven't broken any headsets or monitors, but if you get angry easily, then good luck."
Positive,"Just play it, seriously"
Positive,VARY FUN AND GOOD

Positive,"It gud, many rolls, could use more common fruit."
Positive,Games is really hard but fun at most times. PVP also is really good you should try it once you played through the game. Also about the DLC's if you want the best DLC to money ratio only buy ringed city if you want content buy both.

Positive,"My husband introduced me to the DS world and I loved it so much, we had a Dark Souls wedding! This is by far my favorite game in the franchise and I recommend it to everyone!"
Positive,"Really Great game, I've played through it 3 times, love playing with friends, and amazing DLC."
Positive,YOU DIED*breaks table*
Positive,Great Game.Skill Level: Medium - InsaneLevel Design - BEAUTIFULEmotions when playing the game - REEEEE
Positive,A souls touching work of art.
Positive,"I played this game on my PS4 for some hundreds of hours, then I purchased it on Steam and I played it again. I loved completing the game with different builds, I loved playing for speedruns and I still love hanging around invading people or helping them. Every time I don't have a new game that catches me I come back here and I know I will enjoy every minute. This is my favourite game of all time."
Positive,"I love this game, and I'll tell you why I recommend it but let me tell you something 1st.The Online Aspect and PVP is very hit or miss now. Invading, and or being invaded takes ages and that comes with a majority of the player base leaving. I often times will wait 5 minutes or more to finally get an invasion in the most common invasion places such as Pon Sullivan. Having this said there are some things they should have improved upon with the pvp but overall I enjoy it.Now, with that being said the core game is absolutely fantastic. The Lore is extremely deep and interesting, the bosses are by far my favorite in any other game ever, and the amount of variety of which you can customize and change your character in every sense is the best I've ever seen. The Graphics are beautiful as hell, and most of the areas are extremely fun and interesting with few exceptions. Overall If you want to dive into this game you need to dive deep if you aren't ready for that then don't play it. It's one of my favorite games of all Time.Overall Rate - 9.4/10"
Positive,It's just like dark souls...
Positive,Polecam każdemu <3Nie bez powodu mam 100% achivków <3
Positive,I love this game so much
Positive,"I CRI EVERYTIEMi play on kb+mouse. usually not recommended for dark souls, but it works out.Great game"
Positive,"By far one of the BEST games I've ever played, not only because of it's fun and challenging gameplay but also because of how much this game has honed and trained me, I got this game after I got bored with Dragon's Dogma and was not disappointed to say the least, easily one of my top favorite games. Though it's anti-cheat system needs work since it can ban non-hacking players, here's hoping Elden Ring isn't like this though."
Positive,One of The Best games i've ever played in my life
Positive,dark souls 3 is an action filled game with lore so deep i dont think you would survive falling into it. the gameplay of this game   is incredible for pvp solo and most other methods leaving a fair chance for evreyone
Positive,10/10 Played in PS4 and came to PC. I love this game everything about it yeah the controllers are funky because was set to be with a controller but don't let that discourage you!
Positive,"I played every game in the Souls series (including Demon's Souls) and this is my favourite.The level design is incredible, every place you see is a place you can go. The story... well, I'm not going to pretend that I understood all of it, but I like the puzzling on your own aspect of it. I understand if that is a deal breaker to players who like a more dialogue heavy RPG. The PVP is better, it fells more balanced than the other entries in the series  (I still suck at it though). The worst part is, by far, the covenants. The grind for the covenant items is a very long ordeal and it's required for getting all of the achievements. Co-op has improved, you can summon your friends more easily now by setting a common password between players in the game settings. The combat is the same, but all weapons now have weapon arts, which adds another layer of strategy to the game. There is a large variety of weapons that suits various different playstyles, and they are well balanced, I believe all them are a viable option to finish the game. The spells are there, but I must admit that I didn't play much with them.All in all, this game looks like a refinement of all of the elements of the previous games. They picked the best features and implemented them with different levels of success. The game feels easier, but I think it's because I really got better at playing it during all this time, the challenge is still there but now I know what to look out for when in a dire situation. It's about having the patience to learn the patterns and react accordingly not rushing in flailing about with your weapon. Once you learn this, all the games in this series will be a lot easier."
Positive,My personnal order:#1: Dark Souls#2: Bloodborne#3: Dark souls 3#4: Dark souls 2Yet to beat: Sekiro + Demon Souls + Elden Ring
Positive,"If you want a game you can really sink your teeth into, look no further. It is the epitome of a ""Choose your own difficulty game"". Feel free to go in with nothing more than rags, a wooden club and a fistful of determination. Or if that doesn't float your boat, grind and level up you stats and weapons so every boss is a breeze, it is really up to you. If you want the ""Dark Souls experience"", I would recommend going in blind without guides or hints to truly experience the brilliance put into the level and character design. It is a breath of fresh air from the modern titles that are shallow and unfinished. The RPG elements offered really immerse you into this fantastical yet believable universe FromSoftware have crafted and keep you hooked in and devoted to your play through. Each new area begs the question: ""Where's the next bonfire?"", ""Is their a hidden item over there?"",""When is the next boss?"". This was the first Soulsborne game I have played, but it certainly won't be the last. 10/10."
Positive,I expected the game to be a bit longer. A mere couple of keyboards later I'm done with my first playthrough. 10/10 going for NG+.
Positive,Not funny didn't laugh
Positive,my life changed when i picked up this game.
Positive,This game stands out proud and loud in the Dark Souls series.
Positive,Best game ive played this year
Positive,Comfy and Cozy
Positive,"very good but very hardEdit: first review was from 3 hours in, 400 hours later - its not hard, still good though"
Positive,"What a beautiful game, solid look, familiar From Soft Formula, and smooth gameplay and a DLC that just doubles the game as a whole and gives more ways to play the game. 10/10"
Positive,"FREAKING LOVE IT!!! even if you never play any souls game before, get it on sale and give it a try... ignore all the git gud BS,cant beat a boss? do not hesitate to summon friends or any random people online! Multiplayer is awesome; coop, pvp, invasion and shit. Graphic is good, no need powerful PC to run the gameStory... well you need to read all the item descriptions but yeah its great (FIREKEEPER IS BAE>>>)Character customization, various weapons and armors to choose various boss fights, and not all of them are hardMY SCORE 10/10JUST BUY IT! wont get disappointed!"
Positive,"It's time to tell a little bit about Dark Souls 3. So when I first met the Dark Souls series, it was the second part, I played with pleasure and I liked it, but the first part was not finished. That's why I played the third part. Dark Souls captured me with their fight, climate and history that lies behind all the missiles and which we can discover or completely put down and think that we are here to kill. Focusing on Dark Souls 3, it is a bit different from the previous parts, if only because it is faster and I could say that it reminds me of Bloodborne, but it is not very fast, but not slow. Added to this are various minor mechanics. But it's about the speed of bosses and opponents, which has changed drastically, the game has set the pace. That's why I recommend this game because it is amazing (even when you die). I'm not talking about the level of difficulty here, but about the mechanics, climate and history about which my head exploded. To sum up, if you are a fan of Dark Souls and you are thinking about buying, I personally recommend especially if you want to do it in 100% in achievements, and my friends play in cooperation mode, we are playing 100% because the team. But if you're in touch for the first time, start from the first part to this, because in my opinion, Dark Souls is not only a killing game, but also an amazing story, especially about how you get into it. That is why I would like to give her 10/10, because I do not see any flaws, I do not see them, even if I get angry, I keep coming back to her and speak positively about her.If you read this, thank you very much and I would like to say only one thing ... !!! Prise the Sun !!!"
Positive,Definitely recommended if you need a new controller and the old one isn't destroyed quite enough yet.This game will definitely give you few reasons to destroy it.
Positive,"Amazing game for people with patience and more patience and patience. Did I say patience, still the best anime game on the market, wait it's not an anime game?"
Positive,It's good if you like suffering.
Positive,"Hard, but great fun in co op. Combat is incredibly satisfying."
Positive,"Очень интересная игра, затягивает своей необычностью и сложностью"
Positive,This game made me gay (as in homosexual)
Positive,Will take you 5 minutes to realise what a good game it is.Will take you 500 hours to realise what a shit game it is.But by then it will be too late.
Positive,princess aheadedit:gotta love when you come across people who spam vitality and vigor on their character in pvp
Positive,It's one of those games where you hate it until you love itAnd then it has youForever*dodge roll*
Positive,The only game where people add you specifically to trash talk.
Positive,truly makes you bruh
Positive,"If you are having a bad time playing dark soul 3, all you have to do is git gud"
Positive,10/10 Best PVP Brawler around.Don't sip and spam R1
Positive,10/10 would die again.....Is it still worth buying in 2019 ? I think so
Positive,the best souls game ever
Positive,"A true masterpiece. If you like challenges ,lots of action, hard enemies and strategy, this game is for you. Specially if you aiming to play with friends, it becomes alot more fun. Be aware, this game can be pretty difficult for casual players but rewards persistence."
Positive,"An incredible game to spend time on those summer nights that you feel life is meaningless...There will be times when you will swear to the developers of the game, or smash your chair so hard that it will never work properly again, or beg the mercy of the bosses while crying. You'll judge your life decisions while going through the same place for the 100th time at 2 am.But the desire to beat the developers and being able to say ""I beat Dark Souls 3"" will keep you going, and there will be an undefinable joy as you hit the final boss for the last time.Throughout your journey, you'll witness deep stories of NPCs. I'd give 9.9/10 for its great gameplay, graphics and story.-0.1 for the harm I dealt myself while playing it."
Positive,A good challenging game!
Positive,Totally didnt break my mental health
Positive,beat the first boss after 28 tries and when i finally got to the final boss at 30 hours of gameplay i beat him first try
Positive,"pretty good game for pvp, pve areas are kinda bad and recycled but still fun"
Positive,Friend: How many times did u die?Me: yes
Positive,"best dark souls game, very epic."
Positive,"die a lot, fun very much."
Positive,"Amazing game hands down, personally I like DS1 the best because that was my first souls game. And playing through with a buddy is the way to go when trying something new. I know I might get a little hate from some fans for saying that. ""the best way to play a Dark Souls game is to play by yourself"" I think that's good for some people but not all, and I'm not one for being lost and pulling my hair out just to play a game. Rant aside, it's still a really good game all around alone and with friends!"
Positive,Didn't think I would enjoy D3 a lot but I'm hooked on it now. Game has a bunch of content that I've spent hours just reading through the wiki. Going deprived at first and dying to Index Gundyr 20 times wasn't the best idea I've ever had.
Positive,Not that hard
Positive,"Game: good, People: salty"
Positive,This game is like jojo. Some friend starts bugging you to play it. Then when you finnaly do you either love it or you’re trash.
Positive,this shit hard...
Positive,Ruined every other third person action RPG for me... SO good. Actually TOO good...
Positive,10/10 would get good again
Positive,"Sunk too much time in this, now I am hollow."
Positive,"This game features:- Deepest Lore- a large variety of environments and enemies that set up great memories for you and your pals, if you multiplayer- the potential for danger to come unexpectedly at times, which may end up having you lose a lot of souls- Many ways to play, from a variety of weapons and magic/miracles, armours and shields, to ducking and weaving through allYou might find foes insurmountable at times, but the key to Darksouls is knowing your enemy and environment.If you understand those things, you can beat anything."
Positive,Return from whence thou cam'stFor that is thy place of belonging.
Positive,"I got the game, i played the game, i loved the game."
Positive,Hard and challenging at the start with a somewhat linear difficulty curve. (excluding the tutorial boss) Solid graphics and solid gameplay as usual. Poise doesn't matter anymore so your choice of fashion is free too.
Positive,One of the best game i have ever played.PRAISE THE SUN!!!!!
Positive,Parry Parry Parry Parry Parry Parry R1 Roll Roll Roll Roll Roll Roll Roll I died
Positive,Frustrating but good.
Positive,This games ROCKS!! The best of all DS in my opinion.
Positive,A friend recommended the game and I wasn't disappointed.The game is fun even when you are on your 3rd run.There is always something to do and If you are done with your run you can start another one and try to get different outcomes in the questlines and ending.
Positive,"One of the rare games I've played that I actually explored every single corner and tried to complete as much as i can.Now I'm going for a 4th run and i still like it. Replay-ability is awesome, can create character as you want, and with the reborn feature you don't need to create new character and level it up to experience new classes. Graphics are beautifully awful, Storytelling is cool for anyone that likes a bit of mystery and connecting the pieces together.Only thing that I don't like about the game is that enemies can hit you through objects without getting staggered or anything.But again enemies occasionally can fall through the wall and die. So perfectly balanced."
Positive,You die sometimes.It good game.
Positive,"This game is like anal, Hard and painful, but you'll get used to it."
Positive,epic... simply epic
Positive,git gud simuator
Positive,>played through first time>did pontiff first try and felt like a god>got to the lord of cinder and took me 100 tries>wanted to kill myselfwould recommend
Positive,After this game every time I see a dog I wonder if he will run towards me and try to bite my face off.9/10.
Positive,"Hard game, but it's actually fun"
Positive,Balls required.Hurrah for bravery!
Positive,i just beat tutrorial bossedit: I beat the second boss
Positive,The soul of cinder ez
Positive,"This game is despair incarnate. A warped, dying world you must traverse to collect the wayward souls of those who might possess the strength to preserve the state of reality."
Positive,I got the game today and it is a lot of fun. I haven't played any game like it but I really enjoy it. If you rage easily after dying 100 times then it might not be the game for you.
Positive,"After over a year and a half of playing this game, I finally got gud"
Positive,"Worth every penny. Most fast paced and active Dark Souls, you will definetly spend some quality time with it. The difficulty can be tough at first but the longer you play the easier it becomes. Just the lack of active poise makes the game artificially harder. Just don't install Reshade/Sweet FX or use any free cam mods because it causes you to get banned."
Positive,"Beat the game again on PC a couple of months ago, still can't forget the first message in the intro.""Yes, Indeed, it is called Lothric, where the transitory land of the lord of cinder converge""Haha, I could already recite the intro. LOL.If you are looking for intense fights, giant bosses, obscure story line, hardcore Action RPG game , then Dark Souls III is the game for you. You wake up from the grave, beat Gundyr after a couple of tries, then you travel the forest, the cave, the underworld, the city of snow, finally you collect souls and link the fire.The art is also pretty cool, mid-age style castle , nice-looking equipment and monsters with characteristics.Oh , of course there is the innovation: 1. The weapon skill, each weapon has it's skill set on L2/LT/ZL button2. The MP bar, spells are now limited by the MP but not counts.The only pity is that the steam version does not support cloud saves, which left a potential risk of losing your save.So much for the PC , guess I'll continue my adventure on PS4 even I already get the platinum trophy.I'll beat Newgame 8+ !!Oh and how can you forget Hidetaka Miyazaki 宫崎英高 and his little game traps XD,  love you as always!!!  : )"
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 - 9/10Damn nigga this shit is wanna not gonna be able that shit, niggas like index and tard ass Leona in el castle go so hard bruh they hit me so hard they dont even do that bruh these bosses hard as fuq and that omg this shit gets intense and when you do the boss like a bagioloin times nothing happening till you find the way to beat the boss. Fun to play with frinds go to bathroom grab some soap and run that mother fucking fuck mother fucker cock on the ground so taht you can play wioth the friends that you love so that you can play woth they as friends. Nothing is better tan that friendship and darksouls will bring you toghether wioth your friends. I love the PVPVEPVE when with the swords they shoot at enemy woth the thim eis roght never giv up hope they might kill you but that does bot mean that your a bad p[layer it just means that you need to improve on a few things sp taht you can realise hwp mayn to do whwen you remeber to do the parry of attack woth your ampount of rahmming."
Positive,"Really challenging and even though you have your rage moments its still a very fun game to play, highly recommend buying."
Positive,Masterpiece in every dimension.
Positive,It's a nice casual game to help you unwind. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Positive,took my virginity
Positive,ah i love dark souls it pretty funny
Positive,This game will twist your balls and slam them with a hammer.
Positive,"The majority of bosses in this game are really creative and fun to fight. Areas aren't as interconnected as other souls games but its still really solid. Combat system is smooth, and pvp is fun, just don't be embered in Crucifixtion woods. Bosses aren't super hard but they pose a fun challenge. To be honest, some of the mini-bosses are harder than the actual bosses. Everything may seem difficult, but its fair for the most part. Game glitches sometimes but isn't too bad. I guess what I'm trying to say is if you want a game to introduce you to the Souls series then this is it. I'd rate it a 9/10, try it out."
Positive,"Honestly, one of the best titles I've ever experienced, it's not entirely that good as a game.But it sure does make up for it in it's story and Boss soundtracks.If you look at it as a PVE game it does its job quite nicely aside from some minor flaw and issues here and there such as getting stun locked to death, or just getting 1-2-3 shot by an enemy or boss here or there. and the PVP is kinda bad but it's entirely avoidable.As for the story and level design it's honestly one of the best I've played, The story is kinda held back but oh boy, it's there and it makes me want to play the first two games, the level design is quite nice and will allow for the player to book it and run past at least a quarter of the stuff in the game if they want.The soundtrack is a nice bonus, it's not always there but the boss tracks are really nice, especially the ones for some of the later bosses in the game.In the end its up to you if it's worth baseline $60 or not. Probably not worth the $85 for the deluxe edition but if the game is on sale. It's totally worth the buy if you're into it."
Positive,"great game, make sure to manually backup (there are no cloud saves)"
Positive,Fess ppč hra
Positive,it beats me like my crippling daddy issues
Positive,"Yeah, the game is hard at the beginning. But, over time it gets far easier. Or perhaps you just get better?"
Positive,Game is worth playing but I don't see myself coming back after Sekiro.
Positive,"i would only rekomend this game for the real hardcore gamers. But i would rate it a 11/10 best lore, best bosses, nice weapons, you fell wery free to do what ever you want but still folowing a course whith smal pices of lore that forms a long story. ps/ wait untill sumer sale ;)and if you did :"
Positive,Not for the casual gamer that is for sure. Amazing game with lots of history behind it. Hard to find but there are always lore videos and NPCs to talk to. Hard game but fun as hell to play! Praise the Sun and don't forget to dodge!!
Positive,This in my opinion is a great entry point to the Dark Souls series from a gameplay perspective. It is very precise and well polished with a perfect level of difficulty for those looking for a challenge. The game also lacks some of the more trap-like 'bulls*** moments that 1 and 2 have. Invasions can be a pain for those who do not like them but they can be avoided as it requires use of an item to make you open to be invaded although you do get this item activated automatically after you kill a boss but it will go when you die. This item does however enable you to play co-op so bare in mind if you want to play co-op you will be open to invasions.
Positive,"This game is very fun and i've spent hours upon hours on it. This game to me can never get old since there are so many secrets and things to do in the game. I really do recommend this game to people if they like RPG's or games that you progress and level and all that,."
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is probably my favorite Souls game in the francise.>It has controls that feel really smooth compared to the first and second game.>It has an awesome lore that you just want to know about.>Most bosses in the bosses have a fair challenge but can feel hard at the start.Lastly, the music and atmosphere. The atmosphere just feels great, it truly feels like a Dark Fantasy game that I always wanted. Some OSTs in this game are beautiful to listen to and never get bored when you hear them all the time.With that said, I think Dark Souls 3 is just incredible and if you're a newcomer in the series, then the third and last installment of the Dark Souls series is perfect."
Positive,"Keep calm and Git Gud.Great story, lore, bosses. Just get ready to die!10/10 Will play again"
Positive,"Me:Ah, back again for new challenges.Also Me: MYSOOOOOUULLLSSIMDONEWITHTHISGAME!!!!"
Positive,"first hour, immediately owned by a twink invader named ""stop manspreading"""
Positive,do i have to say it
Positive,Git GudDex = CasualR1!!!SpamRoll PVPNG+!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Cinders Theme = LITDancer is painChampion StunLordthis game is a 20/10 I really enjoyed it and I still do after 166H playtime im in NG+9 and still havent seen everything there is alot to explore. The gameplay is lit af fight system lit af bosses and story lit af cant say more I love this game and recomend it to ppl who like kinda harder games or who need a challenge BUUUT buy the dlc'sSUNLIGHT BROS uwu
Positive,Dark Souls 3 III is a super game it was so fun playing. i've never really played a RPG before so it was pretty new for but that just made it even more fun. i think it's great that you have to learn the patterns of the bosses and that made beating them even more satisfying. I was very intrigued by the story but still don't really get it. in a way that just makes it more intriguing.
Positive,"To start off id like to say this was my first souls game. I had started Bloodborne before, but never really got far. Now, to the review.I can safely say this is my favorite game ive ever played. The combat is so satisfying and rewarding. The bosses are so much fun, they have very good attacks, and i want to say right now that If you say the game is bullshit ever thats a complete and utter lie. Theres always something you could have done to save yourself (aside from bugs, those are problems) But the DLC, the Goddamnm DLC ANHDFNBSAHFHASf. Veyr good 10/10"
Positive,Sick game that makes you sick
Positive,"Challenging but once you get used to PC controls, its honestly one of the best games ever 10/10"
Positive,Change it cause someone screenshot :x
Positive,Killed the first boss. Kinda hard
Positive,"ok guys not gonna lie. this game got me a gf. i just love her spiny,slimy,superfulus body. aldritch!gwyndolin forever. thanks"
Positive,pretty good game. love it
Positive,How is there no cloud saving for this? It seems like a game that would have it in the first place since people put so much time into it.
Positive,"One of the best games I've ever played. Challenging, addicting gameplay kept me coming back for more. The sense of achievement after beating a difficult boss, or clearing an area you've been stuck on, is unparalleled. The DLC is also fantastic."
Positive,"I really can't say right now what they could have done better.It has everything a Dark Souls needs:- an interesting world - the obscure story- many, many armours and weapons- the choice to play it your own way- fascinating enemies and bossesand so much more...A great ending for the Souls series.9,5/10Edit: You can play it without it's predecessors, still i would recommend to have played at least the first game of the series.It just makes the game experience even better."
Positive,One of the best games i ve ever played
Positive,roll roll roll
Positive,"Having 391 hours on the game (currently) has given me a good idea of what makes me keep playing. Bosses- most of the time they're imaginative, dynamic and intimidating! After beating the game more than 3 times I can still be caught out by a random attack that sends the whole battle spiralling down hill, or learn that a boss actually has an attack I've never seen before ! (THE SOUL OF CIDER CAN PARRY :)) Which may be down to me just being a bad player, but it still keeps the battle amusing and entertaining despite the fact that I die.General gameplay - if you have a decent graphics card or maybe even a crap one, you're pretty much set, the only issue will be at the beginning of the ringed city DLC where frame rate is as slow as watching rain drizzle down a window :/ However does get better eventually :) Multiplayer- This is the main reason I still play this game ! Every invasion is different, hilarious or exciting ! The community holding the game up is massive and still around 5 years after release. Whether you're teaming up with friends to kill a boss or doing 1v1's outside pontiffs, it's always fun and usually turns into a slaughterhouse !"
Positive,"Gostei recomendo,não é um jogo dificil,tanto assim ou eu não devo ter chegado em alguma parte extremamente dificil ,um dos jogos com melhores areas ,combate a lá legend of zelda de 64,mas com muito mais armas e alguns elementos de survivor horror,vai com mindset que tu vai morrer varias vezes e não é tão dificil,tem areas opcionais que deixam o jogo bem mais facil com a possibilidade de poder ganhar nivel lá. A lore é confuso,mas eu prencho as lacunas com o que eu acho que as coisas que acontecem na historia significam ,mas tem se tu quiser ver a verdadeira lore tem uns video no youtube ,mas não é preciso.Achei que não ia gostar da tematica medieval a lá Berserk ,mas é bem bom.Chefes são bem legais ,mas eu prefiro explorar as areas novas e me ferrar com os ""minions"".Vou terminar e adiciono algo ,mas por enquanto achei muito bom."
Positive,"Dark Souls III was my first ever attempt at delving into a souls-like game. I have never been acquainted with such a title before, and i have to say this game is one of the best i've played in years; the gameplay, lore and atmosphere is done with so much care that it is just far too much to take in for a first playthrough.I had so much fun playing this game that the only apparent flaw i found was its explaining of controls to a player: you see, when i'm using a keyboard and mouse to play, i expect all the control prompts to be in keyboard and mouse. For no apparent reason, From Software decides that the PC port of this game should be in hand held controller language; consequently a first time player on keyboard and mouse would have spent a considerable amount of time learning the controls.Other than that, i highly recommend picking up this game for those with an immense amount of patience. Though i'm not sure how the other Dark Souls games hold up as i've never played the other two as of writing this review."
Positive,"Hands down, one of the best games i've ever played."
Positive,"☀️Press ""R2"" to pray"
Positive,I love all DS games
Positive,Still not max level
Positive,"A fine end to a fine series. 3 is not as well-constructed as the first, nor does it have the sheer options of the second in terms of equipment, but I think it strikes a balance between the two, has some gorgeous, albeit very grey, venues, and has (in my opinion) the 2 best end bosses in the series! All in all, I highly recommend this game, and the entire Souls(borne) series!"
Positive,This game turned me back to the Church.
Positive,"I love this game, i cant get enough of the story. I know it can be very triggering at times but the satisfaction of defeating a boss with effort feels very rewarding :)"
Positive,"i'm absolutely loving this game, it's full of challenging bosses, a beautiful soundtrack and gorgeous environments. praise the sun!"
Positive,Playing and getting good at Dark Souls III is like searching for girlfriend...1) You need a lot of patience2) Timing is everything.3) Being cooky is mistake.4) Panic = death.5) Always keen for details.$$$ ( WARNING : those tips are not tested irl sadly ) $$$
Positive,"dark souls 3 is pretty great! I have a decent amount of time on it. but i have to warn about somthing this game is NOT NOOB FRIENDLY! SO basiclly There is all kinds of crazy enemies Like Zombie things that turn into giant death snakes،Knights, dragons, ghosts, spirits and all of the weird creatures ! But anyways if you are going to get this game i suggest you look into some basic tips and whatnow! Anyways this game is very fun, very hard, and sometime just downright stupid, but if you like a challenge this game is for you!"
Positive,what to say
Positive,Worth the money... 0 deaths
Positive,"This game is amazing, everything about it captures my attention.but none of that means anything after you lose all of your souls, it sucks man.:("
Positive,This game slaps
Positive,"One of those games where you love and hate it, By love I mean play it over and over again because the gameplay is so well designed, and the feeling of finally beating that one boss is so satisfying you can’t stop. And the hate it’s from you losing to that boss that seems to never die! All and all the game is a solid masterpiece argueably this is the best one ever created, I’ll support fromsoftware in any project they do. Because this game was amazing."
Positive,"""You will die. A lot."" Or so a lot of people will say after playing this game. Definitely one of the best games of our lifetime that incorporates the trial and error games of classic games. Gameplay is the same as any souls-like game: you acquire souls that can be used for experience and currency; You die, and you drop every non-spent souls to the location of your death. You fail to reacquire those souls, those souls are forfeit; So those 100k souls you got from a boss and you lost them? Oops, they're gone forever. The good news is, you'll respawn after your death to the nearest bonfire you lit. That's the beauty of this game, you get to fix the mistakes that led you to your death.If you've played the previous souls games, you will know how convoluted the lore is. You would have to read every item description and pick up the lore yourself, piece by piece. Dark Souls 1 was the best when it comes to lore-building with characters that are so empathetic and it set the stage for a world full of sadness that is present throughout the series... Or so I thought. Darksouls 2 was ""meh"" in this regard. The lore strayed from anything relating to the first game and it made less of a sequel (for me) and more of a spin-off souls game. Dark Souls 3, however, gave the series the much needed finale everyone is clamoring for: Seeing previous places from the 1st game and previous NPCs you helped (or killed) along the way. If you're worried about the story, don't; Dark Souls 3 is a proper sequel to the first game and you wouldn't be disappointed with the world building and aesthetics the director went for.If you're tired of modern games' too easy approach with action RPGs, play the Dark Souls series. If you played the previous games and you're on the fence on buying the ""last"" Souls game, I can say with certainty that Dark Souls 3 is the proper send-off you're looking for. So go ahead and ""take the plunge, you won't die."" While you're at it, remember that Praising the Sun is vital to your success."
Positive,This game is amazing. It's kinda hard but don't give up ok
Positive,Worth the money go for it while the sale!
Positive,"Like having a third child, this one looks better than the other 2, but ultimately you don't love it as much as the first and you'll end up neglecting it."
Positive,"I personally loved the game it has a lot of pluses but it also has some minuses .+The overall story is pretty great, though confusing at times of you don't pay attention.+The game has an amazing atmosphere. +The music is personally my favorite part about the game. I can even call it my favorite of all time. +The graphics aren't anything special but combined with the lighting makes up for some stunning visuals .- The game isn't for everybody as it is known the game can be challenging at times and the gameplay might get frustrating .- Though playable on both a controller and a keyboard, for people who want I guess less of a challenge might want to invest in a controller (even though I myself am playing with a keyboard).So in conclusion if you love depressing stories and a bit of a challenge this game is for you."
Positive,"I try, I cry."
Positive,dex gon give it to ya
Positive,Love getting my ass kicked
Positive,Well... It's fun... But only after your ass will be F♥♥♥♥♥ hundred of times..
Positive,Very good game. Highly reconmend.
Positive,Nominated for GOTY 10/10 would praise the sun again.
Positive,One of my favorite games.Would be better if my friends could finish a game with me xD
Positive,it goog vro
Positive,"If you have never played dark souls 3, you are missing out on one of the best experiences gaming has to offer."
Positive,Nice soundtrack :) recommend this game for a satisfying kill :D
Positive,"I've beaten this game 3 times at this point and have only played it for 66 hours.  Everytime I play it I am amazed by the levels Fromsoft have put together. Every boss, character, enemy, and location is so unique I always look forward to seeing something new. The combat is spot on, Every time I die I know it was my fault, There was no game mechanic that I couldn't get past or some bug, I simply was not skilled enough. I would train, level up, and go back an try again I would win. Additionally finally beating a boss that you have been stuck on is the most satisfying feeling.  The only gripe I have with DS3 is the RNG can get the best of you sometimes. All in all this game truely is amazing, I would definitely would put this game in my top 3 favorite games. However do not play this game if you easily get angry or don't like challenges."
Positive,"Though I have not yet experienced the entirety of the game, so far I’d say it has a fantastic pro-to-con ratio. (Will update once I have finished the game.) Pros: I like that there is a constant objective to reach, (bonfires) so it does not feel like you’re only playing from start to end. This game is really enjoyable to play with friends and a great bonding experience since it takes good communication and sequence to defeat certain bosses. The graphics is very good and the lore is well-written, I myself enjoy reading each person/creature I come upon’s background stories and information.Characters are completely customizable and you can make your character look like you if you put in the effort and time. Everything on your face/body can be altered to look like a replica of you. The monsters are creepy looking like you would expect from a horror-genre game. However these monsters are capable of triggering anxiety for most common fears. (Which adds to the charm of the game for me at least.) The difficulty is quite hard but I find it endearing and makes me want to play this game from morning to night. The hard early-on bosses prepares you for the later battles, and is almost similar to Monster Hunter when it comes to combat style. If you die you do not immediately lose the souls you collect (The in-game currency) The game lets you retrieve it unless you die before you reach the location it dropped. [There’s honestly so many pros but I can’t name them off the top of my head, I’ll just name them later when I update this...]CONS:The FPS drops can get irritating and prevents me from playing with other online people. (This can be fixed, I just haven’t attempted.)It feels like I spend most my time on this game looking at the loading screen because it takes forever to load. The first boss made me have a couple mental breakdowns and I think the game can lower his difficulty just a little bit for first DS players like me. (Took me 13 hours to defeat him.) The places are really hard to navigate even with the blood stain lore paths. (I don’t read them, there’s too many.) Though this could honestly just be a me problem. This game slowly eats your time, but it’s always a choice"
Positive,Its a great game to play!

Positive,I fucking hate those dogs...One of the best games i've ever played10/10
Positive,"I'm a student. I didn't want to sacrifice my studies by choosing games over studies; so, i made a personal contract that i would study for 15 minuttes for every time i died in this game. i'm graduating from an Ivy league school with honors. Difficulty tag is no joke."
Positive,"This is the first Dark Souls that I play, I always had this mental image on what this game would be, but I was not expecting that it delivered much more of ""YOU DIED"" as I expected.This game is visceral, unforgiving, full of mystery and gritty. If you are expecting a friendly, but boring tutorial that will pleasantly guide you through the UI and the game mechanics while showing several colorful popups on your screen, well, you won't find it. There is a minimal if not lacking explanation of everything. If you enjoyed the times where you were playing Isaac and you had no idea of each item does, this is for you. I wasn't able to progress much more than 30 minutes early in the game without having to read walk-throughs. I hadn't rage quitted a game since my most unsuccessful games of League of Legends, this game was to be special. Weird items, strange locations, confusing map (is there even one?), hard encounters, ambushes, overpowered enemies, unfair abilities, losing stuff when dying... the list goes on! It has been a while since I had a fear of engaging an enemy, that dodging to attack felt like it mattered or even the feeling to find a checkpoint, the perception of progress was one of a kind. And yes, I am fully aware that I am terrible at this game.If you are looking for a hardcore RPG experience, this might be the game for you. I am not sure if I will be ever able to beat this game as my hatred towards it builds up as each death, but who knows in some time."

Positive,"Dark Souls III is a fantastic game with vast scenery and a lot of 'lore' packed behind. The combat system feels good, however, a few glitches makes the number of deaths in Dark Souls III feel unfair. Another thing I'd like is more pariable bosses, but the variety of boss behaviours and the learning curve makes the game feel great. 9/10"

The gameplay and mechanics are pretty good , better than the other souls games (yes backstab chains, adaptability and ugly mechanics sucked) .-The history it's ""ok"" , and the fanservice is too damn high and unecseary, but is not relevant I guest,.-Covenant and quest are very simplified , it's ok for the new players but don't feel at the same way of the older games. -PvP builds are diverse (not viable but diverse) , also it's an excellent game for cosplayers.In resume: Purchase it on discount if you are a dark souls Fan, I recommend to play the last two games first because of lore and enjoy the excesive Fanservice. PS: I don't own the DLC on PC , but played it on Xbox one and are pretty fun, specially ringed city."

Positive,"4 hours, 10+ deaths, 1 pvp loss, 1 dead boss. 2 falling deaths. And the game has only just begun"
Positive,Gotta gid gud to play this game
Positive,"This game gives you the feelings that it should give perfectly. You feel the pain, agony, despair this world has been through along with the linking of the first flame. The enviroment is full of buildings which are old and distorted (I mean it's pretty cool) Soundtrack is incredible too. (Stuck in the title screen please help ost is op asf)"
Positive,"Dark Souls III is an amazing game full of challenge and hardship. I have only completed two endings so far, and I put a whole two years in between the playthroughs, but that doesn't detract from how much of a blast I was having the whole time. I played my first playthrough almost 100% blind. I played my second playthrough following tons of guides online, learning how Scalings worked, and being efficient with my levels (not just pouring them into Vitality and Strength). There are so many subtle details in everything: gameplay, story, and visuals. The sound design is great too (Music is good, SFX are good), but I wouldn't pinpoint it as one of the main things that held me to it. Of course, good sounds design isn't exactly 'supposed' to be noticed, because then it wouldn't be ""subtle."" Anyways, this is becoming more of a rant/rave than a review. I'll end it here.Honest to GabeN, one of the best games I've ever played in my entire life. 10/10(P.S. I put a bunch of hours into this game in offline mode, because I was in AIT without Wi-Fi or a Mobile Hotspot to connect online with.)"
Positive,"5/7, R1 button mash simulator. Game is not meant to be played Co-OP invasion mechanic is hot garbage with griefers and hackers. Co-Op also requres you to farm an item for some reason. Rpg builds have an amazing sweet of diversity including fast swing small sword and slow swing bigsword with magic dipping sause. Specking into magic or archery is about as useful as dodge rolling into them for damage. Game is significant downgrade from Dark Souls 1 with sh11ty map design and lack of large goddess t1tt1es. PvP is a significant upgrade from DS1 with the inclusion of netcode. Watching lore videos online makes you wonder if you played the same title. Ending feels as satasfying as an abortion. Overall wait for dlc and buy the whole package on sale."
Positive,"Best game ever, enjoyed it."
Positive,You would think after this many hours I would be able to kill an invader.
Positive,Frustrating but wonderful
Positive,Played the game for 90 Minutes thought it was cool got invaded 2 times by high level players that humilated me the worst possible way. Felt like shit. Got beaten up by a starter boss multiple times. 10/10 would die again
Positive,"SL1 challenge completed, ez"
Positive,"tl:dr Just an amazing and beautiful game that i cant let go off.Now for real, there's so much that makes this game good that i have to apologise if it gets messy trying to show all of it. The first thing i have to say is about the difficulty. While the meme ""The Dark Souls of..."" can be both annoying and hilarious, the difficulty isnt That Bad, the game is challenging but fair for example when a group of enemies seems unbeatble you still have many options, from running through them, learning their moves, gainning an advantage point or even farming previous enemies to become stronger. The trick to dark souls is having lots of patience, some rythm and never quitting on the idea that you have to ""Git Gud"" because you will reach that stage by simply playing without qitting.Another hallmark of dark souls is the music, which is mindblastingly EPIC, it surrounds you and while you might not realise it's there, if you go listen to it without the hectic bossfight you'll somehow know exactly how it sounds and from which boss its connected to. I know big orchestral works aren't everyone's cup of tea, but for those like me, you'll love it!The gameplay is mildly smooth, by which i mean, itll respond quickly and most of the times it's one of the best parts of the game, but this only works when you get used to the attack animations. They're your biggest weakness, as you can't stop middway, you cant correct where you'll attack and you cant stop your enemies from punishing you for misjudging an attack and you wont get used to gameplay unless you get confortable with it.The game has multiple levels of new game+ and a lot of online things to do that'll keep you busy for too long, in fact my problem is keeping the game down and playing something else, because once you start loving it nothing else can give you the same feeling and it has enough content to keep you playing.I love the game, the experience it gives is one of a kind, and while it's worth the price and more, its understandable if you're going to wait for dicounts."
Positive,Dark Souls 3 is the Dark Souls of Dark Souls.
Positive,"Very good game! Great graphics, some hidden but deep and interesting lore, epic story, dramatic and very cool music and a lot more to explore in Dark Souls 3. I highely recommend the game, but do consider that this is a very difficult game and if you want to explore the story then you will need to get past all the challenging areas and progress."
Positive,This game is like dark souls
Positive,Quite Hard indeed
Positive,"This game? The best game from Souls series. Dark Souls 3 is the better brother of Dark Souls 1. While DS1 was a gem, DS3 is a Jewel clear as a day. The graphics are splendid, and they feel truly smooth. Had a hard time getting used to DS1's clunky graphics after investing 150 hours into the third part. The gameplay feels naturally difficult and fair. Die, analyze, die, try everything, and eventually succeed. While being known for its difficulty level, its not unfair.  There are plenty of weapons to choose from, so I'm sure everyone will find something made just for them.Your patience will be put on line many times, so i definitely can't recommend it for anyone with short temper. Definitely recommended.P.S Don't fight Friede. Your sanity is worth more."
Positive,"I've heard a lot about the ""Souls"" games over the years, never really thought I'd play one of them though. Yet here I am, partially because a friend bought it for me and almost made me feel bad for not playing it.IDK what else to say about it other than: it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. Hard, sure, but not insane-level hard. Of course that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy feeling like a god for finally killing that stupid Soul of Cinders after 10+ deaths.The DLCs (especially The Ringed City) makes this game even better.Base game: Deluxe edition:"
Positive,One of the best games :)
Positive,I replaying this game on pc its never get old fuckin Awsome Game :-x
Positive,Took me two hours to defeat the first boss.
Positive,Its a really good game
Positive,"An epic ending to a great trilogy! Darksouls III has all the stuff that you love from the previous installment. The bosses, the challenge, etc. It is still very challenging and the story is a sad one if you know it through reading item descriptions or the wiki."
Positive,Bestest game. 10/10 would rage again
Positive,"If you hate yourself, then this game is for you. My relationship with this game is like an abusive boyfriend. He keeps hitting me and hitting me. But I'm like ""No baby, I still love you"". And I come back for more and more."

Positive,dark souls iii is the game of all time
Positive,"Got this off the monthly Humble Bundle for $12 a few weeks ago and just finished the main game.Pros:- Good variety of weapons, spells and armor. Weapons and some shields have weapon arts or parry animations which add more variety to combat.- Good variety of enemies. Each new level you get to you'll see new enemy models who will have different attacking patterns which helps keep the game fresh. Most levels will also have a mini-boss which can be even more challenging than some main bosses.- Good map design which encourages exploration.- Good boss fights. This is the part of the game where you're probably going to spend most of your time and you can see the devs put a lot of effort into those. The scenery when you enter some of the boss areas is simply amazing like when  you are in the cathedral and about to fight Point Sulyvahn and he's slowly walking towards you and his sword goes in flames- Great soundtrack. Not much to add here honestly.- Lore is fairly decent if you're willing to read through item descriptions (plenty of youtube videos covering this if you can't be bothered to read). There's not much story going on though aside from item descriptions and a few dialogues.- Replayability is there in the form of NG+ where you basically start off from scratch with the same character. There's also pvp stuff like duels or invasions if you can ignore the delayed hit reg.- Plenty of secrets if you're into collecting every item there is in the game.- Co-op is there which is a nice featureCons:- Bad camera controls. Camera focus randomly breaking or your camera randomly shaking are just a few things that you will have to deal with on a regular basis. - Game mechanics are poorly explained. Tutorial only goes over combat and still manages to leave out important things like weapon arts, staggering or poise. Weapon ugrades, transposing boss souls and weapon scaling are other examples of game mechanics that are poorly explained. - Not a stellar port. Constant fps drops in some areas like Irithyll dungeon or Archdragon peak. - Noticeable texture popping - Lots of bugs ranging from harmless ones like getting stuck in fog to game breaking ones like bosses glitching into walls or staggered bosses parrying attacks and one-shotting youConclusion: this was a good game for me and I would recommend it if you can put up with some of the technical problems the game is suffering from"
Positive,"Only after putting hundreds of hours into Elden Ring have I realized how much better we had it with the main Souls series, and how harsh I was giving DS3 a thumbs down. If you want a game that actually rewards you for learning it - this is an easy recommend from me."
Positive,"9/10My first Souls game and I loved it. (DSIII + Ashes of Ariandel DLC)+ epic boss fights+ high difficulty+ most levels had great layout+ alot of lurking/items/secrets+ equipement design (fashion souls ftw)+ weapon mechanics - each weapon type delivers a different experience+ PvP (although I played only a little so far)+ character builds+ ATMOSPHERE! (combined music/graphics/design)+ I expected far worse controls? I liked the not so obvious ""quest"" system but I felt like I could use a small journal ? I wanted even more NPCs and quests- console controler descriptions in the tutorial- camera can give you hard time once in a while"
Positive,Great game to spend hours trying one boss. If you where looking for advice i would have to say git gud.
Positive,"Not gonna lie , you gonna have love/hate relationship with this game. All good!"
Positive,This is a really gud game but Iudex Gundyr keeps killing me even with cheat engine i cant beat this boss but the game is very nice i beat midir on my first try
Positive,Every boss fight is EPIC. The thrill of conquering makes me keen to explore the world further.
Positive,"I always thought Dark Souls 3 was good, but not great. 7.5/10 or so. I had played through 99% of the game, DLC included, so even at “good” I definitely kept coming back. And then, in what would become the most memorable gaming experience of my life, something clicked.Potentially game ruining spoilers ahead!It started off slowly. First, I finally understood the appreciation and admiration the hitboxes get. I grew to appreciate them too, and in game, I grew to appreciate close calls. And I thought about the work that went into the technical part of building the hit boxes, and tried to imagine that math that went into them. It was beyond me, but I imagined that it was complex, but had to be solvable. After all, the hitboxes were extremely well done. So I was impressed about the technological aspect of the game. These hitboxes had to have been just right for this game to work.But, wait. “Solvable.” “Just right.”And then I asked myself: “What if Dark Souls” is solvable? CLICK! Dark Souls isn't an action game, it's a puzzle game.And once I adopted that mindset - action and counter action, step, counter-step – the end boss that ignites the Dark Souls 3 community to the point of division became solvable.You effectively ""undo"" the actions of your opponents the game. It gets to the point that it's basically rhythmic.The boss I had struggled with across multi-hour long sessions went from maddeningly hard to frustrating to confusing to manageable.And from manageable to predictable. And predictable to easy.I will note that even though I had an understanding of the boss, it still took many more tries, as my occasional missteps did add up, and the punishments and odd reward did correct me. Once I even watched myself perform the incorrect action with both myself and the boss at last life, one hit to go. I attacked when I should have rolled. ""Damn, that's going to cost the match,"" I thought, and it did. I went back, and eventually I had the bosses’ pattern down so well that the narrative I told myself as I played had gone from frustrated to friendly! I started talking to him like a misbehaving puppy. I grew to appreciate him, losing again and again. In another match, I finally noticed that this boss is blind, and ""holy shit, they programmed that into the game!"" His attacks are brutal and relentless not out of ferocity but out of desperation. He must shut down whatever threat may be present as quick as possible, as everything that fights him has the advantage of sight! His ""tantrums,"" as I hand started calling them, became pitiable. He was scared. My narrative shifted from annoyed to soothing. I empathized with the boss! I felt sorry for him! Dark Souls 3 made me bond with perhaps the hardest boss in the game. Eventually, the time came when I realised that I clearly had the upper hand. I was going to win. Victory was nearly assured, and what did I feel? Sadness. I felt sad.  I felt sadness similar to the feeling one gets when you put down a beloved pet. The final stroke felt like a duty. A necessary evil. I stood in the empty cavern after, and wondered “what now?” For me, Midir had become the game. I empathized with a blind old dragon, and Dark Souls made me put it down like Old Yeller.What the fuck Dark Souls.10/10 would play again. Masterpiece."
Positive,"Definately one of the greater games I have played. I have 71 hours and I haven't completed the game yet, This is because the game is so unique with classes and different play styles that I end up making new characters just to have some fun.Areas never seemed repetitive for me, I was always excited to move on and encounter enemies which were challenging yet fun to battle. You can also really tell the difference between areas as they were so well made.Yes this game can be a little frustrating at times, for example some of the side quests you are bound to fail because you barely are given any clue as to what to do. Then again that's what the game is about: difficulty.I would 100% recommend this game to people looking for a challenge and who want to replay the game over and over again."
Positive,"A challenging game set in a gritty and dark fantasy world.  The game alone is a tough and unforgiving one that will punish players for mistakes until success is achieved.  This, when paired with the PVP aspect makes the game a very difficult one to pick up casually.  However, it is by far one of my favorite games.  The determination it takes to get through the game without help allows you to grow as a gamer and be able to take on any challenge the game throws at you.  Not to mention that the lore in this game and all of the rest of the franchise is among the richest and well thought of in any game I have ever played.  Overall, it is a great game to play by yourself or with friends.  Just don't expect it to be easy, and you'll eventually get the hang of it.  If you can beat Dark Souls, there aren't many games you can't conquer."
Positive,"First DS title I'm playing. If you think this game looks way too overwhelming, then you thought the same as me. Buy I can tell you now, I was wrong (you still might be right btw).This isn't just a pray you don't get killed game, you make peace with dying quick... Or should at least. There is so much lore in this game that I'm going to play through again once I've finished it (not even close yet) to play with a full guide. Strategy, dodging, not using the estus button to fight is key in defeating any enemy you encounter. Diablo is for noobs. Try it out. It's so cheap. On humble bundle. I do however recommend a controller. Keyboard is playable but the keys are all weirdly placed."
Positive,"HOW IT PLAYSCompared to latest entries, the control of the character is now very close to perfect, fluid and you feel 100% in control of it. Said this the ""casualification"" of the gameplay is obvious. The combat is less punishing and it's too easy for the player to avoid damage, which I guess it's okay because damage absorption is fucked, it never really makes a difference how much armor you have. The online works good enough. As a host the more phantoms you have the more likely you are to get invaded, so from the invader's perspective you're going to be fighting in a 2v1 situation in average. It may seem a huge advantage but it's not really, people who summon that amount of phantoms is because they are not good at the game so in the end it's nicely balanced, although I think there should be a system to punish endless resummoning of phantoms. It's still p2p so this alone is going to produce salt on both ends.HOW IT FEELSThe game is good. Not great. The dlcs have pretty memorable bosses but for the most part the game feels uninspired. Contrary to the first entry of the series the game gets better in its second half, lothric castle is a really solid area and from there to the ending is really good, as well as the DLCs which are also quite good. BUT -there's always a but- it has lost the magic of dark souls, the atmosphere, the fever-dream-like sensation of being immersed in the story is gone.A really solid game that perfectioned technicalities and mechanics of previous entries but has lost the ""Berserk"" feel that made Dark Souls so good. A good game nonetheless and the ost is quite good on this one.The best entry point in the saga for newbies."
Positive,"This is a masterpiece in the history of hardtime games.You will get your ass kicked more time than you can say ""Praise the sun.'Me and another 984068406106840 players recomend this game <3"

Positive,VERY deep lore being experienceed at INCrEDIBLE H IH G SPEeedS
Positive,As someone who was newer to the souls series I can say that this game is great for people looking to pick up the souls series. It's hard at first but with time invested this game becomes a gem. Even after beating the game discovering the PvP scene makes it feel like a whole new game all over again. All in all would definitely reccomend!
Positive,"Just finished first playthrough.INCREDIBLE DAMN GAME.FInally got around to giving this a proper go and I'm incredibly happy that I did. I've played Dark Souls PTDE and enjoyed it but this really knocked it out the park. Fantastic lore, great bosses, beautiful environments and seemingly endless amounts of exploration.Defeat the lords.Kindle the flame.GIT GUD."
Positive,"Would I recommend this game...Absolutely, I love the game but what I see in the reviews is people feel as though they don't know what they are talking about in their reviews, this game is easy and here is where the root of all my issues stem from. Just gonna clarify again, I absolutely loved this game and it's still my go to game. However you people who say this game is ""insanely hard"" and the ""hardest  game"" you've ever played is total bullshit. This game has it's core mechanics that you are expected to learn with Ludex Gundyr, and master before the Lord of Cinder or nameless king... However the biggest issue with the game is it's exploitability with enemies and terrain that allow you to get easy kills which inherently makes the game a shit ton more easy to beat... There is too many bonfires too! Like what the hell? This is a darksouls game, this isn't supposed to reward the player for holding down the run button across a bridge to Irithyll... Abyss watcher freeze glitch Irithyll dungeon wall skip, allows you to quickly get from the entrance of the dungeon to the Profaned Capital. Giant worm guarding the Old demon boss, can be killed by the ballista... Giant demon can be killed by mimic in the Catacombs of Carthus Yhorm can be 4 hit with a sword???????? Irithyll Wall hop skip"

Positive,Amazing game. I finally feel like i achieved greatness when i beat this game. Life is now complete.
Positive,"After being very interested in the challenges games like Dark Souls represent I have tried, and failed (many times) to get INTO a Dark Souls game. I tried Dark Souls, Dark Souls II and many other games that use a similar concept such as the direct clone but (whilst at times beautiful) very flawed Lord of the Fallen...and they just never clicked with me. Something about them just seemed off in some way.Dark Souls 3 is a different beast in my opinion, I have completely and utterly fallen in love with this game. Visually its stunningly (grotesquely) gorgeous. The art style is captivating. Ive spent quite a bit of the game just bathing in the horrific/gothic architecture. Lighting effects are used to incredible effect on environments and characters or beasties. The first time I encountered a rather large creature (no spoilers) hugging the walls of a huge structure I was in complete awe. Visually its probably one of the best looking games, maybe even the most beautiful game I have ever played. And the creature design is simply awesome. A lot of love and attention has been put into creating every single one of them. Big and small....and HUGE!Gameplay wise - well, its a Dark Souls game so it dishes out punishment in heaps and then some. I have had my ass handed to me so many times and I still keep going back for more. What is great though, is it never feels truely unfair. In most occassions, if you die, its because you probably cocked up in some way, or you just arent ready for that fight yet. The combat is tight and responsive and absoloutely relentless in its punishment for mistakes. Learning how an enemy moves, what its strengths and weaknesses are and playing the patient game, waiting for that opening that will help you get the edge when you are up against a boss is probably one of the most rewarding experiences in a video game - providing it pays off of course.Level design is outstanding, from craggy clifftops to dungeons and castle keeps and ramparts. It can be a maze of secrets, terrors and beauty and it never gets old or feels samey. There are so many secrets to discover in this game and so much to explore. I find myself traversing back through areas 5 or 6 times and still finding something different or something I missed before.Sound design is also top notch and definately helps to immerse you. Whispers or wails can be generally creepy whilst the sounds of enemies and especially bosses just get better for each encounter.I seriously cant recommend this game enough, even those that have tried previous Dark Souls titles and failed to get into them. Give Dark Souls 3 a shot. It is definately the most polished of the 3 and is just an incredible rewarding and yes at times infuriating experience. But its an experience that shouldn't be missed.GRAPHICS - Holy *hit biscuts!GAMEPLAY - Hold my beer!LEVEL DESIGN - I'm lost, a little scared and if I'm honest, probably a little excited too.SOUND - Probably one of the most terrifying aspects of the game.OVERALL - It will tear your soul apart!"
Positive,One of the greatest.
Positive,This game can be summed up as thus:Thomas died!
Positive,My friend thinks I hate him because I made him get this game.10/10

Positive,"Whenever I am playing this game, I use a variety of cuss words at least 20-30 times in a sitting. Highly reccomended.  Don't forget to praise the sun."
Positive,"There are only 2 games which I enjoyed enough to finish the single player campaign more than 5 times. First one was Half Life 2, and the second one is Dark Souls 3. I've put  300+ hours into the pirated version of Dark Souls 3, and now it's on sale, so I could afford to buy it. Sure there are plenty of good games out there, but I think this DS3 is special."
Positive,"I guess it's about time I ""review"" this game.Dark Souls III is good; it's damn good, but not great.The combat is solid (I'm talking single player only, P2P sucks and I think we can all agree on that) and it's a lot of fun knocking heads around.  The environments are stunning to look at as well, no doubt...But...This game doesn't capture what made DS1 great, and honestly, I don't think anything will from here on (Bloodborne almost did it...).  It's clearly a fan service game, and that's fine I suppose, but it could have been something much more.I don't mean to sound so negative about the title; as I said, it's a good game, probably the best out of the three to get newcomers into the series.  However, it definitely falls short of what it could have been.All in all, I freakin' love these games so I'll end up being bias no matter what I say.  Try it out if it looks like something you're into.R.I.P. DS"
Positive,"This is a MUST HAVE game. Not only Dark Souls III, but all of them. Story, graphics, mechanics and, of course, level of difficulty made this game one of the best I've ever played. Strongly recommend!"

Positive,Finger but hole
Positive,4 hours later and I finally defeated my first boss. it took 10 mins to reach the boss from the start of the game and took 3h30m for me to actually kill it.I can't wait for what lies ahead me.(( save me ))
Positive,Easiest game in Souls series. No poise.But Still very fun. And beware some redbois :)
Positive,So keyboard and mouse unfriendly but overall a good game
Positive,"this is a good game but the references are way too frequent there's a difference between fan service and just shoving references in your face every 10 mins too much. anyway you will definitely have fun with this it is not the best souls game but as a souls-like game, it's pretty decent. if you aren't comparing it to one of the older souls titles I would have to give this game an 8/10 for a souls like experience that will still fill you some of that mystery and awe that the first game had have fun with this game and don't gank because I will find you if you gank. (don't correct me on my spelling)"
Positive,"Let me start off by apologizing for likely errors in my spelling, as english is not my first language.I'd like to say that DS3 is probably the most approachable of all the souls games, as it's a bit more streamlined and easier than the previous ones in my opinion. The story is a little clearer but not entirely revealed, some blanks are filled in with item descriptions or by your own imagination if you're not into reading that much.The game offers a lot, and I mean a lot of gear options and even more if we go into spells and ""hidden gear"". That said, it's entirely possible to complete the game with the starting gear if you so choose or just find something you like and go with it, it doesn't really matter what you use if it gets the job done.The online experience is one of the many reasons I love this game, even after hundreds of hours of play (My total time with this game is not reflected here as I also own it on ps4). You could be making steady progress and doing ok even until suddenly ""thisdudeyoudontknow has invaded"" runs up to you from nowhere, maybe even gets a hand from another invader, or attacks you in a bad spot and puts you in your place without so much as a wave. It's part of the Dark Souls experience, an essential part even. That also makes it all the more enjoyable when invaders show you the courtesy of letting you clear out the mobs around you first, even heal yourself and make it a duel. All in all this is a great single player game, a great multiplayer game and certainly a challenge for new players.Solid 9/10 in my book."

Positive,"My first attempt at dark souls was dark souls 2. I found it easy yet annoyingly slow and sluggish, which could be because I was playing on the ps4 at the time. I swore I would never play another Darksouls game again because to me Dark souls 2 was utter garbage. With that said I decided to give Dark souls 3 a chance to drag me into this franchise that many people seem to think is good. I must say I believe I'm starting to understand why people enjoy the Dark Souls series. The game can be challenging I wont say hard because if you use your head in combat and focus on building your character the way you like it than it's not hard. What I have come to love about Dark Souls 3 is the focus on character progression, This game is centered around it and if you don't focus on your character progression you will be punished in certain places in the game. With all this said I believe that this game is beautiful and well built the controls could use a bit more work however they dont make the game unplayable."
Positive,I have to admit that this is kind of the game that you love and hate at the same time. If you found dark and hard rpg interseting this is definitelythe ONE you need.
Positive,"Easily the best game I have ever played, great story and gameplay, diverse endings and a great closure to the souls series."
Positive,"Hardest Game Ever Created, but it is also AWESOME!!!11/10"
Positive,I hate this game so much... And still I love it more than anything.
Positive,This game is a lot like Dark Souls huh?
Positive,So hard you'll have to git good.
Positive,"What a game, it is made with love and detail. If you don't know much about the game let me give a bit of a rundown.   3rd person RPG  Varied PvE and PvP  astounding visuals  replayability up the wazoo  Harder than a submarine  Possible connectivity issues requires determination From Software worked on making the game difficult and rewarding. This may not be a game for everyone, but if it is a game for you it is amazing. Singleplayer is great and Multiplayer is seamless. There several different ways to build your character and the weapons are balanced so that every one of my friends has a different go-to weapon that they always use when the going gets rough. You don't see everyone using the ""Best weapon in the game"" at endgame because there simply isn't any ""best weapon in the game"" its all about what looks and feels good. If you want to push through different areas and beat monsters up and get a massive dopamine rush when you finally beat the a**hole that kept murdering you, then this is what you are looking for."
Positive,man do i love being destroyed everytime
Positive,Very nice game if you want to end your life
Positive,You can beat the game with every weapon including broken straight sword 10/10 replayability. Praise the sun
Positive,The pain and suffering i felt that kept me going made me question my integrity as the antichrist of emos.Recomended!!
Positive,Amazing gameplay.Amzing soundtracks.Great atmosphere.Great DLC's.I hate the pvp.8/10 would buy again
Positive,"Ashen one, hearest thou my voice, still?"
Positive,Solid Game! I started with Dark souls 1 and continued to 2. This was one of the most fulfilling series ending games to play. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a challenge. It will be hard but just keep pushing!
Positive,"I am a huge Dark Souls fan. Although this game was obviously designed for console, it was ported over quite nicely. This is NOT an easy game and it is quite likely that you will just stop playing it after reading ""YOU ARE DEAD"" hundreds upon hundreds of times, but if you finally achieve killing this one boss after hours of trying you will feel a true sensation. This is a true masterpiece. 10/10"
Positive,"Doesn't get old.. For some reason the content doesnt change but I have yet to experience the dreaded feeling of repetitiveness that you find in just about every mainstream title. Idk what Miyazaki did to achieve this, but its kind of scary... Especially when you realize that you've read the same item descriptions a million times and you probably know them word for word, but for some reason you re-read them anyways giving you the same sense of satisfaction every-single-time..... TY Miyazaki, for giving us this beautiful masterpeice: The souls Series.. ♥ Praise the ☼☼☼!!!! ♥"
Positive,I love you. Kiss me slowly and gently lord of cinder. I will be your hollow one forever
Positive,Best part! Roll spam does not save. Just git gud!
Positive,"Good game. It can be pretty frustrating at times, but also a lot fun if you have friends to play with you."
Positive,While I may be extremely late to the party all I can say is 10/10 would rage/get gud again
Positive,worth the 3 controllers i bought.
Positive,"The most fair and balanced game I've ever played, fun, perfect for playing with friends.Even though it is known as difficult, I do not see it that way. I actually see how easy it is up to, depending on which part. It has few bugs and rare cheaters, but little bother.Really really good, very well done, highly recommend.Thanks to the YouTube channel TATICADS for showing me this wonderful world.*I recommend getting by 3 than by remaster"
Positive,"I can blame Dark Souls 3 for starting off my addiction to the series.I tried to get in to the first 2, but was unable to.. Since playing through this game so many times I have gone back and beaten them both. Hands down one of the best series in gaming history."
Positive,"Dark souls isn't just like any other game.You play a somewhat weak character who is tasked with killing one of the strongest guys.But you are brave.You kill all of them.After dying, a lot.10/10 would die again"
Positive,Still my favorite game
Positive,"I saw, i rolled, i died. 10/10"
Positive,You died. Again. And again. and again.
Positive,The only way to understand this game is to play it. Just do it. Light the fire. I highly recommend the series. Please support it!
Positive,"anxiety simulator, 11/10 would die again."
Positive,Die...retry....die...retry...get gud....have fun..excellent game.
Positive,"Hand it over. That thing, your DARK SOULS™ III."
Positive,The first Dark Souls remains the better game but visually this does more than enough to compenate for me.
Positive,perfect game to get your toddlers into gaming
Positive,yeah its pretty good
Positive,Dying is fun!
Positive,Get ready to die....a lot.
Positive,This game is pretty easyjust took me 130hrs to finish
Positive,this is like the undead curse in game formsomeone please help me
Positive,"You want to punch your computer... You want to tear apart your limbs and hit your cpu with it every time that you die....I love it and hate it at the same time 10/10Another thing, how can people still die to mimics?"
Positive,"This is absolutely a great game, and arguably the most well-rounded souls game. However, this is the souls game I've put the least amount of playtime into, even less so than DS2.If I had to say the reason for this, I think it's the atmosphere, and the fact that the souls series hasn't really pushed boundaries or innovated in a way that evolves the genre or the games themselves much at all.Don't worry though, the combat is rock solid and feels the best it has in any souls game in my opinion.Simply put, DS3 is a refinement of all the mechanics present in previous souls games. The themes have stagnated a bit since it's conception as a franchise though, and this game doesn't really add anything significant to its repertoire.Again, it's a great game with great combat and awesome boss fights, but I came out feeling slightly unsatisfied with it.While I partially blame the pre-release hype (which I feel happens a lot these days) there were way too many callbacks and references for no other reason than to just appeal to fans (and dare I say to just add more content without having to design more from scratch). This level of self-awareness and the endlessly repeated themes just gets sort of tiresome and can take you out of an otherwise excellent experience.Also - weapon arts:While certainly cool, they often are the only thing that will differentiate a weapon from another within the same class. And even then, one weapon art will often be shared across multiple other weapons, sometimes that are in different classes. It's frustratingly counter intuitive because weapon arts should help each weapon feel unique, but what ends up happening is more or less the opposite.I obviously still recommend that you play this game, especially if you're a fan of the series. It really is great, I'm just showing some tough love as a fan myself. Just don't expect it to be the sendoff you were hoping the series would receive."
Positive,Fun and a great family friendly experience
Positive,Amazing atmosphere with very satisfying gameplay. People often cite the game as too difficult but as long as you're willing to learn it isn't too bad.
Positive,Dark Souls is like the Evangelion of anime
Positive,"This is the first Dark Souls game I played, and I absolutely love it. I play with a Steam controller and it works very well.Needless to say, the game is very challenging and you're expected to die a lot, so be ready to learn from your mistakes often. There is hardly any guidance in the game, as the tutorial simply tells you the game's controls and then it throws you into the thick of it. Expect a steep learning curve that will test you before you even finish the tutorial.There is co-op, but it exists atomically with random PvP encounters. So, you can get help from other players (random ones or specific ones that share your password), but not without making yourself vulnerable to invasion by enemy players. While sometimes annoying, it's hard to deny that this fits with the hardcore tone of the game.The one thing I will complain about is about is the camera. The FoV is pretty narrow and you can't change it, so you don't always get to take in all of your surroundings. This sucks because the game has gorgeous levels.Use the wiki to your advantage since hardly anything about the game's mechanics is explained in-game. Don't let frustration ruin the game for you, and you'll git gud in no time."
Positive,"Are you a fan of games crafted with mindblowing lore, over the top quality world and level design?This game is for you.Are you a fan of balanced gameplay that demands you to GIT GUD?This game is for you.Are you a fan of multiplayer PVP or COOP action?This game is for you.Do you like to punish others?This game is for you.Do you like to explore the world, know and feel the story of the world on your own rather than being spoonfed by cutscenes and stuff?This game is for you.Do you like to have fun?Go ahead and play the souls series.In a nutshell, this game/series is rich with quality lore, world design, a gameplay mechanic that rewards for yor courage, exploration, risks, and makes you better each time you play the level. And with an online multiplayer integrated semmlessly throught the game."
Positive,10/10Would want Anal examination again.
Positive,"Played it so many times, got all the achievements, and the replay values are endless. Buy this game.*Edit: do  not buy this game it sucks"
Positive,"Frankly, as a new comer to the souls series, I thought I'm looking at a stress test ""since i'm used to hack & slash type of games"" except i'm looking at a masterpiece that made me (Git Gud) over time. I honestly thought i won't spend 2 hours playing. And now i'm near over 65 hours and nearly starting my NG+ with ease. As much as any of the world-building and design, I enjoy the sense of being in a world made up of layers, revealing unexpected pathways & routes.highly recommended 10/10."
Positive,"""You Died"" never has a game given so much emphasis on trial and error. This game forces you to be very aware of your enemies and surroundings because you are never safe and never has a game allowed me to enjoy dying and retrying everytime. With 60 plus hours in already, and still not done with the base story I have found a new genre that i hope to love with every future Dark Souls game to come. I found this unknown jem in my gaming world because of a sale and boy am I sorry i did not buy this and previous installs earlier because i missed some great games. understanding the controls does take a minute especially with keyboard and mouse. But if you are a true pc gamer like me then this is very minor and can always be changed to fit my taste. no pc gamer should ever complain about controls unless you can not remap which you can in Dark Souls III. So be prepared to Die and love every minute of it."
Positive,This game has very friendly community wtih enjoyable stress free casual gameplay and amazing story. Recommended for children +6 of age.
Positive,SUPER good game would definetly suggest to anyone who wants a challenge!
Positive,All are good other then the DEX builds
Positive,Игра топ! Аааапапппппппппааа
Positive,"Very good, though not as good as ds1. There are many, many callbacks to ds1 and 2. I'm not one to mind that, but even if you are, I think you'd ignore it when playing such a good game."
Positive,EZ game 😎
Positive,"My opinions on this game regularly change. Sometimes it is amazingly fun and sometimes I feel like putting my head through my monitor and my foot through my PC. I've beaten the game several times and put hundreds of hours into PvP and will review PvE and PvP individually.First PvE. While one of, in my opinion, it is one of the weaker PvE's in the series, it is still solid and probably one of the most reliable in terms of combat. There are a few issues I have with it, however. First of all, many enemies are extremely 'spammy' and fast. This isn't bad 90% of the time, but occasionally, despite being the most fast paced Dark Souls game, your character cannot deal with the situation. Some enemies feel like they are rejected Bloodborne enemies, a game which I do personally prefer. This is rarely unfair, however, and adds another layer of difficulty which is needed now that the combat is more refined and reliable. Dark Souls 3 is also surprisingly linear in comparison to previous entries. The best example of where this is not the case is the original Dark Souls, my personal favourite. Here, instead of branching paths and shortcuts between areas, you effectively move from one area to the next in a set order. There are occasions where multiple paths are offered for you, but the chances are one is 'correct' and mandatory and the other is optional and is a dead end. Despite these flaws, however, I must say that DS3 has a near unmatched boss quality, if not for Bloodborne. Some of the series' best are in this title and its DLC (my personal favourites being Sister Friede and Gael). The areas themselves are also quite fun to explore and have shortcuts within themselves. It is a shame they don't link separate areas like the series was once known for though.PvP is what I have spent the majority of my hours on. The sheer amount of possible builds and play styles in PvP is amazing but also its biggest flaw. With this many options, it is near impossible for it all to be balanced, which is the case here. Certain weapons and builds are immensely overpowered and in some cases broken. I would be lying if I said that it is impossible to counter these builds, for I myself have learnt how to deal with some of them (like a certain pair of UGS) but it can be immensely frustrating to come up against a player who kills you in a single stun lock combo or instantly parries and one shots you.The thing with Dark Souls is these flaws and this jank is what makes it so special. Yes, you can be one shot parried and ganged up on by four people, or R1 spammed by a straight sword, or get stuck in weapon arts from Ringed Knight UGS or Friede's Scythe, but it is the only game where you get the immense satisfaction of landing a parry yourself or successfully killing all four of those gankers spamming R1 and chugging. I can't lie, I have walked away from this game for extended periods due to frustration, but this addictive satisfaction has pulled me back time and time again. This is why I recommend this game, because despite its many flaws, it offers a feeling of satisfaction unmatched by other games of this generation. While this is most certainly not the best in the series (I would recommend DS1 or BB more), it is still a game that is well worth your time."
Positive,it might be fun it might drive you insane but be careful if you play it too much it might consume your soul 10/10.
Positive,Played a little bit and got ****ed so hard .... but it was fun !
Positive,One of the best RPG I ever played.- Good lore- Nice combat system- Unique art style- Funny Invader and Phantom- Wide open world- Best rage quit I ever have :>
Positive,"Pro's:- lots of unique weapons and playstyles, any build is viable- good graphics, great atmosphere and a deep lore- endearing NPCs with their own questlines, completely optional- challenging and intimidating bosses, all unique to each other- depending on how well you do the playtime can range from 40-70 hours (without NG+)- Co-op with pals enhances the experience- high replay valueCon's:- Online mode occasionally glitches (e.g. invaders only the host can see, region-lock not doing its job and lags)- in terms of PvP the host is favored over the invader, especially when the host has 2 friendly phantoms + 1 blue sentinel/darkmoon on his side- Dancer of the Boreal Valley- overdone with references to the previous souls titles"
Positive,"10/10 Would die again and again, and again, and again"
Positive,tongue but hole
Positive,"This is my first review ever for a game well deserving of it. I like to keep it simple instead of writing a full story so I will just make a quick list with pros & cons:Pros---• Great gameplay. Fast gameplay where good timing is the key.• Good graphics. • ULTIMATE GOOD MUSIC.• Awesome locations. The world in this game is just so dark and scary yet so beautiful. • Incredible bosses and enemies.• Fun to replay a few times. I finished the game with 8 different characters now and got 1 character past newgame +5. • Great DLC. DLC 1 wasn't really that big sadly but the second was well worth every penny. • Aside from a few problems I will mentions at the con list, the multiplayer is fun.• A thrilling hidden story. Cons---• For me this isn't really a con but you must be patient. You'll probably die a lot in this game since it's pure trial and error. I've just seen many people hating games like this for it. • Many abilities like lots of magic and also certain weapons that are weak or even useless. When you PVP in this game most guys that turn out to win are quality builds (characters who use STR and DEX) and use fast melee weapons. Also magic is just slow they need to buff it somehow.• The summon system. Sure it's part of Dark souls and I get why, I also know this game is more meant to play solo then with friends and yet it's really annoying sometimes to play this with friends since it's kinda hard to stay together. I wish games like these had a more fun way to CO-OP. • They should put more attention on the LUCK stat. In the beginning you get to pick a class, I would recommend picking either pyromancer or knight since they have the lowest luck stat which is a GOOD thing, luck is really useless unless you run a few certain things. WHY DO I RECOMMEND THIS GAME?---Aside from a bit BS this game brings, it's awesome, dark souls as a series really opend my heart from time to time. The hidden story in Dark souls is just amazing and the world and music just makes it so nice. I love it. I would rate it a 8/10. :)(sorry for bad english)"
Positive,if u want to break ur gaming gear please buy this game
Positive,I regret to say that this game is so good that now I've finished it I'm having a really hard time finding something else to play.
Positive,"This is my first dark souls game. I gotta say, I love this game so much. So much so I intend to play this game a lot more, and even play previous souls games. As a new player, I'd have to atleast rate this 9/10."
Positive,"Dark souls 1 but with gorgeous graphicsDark souls 2 but not clunkyin conlusion, great game, Use controller for best experience"
Positive,No pointless aheadtherefore bloody expensive...!
Positive,Git good... git really good.
Positive,Good game...Unless you suck.
Positive,solid game 10/10
Positive,One of the best games ever made. I played it for hours and hours. The only thing i hate is that it doesn't use the Steam Cloud. My computer got corrupted and i lost everything. I want to play the last DLC but i miss my character :(
Positive,"This is what the game should look like, very challenging and enjoyable at some moments, i mean the moment when you kill the boss and lite the bonfire its the best feeling there is..."
Positive,"""This land is peaceful, its inhabitants kind.""Still gives me conniptions. - Hawkwood the Deserter"
Positive,Do you like fire? Do you like magic? Do you like holy magic? Do you like evil magic? Are you a masochist? Then this game is for you.
Positive,All round best of the three.
Positive,Really fun game
Positive,"This game is less punishing than i thought it was, but still GIT GUD required"
Positive,"""You died"" - Game"
Positive,"Dark Souls is like an abusive relationship really, you get beaten by it, it abuses you, you hate it, but you love it and come back anyways."
Positive,It's hard but when you beat hardest boss in game it's satisfying
Positive,10/10 Would git gud again.
Positive,"Dark souls 3 is basically dark souls 1 but better, which is all you need to know going into this game. amazing combat, amazing story, well worth 60$, i recommend both DLC'S as well. go in blind and you'll be amazed"
Positive,I lost my virginity to this game
Positive,"It's okay, I guess. The best part is when you realize you never have to play it again."
Positive,Amazing game to play single player but even better playing with a friend or two. Bosses are challenging and visuals are more beautiful than most games out there. I would give it a go.
Positive,"Apparently, the first boss is actually the menu screen. That music is just too good for me to be able to hit the start button."
Positive,"Possibly one of the best RPGs and the best souls game I've ever played.It has a great and interactive storyline. The landscapes are decayed, yet beautiful. The combat is fun and interesting. Most boss designs are difficult, but amazing.It's a difficult game, especially if you're new to the series, but it's 100% worth it."
Positive,"Hello I'm just going to inform anyone reading this review that it will probably be pretty long. but I will also include a short synopsys at the bottom of the review.I will be rateing dark souls 3 based on combat, enemies, and lore (there will also be a pros and cons list). I'll also include tips for new players who want to get the game because it can be kind of confusing. Oh and I will include a list of who would and wouldn't like dark souls 3.Combat:The combat in this game is amazing. It is very stratigic and is based around attacking at the right time and dodging at the right time. For the most part you have four things to worry about in combat: health, dodging, attacking, and blocking (if you have a shield). Combat is very quick and relies on fast reflexes as well as memorizing patterns that the enemies and bosses attack with. The combat flows pretty well but the hit boxes are extremely bad when it comes to pvp (player versus player). Pve (player versus entity) is pretty balanced as long as you keep dodging and attacking at the right time.\Enemies: Dark Souls 3 has many different enemies that fight in many different ways. For the most part enemies in this game (that are close to your level) kill you in 2-3 hits which also depends on your heath pool. But if you can dodge well you can save yourself from taking damage. Almost all enemies have different move sets and combinations that they use. You can fight an enemy once and defeat it but next time their combination of moves will change and you will die. Bosses have more move sets than any of the normal mobs and they are faster and hit harder. Most bosses kill you in 1-3 hits depending on your health pool. Bosses will also take multiple tries to defeat because you need to memorize their move sets to know how and when to dodge. Lore:If your not interested in lore you can just skip this section but if you want to know keep reading. The lore in dark souls 3 is well hidden within the environment as well as the items you find in the game. Most of the lore is this game brings in things from the past two games as well as some new developments. If you want a game that is all fighting and pretty much no story you would probably like this game. While dark souls 3 has a lot of lore and a good story you can just ignore it totaly if you want. But at the same time if you like story and lore in a game you would also like this. Be warned though some of the lore is kind of disgusting (what happened to a lot of the characters I mean). For instance you can look up Aldritch the devourer of Gods lore and see just how disgusting it is. But for the most part the story is very very good.Pros:Great combatGreat storycool armorweapons with cool weapon artspvp and pvegiant bosses!!!multiple classesvery difficultCons:bad pvp hitboxesarmor doesn't help much at all besides looking coolStory is not present it must be found while playingBosses that you will have to fight over and over (10-20 times +)can get invaded by other players while embered (this is just apart of the game and you have to accept it)magic is useful for pve not so much for pvpvery difficultPeople who would like dark souls 3:People who like rich lorepeople who like challenging combatpeople who like a lot of character customization (I mean classes, armor, and weapons)people who are persistantpeople who are willing to play for 50 + hourspeople who like medival fantasyPeople who wouldn't like dark souls 3:people who get angry easilypeople who don't want challengepeople who don't want to play a game for 50 + hourspeople who don't like fighting a boss over and over againpeople who don't like getting constantly invaded (by both real people and npcs)Alright not onto the tips list for dark souls 3Tips for new players:1. You should choose the knight class  on your first play through it has some of the best starting gear and weapons as well as the highest health pool2. if your close to dying always pull back from enemies and use and estus flask (health potion esentially)3. Always use a shield if one is avalible at the begining and even the end of the game (unless your going for an ultra great sword build)4. always be cautious and make sure to watch your back and check surroundings you can be ambushed!!!5. ration how much estus you use on the bosses first and second phase.6. don't jump if there is a better way down you can die from fall damage!!!7. when in doubt always dodge from enemies don't just keep attacking8. enemies can ground around you can kill you, don't get swarmed9. some areas and enemies can be run through you don't have to fight them all!!10. there are short cuts in levels that can take you back to the bon fire (make sure yo look for closed doors or elevators)11. If a wall seems like its in an odd place hit it it might be and illusionary wall12. Although armor doesn't matter much you shouls still always wear a set it gives you extra protectionSynopsys:For those of you who don't want to read the whole thing (I don't blame you) here is my summary. Dark Souls 3 is a great medieval fantasy game with great combat and lore. It is a very difficult game so don't buy if your not looking for a challenge. Try to start with the knight or warrior class to make it easier on yourself. Always watch your back to see if your going to be ambushed. The game is very fun to play but it is difficult and it will take a while to beat on your first playthrough. Also you should wait to buy this game, don't buy at full price wait until there is a sale. I hope you found this helpful and hope that you will buy the game because it is really fun.Thanks for reading (if you did),Dark Storm"
Positive,"I am new to the Souls series, and I decided to start with Dark Souls 3. This game has no business being as great as it is, I feel that this title has a balanced amount of difficulty; the atmosphere is never boring; and the satisfaction that is felt progressing through the areas is powerful. I know that there are many Dark Souls veterans out there, but if you are a newcomer to the series I would recommend this as a perfect way to start your experience, and better yet, play with friends."
Positive,"9.5/10 Really good souls game. I really like the story and levels in ds3. Thers plenty of weapons to choose and cool looking armors. Both DLCs are very fun to play. PvP and invading is really fun to do.I think dark souls 3 is one off the easiest souls game to start and its good for first time players. I recommend to play your first playthrough solo and online ( dark spirits can summon to your world if you play online) Dark souls 3 is really fun to play and i recommend you to give it a try. if its too hard for you then git gud.But thers also some problems... i really like to invade and i do PvP a lot. But FROMSOFTWARE why is it so hard to do working servers??? like why the f i have to play 95% against SA, NA and Japan,China and korea.. also Australia? im from North Europe.. 5% is from EU... yeah its so fun to play when host rollerblading and warping all over place and hit you from 30 meters away. its fun when enemy ping is 999.... (salt level 9000) Really like to duel, but same problem (not so bad) 50% players lagging and hit delay like 1-3 sec most of the time. And still i enjoy the game, after all this. and yes i have a good internet...But wait!! Thers more!! Thers also hackers -.- a lot of hackers -.- like 5-10 hackers per day. and i mean those who do 10000 damage per hit, flying around, try to crash your game ( drop your fps to 0.1 whit some healing spell) those who have 1000000hp. yeah its a fun game, but thers those tiny di*k hackers trying to ruin your game. But all in all Dark Souls 3 is one of my favorite games of all time. Its sad that it is last Dark Souls game :/ we had a good journey. Now waiting BB2. And now buy the f game and go git gud you f casual!!!"
Positive,"Time for joyIn other words, liar ahead"
Positive,I died in character customization twice and I ragequit.
Positive,Invades some one..... gets sent back to my world because the host dc. NICE!
Positive,PVP in this game makes you wish people you don't know would die irl.
Positive,"Haven't really played it much, it's okay i guess."
Positive,"107 Hours on Record and still no Review.I guess that says it all, i'm too busy getting good and shouting ""Hey"" to write a review.Jokes aside, this Dark Souls III is a great game which puts your patience to a test like all the Dark Souls games. It's alot of stressful fun and has a unlimited playability.10/10 would die again."
Positive,"""This game is too hard"" lots of people are saying it, giving it the worst possible degree, but this game was made to be hard! It's not for casual players, but for ones looking for really hardcore challenge. I also played the first edition of this game - prepare to die - and it taught me that 3rd part will not be any easier, damn, it's even harder than first one, and that's why I love it!This game is not about mindlessly rushing fordward, happly slaughtering anything you'll see, by doing so you are only going to meet your death even more often than before. In Dark Souls series, every enemy needs to be taken on rather strategically, especially minibosses like Crystal Lizard or elite enemies like Black Knight - this enemy will give you a lot of pain if you underestimate him, as his 3 blows are usually enought to remove your guts. During this duel, you have to learn his moveset in order to beat him.PROS-Ultra challenging-Fighting system-Huge world-Amazing hidden story-Lots of connections to the first DS-Many possible builds-Teaches you to never give up-One of best TPRPG games I played so far-Crazy, unique bosses, usually with intresting story behind-Motherf- mimics-Dead enemy ragdolsCONS-Hitboxes. Goddamn broken hitboxes-Makes casuales cry-Cancerous builds in PvP, like two Greatswords, Estoc or Gargoyle Fire Spear, which requies no skill to kill you and it'a unbalanced with damage, attack speed and stuns-Overleveled players can attack new characters-Ganking"
Positive,Installed the game. It Died.Started a new game. Creator Died.Walked through a graveyard to a big arena. Mobs Died.Found a guy and thaught he was friendly. Feelings Died.Proceeded to Kill that guy. He Died.I put down my controller and walked over to the mirror. I Died Inside.I then proceeded to walk over and pick up the controller once more and continue on... Fell off a cliff and DiedIf you are Reading this during a fight. You may have Died.Best game i ever got.10/10 Died Souls III 2017
Positive,"The game sucks, you have to pay $50 to beat every boss. (Replacement controllers)"
Positive,GIT GUD SON OF BETCH
Positive,"Never wanted to kill myself more then when I played this game, 10/10."
Positive,No Crossbreed Priscilla fanservice?0/10
Positive,Its Worth Wasting your Life On
Positive,Very interesting game. I immediately found myself looking up lore and getting very emotionally charged about my character. Very hard and my first of the series.
Positive,"A fantastic action RPG. Although there are a lot of references to past games, none of it's super needed to enjoy this one. I'd also recommend Ringed City, but don't get Ashes of Ariendel. If you can get it for $40 that's a steal."
Positive,"As with all Souls games, this being one of the best, if not the best of them, a transformation happens as you play. You face an excruciatingly difficult boss fight and are pounded out of your wits. As you respawn on the last bonfire, surprised, confused and frustrated, your mind begins to work. You fight again. You die. You fight. You die. As each cycle happens, layers of truth as veils are drawn away until you finally see the beast for what it truly is. It is a puzzle. It may carry a flanged mace. It may have dozens of creatures alongside it. It may look so grotesque that it stays with you in your dreams. But underneath all the elaborate adornments, it is a puzzle. With each attempt, you discover its pieces, its patterns, until you unlock it fully and bring it to its knees. And the one significant thing that changed for the better was not your armor, your weapon, nor your stats. It was you."
Positive,"I've always been a fan of the souls games, and I was so happy to play this one. It feels so much more like a souls game than Dark Souls 2 did, and the password feature for online play is awesome. A Souls game you can actually play with your friends is just mind blowing."
Positive,"Tried of easy, casual games?Are you up for a challenge of not ragequitting or smashing your keyboard?Go ahead and grab yourself a copy of Dark Souls III.But this is just the beginning of your journey.If you think you can handle a more difficult task.Try the original Dark Souls and its sequel."
Positive,Is good yes
Positive,"This game is more than just dying over and over. This game teaches you something about yourself. Persistence is key.  You can fail hundreds of times, countless hours gone. But with each attempt you get a little closer to success. A little bit closer to understanding why you may be looking at a situation the wrong way, why you can't just go all in at once and expect to win. It also shows you that there are so many others stuck in the same way you are, each feeling lost - each on the border of going hollow.  I could write for days to explain everything I've learned from this game. Know this, you won't regret buying or playing, but you may just find your own flame along the way."
Positive,Got Gud 11/10
Positive,This games is good
Positive,"Great game, nice send off to a great series"
Positive,"I just bought the new DLC. 47 and a half hours later, I finally succeeded in beating the 2nd boss."
Positive,"Brutal, yet visually stunning."
Positive,"Ah what can I say about this jewel, not just this game but the whole series.Amazing.This game and the rest fall into two sights for me,Love and hate.I always come crawling back even after I rage quit.I always come back.10 out of 10.Lore and game play are both phenomenal.I've invest quite amount of time and still have more to indulge myself."

Positive,One of the best games i've ever played! Love it!
Positive,The game is just great... to start in the souls series is just amazing 100% recommended
Positive,"Not for the faint of heart: this game is ridiculously difficult. At times it can be mind-numbingly frustrating. Like, throw my mouse through the window frustrating.Note: You're better off playing with a controller. You can do very well with a mouse and keyboard, but until you master those controls, get ready to die at the first mob over and over again. and again. Until you think you can't take it anymore. Even with a controller it's still hashtag crazy tough, you'll just get use to dying a lot quicker playing with a mouse and keyboardThat being said, Dark Souls III is very entertaining, the graphics are phenominal and it has a ton of replay value. And if you're into PvP it has that too (in the form of invasions).Did I mention it's pretty difficult? When you finally get past the very first mob, you get to enjoy your victory for 8 seconds until you come across 2 mobs who continue to kick the snot out of you for what seems like an eternity.Give this game a shot if you like a challenge, you won't be disappointed.p.s. I wasn't kidding about the replay value btw."
Positive,Good gamelots to do looks prettymusic is good
Positive,I hate it.It's great.
Positive,"Highly recommend this game, it is the best game in History of mankind,100000000years later, it will became legacy Humanity."
Positive,"Best gameplay/graphic/story/etc.We, Unkindled one, shall become the worthy one~`"
Positive,"A tad too short for a dark souls game, yet amazing to play through"
Positive,Contraceptive pills are advised before playing. 10/10
Positive,I don't like that boss in the church
Positive,You will Die Part III
Positive,Bought it once. Died 30 times to the 1st boss (Iudex Gundyr). Sold it back Bought it again. One of my favourite games of all time
Positive,"Just finished the game for the fourth time, finally got all the achivments, was not very easy but loved the challenge none the less. One of my favorite games besides the first, can't wait for the second DLC!"
Positive,"What can I say, it's from From Software. Nuff said. 11/10. Wish Bloodborne was on PC too."
Positive,"it's all about the fire warrior and his quest to save the dark soul.this cooked to perfection meal is fit to eat and sweet, but one complaint; the game is too hard.please turn it down in the difficulty miyamoto, my diaper is full and i'm crying."
Positive,"So, I don't think I have quite enough hours to give an accurate review, but I've spent over 3 million hours fighting the Dancer of the Boreal valley across multiple consoles/platforms, and I have to say:dat girl is THICC."
Positive,"As a newcomer co the Dark souls series I jumped in to this latest instalment wondering ""What is all the hype about""Now I knowThis is probably the best game I've played in the last five years of gaming and marks a return to a more visceral and raw gaming experience where the player has to learn from his/her mistakes to progress. Bonfires acting as check points and areas resetting between visits as well as new game+ and an almost never ending array of secrets and puzzles make the game endlessly replayable. NPC quests without markers or a log to track progress forces the player to pay attention to what they are doing and make choices which have unforeseen consequences later in the game. Combat is smooth and well balanced and the boss battles all offer unique challenges with even the earliest boss in the game being a difficult one to overcome giving the player a good indication of what is to come. Controls on the keyboard however an nigh on impossible to use so a controller really is a must have for this game to get the full experience. Cinematically the game is beautiful and the contrast between the high towers of Anor londo to the deep irithyll dungeon are something to behold.9.5/10"
Positive,"Link to our curator page, Finn ReviewAdultsBeautiful Wait for saleGood PCDark SoulsVery Long  ( 12 - 50 hours)Looping story NG+FantasticSuperiorFew Bugs, some of which you can use for speedrun.Nothing that bothered me during gameplay.Multiplayer: YESSingleplayer: YESFree DLC: NOMost stablest and user friendliest game of the trilogy.I recommend starting from the first Dark Souls though.Level design was nice in a way, but it felt like there was too many bonfires.Lore is epic.Boss fights are epic.I recommend using a controller, eventhough you can play with keyboard."
Positive,"as a new player entering the dark souls franchise, this game is f**king hard, can't even get passed the first boss. I quit. Joke. Highly recommended"
Positive,jet jet skrrrr
Positive,"This game is A M A Z I N G, this was my first and best dark souls experience. This game did not fail for the price this is possibly my favorite gam 10/10"
Positive,"this is the best game i played yet , and the witcher 3assassin creed black flag , Sekiro too"
Positive,its the best game ever!!
Positive,I have been an avid Soulsborne fan for many years now. after playing every game from demon souls to Sekiro to the surge and hollow knight I can confirm that this one in particular game still lives up to the standard it set. This is possibly my most favourite of the genre its series created. Most definitely recommend a play. Does thou even praise?!
Positive,"A good ending to the series, the architecture of the game is beautiful, Weapon Arts are just the thing, Quality of weapons and armors is gorgeous, and the new bosses and locations too.If you miss:- Poise- Powerstancing- Good PvP / Co-Op mechanicsDon´t buy.Also, this game references and relies a lot on Dark Souls 1. This is the major downfall. Like instead of doing subtle refences or adding new content, Dark Souls 3 also recycled lots of content from the old series. Game only worth of buying with discount or outside Steam, else, just don´t."
Positive,"Over 200 hours in and I still can't get enough of this game. The learning curve is steep and frustrating, but every victory reveals a little more of this beautifully crafted world. The wealth of weapons and builds makes it so that every playthrough feels new and unique. Every enemy poses a real threat to the player which forces you to respect even the most basic enemies, and makes it all the more satisfying when you finally find that next bonfire. If you love a challenge, I can't recommend this game enough."
Positive,I absolutely love this game! Dark Souls II left a meh feeling to me but this game brought back the great storyline that the original Dark Souls had and mixed in the PvP from Dark Souls II (improve on of course!) the surprises you get in this game was truly what made it so great!
Positive,"I really recommend this game if you are into a challenge. I stopped playing this because i got ""frustrated"" but if you continue to carry on and get better you have a blast :)"
Positive,"Best game i've ever played. Best soundtrack, boss fights, mood, and everything just makes you feel like your playing D&D in real life!"
Positive,"What is poise, baby dont combo me, dont combo me, no stamina"
Positive,"Single player is great 10/10PVP is like: You go with longsword, invader appears with dagger and small shield, parries you, switch to giant weapon and on shots you. Then you change to ultra great sword, invader appears with katana and destroys you. You switch to katana, invader appears with halberd and destroys you. You switch to halberd, invader appears with great hammer and destroys you. You switch to great hammer, invader appears with curved sword and destroys you. You go with pyromancy, invader appears with longsword and destroys you. You go with sorcery, invader appears with curved great sword and destroys you. You go with a faith build, cast restoring miracles, wield a mace, play very carefuly, then an invader appears with any build and destroys you.When you are invaded, the most likely outcome is ""YOU DIED"" on your screen 10/10"
Positive,Played it so much i finished it in 2 days....
Positive,Most epic game I ever played. Other RPGs feel like crap now.
Positive,Talvez a melhor franquia de jogos já criada em todos os tempos. Vale a pena pelo desafio!S2
Positive,Very good game. Would reccomend to anyone.
Positive,"good game, greater pvp"
Positive,"Sometimes i die in this game, but what i really want is to die irl"
Positive,Got invaded by Hitler 10/10
Positive,I died. 10/10
Positive,this game's lit
Positive,Launched an invader off a cliff with the Lothric K***ht Greatsword. 10/10 would participate again in Lothric Space program.
Positive,"Very fantastic, it's beyond my words."
Positive,"On of the greatest Dark Souls I've played so far.Love the ambiance, the scenario, nothing really change from the other ones except the graphics and the music which are always better and better.PVP is also pretty good since the update (Ariandel)Highly recommended."
Positive,BEST GAME EVER.Update: STILL BEST GAME EVER
Positive,me play me die me like
Positive,"great, one of the best games since 80's."
Positive,"This game is like anal,hard and painful, but you'll get used to it."
Positive,great game iff u dont mind to die . nice co op boss fights . nice pvp/invade/help...u can be busy for hundreds of hours.fun
Positive,"The first time running through the game was amazing. The second time, I played a pyromancy and sorcery run with my friend. It was even better. The third time, we cosplayed as Ornstein and Smough. 'Nuff said."
Positive,Polished and perfected Dark Souls Game with the most amazing soundtrack and visuals
Positive,Not as hard as people make it seem.Fun game lots of falling tho.9/10
Positive,Lot of gametime and time dieing was good
Positive,This game will kindle a burning ambition inside of you just by killing you over and over and over and over and over and over again just to take down all bosses in the game...and just in this moment when you thought you've beaten that hardest boss of all time overcome this legendary all-demanding challenge and jump in the joy of victory...boom surprise 3rd phase incoming just to ruin your day...thanks Sister Friede...10/10 would die all over again
Positive,10/10 Would die again.
Positive,There's teleporting dogs. 10/10
Positive,pretty good i guess
Positive,10/10 would die again
Positive,Satisfaction when you loot what monsters wear ♥
Positive,This is much better than ds2.
Positive,"Stunning graphics, immersive gameplay and responsive controls with challenging enemies to boot. No issues worth commenting on. I would love to see a Small White Soapstone added in a future update!"
Positive,This game is only good with a big head and having a big head gets you banned for having a big head but jordan needs to get it so i can play it with him
Positive,Pro Tips:1) You can't GUD without dying2) Try Git Gud before start a boss fight3) If above two steps coudn't work means you suck in this game.GLHF!
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is an amazing installment to the Souls series, and it is a proud finale as well. Dark Souls 3 is my absolute favorite with the first close behind. I believe anyone and everyone looking for a good game to play the Souls games are my top recommendation to anyone. It has an impossible to dislike world and the gameplay is beautifully accurate to a fantastical medieval setting. But most of all I think the story is the best part, it is mysterious and to get much of it and understand you have to really pay attention and actually seek information. This game and its predecessors are masterpieces."
Positive,nice variety of armors / weapons world design lacking interesting original spirit
Positive,"Love this game, however it is hard as fuck. Will keep playing till I die for ten thousand times."
Positive,"StrenghtsAmazing story telling (through items and lore)Breath-taking landscapesAmazing and truly immersive boss fightsBring a lot of nostalgia to Dark Souls I playersBalanced difficultyA lot of items and loot variationThis game gives you a lot of pride This game is way more rewarding than you can imagineHidden quest are really greatSecret bosses are epicVery similar to Dark Souls IWeakness:Here is some PVP issues ;When you fight a player who is lagging af and you cant see him movingPeople are always using the same weapons and armorGetting invade by the same guy 5 times, when you just want to complete the storySome players call on you for help against invaders and do not care about helping you in fightsMage are so weak in this Dark Souls, everyone can simply parade your spells and 1 hit youOther weakness:Need something to avoid dying from a fall, because sometimes, you're far from a ledge and suddenly your character slips and falls, ""you-have died"".In archdragonpeak, the Serpent-man who can throw an axe with his chain is broken af, because he can throw his axes through walls with aimlock. I mean wtf, how can you see his axe coming when you are in a corridor...When you finish the game and start a new playthrough, the game feels way easier instead of being harderThe game is a unique dark fantasy . I give a general quote of 9,0/10This game is a unique dark fantasy that immerses you in a beautiful and hostile universe that wants to tear your skin and that requires a lot of concentration. If you've played Dark Souls I and II, you will not be disappointed with the third. I recommend the game for experienced players and fans rpg games From Software. Of course, I also recommends the game for players who are new and are willing to take on challenges that exceeds expectations.1 advice, if you die a lot against a boss, it's not because the boss is broken or because you're bad, when you fight a boss, learn his pattern and his combos. Use your brain and find the best timing to hurt the boss and make sure you can avoid every attacks after."
Positive,Gid Gut Simulator 2016Would 11/10 Again
Positive,A relaxing and charming game that makes you happy and calm all the time. And it still does.
Positive,made me shat myself...... 10/10 would shit again.
Positive,I feel like I have played more than 111hrs in this game. Truly it gets better and better overtime.
Positive,"Brilliant game, I would highly recommend this to any fans of the game. I'd also recommend it to anyone who likes challenging games, it will definitely get you annoyed on your first playthrough, there's also New Game + for those who want the extra challenge. If you're not a fan of hard games that will frustrate you beyond belief, don't even think about any Dark Souls game."
Positive,the best game ever
Positive,"400+ hours, still terrible at pvp......... 10/10"
Positive,The hardest enemy in this game is gravity.and sometimes the enemy is yourself.
Positive,Recommend if you would for that is your duty
Positive,"Best souls game on pc , better port than DS1 and overall better than DS2 so if I liked those games DS3 is an easy buy Newcomers just take your time you will die A LOT but thats just dark souls you will make a mistake and you will die , remember you are not some badass approach a situation like you would approach it IRL try to fight one on one , Good Luck"
Positive,"10/10 this game is a blissful masterpiece!! EL DANTE BOLISIMO, DOLMIO FAMILY SAUCE!!!my friend calcutt is grinding on my kawaii cock just cause i havn't done all the achievements!! wat 2 heck!!!! he can go eat some brocolli or some shit.i rate calcutt a solid piece of shi/10"
Positive,"This game is da best. The PvE gets easier later except for some hard bosses, but the PvP is decent. NOT AMAZING. I like how sorcery and miracles are viable in PVP though. I have a lot of fun in the fight clubs but they need a level in the DLC for actual invasion, because Grand Archives is probably the best real invasion spot. Good game though, balance issues are there in PvP but it's not terrible like DS1. Worth a buy for sure, great weapon and armor variety, good improvement over DS1. Can't speak for 2"
Positive,"So I was playing some PvP at Pontiff untill I summoned someone who wanted to ruin the fun. He went into the level and I couldn't bother to give chase. Therfore I decided to use Dried Finger and summon another red phantom and ignore the party pooper. When I was about to win my duel the party pooper decided to say hello and give the final blow agaisnt my opponen, something I was not fond of. So I decided to give chase to this dude. He led me past the two giants and towards a ledge to sudden death. It seemed like he wanted his duel to take place there. I dumbfoundly decided to comply with this man's terms and a second into our duel he pulled of a Wrath of The Gods and knocked me over the ledge where I fell to my imminent death. I was not even mad. In fact I was amazed over the ammount of effort this one guy put into ruining my fun. Anyway that pretty much sums up my experience with Dark Souls 3. Can't say I was too suprised."
Positive,"Good sequel. It fixed a lot of the stuff that was wrong in Dark Souls II. Not to mention that the horrid soul memory system is gone. I still think that the first one was the best, but this one was good aswell. This game has probably the highest difficulty curve in the whole Soulsborne series, since the game starts of in a medium difficulty, and as you progress the game will get more and more challenging. Now I'd like to talk a bit about the bad things in this game. Well, I know, its still a fresh game and this can be fixed, but for now these are the facts that I dislike:-The poise. This stat was super OP in DS1 and it was ok in DS2. But for some reason they decided to destroy it in this game. It just makes no sense, if you apply logic, that you get staggered for ages when being hit by an enemy thats weilding a broken dagger. There's this ""hyper armor"" that you get while doing your weapon arts and so, but still, is nonsense.-The current meta: Well, meta hasn't really changed since the game started. Heavy weapons and greatswords are underpowered, and unless you dont know how to use them good, you'll have trouble if you go with strength builds and so. So yeah, you can pretty much figure what is the meta like. Any weapon  thats not heavy (straight swords, rapiers, estocs, etc) is pretty much superior. The most popular weapons right now are the Estoc and the Dark sword, just because of their ridicoulous scaling and the capability of R1 spamming while still doing great damage.I hope they fix it in the future, but knowing From Swoftware, they probably won't.Anyway, to sum up: It's a great game, very challenging and good for players looking for something hard, tho it has some aspects that they need to fix."
Positive,Sick mush 10/10
Positive,Don't give up skeleton!
Positive,What seeketh th(r)ee?
Positive,"Try finger, but holeDamn i love dark souls, this game was awesome from the beginning to the end. I just love everything about it."
Positive,"Believe it or not, this is the second Souls game that I've played (Bloodbourne was my first but we can debate about that some other time). I tried DS2 but the port for the controller was horrible. I thought this was going to have a horrible port too but I was wrong; I was able to play as if I was playing in a console except with better FPS (as long as you have the specs). This game has gained a lot of patches and balancing updates since release, so I can safely say that you won't find much bugs and OP weapons anymore. FromSoftware keeps this game updated, and remember that the first DLC is going to come up some time this Fall. I've finished the game three time using three different builds. In other words, this game has a LOT of replayability factor because of one main reason: the variety of builds you can use. Once you get bored of PVE, there's always PVP. You will meet a lot of folks wether they be nice or not, it's all fun.The soundtracks are amazing. All boss fights will be etched to your mind by their signature soundtracks. Just starting from the main menu alone, you know you'll have eargasms all throughout a playthrough.For the story, I missed out on a lot of hype regarding the lore when I finished this game. It seems you really need to finish DS1 if you want to have a greater feeling of attachment towards the story, but other than that you'll be able to play the game and still understasnd it just fine.9/10 overall because the gameplay, story, and sountracks are superb, but the DLCs haven't arrived yet. I'm sure this will be a 10/10 once they do.Update:Well the first DLC has come (Ashes of Ariandel) so I figured I should update this. The DLC was absolutely breathtaking, albeit short. I'm not gonna spoil you or anything, but I should probably mention that you need the Lord of Londor ending if you want to get more interesting dialogues in the DLC. It's not that important but at least it shines a little bit of light about the characters. Here's my updated numeric rating on the game:Gameplay mechanics: 8/10 because poise isn't exactly back but everything else feels so smoothOSTs: 10/10Story: 10/10 if you really delve into the lore and read upContent: 9/10 because the dlc was too short but it gave really cool new spells and weaponsOverall: 9.3/10"
Positive,"A naked man with a katana knocked me off a cliff, fell off after me, and when I respawned I got his katana. 10/10 Would naked katana man again"
Positive,its not dark souls 210/10
Positive,Dark souls 1 was a cheese pizza. This game is like having another cheese pizza its the exact same as the first pizza but this time its in HD
Positive,"The game has had a lot of patches over the time it has been released and I now I havent crashed at all, some weapons are overpowered in PvP which could use a nerf (I'm looking at you Dark Sword you sonofabitch). Overall the game has come a long way since its pretty shit launch. I can happily recommend this game now."

Positive,10/10 would buy for myself again
Positive,"I thought it would be nice to write a review in support of one of my favorite game series, Dark Souls; having played all extensively apart from Demon Souls and its predecessor, Kings Field.So far, this game appears to be fitting of the shining professional reviews it has received. The gameplay is excellent, in that is designed to be very dynamic and faster paced than previous games to be a step closer the Bloodborne style combat (but not too many steps away from Dark Souls). The inclusion of special attacks and a bar which limits magic attacks has helped make play more varied and helps limit what is often considered 'cheesing' your way through the game.The method of storytelling is as always, awesomely opaque, with hints slipped into the fabric of the world for you to discover. The world itself appears to be a return to what people liked so much about DS1, whilst appeared to be the primary weakness of the second game (independent of the DLC, which seemed to be made more congruently). The game I would say is visually stunning in its environments, but also in its boss fights (par a few bad early ones). With a GTX 970 and a middle of the range processor the game runs reasonably smooth - and have only experienced one game crash so far from 100 hours of gameplay (and in its early days).Though I'm really pleased with the game, I am a bit disappointed with a few things. The replayability of the game appears to now be based on unlocking side quests, which makes your actions very consequential and likely will have to be planned with the specific purpose of completing these quests - which I do find quite annoying - as it seems like too much of a push to NG plus (though suppose it worked on me, having done a fair few playthroughs just for this reason - but still, I feel a bit cheated). The story is, however, excellent as always and remains consistent between games. There is a sort of meeting of features of all the different games into this one (almost like a love letter to all their previous creations); and appears to be a great send off to the series in this way.Unfortunately there is the subtraction of some things which worked excellently in DS2: such as dual wielding which seemed to provide more depth to combat; and the fight arena (though the latter perhaps done with fair reason so to make the game world feel more congruous and less disjointed which was the fatal flaw of the second game). They also didn't implement differences between new game and subsequent playthroughs (in the way of 'red phantoms' and increased numbers of enemies, as well as increased enemy strength) which was implemented very well again in DS2 (but not as far as I know DS1) and added variation and difficulty to further playthroughs with increasing challenge. In Dark Souls 3 unfortunately I am able to, with my learning and character progression, decimate most enemies on subsequent playthroughs which to me is a great shame.However, my main issue with the game and its implementation is, I think, the lack of a steam save - which though can be countermeasured using manual backups with a little bit of knowhow and Google Searching, is a bit of a pain and seems a bit poor considering cloud saves are implemented often as a general rule (even in games which require considerably less time investment).But to this point, having done a couple of runs through the game - I couldn't of asked much more from it (I usually moan at full price games, but it has been very much worth every penny), and I am greatly looking forward to its DLC (which, if anything like previous games, will be absolutely amazing). Keep it up, From Software"
Positive,First chest is a mimicThank you Dark Souls
Positive,\o/ BEST GAME EVER! \o/
Positive,Best of the best!
Positive,10/10 Would die again
Positive,"Buy!Destroy several mouses!After killing a boss be the happiest person in the entire world!After you died you cry but thats ok...You dream when you sleep of this game, you talk with friends about this game, the game is your life!Praise the sun!"
Positive,"I warmly recommend this game, it's a game with captivating action.Has now played 100 hours and still think it's worth time spending it, and when you finish the game once' one time, you can restart your journey for +2, it means you are restarting without any bone fires but with all the gear and items you had befor you restarted.Then that you can through a password make it easier to summon your friends, however there should be a better co-op system where you could just be able to join your friend and play the game in co-op."
Positive,"Saw a sign saying roll here. I pressed space to roll and my character back stepped off the ladder and fell to his death. gg 10/10. Also the coolest looking stuff on this game makes my resistance a pile of shit so i die from everything in two hits.Lastly, i saw two unkindled sitting there doing shit so i attacked them. One of them says ""you've gone hollowed have you"" and then i got spawn camped by them for the next 10 minutes until i figured out how to parry and killed one which led the other into depression and made them fall on the floor and cry. I decided it's best to end her sadness and killed her too which gave me a good sword. GG 69/21 would recommend to everyone that wants to get into an RPG game. This being my first RPG game"
Positive,"I have played all DS series and I feel DS 3 still managed to overjoy me. Great boss battles, challenging enemies, great scenarios, etc. The game itself hasnt changed much compared to its previous versions, but it stills feel pretty unique and the game mechanics have improved/evolved.Compared to older Dark Souls games:- Faster combat (movement feels a bit faster).- Casting and proyectile animations are MUCH faster.- Durability isnt an issue anymore.- Improved covenant system.- All weapons have skills/stances.If you liked previous DS titles this is a must buy.If you are willing to get immersed into the Dark Souls world for the first time, this is still a solid choice and be prepared to die a lot :)"
Positive,This game is awesome and fun for my first Darksouls game. The only thing that I have a problem with is fucking invaders what the fuck shit this is so bad I would rather play CoD Infinite warfare for the rest of my life with how many times my friend and I get invaded when we try to play... other than that the game is great :)Gameplay = 9/10Story/Objectives = 8/10Invaders = Bullshit/10Kinda tired of invader bullshit with no way of avoiding it other than no embers (Can't play with friends) or staying offline... wtf
Positive,"It has its flaws, but overall it's a great game, and it's as close as you're going to get to playing Demon's Souls on pc."
Positive,"Amaizing graphics ,amaizing story, amaizing gameplay.This is one of the best games I ever played and I like the ideea of Dark Fantesy :D"
Positive,"Prepare to die many, many times"
Positive,"As said by TheUrbanOrb, ""Dark Souls is like being in a relationship with the most beautiful woman, she's perfect. The catch is, she punches you in the face every 5 minutes."""
Positive,Fuck Pontiff Knights.
Positive,Praise The Sun!
Positive,"You will cry, You will scream, You will swear, You will rage quit, but when you finally be able to kill that boss after so many death it's one of the best feeling ever. This game challenge you and trains you to get better by beating the living hell out of you, but you will always come out stronger when defeating that boss. That's what make dark souls 3 great it trains you to become stronger and you will be able to beat it if you have an iron will to never give up!."
Positive,"This is my favorite game at the moment, i realy like the full game even do it can be hard at times. But the thing is, with this game you get the possibility of chalenging yourself bether than on any other game if you ask me. And if somthing ever was so hard that you can't do it yourself there is almost always a phantom somewhere to help you. So i mean this game is good and you should realy give it a try!"
Positive,"my old review I left below for reference, but the many patches have fixed a lot of the game's issues and I am now quite happy with it, although I still think Dark Souls 2 was better for PVP.Dark Souls has always been about being hard but fair, Dark Souls 3 mostly stays within those bounds.  Stunlock is a big part of the game now as poise does not function the same way it used to, they should have named it something else.  As a result you can be stun-locked to death unable to move or retaliate at all by groups of enemies, so timing and group management is more important than ever.  The new weapon skills  and twin weapons are really cool, but power stancing is gone.  Magic has been patched to be much more viable in PVP, but is still less powerful than Dark Souls 2 (although that is probably not a bad thing).  Ganking is still a problem in PVP as the password ability had made friends grouping up quite easy and not everyone is honorable or skilled enough to want to go it alone.  I prefer to goi it alone myself, you get much more of a feeling of accomplishment when you can take a group of 3 on by yourself.  Fromsoft is working hard to balance the stats on everything better for PVP and end the cancerous estoc problem (dark sword isn't really a problem IMO).  The boss design is not as creative as in the past on the whole, but is still really cool and some enemies like Aldritch are really neat ideas from a lore perspective.  The story is much better than that of Dark Souls 2 and they now have 4 different endings which is a nice addition.  I would now reccomend this game after the patches.  8/10only buy Dark Souls 3 if you want a PVE experience, the PVP is currently massively unbalanced as of this review (more than a month and a half after release and multiple patches).  magic is useless (lmagic is somewhat viable now) in pvp atm and melee is the only way to go, greatshields are way OP (particularly havels shield), poise works correctly but is useless now (so stupid), and the estoc is once again OP as heck too.  A big disappointment compared to Dark Souls 2's pvp experience.  The PVE is pretty good, but I still think DS 2 was better.  another big problem is seriously laggy pvp, getting hit by a blow that missed you by 10 feet is very obnoxious.sooooooo many more patches needed."
Positive,YES THIS GAME IS GOOD
Positive,"This game has stunning visuals, amazing bosses, an assortment of weapons, and multiple stratagies for taking down enemies. This game is a fitting end to the series; I wish it didnt have to end. this game gets a 9.8/10"
Positive,"if I hate all red people, does that make me racist?"
Positive,Fire keeper is hot.
Positive,"Read a sign on the ground saying ""no Illusionary wall ahead"". I hit the wall and no hidden passages were revealed. 10/10 most helpful community."
Positive,"A great sendoff for the Series, beautiful graphics, amazing gameplay, more of the brilliant lore we've grown attached to, nice little nods to the past games and ALOT of ways to die, die to the random dood on the cliff, die to that bug thing in the corner, die to that GIANT FUCKING *Insert spoiler* 15 TIMES AND THROW YOUR CONTROLLER AT YOUR DOOR...This game has managed to do what no other game has, it makes me want to stay in the universe, learn more and for it to never end, knowing that (For now at least) that Dark Souls is done is disappointing, but we get one hell of a final game...Also, we get alot of ways to die...like to a GIANT FUC-Wait did I say that already? Sorry, the salt is still going through my veins...If you've thought at all about buying this game, do it, you won't regret it...(P.S. The soundtrack is amazing, it's worth all the rage, salt and tears just to hear it)10/10, Praise the Salt...I mean Sun!(Edit: If you ain't seen the launch trailer, you really should watch it, the music fits so well and you'll see what your in for:  )"
Positive,"All the other souls games are games that i normally dislike but i really love dark souls 3 the combat has been improved a lot from the other souls games and the progression and enemies are all really great, there are so many times where i raged my face off for one part of a area or one boss that I just can't beat.BUT the game is not perfect on the pc the thing that i hate the most is that all the controls and ui interaction are in xbox buttons so i had to constantly check the key binding to be able to play with a keyboard and mouse.Now i haven't had any issues as of yet with the game performance wise seeing that i have a pretty beefy computer.So all and all i would recommend this game to anyone that have a beefy pc and if you dont then you might have some problems seeing as so amny people have had some problems, but I would say to wait for the game to get better optimised before you buy it but its still a great game and worth a pick up."
Positive,"10/10 game. I was kinda iffy about the combat at first, but once you get into it, it's amazing."
Positive,"If you thought pinwheel was hard, you're in for a whole new challenge with the latest instalment of Dark Souls."
Positive,"Never once in all my years playing games has one yoyo-ed my emotions as Dark Souls III has. From fear of death, to delight of beating a boss, to glee of taunting an invader who invades you while you have 3 summons, to rage as you're summoned into a world with 4 players waiting to slay you. Dark Souls III is an emotional roller coaster of ""F*** YEAH!!!""s to ""F*** THIS F***ING PIECE OF F***"". And I will continue to come back to it every chance I get."
Positive,"Dark souls 3 in a nutshellPvp In a nutshell:Most solo players: weak attack, weak attack, weak attack, weak attack, weak.. *gets paried for spam* then they run away to chug estus flasks only to be backstabed and punished for chugging and runningMost players: You *Invades world* Host of embers ""Hey!""

Positive,still fashion souls
Positive,A great mix between the fast gameplay of Bloodborne and the punishing combat from Dark Souls.
Positive,"Absolutely excellent. Worth a play. Does not handhold, and may be difficult fo those new to the series. A worthy sucessor of DS1."
Positive,I give this game 10 onions out of 2 donkeys*****2024 edit: This is what I found funny in 2016
Positive,This game is simply AMAZING
Positive,"It's a great game, a mix between both Dark Souls 1 and 2. Great Enemies, fluid combat, nice multiplayer. The only problem I have with it is frame rate issues that kick me out of online mode. However that is probably going to be patched by FromSoftware sooner or later. I definately reccomend this game to anybody with the patience to die a lot."
Positive,"Pros:+ Amazing and rewarding combat+ Both PvE and PvP are incredibly satisfying+ Extreme replay value+ Visually stunning+ The Most Balanced of all Souls Games (on release) to date.+ Lots of throwbacks to previous games+ Great Level Design+ Interconnected Areas+ Incredibly easy to connect to friends, especially compared to previous installments+ Incredibly well designed and intricate bosses+ Lots of players can enter a single word, making for a large, chaotic PvPvP battle+ Backstabs are finally balanced, a very good compromise between DS1 and DS2 backstab mechanicsNeutral Points:+/- Very difficult, IMO the hardest souls game to date.Cons:- Framerate sometimes drops, though rarely.- Some weapons feel underpowered, while others are incredibly strong in PvP but utterly useless in PvE and vice versa- Much slower magic-casting times compared to dark souls 2, making it much less viable to play a ""Pure Caster""- It's ridiculously easy to miss NPC's which you NEED to find in order to do certain builds (i had to look at least 4 NPC's up on the wiki to find out where the f*ck they were...)And the most important Con:- ""Door does not open from this side""This game is an absolutely fantastic mix of Dark Souls 1's combat, Dark Souls 2's much better netcoding (than DS1), Bloodborne's tempo, a few mechanics and throwbacks from Demon Souls thrown in the mix, and top it off with amazing graphics and incredibly intrigueing lore. If you have played the other souls games front to back, be it dark or demon souls, or bloodborne for that matter, this game is definitely for you. If you tried another souls game but found it (a little) too hard or frustrating, or you have never played a souls game before, then i suggest you skip this one for now. Play the other Souls game to end. as FromSoftware really upped their difficulty this time around, Dark Souls 3 could be an extremely frustrating experience for newer Souls players. I give it a 9.5/10."
Positive,"8/10If you dont like games that frustrate you with their difficulty dont get this game. Its not a game that relys mainly on your reactions like super meat boy, its more of a unforgiving game where patience is key. If you go into a room and see a item in the center of the room use your brain, what are the odds that there is just a nice free present for you, no youll go up to it and get fucked by tons of monsters. This game makes you think about everything before you do it because you know at any moment you could die and lose some significant progress. By dying you learn and learning every time makes you feel like a god when you go back to an area you just died in and you dodge all these attacks. But dont be too worried their is co-op in a sense, you cant match directly with friends anymore like you could in DS2, but in its current state you really never go without help on a boss. But you can solo bosses if you want, the bosses have more health for each summon you get. adding up to 100% more health if you take 2 friends to help you.Dont assume that you will be able to beat each boss on your first try. All the bosses in this game take some time to get used to. This game is pretty hard and its to the point where you have to take a little bit more time in it, something i didnt feel in DS2. Dark souls 3 for me is a 8/10 it feels unfinished with its current netcode and optimization for PC. Dont get me wrong this game destroys DS2 in terms of game play and level design. Pros:Good match making (for friendlys)hard bossescreative bossescreative move setsinteresting types of weapons to usegood map connectivity and AMAZING level designThe story is there but its not forced down your throat taking in to mind that some people just wanna play the gamecons:invaders have no time limit and can seriously cause you to waste a lot of time because they wont let you progress. I have had a few times where they stand next to a huge monster and you cant go near them and then they just sit there and dont leave. poorly optimized, in its current state there is no real excuse for some of the issues people in the community are having with FPSLaggy PVP invaders, invaders pings are always so high that they are like teleporting and rubber banding. There really needs to be a system to check their ping so you dont have to deal with it."
Positive,The best worst game I've ever played.
Positive,pvp is the definition of a clown fiesta
Positive,"Edit as of April 21st:  Turns out there was a large wave of bans that went out and a bunch of innocent people got banned, too.  Well it sure makes a lot more sense why the rating is so low now.I'm in love with everything this game has to offer.  For the first time since I first picked up the original Dark Souls, I haven't been able to put down the game.On top of that, I haven't read a single negative review that was accurate.  Some have made fair points but most of them sound as if they wish the game were easier, which would really take away from what makes dark souls so great.  Sure there are some bugs right now, but this is only version 1.04.  Those claiming they are having connection issues probably have sub-par internet connection, as I have been invaded so much that its hard to beleive that i've ever been disconected."
Positive,"my game of the year already!probably not yours if youre in the type of ""collect 10 frog legs"" and after that ""a bazillion rabbit plushes"" etcetc.+ combat+ difficulty+ manasystem+ later on some of the best bossfights in souls+ leveldesign+ graphics / artstyle+ lore+ npc characters / questlines (old friends :D:D)+ you can get every item of a mob. literally.+ even better soundtrack than bloodborne (esp. yuka kitamura <3)- some framerate drops in foggy areas- best coop mechanics in a souls game so far (works fine for like 80% of tries), still pretty poor (signs wont appear, summoning fails etc.)- a rare bug where invaders or invaded ppl slide around in T position. its very bad cuz u cant see any attack animation.- some pvp lagsi had two crashes til now in 70h playtime which is decent i think. i am ok with that.git gud/10\T/"
Positive,"This game is amazing. Graphics and art design are just blowing me away here, From has crafted a beautiful dark fantasy! Combat is the best this has ever been and level design is a wonderful homage to Dark Souls 1 and 2. This may be the best Dark Souls game yet!!!FYI I am 20 hours in and am just at the swamp, maybe 1/3 of the way through the game? I like to take my time an explore and this game is the perfect game for that. I love the atmosphere, the strange and horrible and incredible things you come upon. The lighting engine this game uses is FANTASTIC just the light from an enemy holding a lamp makes a scene look cool. I was afraid this game would be all dark and grey but it is very colorful in places. When you die your soul echoes this time are represented by a glowing green orb that looks incredible floating by a stone staircase or whatever. This game is a halloween medieval fairy tale acid trip gone wrong."
Positive,"Exelent Mix between Deamon Souls, Dark Souls I, Dark Souls  II and Bloodborne"
Positive,Weapon sheaths are back GOTY 10/10 It's ok
Positive,"Decent game I guess, just finished choosing my first characters name."
Positive,"Dark, haunting, challenging, and rewarding. Dark souls III rises above its previous younglings, and takes all of it into one sucessful bundle of dark fantasy. If you liked 1, 2, and Bloodborne even, chances are you'll love this too. Combat is fast and fluid, graphics are, although not a killer, shines in many areas. The music will keep you motivated, as the epic haunting sounds of Yuka's score blasts through each boss. Buy it. You won't forget this journey. Don't worry, dying is a normal routine."
Positive,"So, in this review im gonna say what i saw in the game what i liked and what i disliked . I realy love this game and its already my favorite Souls game.Positives:So, i played the game in NG 6 and now here are my positive things . The world just looks beautiful . Every area in the game is just amazing and you get so exited whenever you enter a new area. Also whenever you progress you get rewards . You get extremly good items (depends on class) that are often usefull. In my opinion the game is much easier then the other games. I guess its because of the playstyle that they copied from bloodborne. Its much faster now and you can play without a shield with just dodging (but you dont need to). The bosses and also every enemy is very well designed . Every attack pattern from the different bosses is unique on his own way. Whenever you fight a boss you think you encounter something you never faced before ( like a guy who teleports or who is very fast). So lets come to the multiplayer part. The pvp is literally the best in every souls game . The covenants are great and they are all different. Like the sunbro covenant shows that you like to help people or with the aldrich one you defend him and his ,,castle´´ . And the coop yeah the coop is gorgious . I´ve never seen such a great summoning system. Before every boss there are people who wants to help you or at the start of a area there are peoples who wants to help you to come to the boss. But now lets come to the negative aspects of the game.Negatives :I dont know if this happens only to me but for me sometime ( not every time ) the framerate just drops down for a moment and this sucks. Also it kinda sucks that sometimes you just cant summon peoples but its not a big deal.Summary :I played every souls and its just the best Souls game on my list. Im very imprest what FromSoftware did there. Even if the difficulty is much lower now its still wonderful . I´m kinda sad that this will be the last souls game and i hope that eventually there will be another game that FromSoftware brings us. For all who played DS , DS2 or Bloodborne : Buy it its amazing. And for everyone who wants to buy it : Do it !"

Positive,THE LEGEND NEVER DIES
Positive,"Giń, giń, giń, zawsze gdy boss ma 1% HP. Jedna z najlepszych gier, w które grałem. Niesamowicie wciągająca, ciężko się od niej oderwać, a momenty śmierci tylko nas napędzają. UWAGA! Możliwe, że wasze pady, myszki i klawiatury ulegną zagładzie."
Positive,"The best thing I've played since Dark Souls 1. (No spoilers)Yes, there are a few issues technically and I've been lucky to not have faced some of the things other players have, but as the newest installment in the Souls series, Dark Souls 3 takes what we've come to love about the Souls games and stuffed it into a flashy new package. The combat is a little faster, maybe a notch slower than Bloodborne, over all it just feels more responsive. Every thing seems to have a nice weight to it. Combat still needs you to pay attention though and the enemies this time around seem more ""alive"" than ever; jumping, leaping and scurrying around to tear you apart. Having said that; maybe it's cause I've been playing Bloodborne everyday since the DLC came out so I'm ""on it"", but the first few bosses were taken down with barely an estus swipe on the first try. So that WAS a little disappointing. The other enemies scattered across the ares have been fun to discover and fight though.Setting wise; we all know that ""Souls lore"" is something you have to look for and piece together, but as someone who has played every Souls installment since Demon's Souls; there is a lot of nods to look out for and appreciate. I spent a lot of time just exploring and looking around enjoying the new game engine which looks absolutely beautiful. Everything from the environment to the things that inhabit it look terrifying yet great to look at.    Dark Souls 3 is great for people you love Dark Souls and want more of it. If you have never played a Souls game for whatever reason, if you didn't like it before I'm not sure why that would suddenly change with this new installment. If anything the updated graphics will make your frustrations look prettier. But for fans of the series; they aren't even reading this review because they are already playing it."
Positive,Who is the moron that added a FUCKING KATANA wielding WHORE that legit never stops spamming attack 15th time to die to that boss High recommended for the ppl that want to go insane 10/10 would fuck again!
Positive,Made a character and died in the first ten minutes10/10 experience is what I expected
Positive,What Dark Souls 2 should have been.
Positive,"tl;dr: amazing game, servers are buggy, sorry for anyone having the crashes, get it when its updated and fixed.I can recommend this game, as I am not having any problems with crashes, low fps, or any performance related things. The only thing I can complain about is online not being accessible right now. I'm not sure if this is a widespread problem, but I was able to connect yesterday, and not today. I'm only assumming its because of the massive amount of traffic.Combat is as fluid as it ever was in the series, best feeling so far. There's a new learning curve that will throw players of the previous Souls games for a loop. Enemy AI is very aggressive, which is nice to see. Original Dark Souls'  poise is back as well, which is all I could have asked for. A minor complaint is bonfire placement, but it can easily be overlooked. At some points, bonfires seem to be placed too far or close to each other, making one part of the area feel very easy, and the other part feel like a gauntlet. Bosses don't dissapoint, as there are actually interesting designs, mechanics, and arenas to fight in. Having only played the PC version for 5 hours, as well as exploring in the network test, the amount of content in areas is very dense. Having played only the first few areas, and gotten roughly half of the amount of weapons that Bloodborne had in the entire game, Dark Souls III makes a return to form in player choice on playstyle. Starting classes aren't solely specialized in Dex or Strength, or Magic as well. There are now what seem like hybrid classes, like the Herald or the Mercenary, being Strength/Faith and Quality builds respectively. Weapon Artes are also a staggeringly good addition to the franchise. Having more fluid and less predictable moves, along with being able to equip three weapons, make for a more engaging and intimate combat system, with PvE and PvP alike. Branching paths in areas, new weapons, and the wonderful addition of Weapon Artes make choice in this game extremely deep and engaging.Graphically, it's beautiful. It doesn't have the most polygons as other next gen titles. However, it has some of the most beautiful textures, use of depth of field, and overall some of the most interesting designs I've seen in a while. This game will most likely hold up graphically for many years to come. The cloth physics are amazing, character design and settings are beautiful, and lighting is gorgeous. The world is depressing and dark, but there are still splotches of beautiful contrasting colour found throughout Lothric. From the Giant Crystal Lizards azure sheen to the Undead Settlements stunning fires, the game knows when to throw a little bit of colour to keep your palette interested. Again, I've had little frame dips, no crashes, no low FPS. My graphics card is an nVidia 860GTX (2GB), I have 16GB of RAM, and an Intel i7, and am running the game off of an SSD. I would hope that no problems would come from a bit of a hefty rig. It's ashame that so many negative reviews are given out from not being able to play the game, as its amazing thus far. The developers do need to fix this however, and I'm sorry for anyone who has payed 55-60 dollars for the game, (or even more if they bought the season pass) and isn't able to play. My main qualm is sever issues. I've only been able to play online once. At first, I was consistently getting the message ""Unable to log into Dark Souls III game servers. Press 'OK' to try to reconnect."" I tried this for about 45 minutes before giving up. Then, later that night, it worked, and I was in the server. However, today I have been constantly getting the message again and again. I must have tried at least 10 times, giving each time 15 minutes. Its infuriating because I would like to enjoy PvP and Co-op with my friend. Although the minor upset about the server issues, this whole game is a masterpiece. I'm glad there are still developers who create more or less Triple A titles, and still put this much passion, polish, and content into their work. If you have any interest in this game, or RPGs in general, I would wait for the crashing/frames fix, and pick it up not a second later. It's a wonderful game that really doesn't treat you like an iimbecile, which is nice to see in an industry that treats players like idiots."
Positive,"love the dark theme, challenging enemies, and decent graphics, 9/10 so far (y)"
Positive,Better than Dark Souls 2
Positive,Can play this for hours. A++ game.Can't handle the heat? Git Gud.
Positive,"This game is incredible.  I'm a huge fan of the souls series but this is my favorite entry.  Every new area I enter is so well designed, and I was so immersed that I played until 4 AM without even looking up to check the time.  This is one of those games that you just get lost in and forget about all of your responsibilities, and I love it."
Positive,"So it has hit, and with absolutely no disappointment at all. I havent been doing much bosses but I have been looting alot enjoying the scenery and trying out some weapons. If you thought Bloodborne was beautiful wait till you play this."
Positive,"God, this game is everything I wanted. As someone who doesn't have a PS4 for Bloodborne, they infused Bloodborne so well into this. Combat is quick and fluid.The setting is amazingly detailed and best of all Soul's games.The score is absolutely just stellar.Solid 5/7."
Positive,"The Game is so Good/Hard, My PC Said ""You Died"" after I launched it 11/10"
Positive,"Game crashes whenever I get close to a bonfire.10/10, must have enabled hardcore mode by accident."
Positive,good as f
Positive,PRAISE THE SUN!
Positive,Praise the sun! If you like any of the past iterations of dark souls you will definitly enjoy this one.
Positive,most intuitive multiplayer system to date /s
Positive,"Dunno why everyone is crying about system crashes, personally i had no issues or whatsoever, amazing graphics and an amazing gameplay. Been a huge fan of Dark Souls games, this might become my favorite after the first one. It may seem easy at first for ppl who are already familiar with the gameplay, but i kinda like how the combat is a bit more fast paced. Anyways, everyone who was interested in the game already heard all these via videos or forums, so Praise the sun From Soft, thanks for the amazing game! You actually got me to write my very first review! 11/10 so far!"
Positive,"You'll be abused until you love it. In a scenario where the sweaty, worn wifebeater has atleast 3 coffee stains. And there's already 6 empty beer cans next to the armchair, by the time the clock rounds 5.30PM....And the rug reeks of urine.Joking aside though.Dark Souls has a reputation for being insanely difficult. I'd rather say it's punishing and rewarding, as it's only as hard as you make it. You're rewarded for being observant, prudent and quick on the reflexes.Everything in the game is made to impress you, and in that sense, make you instinctively do the opposite of what the situation calls for. It's tricky.It's so nice to have Dark souls come with the polish of Bloodborne, and it seems to have cleaned up a lot of the little contrived things. A lot of things are more convenient, and it feels much less like you're fighting the controls before the enemy.It's gorgeous and the soundtrack is stunning right from the title screen. Definitely a contender for game of the year.Worth the asking price....Prepare to buy."

It's challenging but I wouldn't say it's too hard, you just gota level up a bit and you will get through it. I love the animations, the fight styles, and the story. It's freaking beautiful hahaha I LOVE IT!!! I also really like finding hidden goods so I get really excited when I find the secret doors and the chests UNLESS ITS A MIMIC HAHAHHA little jump scared XD also there's alot of cool people that play so it's always fun when someone comes in to help.

Positive,i like it
Positive,Guaranteed fun as long as you down point and throw dung pies at the corpse of every player you kill.Even if you summoned 3 allied phantoms and gang bang one enemy player. Do it. BM.Become the disrespect.
Positive,"Sadly this game is actualy a bit instable , i already have ~10 crash and it's boring. [But i'm sure it'll be patched soon.]If you look at the game itself, it's a real piece of art, if you already love Souls game you have to play it. If you are new to Dark soul, you should try it (Even if i strongly recommand you to play the first one before).You 'll die. A lot of time. You'll rage. A lot of time. But the craziest thing about this ? You'll love it. The more you fail, the better it feel when you succeed.   This is only my point of view, but for me, Dark souls III is the best of the souls trilogy.And guys, don't forget to praise the sun !"
Positive,Memes are everything.
Positive,"I've really enjoyed my time with Dark Souls 3, it's as good as the original in my opinion. The PC port is the best in the Souls series and both the PvE and PvP are fun."

Positive,"This game is trully a matserpeice when it come to PVE. Although, when it comes to the PvP portion, the souls series has lost its charm. When developing this game, there were so many people complaing about how Dark Souls 1 PvP was better then 2's, but what they failed to recognise was how broken it was back then. That game was filled with fliping Havels, gold tracer fags, and katanas everywhere, and it was broken as fuck. Yes, you could use the deamon's great hammer, if you were lucky enough to get a hit in on a glod tracer user. It was completely Dex based, and DKS2 actually fixed that. The PvP in Dks2 was balanced, a greatword could easily overpower a katana, if they knew how to use them. Fights meant something back then, every weapon had a balance to it (yes even the Ice Raiper [it was easy as hell to parry]). People failed to realise that it was a far better system, and it shows because people still play it reguarly and Dks1 doesn't even hold a candle to its popularity. Instead of seeing this FromSoftware decided to create the same broken ass system that was in the first game. It no longer concerns skill, just whoever has a faster weapon, thanks to no poise. Theres been a lot of arguments about leaving this out and I'm not going to get into it. That said, From can't fix this anymore because of the mass of players in it, so we are stuck with this horse shit. PvP means nothing anymore, and they knew it would from the start, because there aren't any arenas anymore. Besides all of this, in a PVE setting, this game is great, and I would recommend it, I won't the PvP though, it's absolute dogshit."
Positive,"I guess I'm one of the lucky ones not having any issues with the game crashing whatsoever. The camera leaves some to be desired, but I'll have to learn not to back myself into corners I suppose. :)Liking the game so far. It doesn't grab me the way DS1 did, but not too many games do."

Positive,"9 / 10   Dark Souls 3 doesn’t reinvent the series, but it’s a great Dark Souls game that provides an excellent conclusion to the trilogy.   It’s the fastest paced combat in the series.  It’s almost a hybrid of the earlier Souls titles, and Bloodborne PC performance is excellent.  This is not the poorly done port that plagued the original game’s pc launch. All the equipment is useful, to a degree.  Earlier installments saw the character receiving mountains of equipment, but only a small number of items would prove useful.  Thankfully they struck a good balance with part 3. Rogue-like features of this game might be a turn off to some of the less adventurous players, but this shouldn’t be a surprise at this point either.   No ability to pause the game even when you’re playing in single player offline mode.  Apparently nobody on the development team has small children.3/31/2017  42 Hours Played  More Game Reviews"

Positive,"This is a review aimed towards those who are interested in buying the game and are new to the Souls series. If you are a returning player interested in knowing how it compares to the other two games, in my opinion, Dark Souls III is much better than either of the iterations, with more variety than Dark Souls II and much more balanced, fluid gameplay than Dark Souls and much less unfairness in its design choice. Though if you are a masochist that just wants the game to pound you, you may find it less appealing.__Dark Souls III, and the Souls series in general is a game that is difficult to serve a purpose, and that is to test your human spirit. It is not insanely and notoriously unfair, but it does paint a picture of you as a simple human being, an insignificant mote of existence in a much grander universe. And it is your job, as the player, to prove to that universe that you are something, that you are capable of becoming powerful, that your human spirit, not your skill or your wits, will survive any arduous journey that they throw at you.This game is about surviving hardship, moral ambiguity and a dreadful, fearful world. It is about giving you a deep sense of wonder, and just enough tools for you to grow and learn as a player. The gameplay's ability to make you die quickly is not to frustrate you, but rather to make you very aware of your own mortality. And it is this awareness that brings immersion and satisfaction. When almost any enemy can kill you if you are clumsy or slipshod, every enemy that you defeat becomes that much more satisfying to take the heads from. It's brilliance comes from the level of agency that it gives to the player, whether you outskill a difficult opponent, or resort to cheap tactics and cheesing a for, both give you great pleasure as you learn the ins and outs of surviving in the inhospitable landscape. A player doesn't have to be good to beat the game, they merely have to be patient, and to be aware of their surroundings.Is the game fun? Yes. But it is often in a way that you do not expect, and it is difficult to describe why something that punishes you so harshly can be so engaging. It is not for everyone, but it doesn't take long to see the game's charm, once you survive the initial shock.TL;DR: This game excels in putting you in the zone. It is a trial of the human spirit, rather than a game to enjoy for the masses. But if that appeals to you, I strongly recommend this game."
Positive,"This was my first soulslike game, so I am not experienced enough to review such games but personally I liked Dark Souls 3 very much."

Positive,"By far one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. Masterfully directed, produced, and presented by artists that have mastered their craft and it clearly shows. My immense respect to the entire development team. I cannot recommend this game enough; play it now. 10/10"
Positive,"EDIT: I DID IT! I FINISHED THE GAME! EDIT: Innocent people being banned. Unacceptable and really unfair. Though I'd recommend it if you  DON'T PLAY MULTIPLAYER. EDIT: Five hours to complete tutorial.10/10 would die again Dark Souls 3 is a masterpiece. Graphically, it is flawless and also extremely beautiful. Having been this is the first Dark Souls game I've played on Steam, I was blown away.Let's start by what is in Dark Souls 3:+ Excellent gameplay, from what I have played, this game does not spoon feed you. It is fast and aggressive and will keep you on your toes. Along with this comes a clean, percise, smooth curve of difficulty which (may steeply) progress over time.+ The Details: Usually you'll find games that repeat the same things over and over again. This game does not. Each level is design in such a way to make your gameplay an unforgettable one. The world is graphically beautiful with on par level design. + Tons and tons of choices: There are  loads  of weapons and armor, making it open for new combinations to fit your style. + An amazing soundtrack, all I can say. The music is on point. (a1)+ Great emenies, bosses, and areas. Some areas are massive with loads of room to explore which makes a game a great game. + The Level Design. Just wow. - Personally, I dislike gank type appoaches. Dark Souls 3 did have somewhat of it with enemies. Although it is fun to hack and slash and dodge (and hold on to dear life) your way out of it, many people may dislike the approaches if they are not ready, new to the game, or simply unable to fight. - Playing with a kb+m can be utter chaos.  However, kb+m is great for aiming (naturally).  I didn't find many cons to it as a first time player, but there were a lot of pros (which is a good thing). Personally, I love games like this. Games that don't spoon feed you but throw the food on the ground and make you fight for it. I have to admit, this game is difficult, often frustrating at parts but I do love the challenge. Whether you are a fan or not, this game can and will blow your mind.  Overall, Dark Souls 3 is truly a masterpiece. Graphically and performance wise, it excells. It has tremendous content to it and is difficult. As a first time player, I absolutely love it. And yes, I love to die multiple times then get it right just once."
Positive,best of the trilogy no doubt all my respect goes to dark souls 1 but this game is LEAGUES in front. Well balanced in all directions and immersive as fuck. Play it if you want or dont idfk.10/10
Positive,It made me suffer.
Positive,"through the dark soul, i alone am the ashen oneafter 100%ing this game, i can absolutely say that this game is a hood classic. the game never dips in quality and only goes higher and higher, ESPECIALLY in the DLC (love the ringed city, gael is EASILY one of, if not, the best boss in soulsborne). the weapons feel great, the bosses are all great to fight and wonderfully designed, the music made me wanna crank up the sound so bad that i would get tinnitus, fire keeper is an instant smash and the levels, although not the series best, are all fun to traverse and get progressively more interesting (boreal valley, lothric castle, archdragon peak, painted world and ringed city are all perfect). although not my first soulsborne experience (i 100%ed elden ring and ds1:R before this), had a good challenge but never felt impossible. the only flaw in this game is that you cannot sex fire keeper. so please, even if you're picking this game up and it's your first souls experience, do yourself a favor and buy it. even if a boss is whooping your ass too hard, never go hollow"
Positive,"Not sure why my very old review got deleted. Dark Souls 3 is still the best of the Soulsborne series, and the Souls-like genre, to me. It's still playable today. Still holds up. You can still experiment with making different builds. Tackling the game in different ways, experimenting with PVP. The setting is still astounding to me. The challenges are incredible, yet rewarding, even after all this time. Sucks my original review disappeared. I had a lot more to say. All I can really think to say now is, the game is amazing. it's one of the best games you can play. Are there harder games? Sure. Are there other souls-like games? duh. But, this one just checked all the right boxes. If you like the challenge, and if you like the first Dark Souls game, you'll like this."
Positive,It's pretty good.
Positive,at least ten times better than destiny 2
Positive,One of the best games ever concieved throughout history. 11/10.
Positive,"It's pretty good. The community is full of cancerous dickbags though, so be prepared for that."
Positive,"Very good game but it is a little linear (or at least feels more linear from DkS1). Looks nice, controls nice (except for the input queuing that kept getting me killed but that's on me), good level design for each area, and the bosses were more than just dude in armor. There IS a gimmick fight and a few find the week spot fights but the rest were great. I wouldn't say it's better than DkS1 but it did improve some areas (except for the camera)."
Positive,"Dark souls 3 is a damn grat game and you should play it before i slit your mum's throatFor real though, dark souls is a masterpiece of a game and this one is just as good as the previous ones (maybe not dark souls 1)just get it or something its good"

Positive,Hard game make go cry
Positive,"Ahhh Dark souls 3 one of the best souls-like games that makes you addicted to dying and trying, you will be drowned of it deep lore and story, you will be amazed with the bosses design and soundtracks, Engaging in pvp or pve battles makes you feel like a real knight either having a big sword or small dagger doesn't matter what matter is how to use them correct, learn how to work together and make strategies with phantoms against bosses or players, Or you can ignore all of the above and play reckless"
Positive,"Ah, Dark Souls 3. How I adore you. You are that type of game I always dreamed of playing and my only regret was not getting my hands on you sooner.To my shame I never played Dark Souls 1, but I did play Dark Souls 2. Compared to that one, Dark Souls 3 feels like a more streamlined yet overal improved game. Dark Souls 2 had a lot of very unforgiving mechanics, such as poison being way stronger, you losing max health every time you die because you're losing your humanity... Dark Souls 3 gave up that kind of stuff and instead focussed on the combat. The average enemy is easy to beat, you just learn their attack patterns and counter them, easy peasy. The boss fights are a lot of fun, as not only is each fairly memorable but each requires you to understand how the boss is going to attack and how you can counter them. It's a push and pull, give and take, where mistakes are painful and the game rewards you for paying attention. The pvp in Dark Souls 3 is, however, the true icing on the cake. It is a dance of death, where you and your opponent are constantly trying to outmanouver each other and punish mistakes. It feels like a slower paced fighting game, where unless your gear is truly awful the battle is decided by who is the most skilled, not by who has the best gear. In short, it's great, but you will notice that certain things that worked in Dark Souls 2 will not work here. Poison for instance is tremendously nerfed, and not nearly as deadly as it used to be, which is sad because it's just as easy to remedy as it was in Dark Souls 2.However, the atmosphere of the game really blew me away. The vocals are well done, each area is its own distinct sence of gloomy and ancient, and holy moly the music. Even today I still occasionally listen to some of the soundtracks cause I just adore them that much.Dark Souls 3 is a game I'll never forget. I'll admit, part of that is because of my personal preference, so consider me biased in that opinion. Even so, if you're even remotely interested in these type of hack-and-slash games mixed with rpg elements, Dark Souls 3 is a must-try."
Positive,"Every soul has its dark,"
Positive,best game on steam.
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 was actually the first Dark Souls game I had beaten, and I think I know why. It's more of a linear experience compared to the first game, so you likely won't make a wrong turn when exploring different areas. That isn't a bad thing, considering it was the reason I didn't beat the first Dark Souls (at the time), I never had an idea of how close I was to finishing the game, or if I was making progress at all. Dark Souls 3, however, with it being more linear, it feels great due to it always feeling like you're making progress, even if it's just getting out of the area you're in to go to the next bonfire. With 204 hours (currently) on record, I can highly recommend this game as a must-play for people who couldn't really get into the first Dark Souls."

Everything about it is amazing, the bosses are amazing, the setting is amazing. Just everything about it is incredible. Even if you aren't a fan of Dark Souls, I will 100% recommend this to anyone.

Positive,"The latest installment of the Dark Souls franchise, this gem is faster and more fluid than ever.  While the freedom of the swift movement and combat feels amazing, and it has been a lot of fun experiencing all of the different weapon combinations, I do miss the purposeful and more challenging learning curve of combat that Dark Souls 1 and Dark Souls 2 held.  In Dark Souls 3 the beauty of people emphasizing skill and forethought into how they will attack has oftentimes been replaced with whatever weapon is the ""cheapest"" to use and can be spammed to try to win.  This is exclusive to the PVP, though, and not an issue at all with the environment and your personal experience.  If you are very into PVP this is something that is easy to identify and overcome, and you can still have a fulfilling experience.  You just won't be playing chess, instead you'll be playing tag.  Still fun, just different.It wasn't my intention to lead with a minor gripe because this game is still an incredible experience that I have gone back to multiple times.  Dark Souls has always been about the environment, the characters/creatures and bosses for me when all is said and done.  The art direction is just as gorgeous and haunting as ever and some of the best boss battles and designs I have seen were contained in this one.  The multiplayer was much easier this time around as opposed to the earlier installments so playing with others was not difficult at all.  The gameplay, the aesthetic, the music, all of it was memorable and immersive.  I definitely see myself coming back to this one again and again, happily."
Positive,Hard but fun.
Positive,"Well what can I say? I love Dark Soul and I had big expectations regarding the new installment. After a little bit disappointing Dark Souls 2, I was worried that Dark Souls 3 will be only a good game too. Thankfully, unnecessarily, because Dark Souls 3, the same as Dark Souls 1 is a masterpiece. Miyazaki delivers.  The game is beautiful, may be not a technological breakthrough, but the artstyle is godlike. Some of the views are magnificent. Artstyle wise it’s the best game on the market (IMO). The same goes for music. Orchestral score perfectly fits fights with huge bosses, and in my opinion, Dark Souls 3 has the best soundtrack when it comes to souls/borne games.    When it comes to the bosses, NPCs and gear, I must admit that I’m very pleased. The bosses feature great design, and some of the fights are one of the best in the series. It’s hard to judge their difficulty as I’ve been playing souls games for more than 600h. I love the fact that there’re so many references to Dark Souls 1, as it’s my favorite part of the series. Of course there’re references to other titles too, even to Demon’s Souls.    Moving to locations. They deliver too. The areas are varied and feature many hidden paths and secrets. Some of the areas are located off the beaten path and player will not find them if he/she’ll not look carefully.    Of course the game has its flaws. Probably the biggest one is the net code. Very often one will not be able to summon phantoms, and if they manage to do so the phantom/s may be lagging.   To sum up, the game is great and everyone who likes fantasy or looks for a challenging game should buy Dark Souls 3. For me the game is almost as good as the first installment, which I thought would be impossible (Dark Souls 1 is my favorite or the second best game of all time).  I can only hope that the game will become even better with the upcoming two DLCs. EMBRACE THE DARKNESS!"

Positive,"Pretty solid game. I had always heard that this game was pretty challenging, so I decided to give it a go. For the first few hours, I felt like I had become a game journalist. I think I saw the death screen more than actual gameplay. I thought this game was sadistic, and wondered who actually enjoyed this torture. But, the more I played and began to understand the game, the more I started to enjoy it. Over time rage turned into joy as I went from being unable to kill the most easiest enemy to defeating the final boss by myself. 9/10, would recommend."

Positive,"before i played this game i had a small pp, depression, and no girlfriend none of those things have changed but the game is good"
Positive,I should have played it earlier. It's damn amazing
Positive,only play for drip
Positive,one of the best games ive ever played hands down
Positive,"This game is so stupidly hard that it will have you question your own sanity yet draw you in in such a weird way that you will want to play it again just to marry the best NPC, Anri of Astora. Play the game, you'll understand."
Positive,"I feel like it had just the right amount of locations and bosses. It did not feel bloated with content nor underwhelming. The lore/story is interesting. I also liked the fact that we got to see  locations from d1, it was sad and nostalgic"
Positive,if you enjoy homosexual intercourse you will love this game
Positive,The current height of the From Software Dark Souls experienceA challenging must play for any souls fan and or metroidvania fan - Hours of deep combat and explorationReally a must play

Positive,"IT'S A MASTERPIECE PLEASE PLAY THIS GAME IT MAKES ME HAPPYI AM THE NAMELESS KINGYou can kill a god, 10/1010/10 would almost die to random wolf after killing god againOverall masterpiece, it's very dark actually tho very surprised 10/1010/10 main game, DLC probably 10/10truly the dark souls 3 of dark soulspc players beware of poor optimization tho"
Positive,"Amazing music, fascinating boss fights, stunningly medieval areas with a magical, or a sad touch. The difficulty is hard, but some people tend to overhype how hard it is. The main thing why I love dark souls is that it got the perfect difficulty. If you've played many characters, and played till ng8, you will still find this game challenging, but by no means unfair, or whatever word to put here.But don't think dark souls players who've put many hours into the franchise love it for the challenge alone. This game offers incredible gameplay mechanics, and a well thought balancing aspect. If I knew how much time I would spend into DS3 before I bought it, I would've bought it full price. Unlike most good looking games, this one actually features a lot more than just graphics. A ton more."
Positive,"Epic gameplay , story and soundtracks followed up by enjoyable coop experience and very skill based pvp combat. strongly suggesting this game to anyone who calls him/her self a gamer.reccomending to finish Dark Souls 1(remaster) before playing this for ones that are after the story and greater understanding of the lore."
Positive,10/10 would die again
Positive,This is a good game
Positive,"One of the best games I've ever played. The world/level design is a bit more linear compared to the last two Souls games (not sure about Bloodborne, I've haven't played too much of it), meaning you can't really choose where you want to go for yourself, the game paves that path for you. Also, the multiplayer at its best is great, but at its worse it's...janky. Other than that I have no other complaints, this game is great.Disclaimer for mod enthusiasts: DO NOT USE THEM ON THIS GAME. I did and I unfortunately got banned for it, permenantly. It says it their EULA not to do it, even in offline, so this is a heads up for newer players to not make the same mistake I did and to use mods at your own risk."

Positive,"Originally, I was intimidated by the dark souls series. From the ""git gud"" culture, to the add campaigns which make note of the games difficulty.It is not that bad. If you persist, and are willing to die a few (or more) times, the game can be overcome by any average player. Dark souls 3 tends to reward observation and experimentation. The game tries to go out of its way to give you hints. For example, in the preceding level, you will often find items that buff your weapon with the element that the boss is weak to. Worse comes to worse, you can always summon. So, if we ignore difficulty, why should you play? It is one of the best action rpgs to date. The game will constantly present new challenges, keeping you engaged. Due to the amount of depth to the combat system, this can continue to hold you over multiple replays of the game. And while the leveling system will be underwhelming at first, you will eventually enjoy the flexibility offered by it.And of course there is the rush you get from taking down a boss for the first time. Because sometimes that boss can be pretty damn hard."
Positive,Boss fight in this game is the best and most the intense things ever! 10/10
Positive,like dark souls 1 + 2  = 3
Positive,"Sooo.... This is what Miyazaki did when he thought he could combine bloodborne and dark souls. Pretty fun combination, can be challenging but there really is nothing that you can't predict or see before hand. Well, except FOR THE FUCKING FACT THAT THEY DECIDED TO PUT SHIT IN FUCKING LAVA THAT YOU HAVE TO RUN THROUGH TO GET, WHO THE FUCK THOUGHT IT WAS A CONSTRUCTIVE IDEA TO PLACE ITEMS IN AN AREA YOU HAVE TO DIE IN JUST TO AQUIRE THE FUCKING ITEM. Other than that 9/10 pretty gud.Quite the bit more intestive on the system than the last game."
Positive,Hard to play Easy to run
Positive,its a lot like dark souls 1 and 2 but its well designed
Positive,"I've always enjoyed the Souls series, the cryptic story and confusing level design never failed to keep me engaged. I enjoy difficult games, and getting my ass blasted (unrelated). The boss fights in DS3 are enjoyable either because the challenge they present or reason for fighting them. Some fall short and get overshadowed by others but overall I find myself remembering the positives a lot more then the let downs. I've played trough multiple times but I've gotten most of my playtime from PvP. Fight clubs and regular duels are some of the most enjoyable multiplayer experiences i've had outside of playing with friends. You may hold the spot as the fight club champion for and extremely long time, or stand against the wall swinging pickaxes with 4 others for no reason other than its funny.You will run into cheaters and people trying to get your accounts banned but they're not all bad, some will just try to have fun and show off. The addition of real duels and actual arenas were nice but I will still enjoy fighting on the edge behind Pontiff."
Positive,"Last year, before I left PC, Qlaag challenged me to a duel session, wich I won, 6month after I had already left PC, Qlaag told me he had improved a lot and was one of the best PC player. Which is why left confident me to a another tryhard duel session.I had already made up my mind that I was done with PC.. but in the end, I asked him to keep it between us, so I can avoid getting harassed for duels and bo9s by salty PC tryhards. (As you will probably see in the comments theres a lot of them.) In the end I accepted the challenge.Qlaag has now unfortunately become one of those salty tryhards and wants another chance getting at me. This is the last tryhard session we played on the 12th of march 2021.For the record, I do not have the intention to participate in tryhard duels or tournaments until Elden Cringe, having beaten everyone multiple times, I simply do not have the motivation for these PK/xbow/murky duels anymore. I am focusing to growing the channel and conquering the invasion landscape.This upload is for the people who asked for some duels vs Qlaag who is apparently the best duelist left on pc. Final Score for these fights is 11-6 in favor of G9."
Positive,I fucking hate this god damn game so much10/10 would recommend
Positive,"""Poise is working exactly as intended."" - FromSoft"
Positive,"This game is brutal, and will not forgive you for your mistakes. And that's just how it's made!A variety of weapons and armor, well hidden items, a seemingly cryptic yet interesting lore, this game does not disappoint those who love a good balance and challenge of cooperative and invasions.I recommend this to others who not only have to go through Brutal PvE, but also against a variety of players who are invading you. It's brutal, punishing, but all that makes it more rewarding! I give this game a 9/10."
Positive,"Lets get one thing out of the way real quick - Dark Souls 3 is the best game in the series. What can you expect from a Dark Souls game? Death. Lots and lots of death. This of course myself and others have experienced throughout there time with Dark Souls 3 but it doesn't come without its rewards. A huge positive for Dark Souls 3 that easily seperates it from the other Souls games is how much more you can explore each area. Every time when I ventured into a new area I always wanted to know what would happen if I went in one direction but at the same time I wanted to go the other direction and see what was over there. A bonfire perhaps? Death? Treasure? A positive way to look around and see what you can find. While not without it's share of risk, the vast majority of the time there's always a reward waiting for you at the end should you be daring enough to take the leap of faith. With it's great exploration, the level designs truely shine here. From massive hidden levels tucked away, seemingly everywhere you do look, in one way or another you will at some point be visiting there. There were plenty of times that I found myself saying, ""Wow, THIS was here?"" after thinking it was just a fill in for the map. Everything has a purpose in each area. Everything. All the bosses are very good. While some will be extremely easy for a seasoned vet, there are some bosses that just defy ""sane"" in terms of difficulty. There are a few bosses in terms of difficulty that are just mindbogglingly difficult even for a seaonsed vet like myself but of course that joy that comes after finally beating said boss is always worth the dozens of death that came beforehand. Should you not wish to partake anymore in such cruelty, then as the Souls community says, you can always partake in jolly co-operation with other fellow members. \[T]/ - There are a few bugs here and there when it does come to summoning someone but it's not to the point where its rediculous. PVP is still as great, if not as good as ever. Other than sometimes running into a person with a terrible internet connection to the point they just skip all over the screen, it's a great experience to test out your might and gear vs other people all while being rewarded once more should you be the victor. The soundtrack to the game is fantastic. Each piece of music perfectly fits the ambient envrionment and creates this tense and dreadful ambience that you come to expect. Furthermore, where the soundtrack truely shines is during boss fights. It's absolutely incredible. The music sets the stage perfectly for each individual boss fight and that just adds to the already immersiveness when facing the boss itself. If I were to briefly give a bit negativity to Dark Souls 3 is that there are a few recycled bosses from previous Souls games as well as enemies but the vast majority of bosses are very unique and fun. Performance wise, I think that it could've been a bit better optimized even with system specs like mine matching and a bit surpassing the recommended requirements, I did hit a frame dip here and there in certain areas but for the most part the game ran perfectly smoothly. If your computer is somewhere in the middle of minimum and required, lowering the light and water quality helps alot in getting those frames higher. Pros to the game:+ Environments+ Exploration+ Soundtrack+ Epic boss fights+ Risk vs Reward+ Online PVP and Co-operation \[T]/+ Replayability+ The challenge is still there even for seasoned veterans of the seriesCons to the game:- A few recycled bosses and enemies- Could've been a bit better optimizedScore: 9.5/10"
Positive,broke my controller10/10
Positive,This game is one of the hardest games i have ever played. I almost threw my controller after only 30 minutes of playing... I love it!
Positive,Best game I ever played
Positive,"Update:Its been over a year since this game came out and i have almost nothing to complain about anymore. So lets break down what happened shall we? Most importantly both DLCs are out now. They were both pretty awesome but i think some things could have been improved especially with the first DLC which was Ashes of Ariandel.This DLC introduced two new bosses. While the final boss of the DLC was one of my favourite bosses in the series i can't say the same for the second one. It was basically a copy of Royal Rat Authority from DS2 with addition of 3 wolfs and an npc. Only good thing this boss droped was an item called Champion's Bones which unlocks the PvP arena. And that was one of the main reasons i actually bought this DLC since the only way you can unlock the PvP arena is throught one of the DLCs. The DLC it self took me about 5 hours to complete. Its not too long but if you consider the quality and the time you can spend in the arena i would say it was worth it. The second DLC was definetly the better out of those two. I personally think its one of the best DLCs ever made and that DLC is The Ringed City. There are four new bosses and a tons of items varying from weapons, spells and even some of the coolest armor sets in the entire series. The bosses in this DLC are some of the best bosses in the souls series. My favourite is probably the Slave Knight Gael which is the finall boss of the entire DLC. Also Demon in Pain & Demon from Below is an awesome boss fight. Its a two stage boss fight in which you fight both Demon in Pain & Demon from Below in the first phase. Once you kill both of the demons they transform in to the Demon Prince which is basically stronger, more agressive version of the first two demons. Then there is Darkeater midir. Without a doubt the strongest boss in the entire game. It has insane on hit combo and extremly high defenses so prepare to get your ass kicked. First time i fought this boss i was on NG+3 and it took me about 3 - 4 hours to beat him. And then there is the Halflight, Spear of the Church which is another generic NPC boss. However if you play online you won't face the NPC but you will fight against another player. Which can be fun but if you are playing against someone with 500 ping its just pure annoyance. So yeah this DLC took me about 10 hours to complete. Mainly thanks to the Midir. But non the less its hands down one of the best DLCs to this day and for the 15€ you pay for it you get more than enough content. To summarize things up Dark Souls 3 got a lot of the flaws it had patched. Ashes of Ariandel whilst short added the thing which this game missed the most and that was a PvP arena. The Ringed city was an amazing DLC which added some of the best boss fights in the entire franchise and gave the game an worthy ending which this series deserves. So for me Dark Souls III with the DLCs is 9.5/10 game.Old review: Dark Souls III This game is what you probably expect it to be, combination of Dark Souls and Bloodborne. And it plays out very well, yes it has some flaws but more on them later. Since there is a lot to cover i am going to split this review in to three categories -  Gameplay, Single player and Online play.  Gameplay Lets start with gameplay. If you played any other souls game you will be familiary with controls and yes there are some tweaks from previous game but its small changes you are going to learn pretty quick. Most noticable difference is that the game is more fast paced thanks to Bloodborne. Another addition to gameplay is weapon art and FP bar (mana). FP bar determines how many spells you can use and it determines how much you can use your weapon art. Weapon art is uniqe skill for every weapon. It differs from backstep with dagger to buffing your sword with fire for a period of time. Single player One of the strongest part of this game is its lore. Thing with Souls game is that most of the lore is hidden in item description so you should read them if you are interested in it. And best thing about this game is probably its bosses. Every souls game had great bosses but i am pretty confident to say that Dark Souls III has some of the most amazing bosses in ever.  Online play As usual there is a co-op and PvP. Both of them stayed pretty much the same. Which works for co-op but not for PvP. Since the game is fast paced like Bloodborne magic is utterly useless and same goes for miracles and pyromancy (only exeptions are buffs) and that essentialy removes all of those elements from PvP. Another thing that is kinda annoying is a fact you can use estus as invader. Probably the worst part is that there are no PvP arenas. And don't get me wrong i like PvP in this game its just gets repetitive after a while.  Overall rating  All in all Dark Souls III is an amazing game with few flaws. Yes the PvP gets repetitive after a while and magic is useless but i don't regret single penny spent on this game. For me its 8/10!"
Positive,oh god yes.
Positive,impossible to play online with strict NAT type. pretty dumb considering it's not an issue for literally any other game on the internet. other than that it's pretty fun.
Positive,"Dark Souls 3.  Oh my, where to start.  Overall it's a good game.  Some would say better than others, some would say not so good.  Personally, it feels like the best send off the series could have gotten, maybe.  FUCK MIYAZAKI JUST BRING BACK OLD POISE AND EVERYTHING BECOMES VIABLE AND IF IT WAS WORKING AS INTENDED IN THE FIRST PLACE WHY DID YOU BUFF THE NEW SHIT TIER POISE FOR THE DLC GODDAMMIT FROMSOFT YOU FUCKING SHITS GIMME MY MONEY BACK.Overall, the last bossfight is cool.  Really well done for the series closure.  Even if the Ashes of Ariandel was shit.  We got new long haired waifu and weapons.  That's about it."
Positive,lmao buy it
Positive,"I would highly recommend the souls series to anyone who loves RPG's, or hack and slash games(not that this is a hack and slash), but if you want a serious challenge; learning defense, and timing for each and every new enemy, fighting in your own unique way... Then get ready to have your mind blown as it attempts to wrap itself around this seemingly storyless game... You have to search every nook and cranny to find lore... but It's all there. An amazing story just hidden beneath the surface of this incredibly challenging, bloody, medieval(looking) undead battle for the ages."
Positive,"Me killing boss, me happyMe 100% the game, me very happy"
Positive,Dark Souls 3 more like Dark Souls PEAK 9/10
Positive,"Amazing game, some of the best boss fights ever!"
Positive,"i like dark souli am into the dancer of the boreal valley, shes hot"
Positive,its okay. like 6 out of 10
Positive,This game helped learn how to dodge my dad's belt
Positive,Very challenging yet rewarding game. I know some will complain about it but I believe its better played with friends. The game still has some players but it kid of feels desolate at times unless you're in a high PVP area. There's times i put down my summon sign and i'm not summoned for like 20 minutes if at all. I like the new summon system that Elden Ring has it works much better. In 2024 I still highly recommend this game. It has aged well and is still a masterpiece.
Positive,"Dark Souls III makes a beautiful blend of wonderful locations and sad stories. Each enemy you encounter is unique and the NPC's that are scattered around really give you a feeling of ""hey, I'm actually not alone in this world"". Each place is wonderfully crafted, with breathtaking visuals and a background music that really fits each zone.Every place looks like it's out of this world (well, it actually is). Irithyll of the Boreal Valley must be my favorite place in the entire game. It looks like one of those amazing paintings and the ghosts that walk through the city are mesmerizing. Each place in this zone is beautifully crafted and the lighting system, combined with all the amazing details makes this place truly breathtaking. Every single area in this game is this amazing blend of surreal and fantasy and this is the reason why I find DS1 and DS3 the most poetic games from this trilogy.The combat is really what makes the Souls games stand out from the crowd. I can understand why people say that each battle is both hard and rewarding. Each enemy is unique and has this amazing moveset that will make you feel amazing if you manage to win, but will leave you speechless when you'll see the YOU DIED sign, wondering what went wrong. The bosses give you an epic challenge and each one has a story that you'll really remember. The Abyss Watchers fight is both poetic and sad. The music pierces your soul and even before you reach the fight zone, you can hear the battle that goes in the room. It kinda makes you feel good that you stopped the fight for good, gives you a sense of ""now you can all rest in peace"". The fights with Soul of Cinder and Salve Knight Gael (The Ringed City DLC) are both sad and rewarding. The music fits perfectly and you can feel the struggle of the characters. To me it seemed like each boss was glad that you won the fight, because you actually managed to end their struggle and this is what makes this game so immersive.The story gives this game it's depth. It was amazing finding lore bits scattered around the DS3 universe from the DS1 game and I loved each new story that was told. Each character has it's little bit of story and each line is delivered like an arrow. I love the fact that there are multiple endings and the characters quests give you an excuse to spend more time in this game. One line that really gave me goosebumps was from The End of Fire ending and it was the moment I realized that there is more behind the game than countless deaths and struggles.  But one day, tiny flames will dance across the darkness . This line is so beautifully delivered, paired with the amazing cinematic and wonderfully blended music. Overall, yes, I really recommend Dark Souls III. It's an amazing game that rewards each perfect dodge and hit and actually makes you feel amazing with each victory achieved. You'll find yourself immersed in every zone and you'll struggle in every fight you'll encounter, but the whole experience is beautiful and the story beautifully unveils itself in front of you. This review doesn't come from an excellent Dark Souls player, because I'm really not and for quite some time I didn't really want to continue playing. (I started with DS1 and God knows how many times I rage quit because of Capra Demon.) This review comes from someone that gave DS1 and DS3 another chance and I gotta say that I'm glad I did. I would've missed some great games with amazing stories if I didn't. You'll both hate and love every part of this world that is beautifully crafted before your eyes."
Positive,I've probably played this game for over 1000 hours on all platforms combined (and including with mods) and it's among my favorite games of all time. Very replayable and my personal favorite of all the ~15 soulslikes I've played. The artbook is also amazing
Positive,Got invaded more times than I can count while playing with my BF 10/10 would continiue playing cuz this game is great :3

Positive,"This was the only game ending that made me cry. I know there are hundreds of games with endings that are sad and depressing but this game didn't need to try. After all the challenges, anger and frustration you feel when going through the game and even beating the nameless king for the first time by yourself is just pure joy. But when it's all over and those end credits play, you get put in to a depressive like state of mind and reflect on everything, maybe even shed a tear along the way and smile at the end. But hey new game plus exists for a reason lads and time to do my fourth play-through.Note: I played this game on console and did two endings on xbox and now I'm going to do my second play-through on the pc version and get a different ending..."
Positive,bought it for the menu music stayed for the gameplay safe to say its worth👍
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is a triumph of the genre, offers the most challenging yet rewarding experience of all 3 Dark Souls games, it serves as a spiritual successor to Dark Souls rather than a sequel to Dark Souls 2, everything is just bigger and better, Graphically stunning and an amazing soundtrack also, the move and combat feel more fluid than ever and the bosses have more variety than ever, Again Praise the Sun 9/10"
Positive,"If you think it is hard. so did i, but guess what. thats a good thing. Use the brain you have hidden away in that thicc skull of your's and you will be rewarded with something called ""dopamine"". Now belive it or not that makes you go IM GONNA COOOOM SO HARD (But without the cooming) But this is not the only reason why should play it. This was what kept me from playing any souls like for way to long. In short: the game is spectacular in every step of the way. There is always something to poke at/room for improvment, but i belive we humans wouln't be ready for such a thing happening. 10/10 Masterpiece"

Positive,"You cant go wrong with Dark Souls 3.It’s the most new-player/casual-gamer friendly Dark Souls title but still has a significantly high difficulty/Skill-ceiling combined with its DLCs. This was the game that really got the Dark Souls franchise rolling into Mainstream and for a good reason as well.Pros:- Fluid Combat and an amazing Magic system- Extremely memorable and Challenging Bossfights- Beautiful environmental Storytelling- A great set of new and returning Characters from previous games- The most active and polished PVP system in the trilogy- Patches the UnbreakableCons:- Very linear map layout- The first DLC is extremely short for its pricing- No Steam Point Shop itemsConclusion:If you don’t own it, buy it.If you haven’t played it, try it.If you die, try again.Nothing in life comes for free and being able to experience relief and freedom, you will have to undergo hardship and suffering. And the fact that so many people are willing to pay 60 bucks to do exactly that, shows that the game succeeds in what it’s trying to accomplish.It’s also just really funny to bonk mobs with a 2-meter wooden club."

Positive,"DARK SOULS 3 is a pretty good gamei have played elden ring sekiro and bloodborne prior to this and i still think they ae better than dark souls 3. The game itself is fluid with amazing boss battles and interesting characters, i was able to feel immersed in the story although it is confusing. I think this game can be recommended to poeple wanting something similar to elden ring and like the combat style. Some flaws in the game in my opinion is that it often feels very frustrating to get past bosses and the late game is really unfair, with even common enemies able to deal a ton of damage. it doesnt feel as strong as elden ring or bloodborne because some of its level design is really boring. The level design makes me feel very burned out and often i find myself feeling very done with the game.  I would consider this game to be an 8/10. EDIT SOONalright after doing 2 endings and both dlcs, my opinion has changed abit. This game's DLCs are really good and makes up for some of the boring areas in the main game like 2 of the starting areas, but near the end it is really good and the dlcs are memorable and add to the experience. 9/10, what a game!"
Positive,"This game is my favourite dark souls game. The main game is really good for a first time but if you are someone like me who replays it for achievements you realise how short it is (About 6 hours if you know what your doing). The DLC is what really made me like this game. The Ashes Of Ariandel was brilliant but my only complaints were there are only 2 bosses and it was about 3 hours in length. The Ringed City however was mind blowing. The NPC I summoned to help me with a few bosses was the final boss of this DLC and was trying to find something called ""The Dark Soul"" to paint a new world which links to an NPC in the Ashes Of Ariandel DLC. I don't regret playing this game for 60 hours. In fact I would play it even more if I found something else to do in it. 9/10 game. Now I am just waiting to get my hands on Elden Ring."
Positive,very gud very chip
Positive,is a very good game
Positive,This is one of the best games I've ever played. Has amazing graphics and a god-like soundtrack; not to mention one of the best main themes in gaming history. The bosses are all well made and fun to fight. 10/10 would definitely recommend.
Positive,"Dark souls 1 as Ultimate game of all time and Dark souls 3 as Ultimate fan service of all time, had so much fun,such a genius way to use nostalgia and break it! explain a theme of ur games by showing what will happen and there are so many things I can gush about."

Positive,great game best dark souls in my opinion

Positive,"this is the kind of a game in which you can easily spend more then 1K hours.its a bit hard and unfair sometimes like any soulsborne title but Hey, we all come here for that, right ?give it a try, you won't regret it"
Positive,Better than Dark Souls 2
Positive,One of the most satisfying games when you beat a boss
Positive,when the souls are dark

Positive,"Dont worry about it, You wont lose your soul to this game :)"
Positive,"Made me depressed, but good story highly recommend."
Positive,"A bittersweet experience, once a challenge is overcomed a euphoria like no other is invoked"
Positive,"My god. What an absolute masterpiece of a game. At first, it appears as though this is a PUBG style, bean pvp game. However, once you delve deep into the intricate lore of the beans and learn just how much severe PTSD and schizophrenia they endure on a daily basis, you then realize that this is not a game about fighting others. Its about the fight within. It's about the burning feeling of abandonment as you descend into a schizophrenic meltdown like the joker does after a talk show host is slightly rude to him. It's about harnessing the chaos within and doing everything in your might to contain it for the sake of all that is good and the safety of your loved ones. Or, perhaps you give in to the chaos and ascend to a new dimension of understanding. Perhaps you choose to lose the battle within, not because you knew you would lose, but because you wanted to. Perhaps you use the madness within you to exert the deepest of your wishes on these puny little beans, and kill them all. Starting with those you see hopelessly wandering the bean battlefield and then their wives, their children, their children's children, and so on through all eternity as you finally reach the final circle of hell as you realize you cannot go any further off the hinges.  You realize there is no new way you can invent to kill a man or his descendants, and then you break down in tears as you realize the meaninglessness of it all. All those deaths, the bloody mist of all those beans, are on your hands. But then you ask yourself, will it ever stop? Will the voices ever stop telling you to kill? Will the suffering ever cease? That I'm afraid I can't tell you. You must find out for yourself.Overall 10/10 game. Would definitely recommend!"
Positive,I fucking hate this game 10/10
Positive,dex > sex
Positive,honestly just embarrassing if you still haven't played dark souls in 2022

Positive,The souls formula has been refined
Positive,Ruined my life.
Positive,"When it clicks, it clicks."
Positive,dark souls is in fact the dark souls of dark souls
Positive,"I was stunned when I realized I never reviewed DARK SOULS III as it is my favorite FromSoftware game out of all of them. It's such a stark improvement from DS1 and 2 in so many ways! The combat is tuned to absolute perfection, every weapon and shield feels like it's its own beast and learning each one's intricate movesets is a joy to master. The game is stunning visually and contains my personal favorite location in the entire series. Each boss has so much love and passion poured into them and every single one has a different phase when erasing half of their health bar! I must admit that this was indeed my first Souls game, so there is definite bias there, but even after going back and playing them all including Bloodborne, there is no doubt in my mind that DS3 is Hidetaka Miyazaki's finest piece of work so far.The ELDEN RING hype is the highest it has ever been and I hope it's so good that it makes DS3 feel obsolete by comparison."
Positive,Hyped for elden ring squad

Positive,Still stuck on tutorial boss😑
Positive,"GOLDEN AESTHETIC!!! Yeah It's Very hard and you'll want to smash your PC into the inner core, but it's all worth it when you finally beat that boss you've been stuck on for 3 hours. If you can get past the difficulty struggle, then this game has so much to offer, and the class/power system is so nice. I think the difficulty really just adds to the overall aesthetic and feel of the game too, and the visuals look great. 100% recommend"
Positive,I finally beat Iudex Gundyr
Positive,I fucking hate Pontiff
Positive,Best one in the series. It's an absolute must-play.
Positive,died during the download
Positive,"Let not my humble 31 hours as of the time writing this review fool you, gamers. I have, in fact, put hundreds of musky, testosterone filled, manly hours into this game. Hundreds of hours that could easily translate into a number of, as they say 'yo biches, leaving your lack luster game library havin' ass for I, a dark souls enjoyer. Fret not though, I will bestow unto you clear virgins my knowledge that will explain why you should become a man and buy this right of passage piece of shite. Why buy dark souls 3? Well, while I certainly went above and beyond in my play through as a naturally born woman attractor, this game, for feeble little children like you, review reading casual, is undoubtedly, the most casual of the souls games out. While the halving of your health mechanic for dying and or etting cursed may've been but a mere myth to us more refined players and of hardly any issue should we have ppffft *died*, it was definitively ""bs"" as the casuals put it. A ""harder for no reason"" mechanic that was removed from this game. In fact, there's hardly really anything to so harshly hinder the riff raff of newer players in this game. The difficulty of the souls series is -HIGHLY- over exaggerated. I know, i know. ""but god gamer extraordinaire"" i hear you say. ""that's so easy to say for such a prime specimen like you."" to which I say, yes. However, I dare speak against the beta males insisting this game is anything more than a trial and error simulator meant to test the chromosome count of every one who plays it. Mine, of course, being amongst the higher counts with the fellow divine beings given gamer bodies.Is the game a challenge (for you?) most likely, yes. Is it filled with unforgiving one off jokes? yes. But I wouldn't call that hard. I'd call it conditioning. Don't rush, explore, take it in. Get invaded, die and get feces tossed in your mouth from his back pocket after he points down at you, quit, swear you'll never play again, play again.In all seriousness.Please, don't let your friends and redditors fool you into believing this game is an unforgiving nightmare. It's not nice, but it calls you cute. It let's you know you did good when you do good, yeah. It'll slam your funny bone into a door frame after a few minutes, but it isn't all bad.This game doesn't require you to play the last two or demon souls to understand it. Why? Because this game doesn't try to shove story down your throat. They have your money, they don't care about making you read their writing. You can invest your desire to know what is going on in dark souls to whatever level you want. Don't care, see a cool boss, want to learn all of the lore behind it. Watch a video explaining all the theories v=because this game confirms 15% of the lore it shows, watch another lore video, watch all of vatividya's videos, self diagnose yourself with dark souls lore expert. Why should you buy this game? No one who isn't trolling or is legally allowed to wield sporks should argue that dark souls 3 is the most casually inviting of the souls game. This game is the most linear of them all. 2 gives you like 4 different routes to take at the beginning, and 1's entire first impression relies on whether you feel like exploring a gaveyard with funny skeleton mens or hike up a big ass hill to armored zombies with crossbows. Guess which route is gonna devour your virginity?There are so few things you can do to really ""ruin"" your run through of the game. Maybe you miss a quest line, maybe you murder granny who promptly inflates the prices on your violent trigger happy ass, but that's hardly anything to being able to destroy your hub area by killing the fire keeper in ds1 and turn the game to walking simulator.The hardest part about this game is online but let me explain the absolute lack of actual issues there is with it.Yes, invaders do have the entire fleet of enemies on their side, but they also have a max of 7 healing estus to your 15, not only that, you have way of the blue which let's you just summon people who (might) know what they're doing because the invader existed in your general zip code for 2 and a half seconds. and if all else fails, if you are backed into the corner, if you see the light at the end of the tunnel, if you can only do two things before you fade to oblivion.ALT F4 and hit the quan.This game is beautiful and the people are fucking atrocious. I like pvp, you will too when you discover ganking and a straight sword. I think everyone deserves a souls game experience form start to finish. so if you're okay with a challenge, maybe some frustration through some gimmicky or just dumb placement of enemies and items, I really do suggest this game. It's very straight forward, mods can assist you if you're struggling (more on that below) and I believe this game hurts me in ways only it can and still make me crawl back. Dark souls isn't easy but it's not like everyone who beat it is a fat wang swanging deity.TLDRThis game is wonderful. It's hidden story, the world, its design of armor, weapons, and bosses and such. Don't let the congested rambling's of the most aids people in a surprisingly cool and friendly community convince you this game is a waste of 60$ if you're not a competitive e-sports legend. I'll list below some suggestions for anyone wanting to play who want's to just beat the game and experience the world it's inFirstly, build.I strongly suggest quality builds, an even split between Strength and dexterity build. It lets you mess with the majority of weapons in the game and you'll never really run into an issue where the boss hyper resists you because of fire or magic defense. First, however, please invest in health when you start. Your weapons wont really scale with your stats until later when they're upgraded and you have more points in the category. 30 should be a good health pool for awhile. as for starting class, knight or merc.Merc- Spam your left bumper attackKnight- spam right bumpertrustI would also suggest keeping tabs on the dark souls 3 wiki and using it to track -Undead bone shard-estus flask these raise the effectiveness and quantity of your healing. so yeah.If you want, https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/607this'll take you to a mod that provides a merchant that sells pretty much everything for a soul, including a soul of a champion which translates to a -lot- of souls. It's both handy for if you dont wanna farm souls to level up after losing a bunch and getting to skip farming armor so you can enjoy looking at your depressed lump of violent ash. If you dislike the idea of clicking my link, you're racist. You can also just look for ""Honest merchant"" mod on ""Nexus mods"" if you want. This mod is also handy for your inevitable toe dip or full dive into the pvp of the game where you'll be sad even when you win. I genuinely love this game and its world design, I think everyone should experience at least one souls game and 3 is the most welcoming to a new player base. Between an abundance of bad players, items and strats to make bad players annoying players, and the lack of just obnoxious mechanics found in the other games, I really think this should be what every player just wanting to try a souls game should start with. If you like this, I strongly recommend bloodborne.Anyways, hope to invade, violate, and toss feces at you soon <3"
Positive,Every souls has its dark
Positive,fart souls 3
Positive,"Phenomenal. This is a really great experience but you have to go in it with your mind open to the fact that you'll have to dedicate alot of time and effort to this game in order to progress, and its difficult to just breeze through it without somebody helping you every step of the way. You will not enjoy this if you rarely play and games but if you do often this will be no particular leap in difficulty."
Positive,"This game may take a while to get into but it has incredible things to offer if you're patient.I'd like to point out the amazing bosses first. They make Dark Souls 3 what it is for me. For example, the final boss has an incredibly huge arsenal of moves and many lethal combos that come along with a steep learning curve. But whenever you die, you can point out what you did wrong.A vivid environment, diverse NPCs and so many secrets everywhere give Dark Souls 3 a special touch I'm happy I didn't miss out on."
Positive,Praise the Sun!
Positive,jus dodge lol
Positive,"- Dark Souls III, despite being the third installment in the Souls' series of games, could honestly be said to be a carbon-copy of the first. Dark Souls III as a title is nothing new in terms of storytelling, as it is the same formula of your character being  'the chosen one'  destined to beat back the evils of the world and set back balance to it. The way that Dark Souls III does so however, is a far more interesting direction than initially presented. The world is dying and you are the consenquence of a failure, that, by all means, should never have happened. Without spoiling any of the major story-contents, Dark Souls III's story is nothing special by any means, but it makes up for it with having something that FromSoftware has always been great in, and that is its strong environmental storytelling, interesting characters, and lore that is easily left to the interpretation and imagination of the player.  Dark Souls III is, in hindsight, probably the easiest Dark Souls game to date. For anyone unfamiliar to the series and starting out with it, it can be a very hard and bumpy road, as the enemies are ruthless, and unrelenting in their strength and speed. The Bosses are once more, also a creative distinction from the many enemies in the game, and are one of the most unique parts of the game, both in gameplay and in lore. I will admit that the first time I played through the game I was completely lost, as the game moves you from one locale to another at such a rapid pace that I had very little to really try and maneuver what in the fuck was going on. There are stages that definitely drag on too long and overstay their welcome, especially in really shittily placed enemies and mobs, specifically the Cathedral of the Deep. But once you move past that, or beat the game like I did and tried it for a second game, there is so much creative vision packed into this game that it doesn't even know where to put it all. Miyazaki and his team created for what it's worth a fantastic title that stands as a monument to the success of their company. Had it taken a far bolder and more intriguing storyline, this could have easily been another classic, but asides from that is already quite a fantastic title."
Positive,this happened to a buddy of mine
Positive,fajna taka do pogrania

Positive,"This is still one of my favorite games i have over 1000+ hours on eggbox, doubt i'll ever get those on here sincei already did everything, except for  M  O  D  S.I truly recommend this game, it does have a learning curve but it is worth all the deaths you will go through.Pro tip: Don't die :)"
Positive,The soul do be dark
Positive,this is one of the games of all time
Positive,muito foda tomar hit enquanto rola pra um invasor chinês com 700 de ping
Positive,"fun but just doesnt have the same feeling as the original game. I do like the larger selection of weapons and all of the quality of life changes, but a decent bit of the areas in the game just feel so empty, in the sense where i just feel no emotion while being in them. Something that I liked in the original was how the map always wrapped back around itself, and you'd always be revisiting early game spots in order to progress when in the late game. This game just makes it so you explore, go through an area, fight 1-2 bosses, and you will never return, unless you want to progress some very specific npc questline. The game is fun no doubt and is admittedly a lot less janky than the original, but the map just lacks a lot of things. will definitely be finishing the game though."
Positive,"Originally bought this game for my Xbox One a few years ago - and I got all 100% achievements. I liked the game so much on Xbox that I bought it again for PC - and it's even better on PC! It performs way better (especially with 60 fps).The game is difficult, but it is worth the buy if you want a nice learning curve. Be patient with yourself.No one is good at anything when they're first trying something new.When compared to the earlier titles in the series - Dark Souls 3 stands out in my opinion as the magnum opus of the Dark Souls lore and core game-play. It's the smoothest and well thought out game in the series - it's sad that the series ends with it.If you're interested in achievements (like me) - expect at least 100 hours (unless you get carried)(It's okay to ask for help) No shame, check the forums. Finding the rings will kill you - Look up fextralife for guides.Fight hard and die well - give those invaders hell. And - make sure to kill the host if you're invading - it's quite fun.OoooOooooOOoOOooh Elden Ring.. How long must we wait for you to release?Lest we all go hollow whilst waiting."
Positive,Made me want to kill myself.10/10Would recommend.

Positive,An absolutely incredible gaming experience.

I WAS JUST CHILLING THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN I GET INVADED BY UrMomFatLOL AND THEN WHEN I ABSOLUTELY DEMOLISHED HIM MY PC GOT HACKED!!!What in the world guys, how did he manage to do that to me. Wait- NO NO N- HE IS HACKING THIS REVI- DADa)_FG adioa wdaw[dawf joapDjAWDP[k AWDKWAO_ DJWAODm,n joh nvm i just blacked out and hit my head on my keyboard :)"
Positive,"The gameplay is amazing, the online sucks though. The game is worth for the PvE, but the PvP isn't for everyone for it's delay, but with time it becomes like a part of the game. The DLC is also worth it, so just get the deluxe if you buy it."
Positive,"In this beautiful life there's always some sorrowAnd It's a double-edged knife, but there's always tomorrowOh, you knowIt's up to you now if you sink or swimJust keep the faith that your ship will come inIt's not so badAnd I say... R1 R1 R1 R1 R1"
Positive,"What a way to end one of the best series ever made. This took everything good about the previews installments in the series and made them even better. My only complaint is that unlike in the remastered version of the first game the controls are from an xbox controller instead of a keyboard even though the game is on pc, which was annoying since you don't know what button does what but you eventually get used to it. Although the world is not as interconnected as in the first game it's a lot more linear and therefore easier to follow. The bosses are way more memorable and harder than in the previous games, with each one having multiple phases, as well as an incredible soundtrack, making it that much more satisfying when you beat them. I would also like to mention that I loved how in this one the bonfires were actually close to the boss, taking away the boredom of having to walk for a while to the boss every time you die (which was a big waste of time). Yet another masterpiece of a game as well as my favorite in the series. Once you get caught on it becomes very addictive. It was an honor to play this, thanks for entertainment!"
Positive,I shit myself while playing this game.
Positive,I have spent 3 hours trying to make a good looking character just so i can put a helmet on and never see it10/10
Positive,"I got invaded, stun-locked, and then down pointed. 10/10"
Positive,Good game to relax after a hard work day. There is a lot of friendly npc who will help you to pass cheerful locations. Plot is very hopeful and makes you feel happy. Good game!!!!
Positive,All of my friends hate me for playing this game
Positive,Invasion is hard? Git gud. 10 / 10
Positive,Hard game but its fun in this game its actually kinda fun dying (except for when you die cuz the camera.) Imo the graphics look pretty good and the gameplay is really fun but online the hitboxes can be a bit wierd. bosses are fun and make you feel like a pro when you kill them. So if you wanna be/feel like an epic gamer this game is wonderful for that. a big recommend from me. :)
Positive,big fun if you hate yourself
Positive,Don't get hollow u idiot
Positive,I died to the first mid-boss at least 20 times.Thanks Dark Souls.
Positive,it is good
Positive,pain but in a good way
Positive,irf wnat depresiona yes
Positive,Fun but I also hate it
Positive,not the most difficult in the series but still tough and even better gameplay

Positive,"THIS GAME ALONG WITH EVERYGAME IN THE SERIES REQUIRES A LOT OF PATIENCE. My first game to start the series, said to be the easier of the 3 DarkSouls game and diving in i felt on top of the world completing the first tutorial boss without dying once through the run. Now however, im finding myself navigating through dangerous and dark winding paths unknowing to what lies ahead... as i get angry from the repeated deaths and attempt to take a break, i consistently dwell on the boss or foe i have waiting before me.. yearning to extinguish my flame once more.. tread carefully and choose your foes wisely.. may exploring lead to shortcuts and bountiful loot... or certain death."
Positive,"One of the best games i have ever played. Dark souls 3 is one of the best game of the franchise. Honestly i couldn't stop searching for the lore of the bosses every second till i finished the game. It starts relatively easy but as you progress it shows how brutally difficult it actually is. Places are gorgeous and each of them have their own vibe. Weapon variety is much better than the earlier games and boss designs are amazing. As soon as i started this game i couldn't focus on another game until i finished it. It gets really cheap on a sale and as a bundle. I would recommend buying all the dark souls games, all of them are masterpieces."
Positive,the game is great and all...but i belive it's way more fun when my character doesn't decide to walk off a bridge and kill himself.
Positive,I didn't know a bonfire could look so beautiful
Positive,Best visual novel ever.
Positive,This is my first dark souls experience and its strange to start from the 3rd game but i just love it !
Positive,"Just brilliant. If you disagree, get good"
Positive,"I died. I mean a lot! inside and outside of the game. Every bloody moment i wasn't playing the game, i was thinking how i could defeat the next boss, and once i defeated the game it was the greatest feeling. so, yeah I would say it's worth playingGood luck to anyone who tries to tame this beast of a game."
Positive,"After 200 hours, I've finished the game 3 times. In those three playthroughts I haven't finished most of the NPC's quests, I missed a lot of secrets and learned a lot from playing this game. If you are looking for a game that will take up a lot of your time, then Dark Souls 3 or any of the other Dark Souls games are the games for you, It's hard yes, but you learn to cope with it and push through the pain. Dark Souls is worth the money in my opinion, and if you are cheap like I am, wait for a special. The money you spend on this game is well worth it. Good luck and be safe, wouldn't want you to go hollow."
Positive,"For those of you that just want a run down of how it plays before buying: Its much faster paced than the earlier titles and feels closer to a Bloodborne reskin than the previous souls games. Armor helps in bits but I can only personally tell when wearing some of the heavier sets.Weapons are much more varied but the more unique magical weapons seem to be getting the short end of the stick with higher elemental resistances in enemies along the board and poor calculations for split damage types.Magic itself is still strong, but it takes a while to unlock most of the spells and less of them are found in the world at large. I know parrying is strong but they changed the window for it yet again so even if you can do it well in 1 and 2 don't assume it'll play nicely this time.And for those who are new to the series:I still think that the first game is an easier barrier for entry so go back and do that first.And if not then Endurance is your friend, blocking, rolling, attacking, picking your nose, everything needs it so always have lots.All in all, probably one of my favorite games, but still has some balancing to be desired.And as always, try to engage in some jolly cooperation for a better experience."
Positive,"Oh boooy, where do I start. I am beyond disappointed I started playing this game as late into my life as i did. Dark souls 3 has changed me for video game expectations. I will spend a whole night gaming just running around trying to find secrets/weapons/bosses/items/locations/  anything that little wild dark fantasy mind of yours wants is what dark souls is handing out. Like what the actual F*** never have i been more mad at a game not because of toxic community reasons but because holy s*** everything just wants to rip your head off and Ronaldinho kick that out of the world. You want a game that you can sink a sad amount of time into and tell your friends you ""have plans tonight"" just so you can go home and suffer dying over and over and over again <3 what a world we live in."

Positive,"It's alright, I guess."
Positive,"Never have i ever poured this much time in a single player game. I've been playing games since i was a 6 and i am now 16, during my childhood any single player game that i beat i would just toss it away never to be played again. But this game just swallowed me. this is one of the games were i just wouldn't stop playing and to this day i might just play it again. if your thinking of buying this game just know that your in for a hell of a ride."
Positive,first you'll hate how hard it is but at the end you'll still hate it 10/10 great game love it
Positive,bloodborne on pc pls
Positive,Do you like crying? If so then you should play this game.
Positive,GOOD GAME BRUUUUUHHHH
Positive,It's hard because each boss deserves more than one try.
Positive,"By far the best souls game. The mechanics are amazing compared to dark souls 1 and 2. great bosses, boss design improved from the past installment and most of bosses are amazing. new game+ is fun and adds some content and it was very fun and challanging to beat new game+ 7(which is the highest new game+ to change something, everything above 7 stays the same)Highly recommended!"
Positive,"Very good game, great challenge and fun."
Positive,I've got 40 hours on this game so far and it makes me want question my sanity. I love it. If u like a challenge this game is definitely for you. The satisfaction after beating a boss is better than a blowjob.
Positive,you die 900+
Positive,just step in the right directionsthis game to ez
Positive,G O A T G O A TG O A T
Positive,"Don't be afraid of Dark Souls! It's not as difficult as the legends suggest. In fact, it's really not any harder than the average game, and for any bits you struggle with you can 'summon' other real players to join in and help out, including boss fights, which can make progress almost trivial sometimes.It's just hard enough to give a sense of accomplishment, and while the enemy placement can be purposefully challenging, the fact that they're always in the same spot, or following the same route, means that if you fail you can try different tactics until you beat them. Or, level up and head back when you're stronger."
Positive,"I lost my humanity, so it did a pretty good job"
Positive,"Amazing chest ahead, therefore try two handing and Praise the Sun!"
Positive,Extremely frustrating at times yet so addictive to keep dying. Had tons of fun.

Positive,"In Japan, game developer. Number one. Steady hand. One day, Yakuza boss need new game. I do game. But, mistake! Yakuza don't like Dark Souls 2! Yakuza very mad. I hide in fishing boat, come to America. No english, no food, no money. Darryl give me job. Now I have house, American car, and new woman. Darryl save life. My big secret: I did Dark Souls 2 on purpose. I good developer. The best!"
Positive,PRAISE THE SUN!!!
Positive,"Between PS4 and PC I have about 4500 hours playing the darksouls series. Once you get the hang of the mechanics it's a very fun game, but learning can be hard. Stick with it and this game can last ages."
Positive,"The game and also all the two DLCs are amazing. Don't buy it without DLC, it will add very beautiful scenarios, with very nice bosses, amazing new weapons andddd the DLCs buying alone is way more expensive then buying without the base game. As the others dark souls, this game keeps the essence of learning by correcting your mistakes again and again and again until you master it. Another thing is: you will need a lot of patience. Don't try to rush and/or make the things quickly because you are out of patience. Instead, give it a break, take some time and come back to the game another time. You will see that in many cases you will be able to do that ""impossible thing"" with only one or two attempts after the break (or maybe not =P). IF you are really stuck, then you can try summoning someone to help you in some part of the game.Another tip is: try to find a character build on the internet that fits to you.I've played as a hybrid of swordman/pyromancer. It gave me the possibility of killing mobs in close combat with my Onyx Blade and also a very powerful attack with fireballs.And one last tip: this game does not have an auto save on the cloud. Be sure to save it manually on google drive or something like that before you format your pc or something like that. The save file location is: C:\Users\YourUser/Appdata(hidden)/Roaming/DarkSoulsIII"

Positive,"Still at first boss, best game ever played."
Positive,"I´ve played through this game several times now and each time I find something new to love about it, the combat is the best its ever been in a souls game and the difficulty isn´t as crushing as its predecesors, which makes it a good first souls game to play. The level design, score, lore and asthetics of the game keep you going and will immerse into the world of the game in a way no other game does. And once you reach the end credits There´s no doubt you´ll go searching for more of this genre."
Positive,I Got Gud
Positive,"If you liked the first game, then you will, without a doubt, enjoy this one. It has plenty to offer in terms of lore, game play, and fun."

Positive,"Never thought DS was for me, until I tried it.9/10"
Positive,"Great game. Seems hard and will cause anger on first run, but after that its a very enjoyable experience. Definitely worth the money, you will get lots of replayability out of it as one run won't give you near the full experience"
Positive,"Ok as a souls game fan for several years finally i am gonna write a review about this, which is gonna be obviously long as i am gonna talk about the entire franchise So for TL:DR users lets just be honest this game is challenging but very depressing at the same time lmao, like it gives you even more pressure than you already have, but jokes aside, this like MUST play games for any of em out there because its a different experience from other games 10/10 would recommend to anyone who has some chill xD So lets start from DARK SOULS 1 for me personally that game was ONE BIG GIGANTIC CHALLENGE as i was very new to this type of game like its totally different mechanics, i am that kinda person who rush my gameplay on RPG, and face several enemies at once, but this gosh dammit facing one enemy is hard enough, one careless move and BAM 'YOU DIED' gotta say i even broke my controller once, on this i mean yes its very tempting, but apart from that i started to love the game and its uniqueness, yes gotta admit i hated it in the start, as i couldn't play it well, but i learned how to play after several times ""START NEW GAME"" and then once i got leveled a bit everything was more fair than getting killed by FOUL MINION, so i would just say this game has a dark theme, very different mechanism from the rest so i give10/10 you all should give it a try SO LETS GO TO DARK SOULS 2 in dark souls 2 its all traps, not tough or intelligent enemies, its all FORCED TRAPS, like the devs wants you to die on different locations, LIKE BRUH NOBODY WOULD SAW THIS COMING WHEN YOU GET TRAPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE WAY UP THERE TO GET AN ITEM and BAM YOU GET SURROUNDED BY ENEMIES, like wtf? i had no estus flask that time bruh, so yes i died MORE THAN I DID in dark souls 1, and the more annoying PART in dark souls IS WHEN YOU LOOSE A TONS OF SOULS BY DYING WITHOUT RETRIEVING. it HAPPENED A LOT ON THIS ONE but as i said it has its charm, and dark souls 2 isn't unique as dark souls 1 as i got used to the gameplay, but the bosses are splendid, thats the beauty of dark souls "" THE BOSSES"" would give 9/10Brilliant game but lots of cheap tricks to get you dieSO TO DARK SOULS 3More traps and More annoying enemies lmao and also ENEMIES CAN EVEN DODGE yo arrows, i mean when did enemies got that smart? like even a dragon dodge my ONISLAYER ARROW, do you have any idea how costly that is? stupid dragons anyways jokes aside, really loved that game man, i mean the game was fair to the least as people had experience from the previous parts, and also BOSSES ARE MASSIVELY unique and tough and there are two bosses which was the hardest, but i dont wanna spoil em for ya, so lets just say9.5/10 would recommendConclusion : massive, unique, irreplaceable gaming experience, you would feel you achieved something when you finish itthank you for reading"
Positive,"Great game. Not the masterpiece Dark Souls 1 was, but certainly better than DS2. DLCs are good too. When you finish it, play Item Randomizer mod for extra replaybility (in offline mode, just in case).Edit: Cinders mod is great too, and it's becoming more and more interesting. The Convergence 2.0 is even better."
Positive,"Really fun game until you get invaded by people from different countries and the lag makes it unplayable. Playing co-op is cool but annoying it only progresses one persons game if you try play it with a friend the entire time, and doesn't help if they block you on ladders and take elevators without you, You know who you are.."
Positive,"Dark souls 3.. Played on both consoles and PC, one thing I want to say is playing with mouse and keyboard is not recommended, because PC version control is not converted nor its optimized for mouse and keyboard.Now for the game itself: this series is known for its difficulties, therefore took me awhile to beat the game, some bosses can be really boring such as yhorm the giant, you can only deal significant amount of damage to him by using Storm Ruler (A sword you can pick up near his throne). Combat is awful like other soul games, i hope they can make some tweaks on their next Souls game, because the combat is cluncky and unsatisfying, their latest game Sekiro does a good job of combat, so i have faith in them. Other than combat, i have no complain about the game, 8/10"
Positive,"Dark Souls III is the Skyrim of souls games.Technically speaking, it’s without a doubt the most fun to play.Yet, it kind of lacks soul (pun intended hehe) as it feels like a rehash of the first Dark Souls, but with Bloodborne’s combat system and aesthetics.There are also no differences in NG+ but this is still okay since it's literally the same (but harder) game.In fact, even tho I just made a few criticisms, this game is FECKING AMAZING and the Ringed City DLC is the P-E-R-F-E-C-T ending to this epic saga.Final verdict:9/10 on NG; 9/10 on NG+;"
Positive,"the game is so good, i cant stop playing it"
Positive,This Game is awesome just check out Syco77s review !!
Positive,I bought the game in 2017 but didn't finish it until 2024. It took me seven years to muster the courage to complete the game. Now it's Nashandra and Gwyn's turn. This will be my path to salvation.
Positive,"There is little to be said about Dark Souls 3 that hasn't already been said, so I just want to use this review to say that the Aquamarine Dagger is sick as fuck"
Positive,Go to death to win... Over and over... That's how it all started... This is where it ends...
Positive,A game all about learning from your mistakes and improving your self so that you can overcome those obstacles.

Positive,den håller sanningen
Positive,ez game didn't die lmao
Positive,DS3 is by far the best in PVP terms and mechanics compared to previous installments of the game.However it is a lot more linear than DS1 and 2 which I think is a step back from the Metroidvania map design from DS1 for example.Graphics and overall flow of the game is faster paced and just feels smoother than previous games.Dark Souls series is a must play but it is not for the weak hearted players! :)
Positive,"great game, better than 2 for sure. recommend grabbing a friend though, it'll make things a bit easier."
Positive,My favourite game of all time! I still go online from time to time and just help other people out. It's an awesome game with a lot of replay value.
Positive,10/10 favorite Dark Souls game so far. Although I still haven't played the first one
Positive,"At first, I hated this game.Then I shelved it for about a year. During that time, every now and then, I'd look up Dark Souls 3 videos on YouTube, and my little bro gave me some build tips.I started a new character and beat the game. It BLEW my MIND. It's now one of my favorite games.Dumped all points in strength, vitality, and vigor. Got Butcher Knife early in game.Hesitation is defeat. The game favors courage."
Positive,"This game is my new favorite game. And from what I have heard from my friends, is that it is also the best game in the series. It has great physics that require you to dodge left to right. And even after you finish a certain portion there are still more areas in that portion to explore. And it is very challenging and fun. And it is also fun to play with friends. But you can't just connect like most games. In this game one player has to have an ember and activate it. Then the other player has to have a summon symbol to place down. Then you both enter a password and have the same settings. And the player with the ember uses the summon sign to summon their friend who then comes up as a phantom. So it is a great game and I highly suggest it.But it is a little expensive"
Positive,"I used to be a Dark Souls 2 Veteran from Xbox 360 a long time ago when i was 13 years old. I never thought i would come back to the Dark Souls Franchise but until i saw Youtube video's on Dark souls 3 and just by looking at this gameplay, it looks really fun. I had to wait a long time to play this game because life's hard without money you know? But Thanks to a close Friend of mine who bought this game as a gift for me, Played Dark Souls 3 for the first time. Let's just say i love it / addicted and i also hate it because i'm constantly dying and losing a Ridiculous amount of souls. Really after dying to all this Monstrosity in the game, in the end it's very rewarding. I would personally give this game a 10/10 and I would love to recommend this game to others."
Positive,"Great game. Upsetting how it shoves you into doing new game pluses (I'm on ng+++++ on my main character), but never loses what makes it enjoyable. I liked it so much, I got both DLCs, which I recommend you get if you want more from this game."
Positive,"After playing many hours of this game I can say I personally love it. Despite the fact that I personally consider this game to be the worst of the Dark Souls series. That isn't to say I don't like it and this is of course my own opinion. This game is clearly designed by the developers to be as close to the original Dark Souls as it can without perfectly mimicking it.   That fact aside this game is gorgeous. The scenery still astounds me to this day and one can definitely not deny how much love the developers put into not only the play area, but the areas both out of bounds and in skyboxes. It's always fun to grab my binoculars and slowly explore through each region, paying attention to every small detail as I go and discovering something new that I had never before seen in all my time playing.   The gameplay is challenging and fun. I remember when I first played through this game and I encountered the first boss for the first ever time. I remember not struggling as much as I had thought I would, although admittedly I had watched a multitude of videos on the game previously. I remember getting lost at the High Wall of Lothric purely because I was too scared to proceed in case I lost all of my souls. I eventually played through the whole game with a full squad of four friends and I bought the DLC and completed that with them too. I remember how much fun I had doing that and how much I still wish that it had never ended.   The combat is tight and plays well. It is complex and strategic. Each battle can play differently than the next and everyone's combat is different and unique based on their play style. It requires careful thinking and well-timed dodging and keeps the player on their toes. Despite the Souls games being commonly viewed as rage inducing games, they play very well and can be very enjoyable if you take the time to play them and go in with an open mind.   I truly value this series as one of my most favourite game franchises of all time and it doesn’t look like this is going to change any time soon. Thanks for all the great times From Software, keep them coming."
Positive,"dark souls 3 was my first game into the souls series and let me tell you, this was one hell of a journey. the game is definitely hard without a doubt, but with enough time and focus you can overcome just about anything, and that's what i love about this game. for me personally i played very passively, took my time and grabbed items, and this game took me around a month and a half to 100% complete the base game and both dlcs with about 224 deaths in my play through. i highly recommend this and it is absolutely worth the full price, consider it only a bonus if you pick it up on sale."
Positive,Challenging in the beginning but fun as heck once you git gud
Positive,"Totally worth the 22€ i payed on g2a, although its hella cheap with dlc now10/10 i would die again."

One sword, that's the only thing I needed to destroy this game !!!!Maaaaaaan that was so hard but I totaly loved it.This is one of the most challenging game ever ! Thanks for this incredible adventure, that was something.10/10The naked man."
Positive,+ Addictive+ Fun+ Nice Graphics- havent seen friends or family in days
Positive,I guess it's okay
Positive,Harder than dark souls 3.  (?)
Positive,"I could not get more than a few hours into Dark Souls I or II. I am inferior to the remainder of the human race. Dark Souls III is one of the absolutely best games ever, It doesnt tell you that though, you have to figure that out for yourself. 10/10 100%"
Positive,"Very difficult, but very rewardng when you are able to pull off a particularly challenging situation. Be ready to work through a lot of frustration to get your rewards though."
Positive,I am going to California
Positive,"I have not played the first Dark Souls.I played Dark Souls 2 for like 60 hours or so, got halfway through NG+ and stopped playing.This game is heavily addicting, if you enjoy hard games, or games that take a while to get used to, then you will love this, it is a challenge, it will make you rage, but it's worth it. The amount of lore and complexity behind the NPC's is outstanding, there are so many callbacks to things from their previous games, even though I haven't played the first tone I have seen plenty of videos to know about all the bosses and lore. I plan on doing so many playthroughs of this game, as I am currently on my second one and am getting 100% on it so I can blitz the game over and over after, it's so good, and I would recommend it in a heartbeat, get it, you won't regret it, or you will and then come back and get good so you won't regret it."
Positive,"Geme is simply great. From pve to pvp. I like the fast paced combat and ability to spank ganks likenever before :3. The only thing i miss from previous games is the feeling of unease when walking to new location or some ""exotic"" weapons which are a bit lacking here. Also this is the most straightforward game in whole series. Every mechanic is pretty easy to comprahend which also takes away that feeling of discovery from previous installments. All in all despite Collision detection still being a bitch sometimes and servers not always keeping up with the action this is the third best game in souls series FAR better than ds2 and quite close to ds1 and D'sS. I recomend for everybody especially new players. Git Gud and praise the sun. :3"
Positive,"Amazing game, but incomplete without DLC, wait for sale to buy.Will die again 10/10."

Positive,dark souls best game im a fanboi yeet 20/10
Positive,"„Dark Souls 3” is (as the name suggests) the fourth game in From Software’s „Souls” game franchise. It’s an action RPG game published by Bandai Namco on 24 of March in 2016. The game’s marketing implies that it’s really hard, and only for „real men”, but it’s that really the case? That’s what i’m going to find out here.The Gameplay.The gameplay of DS3 is pretty much the main thing that scares most people, while in the same time attracting more of them. Why is that? Well, as I wrote before, the game seems to be really hard at first glance; attack animations are really slow compared to other games, all of the enemies are at least twice as big as you, and the first boss in the middle of the fight transforms from an armored guy to a giant demonic serpent. All of it’s purely designed to make you feel hopeless, and when you actually conquer the challenge, you feel like you’ve just did the impossible. Most of the bosses and enemies aren’t really that challenging, you just need to memorize most of the attacks, and have at least decent reflexes. The most brilliant thing about this is, that the game likes playing with you in boss battles. For example in most games an enemy would attack you twice, maybe throw in there a suprise sweeping attack, and then stop allowing you to beat him. However, in Dark Souls, a boss would strike two times, then follow it up with a sweeping attack, and when you think you have an opportunity to kill him, he’ll hit hit you with his elbow, or kick you. It creates really tense fights, where you have to expect everything, and dance through like a master swordsman (or swordswoman). But, of course you know that the game isn’t only made of boss fights. For me the real Dark Souls experience comes from exploring the the various environments we encouter in the game. They are great, not only are they visually appealing, but you have to be constantly cautious of your surroundings, avoiding the traps (there’s a lot of them), and killing lots of enemies ranging from a normal zombie-like guy, to a abomination made from thousands of human hands and a woman’s deformed head in the middle. That’s what I love about From Software’s games, you’re not just exploring common dungeons with a straight path leading to the end. No, you’re trying to survive in a crumbling underground city filled with abominations placed on every corner to suprise you, and just barely making it through them just to realize that you’ve been killed by a rock falling from the ceiling. Add to it that some chests can eat you, random players can invade your world to kill you, and you have one of the best designed games since the last From Software’s game.The PlotDark Souls 3’s story is one of the most convoluted stories I’ve ever had pleasure of experiencing. The only thing you’re straightly told is, that you’re a some kind of undead who has been raised to kill 4 Lords of Cinder (whomever they are), and throw yourself into a special bonfire to prolong the „Age of Fire”. It sounds confusing doesn’t it? Well, if someone’s really interested, they can uncover all the lore from talking with various characters inhabiting the world, reading item descriptions, or just looking carefully enough at the environment. In conclusion, the story is hidden enough fo you to miss it when you’re not interested, but interesing, and original enough to be speculated by hundreds of thousands of people across the world.The ConclusionI think Dark Souls 3 is one of the best games I’ve ever played. It’s ingeniously designed, difficult enough for you to actually pay attention while you’re playing, and fun enough to keep you interested even in the weaker moments of the game. The only bad things about it I could find are mostly related to the balance of some particular weapons in multiplayer, but they’re just minor things compared to the rest of the game. In the age of video games becoming much easier, and centered only about making as much money with low effort put in, it’s really good to see a high demand on a game such as this; a game that’s original, challenging, masterfully designed, and just fun."
Positive,I love the hell out of this game. This game won't love you back as much though.
Positive,Got past the tutorial boss. Game seems fun but idk
Positive,"Thank you for invading my world, 'One Nut Man'."
Positive,"One of the best Games ever made.You can play it more than a thousand Times. And still learn stuff.They Story is great, Gameplay is awesome, World to explore is amazing.Boss-battles are briliant. It's more than a good Game. It's Art."
Positive,"BEST GAME EVER!Dark Souls 3 was always about hard and challenging fightinhg till the end, and that's what this game does on the highest level.+PVP is alive, up to 6 players in 1 world.+Challenging bossfights.+Good Lore.Only minus is that there is to many bonfires in some locations, but new players won't complain about this :)"
Positive,"This spot marks our grave. But you may rest here too, if you like"
Positive,Hard as balllls
Positive,cant stop shooting ropes to this
Positive,"Feel boring?Tired of real life?Games being too ez for you?Want some challenge?Wanna f*ck yourself?Dark Souls 3 will be your best choice !!! :DIf this is your first soul game, buy a controller, don't be me, finish the entire game using keyboard and mouse. I doesn't mean that keyboard and mouse are sucks but this game is designed for controller, having a controller will enhance your gaming experience, but I just don't like controller lol.If this is your first soul game, you might be me, f*ck by boss so hard until you feel like regreting buying this game. Please don't give up, after you get used to it, you will ask for more. :)Each of the boss fight is unique, I like that all the bosses have second phase, and everytime it gives me a feels like ""Aha! You're dead!"" become ""Aha! I'm dead....."". But still, fighting a badass sh*t is so f*cking cool, each time you defeated the boss will give you a sense of achievement and motivates you to continue your journey.Overall - 10/10One of the best rpg game I've ever play, never get tired of the thrilling combat and super challenging gameplay."
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 combines the best of exploration/adventure with non-stop action. What sets this apart from the previous titles of the series is the polish in both gameplay and difficulty. The game feels just hard enough to keep you engaged into its own rhythm, but also not too easy for you to breeze past. The original Dark Souls stands in stark contrast with its unrelenting difficulty. Dying in the original Dark Souls felt like it was the fault of the game's design, where trial and error was the only recipe for success. What Dark Souls 3 does well is that doesn't hit you with a boulder from behind for you to anticipate the second time. You can actually see the boulder coming, and it's up to you to avoid it the first time. The exploration and attention to detail is what will keep the player coming back for more. The story is ambiguous and a lot of detail is left open for the player's own interpretation of certain events. Exploration is heavily rewarded with not only items, but also a better understanding of the game's world. Multiple playthrough is encouraged to fully complete the game, and the different character customisations makes even running through the same areas just as fun as the first time."

Positive,"Really fun game that allows a variety of play styles, with either being a solo badass, or a co-op party just to have fun slaying beasts! Highly recommended"
Positive,give me bloodborne
Positive,This is the bad place.
Positive,"Easily one of my favourite games! ♥The soundtrack is phenomenal, Yuka Kitamura did an amazing job with it. x:"
Positive,10/10just get ready to git gud
Positive,A very well developed game with some amazing combat and mutiplayer systemp/s:It's a very difficult game (recommend for sum pro player out there)
Positive,Almost as hard as Crash Bandicoot
Positive,"Honestly this is the one of the best, if not the best game I have ever played. This was my first dark souls game ever and I loved it. Everything is great the visuals, soundtrack, bosses the content, I could go on about how great this game really is. Playing this game just instantly made me a fan of the whole series and a fan of the company that put this together. I have played every dark souls game and I recommend all of them as much as I do with this one. But this one was special with me since it was my first one to play. There were so many good times with the game. It's sad I can't enjoy the game as much since I have played so much but I try to have a lot of fun. Of course the difficulty is brutal but that is what it should be and trust me you will have fond memories about running to the boss gate for the 1000th time. Dark Souls is now my favorite video game series thanks to this game and has made me a big ass nerd-fan about this game.  Do I recommend this game? Yes I do."
Positive,GIT GUD AND PRAISE THE SUN!
Positive,Everything is faster and angrier than in Dark Souls 2 sotfs but its a great game overall10/10 would have gigantic beach umbrella shot at them in anor londo again
Positive,"Just perfect!Amazing graphics, optimized controlling, various movesets, tons of build options, epic storyline, and even if you think you know everything it still can show you something new.""Time for git gud, therefore praise the sun."""
Positive,"Could this be a soup?,Let there be soupLet there be victoryand then may the flames guide theevisions of love...only try soupTime for victorytherefore praise the soup!Greets for people that reads my soup messages"
Positive,"I hate this game so very much. So so  VERY  much. Easily one of the best games I have ever played.This being my first game in the Souls series, I knew I was in for a challenge but saw it on sale a few months back and though f*ck it. No regrets to this day and am now in the process of going through this masterpiece for the fifth time. From the first boss to the last (with a few hiccups along the way admittedly, namely  Deacons of the Deep  and  Ancient Wyvern ), I felt challenged beyond any game I'd played before and rewarded with some of the best visually designed unique weaponry throughout gaming. I also am amazed at the sheer diversity you are allowed thougout the game. Just a few basic examples would be a simple strength build, full of large but hard-hitting swords and axes; dexterity build with plenty of rapid slashing curved swords and daggers; pyromancer, with a surprisingly diverse arsenal ranging from your standard 'fireball' to 'sacred flame' which involves grabbing an opponent and releasing a large explosion within their chest and of course, sorcerer, with a huge range of unique spells to tackle any foe from range.I cannot recommend this game more to someone looking for an amazingly designed challenge and who didn't want their controller in one piece anyway."
Positive,"Souls borne games are an acquired taste and Dark souls 3 is a great entry point. The combat seems difficult at first but when you get into it you'll quickly see that it is more puneshing than difficult. It rewards methodical acting over button mashing. After you got into it you rearly feel like you died because of bad luck instead every death is a result of a mistake.The world is absolutely beautiful in a dark fantasy sort of way! People growing into trees and disgusting slime creatures that used to be human in a beautiful gothic castle litt by a setting sun.The story seems bare thread at first glance but quickly becomes very deep if you even slightly look for it. Defeat the bad guys and safe the world quickly becomes an exploration of all the characters you meet, their factions and the world itself.After the initial shock of ""dark souls games are to hard and stupid"" the series quickly become one of my favorites of all time!!!! (ds 2 is trash through ;P)"
Positive,This game made me consider a lobotomy so i can replay it again without knowing anything and experiencing the emotional rollercoaster once again
Positive,Still enjoying this game after all this time
Positive,"The eternal nightmare, play this game expecting to get some rage moments, but if you have a friend playing with you it all can be better"
Positive,Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.
Positive,"An amazing ""difficult but fair"" game.Every boss and strong enemy defeated fills you with a sense of pride and accomplishment. When you beat the game, you'll feel like you climbed a mountain and will want to start over again with knowledge of previous runs to completely dominate parts where you had a hard time.I have to assure that this type of game isnt for everyone, but damn if I'm not certain that you should give it a try."
Positive,I just gonna say this: i'm very very sorry I took this long to buy this game...online multiplayer is still good but oh boy it should've been so good at release date
Positive,Without a doubt one of the best action RPGs of our decade.Must-play10/10.
Positive,Pisses me the fuk off
Positive,First time play ------>  I want to sell this gameNow ------> I want to play all serie soul game

Positive,"The original game is absolutely f*cking amazing. The DLC's however, pretty dog sh!t."
Positive,Best game ever made .
Positive,It's not Bloodborne on PC but I'll take it.
Positive,"Amazing game, beautiful visuals, lore deeper than any game I've ever even heard of, challenging bosses and enemies and overall a f*cking great game. 10/10The only problem I encountered was without a controller backstabs and kicks were very inconsistant so I would heavily recommened a controller but it is not required.Also invasions are a pain early game so I would recommend playing in offline mode until you feel confident enough with the combat mechanics to take on other players."
Positive,"This game is beautiful. Everything from the graphics to the secretly crafted storylines left me falling in love with this game over and over again. Recommended for players who can dedicate time, patience, and skill."
Positive,Got killed by a nake man with a katana I was wearing knight setGot madAfter some tries we both fell off a cliffStrength and Dex are nothing to gravity 10/10 MASON APPROVED
Positive,"Chill, relaxing game - 10/10"
Positive,It'll definitely improve your overall gaming skills.
Positive,"A wonderful addicting game for us gamers who like challenges although some may rage from losing souls upon death the game is certainly one I would strongly reccomend to anyone who loves difficult games, dark fantasy games or simply someone who loves beautiful graphics and can endure the game to see just how fun it is. Trust me, you'll be addicted to this game forever...."
Positive,"I'll be honest and say I've never completed any Dark Souls title.To put that into perspective, I have a total of 414 hours put into the Dark Souls trilogy, and I don't intend to stop. Dark Souls has a little of something for everyone - Visceral, action-oriented combat is just the bread and butter. There's online play, which can be both jovial intrusion or terrifying invasion. There's the joy of building a 'perfect' character, only for it to be batted away like a fly by a boss, or the self-imposed challenge of making it through every area without using any bonfires. There's nigh-impenetrable lore that's been layered up over the trilogy and is an absolute joy to pick apart, and there's just enough drip-fed to keep you interested - you might seek out a boss' armour or weapon to get some more tidbits about who they were before the events of the game, or you might stumble upon a character from a previous game's gear and find out how they met their demise. The Dark Souls franchise is often noted for its difficulty, but I feel this is incorrect. It's certainly tough at times, but it's not inherently hard, as most challenges can be overcome through simply throwing more time and effort at it - can't beat a boss? You can grind more levels to either get more damage output, HP, or even boost your stats to allow you to use a different weapon which is more suited to the enemy, or you could instead use those souls to purchase different equipment, perhaps you get Embers to increase your maximum HP and allow you to summon allies, or perhaps you get some Lightning Pine Resin, so that you can add the boss' elemental weakness to your weapon, dealing more damage. Perhaps you just get a different shield, one that's stronger against the element the boss happens to be using. No matter what it is, you can always tackle things in a manner that minimises difficulty, and that's what people who say Dark Souls is ""hard"" don't think to do. Of course, there's a certain degree of difficulty and mechanical mastery called for, and unfortunately the first boss in the game presents himself as a sort of gatekeeper, as you CANNOT level up or change your equipment AT ALL until proving yourself to him, and this often creates a bit of a misunderstanding in players. Regardless, for the most part - especially concerning the 'core' areas/bosses (that is to say, excluding optional areas/bosses that were intended to be a challenge and nothing more) - the game is very fair and allows you the opportunity to scale the 'difficulty setting' as you wish. Overall I consider Dark Souls III - and indeed, the entire Dark Souls franchise (yes, even Dark Souls II, as much as some dislike it) to be a wonderfully-entertaining ride that's always fun to come back to - either to give the game a shot from a different build, or to simply muster up the courage to continue and avoid becoming Hollow."
Positive,"Killed by tutorial boss a dozen times...Anxiety creeps when you reach a new area...Generous online players that help your enemies beat you to death...Proud and happy for finally beating a boss on the first try... then gasp in horror when the same boss comes back alive... in much stronger versionYep, I will definitely play this game again"
Positive,"I'd say this is better story wise and gameplay wise than DS2, however it is lacking in the PvP department due to lack of balancing and extreme lag that occurs more often than not. I love the game, however it lacks some of that wonder, confusion, excitement, and despair that DS1 had, and that DS2 managed to capture some of. I never felt in DS3 that I could just step back and appreciate the game and what I had accomplished in it. The world of DS3 is very flushed out, but the faster pace is something that allowed From to slack off on the interconnected-ness of it all.Excellent game, and for sure worth my time, but the nostalgia can somewhat ruin it."
Positive,Best character creator ever made get it.
Positive,BUY ITS SO REWARDING
Positive,Best game for me!
Positive,"This is one of the best, most engrossing, mysterious and rewarding games I've played in almost 15 years of gaming. The lore is deep and rich, almost reaching the heights of other inhabitants of the high fantasy genre, yet staying shrouded just enough for the player to reveal at their own pace, and the games immediate story, while simple, is incredibly thought provoking. Level design is sharp and smart and enemy's are challenging. The combat is rewarding and consistently shifting, and can prove to be immensely satisfying, given you have the time to give this game, as there is undeinably a learning curve. But most importantly of all, this is the first game I've ever played that's made me realise something very important about myself: I'm not very good at video games. But if anything can, this is the game that will change thatTime to git gud, 20 deaths at a time"
Positive,"It's impossible to mimic the exact feel and wonder of the original Dark Souls, as everything after will be, by definition, reiterations of the same concept with improvements. That said, FromSoftware has honed the Souls formula to near perfection, retaining the excellent worldbuilding and lore that the series is known for, and streamlining some parts, like weapon upgrades, to help the player get back into the game faster. Boss battles in this installment are the best they've ever been, with music that accentuates every encounter and gives each battle a distinct tone and weight. The addition of Weapon Arts makes each weapon feel a little more unique, forcing the player to consider more than just type and damage output. The areas are a little more linear this time around, although they are beautifully designed, and the first DLC area is a bit of a letdown in terms of content added, but what's here is unforgettable. Definitely worth every penny."
Positive,"""Bell tolls"" - SPOILERS!!! Woken up from the ashes to nail the old lords to their thrones. To bring back fire to the world, is this our destiny? The legend of the dark soul? The pilgrims found the truth in the ashes of the past. ""The fire fades"", but note this ""The lords go without thrones"", means all lords not only the cinders. But the dark lords as well, those who held to the dark soul of man, in a forgotten kingdom ruled over by kings of men. But whom this kingdom was shaded from a dougther of Gwyn himself. Just like a mirror of a world named the ringed city.We set out on a quest. To kindle the same flame just as the souls of cinders did before us. Supposed to believe that this is our destiny, our duty and our right.When we enter the painting of a rotten slip of cloth carried by an old slave knight. We find our self in an alternative universe. A painting made for those who have no place to kall their own. A place left to rot, only to be reborn by a new painter after you have set it aflame.We start to believe that the soul of man can be connected to the abyss the eternal dark, and that the flame is connected to the lords.We have fought undead, beasts, demons, dragons, lords, and kings. Used their souls to regain strength and even used our friends in our battles only to see a curse being downed upon them. While our own curse is still whaiting and crumbling in the backs and bones of our unkindled flesh. I ask again ""IS THIS OUR PURPOUSE?""But we are not alone.In the final battle in a place long forgotten, beyond the end of the world we seek Gael. The man who went out to find the pigment for her lady. And he did. He found the old lords of men, even before you do. He found the pigment, the dark soul of man. But he is not the champion nor the legend to bear theese souls. Gael knew this, but his loyalty stays with his lady, and this old slave knight manages to take the final step to give his lady her pigment.You however kill the tainted slave knight gael and takes the souls of man and the blood of the dark soul. Then you finish his quest for him, and gives the blood to the lady in his stead. But you dont tell her his downfall. Instead you get the honor of naming this new world. The world i named has no name, but it will be ""a Cold, Dark and very Gentle Place"".There is only one lord and only one curse. And they will never die, but reborn from the ashes again, and again, and again.Untill the dark settles. Then tiny flames will dance across the dark. Just like an old, long and forgotten tale of lords and men."
Positive,"Worth it, worth breaking 2 Xbox controllers, and a monitor... So hard, much fun...9/10"
Positive,It's Dark Souls ... do i need to say more ?! :)Still good
Positive,"Deus Vult ! If u cant beat this game, git gud ! Praize the Sun \[T]/"
Positive,"Love this game.  It's currently my go to game, some of the bosses in the expansions Ashes of Andarial and The Ringed City remind me of Bloodborne also which was another one of my favorites.  So many builds, the pace seems faster than the first two DS games but this has just as much to offer and more.  One of my facvorites of all time.  I would really pick up the expansions as they both offer a multitude of new weapons/armor/bosses/npcs/enemies and more!  This will have you playing for dozens and dozens of hours."
Positive,This game gave me the spooks.
Positive,"A lot of people say ""I hate this game."" On the contrary, this game hates you.10/10 would fall into bottomless pit because of player notes again."
Positive,Although I do think that the challenge has decreased the game is still fun!!!
Positive,This game turned me into a masochist 10/10
Positive,"My favourite RPG of all time!Really had a blast playing this game.From the bosses, to the excellent soundtrack, to the good feeling of passing a part that I was struggling with and even the lore.Really enjoyed watching me getting better and better when I progressed in the game.A game that made me replaying it for some time."
Positive,This game is an absolutely perfect game. It can be frustrating being that it is a really hard game but overall you just need to learn proper evasion and your specific opponents weakness. Has tons of replay value. Great game. 10/10
Positive,"I am rewriting a review as my past review I had not even finished the game yet but was already in love with it. Since then I've finished the game multiple times over, done all the endings and am close to all the achievements and aiming for that. I must say I think I've experienced what Dark Souls 3 has to experience and it is good. First of all I want to say that only 80% of people have beat the first boss and only 20% have gotten to the end (steam achievements). Which I guess you could use as an indicator for how challenging people can find these games. Although please do not get discouraged! This game will not hold your hand but this is part of the experience. You have to figure shit out and you will die in the process! But once you complete the game at least once, doing it a second time is so much easier. You will have some very challenging moments and people will often tell you to ""git gud"" which may seem like an annoying comment, yet its so true, all you need is to get good and learn how to play the game well, which will naturally come from experience and dying.THE WAYS YOU WILL EXPERIENCE DARK SOULSI want to point out there are different ways of playing this game. I don't mean ""you can be a pyromancer, you can do this blabla"", I'm talking COOP. I've experienced this game many times with many different people, and I've raised a lot of Dark Souls players which I can proudly say have grown up to be some pvp legends. But playing with friends is a different experience to alone. Playing alone is scary, painful, and requires patience. When you play alone for your first time, you don't know what you're doing, where you're going, and you're mostly dying while being confused as to what to do. I can imagine a lot of people getting discouraged to continue if this is the case, but please keep trying, the feeling of overcoming a boss or finally finding the next bonfire is amazing. Playing with friends on the other hand, is like a cake walk. On my first playthrough my friend had also just gotten Dark Souls so we were figuring things out together. When we did play with each other we didn't know where to go and we still died to bosses but having each other made it so much more fun rather than painful.BUT! Since then I have played with many other people and held their hand through the game. This wasn't intentional as I knew everywhere to go, so they'd follow me and that's kind of how the game would play, I'd guide them through the game. I've asked my friends and have had mixed opinions about this, as to me, experiencing it when you have no one to tell you where to go is the best way to experience Dark Souls. My friend however, said he got bored after being stuck in the first area not knowing where to go. Then I come in I'm like ""come play dark souls"" I hold his hand, I lead the way, we kill bosses I give him tips I feed him the lore, he beats the game and he's like ""wow that was fucking epic"". It was epic, but not as epic as when I played and it took me 60 hours to beat it as it took him only 30 including all the dlc and bosses which were not yet released when I first played. To me guiding players is too easy, I want players to experience the frustration I felt when I couldn't kill a boss until I finally did and had this sense of achievement, this voice in your head saying that you finally did it. Although, if I wasn't there to hold my friends hand he wouldn't have known how to do all the quests and in a way experience the most out of DS3. It's a hard concept of two sides, as on one hand I felt it was too easy for him and on the other I'm glad I was there for him to experience the wonderful stories being told that he would have most likely missed. Overall it's up to you how you want to play and experience this master piece.This game is amazing, if you have the will or some friends to play with, do so. You're missing out if you don't. This game also has an amazing pvp scene with so much depth and variety, there's nothing like the feeling of winning invasions of winning a duel. If you have friends this is even more of a reason for you to play."
Positive,"Well, I was sceptic about this game when I heard for it for the first time... Saw the gameplay, still sceptic... Until I tried it! It is one awesome game, so complex and huge that thats unbelieveable. Yes it's hard in some way, but also very interesting, cool and... Just great! (And yeah, you can beat it with keyboard & mouse!) Cheers =)"
Positive,"What an AMAZING game.Αlthough i finished the first playthrough in 15.30 hours it still filled me with joy and happiness in the end.The music is absolutely to another level especially in some bosses but overall its a great feeling fighting a boss and hearing a bgm that suits it.The enviroments are stunning and i must have spent a lot of time looking around rather than killing bad guys :) Its just and awesome feeling i don't know how to decribe it.......The bosses are absolutely tough and the game somehow tells you from the very first encouter of a boss that you must learn how to play,think carefully,memorise your enemy's moves  learn the dodge or else you want survive Dark souls 3 till the end.These are the top 3 things for me in this game to say.......I can say more about the variety of weapons,shields,rings,Armors or even more but i don't want to get in depth with the game because it will boring for this review.Overall this is my second Souls game and i have to admit it was my best game of 2016.....Highly recommend it to new guys at this incredible series.Remember to keep your patience and PRAISE THE SUN!!!"
Positive,"My first game of the Souls-Series.I really like it, it is tough to defeat the bosses. You have to workout strategies and use the right weapon and buffs against the bosses. Also there is a big diversity in the weapontypes. I prefer UG-Sword + Shield or 2 G-Sword, just because it looks cool xDI bought DS 2 now and I never regret to buy this game. It is the kind of game I wanted to play all the time of my life.I saw Bloodbourne on PS before I knew about DS, sad but true. And now I am a huge fan of this series, it is just awesome.Just buy this game if you have patience and a huge amount of tolerance to die many times.In my opinion this series is the second best of all time after Age of Empires."
Positive,Dark Souls III is a game about loss:Lost 1000s of souls.Lost 300+ hours.Lost 2 controllers.Lost 1 Job.Lost 1 Wife10/10 - Would do again!
Positive,Got Gangbanged by little midgets. 10/10 gotta love pvp as well
Positive,"Very good game!  Not as challenging as its predecessors, but just as much fun.  Also has amazing graphics!"
Positive,I still enjoy playing this game even tho i finished the story. The multiplayer is also very fun to play you can play Co Op and help your friends or can fight against other players.
Positive,best game ever
Positive,"When i got to the hairy pussy spiders I thought it couldnt get any worse, i was wrong"

Positive,"Dark Souls 3 holds up as a worthy sequel and ending to the Souls trilogy (sorry Demon's Souls). Dark Souls is a brilliant series that's had the greatest impact on video games we've seen these past 7~ years, or perhaps ever.Amazing singleplayer experience that ends the trilogy on a high noteIncredible amount of fun to be had with friendsMemorable boss fightsMultiplayer is made 10x more fun by covenantsRuns on the same engine as Bloodborne, looks amazing on max settingsMuch quicker, visceral, satisfying combat in both PvP and PvELaunch issues fixed over time (crashing, bugs, unoptimisation). I feared I couldn't run this game with a GeForce 750 ti, but it runs very nicely on medium-high settingsActive patches and updatesArguably weaker PvP than in previous games due to quicker healing, certain weapons and very common phantom gangbangs where it's one invader vs the host and three phantoms. I enjoy it mostly but I can see why people are upset about itNG+ doesn't add very much apart from some new item placements and scaled enemy damage/HPWhere the fuck did poise go!?DLC is unpromising, since Ariandel was so shortArmour is no longer upgradable and shields are pretty uselessAt least a million pointless or unneeded DS1 referencesDS3 is great fun and is worthy of a lot of praise, but I feel it struggles to find its own identity and offers a weaker post-game experience than its predecessors. Regardless, it deserves a 9/10."
Positive,More easy than DS2:estus can be restored during combattitanite has easy chance to farma good list of armor sets and weapons for any purposeBut each boss has a bit better list of abilities and there are only few non-unique bosses.PS. There are four different endings. Try to catch 'em all!May the Bonfire be with you!
Positive,Git gud or die trying. Easy game though
Positive,"This, ladies and gentleman, is by far one of the most catching games i´ve ever played!Totaly recommended!"
Positive,IO SONO MYRMY
Positive,Really good game. But beware if you have bad temper issues. :P
Positive,This game was amazing and has risen to one of my all time favorite games the combat the story and the memes make this way to good
Positive,A very chill game. Prepare for relaxation
Positive,"If you're a masochist like me, you'll like this game."
Positive,"A great game to end a great series, this game has its flaws but the pve is by far the best part. The multiphase boss battles and well placed enemies make for a difficult yet rewarding experience. Some major changes to pvp mechanics and equipment stats have severly stunted the games multiplayer longevity though. But to someone who wants to play the dark souls 3 pve experience solo or coop I would definitly recommend this game. Beware though, dark souls 3 will destroy newcomers. I suggest starting with ds1 or 2 if you are new to the dark souls series"
Positive,Cannot be compared to the gorgeous Dark souls 1 and 2 pve.Cannot be compared to the fun pvp of dark souls 2Beceause Pve and pvp is not good. it's just a beautiful game. But Miyazaki cannot surpass dark souls 1 at all.I still recomend it beceause it's a good game on it's own.But the sense of adventure in dark souls 1 and 2 is not there.
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is an action rpg set in a dark fantasy world, the story in this installment is connected to the previous games. You play as the ashen one who is awakened by the toll of the bells, which signifies, that the link of the first flame is threatened.The first flame is responsible for a lot of things in this game, when it weakens the world starts to get upside down.The story is actually deeper, but I couldn't tell you more without spoiling you. So you leave your tomb on a journey to find the flame and solve the issue. In this journey, you'll have to face many enemies and bosses that each have their own behavior that you must carefully study, if you don't want to die, this setting enforces a tactical approach that you most likely will take some time to get used to, it is what makes most of the game's charm and difficulty though. The game's backstory is explained via object descriptions. So basically to understand the whole game, you have to collect every item, read each of them and then put every info you have collected in order, hopefully, some courageous people in the community have already started working on it thus you can simply look for some explanations on the web to learn about the game (obviously,there's a risk of getting spoiled and not everything is certain!).I will now list the pros and cons that I've found (might compare some elements with the previous games)Good Points - The interface was greatly improved, the developpers finally explain in detail what each stat is for.- The soundtrack they added is majestic, it blends perfectly with the stages you are in and builds immersion.- Very smooth and dynamic animations not to mention the graphics.- Some old armors were ported and cool new armors were added.- Estus Flask - Ashen Estus Flask convertion (Health Flask and Mana flask, you can balance how many you want.)- Improved Covenants (factions)- Merged fighting mechanics from Dark Souls 1 and 2- Large variety of weapons- There is a lot to explore and side quests are rather entertaining.Bad Points- Hitbox can be messed up in PvP and allow your opponent to damage you from afar, hopefully though, there are some techniques you can use to avoid that.- Huge invincible frames from fast rolling.- Poise only works when you attack. (It's a stat that determines stagger resistance, in previous games it was always active.)-  Miracles are almost useless in PvPConclusionOverall it's a pretty good game which I suggest you should take if you like difficulty and games set in a medieval dark-fantasy theme. I guarantee you that no matter how good you are at other games, you'll struggle against this one. You'll probably die very often aswell, don't lose hope if you it happens, just remember to ""git gud"", use tactics and rush less."
Positive,"Probably enough deaths to air GoT for 10 more seasons.Git Gud or Get GoT, 11/10 Dolphins"
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is perhaps one of the best modern games I've played in years. The visuals, the combat, the difficulty balance, the level design. All fine tuned points sharpened over the years culminating in what I can only describe as a masterpiece of modern game design. The combat feels very grounded as every enemy plays by the same rules you as the player does. Every area feels unique and distinct from one another from the decrepit Undead Settlement to the lowest pits of the Smouldering lake to the stunningly beautiful Irithyll Valley. All memorable in their own right. There's a diverse range of weapons and almost no repercussions for using them to your hearts content. Some weapons scale with strength, others with dexterity, but depending on how you level your characters you can softcap both of those without lacking in other areas. Sorcery, Pyromancy and Miracles however are more specialized as well they should be. But you can experiment with builds as you please.It takes quite a while to learn the intrigued combat system, the harsh difficulty curve starts as early as the first boss; Ludex Gundyr, but once you got the hang of it it'll feel so rewarding. Early areas could take hours upon hours to complete on your first run, but once you got some experience you'll breeze through it. Bosses and enemies have been balanced to be challenging but fair. Once you've learnt a boss's attack pattern it doesn't take long to take them out and the ones that do take longer will usually change up their attack strategy. This game franchise is often praised for it's difficulty, sadly I feel this reputation overshadows the quality of gameplay it has to offer."
Positive,thas some gooooood shitturns out... its preeeeetty gud
Positive,Haha it is me the Parry King.
Positive,Try finger but hole10/10
Positive,dark souls 2 BAD dark souls 3 GOOD
Positive,"Without a doubt my favorite Dark Souls game, fluid combat and unique enemies. The bosses are fun and the amount of replayability is enormous. My only issue with multiplayer has been from the inconsistency of summoning signs, especially when trying to connect directly with a friend."
Positive,Review initially written at 219 hoursWhere to start...It's great... however... there are few major flaws in the game (pvp mostly) such as poise. Every attack staggers twice in a row before allowing a small gap big enough for a parry or roll but only for that.A good continue of the series.Much more of a sequel to Darksouls 1 than Darksouls 2
Positive,"Truly an astounding game. A beautiful set world with stunning sights, even more stunning enemies, and plenty of other amazing items to appreciate. While seeming a little short when running through multiple times, the game presents unique challenges and a wide array of enemies just like the other Dark Souls games. The PvP is tightened up with weapon tracing and hitboxes being spot on, better player tracking, and much less of those awkward backstab fishing moments. Overall, great game. No true complaints. Keep at it developers, you're doing great."
Positive,10/10 would git gud again
Positive,Glad to see my favourite franchise to be released thought sad to see it end....but as a true souls player I will always praise the sun
Positive,"Very nice and challenging game , im new to Dark Souls but im really enjoying the game mechanics and the epic story line and of course the awesome scary looking Demons to fight off !"
Positive,"great game, not quite what I was specting for this saga finale but I enjoyed it anyway."
Positive,"Beat the game the other day.Some bossfights were subpar but the good ones were REALLY good. Like they took all the best ones (Artorias, Gwyn, Kalameet, OS etc) from Dark Souls 1 and remixed them.Level design is incredible, same general vibe as DS1 but not as interconnected. Lore is great, music is great.PC port is okay, it doesn't support 21:9 resolution which is a big frowny face from me.Also, why the f is equip load a separate stat from endurance smh."
Positive,absolutely the best souls game yet... Too bad i dont own in anymore... BUT BUY IT ITS AWSOME!!!Pros:  Absolutely Gorgeous Graphics.           Can run on Mid-End to High-End Pc's          Lots of players willing to help you if you are having trouble with a boss!          Lots of references to different souls games. (even bloodborne)          Leveling system has improved since the first and second dark souls games.        Cons: If you are new to dark souls good luck.          If you get invaded good luck.          If you get to the third boss good luck.          If you start as a cleric good luck.          You know what fuck it if you play this game good luck...p.s. I thought this game was extremely fun.
Positive,"Im running this on a mac and it's still an amazing game on low specs. No issues what's so ever and so many nostalgic moments in the game that puts you back to the other souls game. ""PREPARE TO DIE"" in this game, cause your gonna.CON:You will rage and you might break somethingYou will waste your life in it for hoursPRO:Lots of funNO REGRETS spending about $70"
Positive,Starts off pretty easy..... But then you are quickly reminded that this is dark souls by a half naked man with a katana :praisesun:
Positive,A must buy to all soul series fansToo bad my pc get embers everytime i try to put the game on High SettingsFinished the game and managed to die at the menu even now.10/10
Positive,420/10 - IGN
Positive,YOU DIED <3
Positive,This game is too fucking goodnuff said
Positive,summoning people to help should be removed fuck you faggots
Positive,"The best Souls game to date in my opinion. Fantastic atmosphere. I'd say it's easier than DS1 and DS2. But more engaging.Level design is MILES ahead of DS2. On par with DS1.If you loved DS1 but DS2 left a bad taste in your mouth, pick this up immediately. Highly recommend."
Positive,"This game offers pretty graphics, atmospheric and epic environments, lots of unique enemies and items, a fairly deep combat, co-op and pvp and a very good challenge.The most problems are with the multiplayer as there's occasionally lag and desync which can break the game.I'll rate 8/10, but if you ignore the technical problems and just look at the game design, then this game would get 9/10 from me. Getting 10/10 would require some design overhauls that would make the game less ""Dark Souls"".This is the best Dark Souls game."
Positive,"Its Dark Souls.  You know what to expect.0 amount of crashes so far after 16 hours. Still wondering in Udead Village, send more sunbros!"
Positive,if you need a controller to play that you're a filthy casul
Positive,Played teh first one wasn't too hard playing this one is like trying to cook pizza rolls with a freezer
Positive,So hard that crashes are implemented into the game.Edit: Fixed.
Positive,Amazing game so far. I'm 9 hours in at the time of this review and this game is true to the souls series. It also runs great at 60fps throughout!
Positive,it is very... i cant even explain it
Positive,Why is it always plin plin plon ?
Positive,"Some hitches in coop matchmaking, but this game is absolutely amazing!Haven't noticed any crashes or strange glitches yet after 15 hours of gameplay, so no complaints in that compartiment either.Game looks and plays amazingly!"
Positive,I wish i had alzheimer's to play it for the first time again.
Positive,game of the year
Positive,In my opion this is the best dark souls game. i really enjoy it.
Positive,"After 1 year, this is still my favorite game. >ω<Praise the Sun once again!! \[T]/"
Positive,"Arguably the easiest game of the DS series, but imho most enjoyable."
Positive,ez game tbh
Positive,If you have never played a dark souls game before.. Imagine playing skyrim in legendary mode and starting deep down in the dwemer cavewith only a dagger and naked. Now you will have an idea of how many times you are going to die.
Positive,"A great game with beautiful level design and fabulous fashion. The story and the lore are both vey interesting too.As for the combat, i love it in this game, as it is really fast-paced, unlike in ds2 where you move as if you were covered in syrup."
Positive,"As my first venture into the dark souls franchise i'd say this is a stellar game, and even though it has some things i can't reallt agree with such as pvp arenas being in the DLC and not the base game poor connections most of the time and a decent anti cheat wouldn't hurt either."
Positive,"This is a game that rewards you with true ""sense of pride and accomplishment"" for overcoming all the odds it throws at you."
Positive,Died while choosing the resolution. 9/11
Positive,they fixed servers
Positive,"If this is your very first game in souls series, I strictly recommend to play with friends. Otherwise, your pain will be endless."
Positive,the real dark souls 1 remastered
Positive,"Things I learned from this game:1.Praise the sun.2.No shame in checking the wiki/guides because item descriptions leave out vital details and it's easy to get lost.3.Your opinion on any of the areas, weapons, npcs, or bosses is objectively wrong and people will send you a several page long reddit essay calling you a retard if you don't agree.4.Dogs make me wanna die.5.Pontiff makes me wanna die.6.Don't somewhat breathe next to a hacker or you're banned.7.Don't give up skeleton!8.The jailors make me wanna die.9.Skeletons have learned the way of the blade from Emporer Palpatine.10.10/10 would die again."
Positive,"The game is friendly to beginners (more than previous games) but this does not detract from the series-defining difficulty, But This game does requires patience but it's worth it. I quite like the nods and references to previous games in the series also with the the scenaries can really amaze, great atmosphere.  The controls are tight, the enemies AI is smarter and much harder to manipulate, in terms of PvE. so much gear and weapons to use. (Glad they brought them all back, bloodborne was too limited)  All of the negative reviews state the game crashes. I have played  30 hours so far and not a single crash, i don't know why you play on a potato but we eat them here in Ireland.Yes there is Poor Mouse and keyboard support... that is because the game IS MEANT to be played with a Controller... just like DS1 and DS2,The only immediate advantage I can give DS1 is the sense of early game mystery when you had the freedom to go the wrong way to the Catacombs, or New Londo, right off the bat.Ps  Truly the last Souls game? :("
Positive,"pretty fun to play this one solo or with friends, the co-op works well and invasions aren't too horribly often unless in a couple of bad spots (don't dried finger there unless you have a second friend waiting or it will be very hairy!).Not the hardest game in the series as 2 is so awkward its harder than it needs to be.  Very solo-able, but challenging.Only on my 3rd journey but 5 is the goal! Good Luck to all that dare! haha"
Positive,"Years from now, Dark Souls III is going to be known as the ""Ocarina of Time"" of the series. Compared to the previous Souls games: artifical difficult has been replaced by unique and skillful execution, quality of life nuisances have been remedied, and sound/visuals have been improved drastically. In a nutshell, the biggest difference in Dark Souls III is that you aren't being tested for your patience/discipline. DS3 tests you for your skill. In DS1/2, dying was infuriating, and winning was a relief. In DS3, dying is awe-inspiring, and winning makes you feel like a lord. I whole-heartedly recommend you get this game. As soon as I got it, I couldn't stop playing it (I put in 68 hours over 5 weeks while working full-time and going to school). It is not flawless, but it is a clear 9/10. It's quite a enjoyable and rewarding experience.Also, in your times of struggle, remember that every death is meant to be a lesson. The game wants you to succeed.MechanicsWeapons are extremely unique and most of them are viable in PvE. You get to just pick whatever you want and feel like the badass that you want. Boss weapons are not impossible to come by and often feel the best. There are also many more choices for each weapon based on their ""arte"", which are more than just a guard break or a lunge forward. The movement/dodge system is much faster and more responsive. This would be very OP in previous Dark Souls games, but enemies in previous DS titles also were hard countered by circle-backstab anyway. The rolls in this game are appropriately needed for the changes in enemy move sets. It overall just feels better just to run around and battle.The convenants and merchants are infinitely less cumbersome than previous. Discovering a merchant relocates them to Firelink Shrine, in which all merchants and most NPCs will stay. You won't have to go traveling for 4 minutes just to get your weapon upgraded after you buy some pyromancies anymore. Convenants are also joined by being given a Sigil following discovery. You can just swap convenants by switching this slot in your inventory instead of hunting down the convenant leader again. Also, a merchant dying no longer means that you lose their products. All in all, it is much less of a chore to do small tasks like these.The equivalent of being human is called being Embered. Unlike in previous games, this is actually useful (you get 30% extra hp). This means that more people embered overall = more PvP interaction. Also, you gain embered status for beating a boss, which means more people want to put down their summon sign to help out others with a tough boss. Summoning also has a level limit, so you don't have to be scared of getting invaded from someone light years ahead of you in levels/gear. All of these mechanics lead to greater and more meaningful player interaction throughout your time in Lothric.You get to warp between bonfires from the get-go, and you also don't have to upgrade specific bonfires. Some have complained that this makes the world feel a bit smaller, but I disagree. The world is extremely connected save 1 or 2 exceptions, and you can see almost every other point in the game from one another. Bonfires are also a bit more on rails, meaning that it's tough to miss one. Previously, hidden bonfires (especially in the Tomb of the Giants in DS1) could completely change the flow of how you play the game based on whether you stumble upon it or not. There's also a generally lower amount of arbitrary shit that would punish you for lack of prior knowledge.The weapon crafting system no longer punishes you for making a choice. You can simply swap the properties of a +10 weapon instead of having to find another one and go through the full upgrade path each time. The information about each weapon is much easier to process and there are more choices for whatever nuianced build you're trying. The menu overall is extremely good. You can finally navigate on a grid instead of a list, and you can tab between menus for your armor/weapons. You can have more rings and items equipped simultaneously. You can also view your status to see how many souls you need for a next level instead of stopping by a specific location. It is overall just much easier on the eyes, and it is optimized to provide convenient access to information.CombatThe bosses follow suit in the weapons improvement, and (with few exceptions) they all feel varied and deep. I've fought some bosses almost 40 times and will still see some new moves. The AI is also programmed well enough to show human tendencies like getting greedy or faking out a move. You would be able to look up a guide on these most bosses and still not find the secret to beating them. In previous DS games, it felt like you would cheese all of the bosses because they'd cheese you (just walk near them and stand behind every boss). Sometimes, you'll want to intentionally separate yourself from a boss as much as possible. Some bosses have moves to punish you positioning close; other bosses have moves to punish you for rolling as a reaction to anything. DS3 bosses have several move sets that keep it fresh several times over. I never noticed how terribly annoying previous Dark Souls bosses were (from walking to each boss to the small gimmicks and lack of tactics) until realizing how good it could be when I played DS3.Honorable mention is that the Final Boss is an absolute beast. He is the summation of all who have ever Linked the Flame; therefore, his fight is the deepest and most ""complete"" that I could say I remember in a video game. He's not this way because he just ""has a lot of stages"" or takes 30 minutes to beat, but because he contains every popular player build and you will find something different each time you play him. There is also a bit of an emotional moment in which the music for Gwyn, the original Lord of Cinder, plays and he begins using Gwyn's sword. Sometimes you feel so emotionally connected with him, that you almost don't want to win. The normal enemies are what you would expect, but there is fortunately a bit less mob behavior. I thought that mob behavior was a bit of a cheap excuse for difficulty, and the AI programming and enemy design has made up that difficulty in a more meaningful way in DS3. I unfortunately don't know too much about serious PvP, but my experience with the invasions mechanics have been pleasant when fighting another player. It hasn't really felt unfair at all, yet. Performance & Audio/VisualDrastic performance increase. 60 fps, unlocked resolutions (I played in 1440p). The draw distance is excellent and the environments are stunning. You will find several ""Oh my god"" moments in which you are greeted by amazing views en route to a new area. For a little bit of preview, look up the screenshots of Irithyll of the Boreal Valley. The armor and characters are also extremely sharp, and the in-game rendered cutscenes are Blizzard quality.The audio is overhauled. The directional sound in the game rivals Counter-Strike 1.6. The materials and general pitter-pattering is very precise and varied throughout. The sounds in the game are also overall very clear; play a bit of Dark Souls 1 and you will notice a staggering difference.The music is the best of any in the series. Several songs feel like a perfect fit for the environment/boss, instead of just sounding like generic background tunes. Pretty much any boss theme is great, but Abyss Watchers, Soul of Cinder, Pontiff Sulyvahn, Father Ariandel and Sister Friede (from the DLC), Twin Princes, and Oceiros get honorable mentions for great music. The Main Menu theme is pretty damn good, too."
Positive,"There appear to be major issues with the PC version on launch for a great many people - mostly issues with their graphics cards not cooperating with some of the features of the game, such as the lighting engine for example. Everyone should take this into regard before buying the game, and make  sure to check for updates to see if these issues have been resolved. I can say that with a GTX 980 I have not had the crashes or FPS problems that I hear about frequently.I'm only 5.5 hours in at the time of this review and will likely update it as I get further, but for now this game has my approval. PC players of the last two games will probably assume that the keyboard and mouse controls are as much a waste of time as they were previously, and that's probably true - I never even bothered trying them out, but as usual all the button prompts assume you have an Xbox gamepad, and that's how I've been rolling.The combat is very familiar to players of the first game, and the use of the quantifiably superior Bloodborne engine means that the controls are not nearly as sluggish or unresponsive as they were in Dark Souls II, making for an altogether more satisfying experience where you feel like you're doing things right, or that dying is more the result of your own mistakes rather than terrible input recognition or nonsensical hit detection.The new weapon art system offers an interesting new dynamic to combat that probably puts this game closer to Bloodborne's attack variety than it does either of the previous Souls titles. However, performing weapon arts uses the L2/LT button, which means it replaces the Parry functionality in every circumstance except if you are using a Parrying-class shield. This, combined with the more fickle parry timing that feels more like DS II, means that parrying altogether feels less like a viable technique. This might be a blessing to some people who felt like parrying was broken and OP in the first game, but it also means the developers took the time to create a function that most people probably won't end up using.Dodging is more like the first game, in terms of its animations and more generous invincibility frames, so it can be used in a more offensive manner than in DS II as a way to maneuver past an enemy's guard and their attacks to land some serious hits. The way equipment burden affects rolling is virtually the same as DS II, however, meaning that your roll distance is what is affected the most as your equipment weight rises, until you reach the ""fat roll"" cap at what I estimate is around 70% burden.Upgrading weapons looks very similar to DS II but I have yet to max out or infuse a weapon to verify that. Upgrades require more individual titanite stones than in either previous games, for reasons that are not exactly clear, but I also feel like drops are significantly more generous. Infusion stones seem to be accessible more early in the game as well, especially Raw stones, which are helpful for starting players who don't have high stats to affect their Attack yet. However, infusing weapons with Raw or elemental damage means all stat bonuses for the weapons are removed, not just reduced or modified like they were in the previous games, so the drawbacks are more severe.Overall I feel so far that leveling up does not give you the same sense of power and progress as in previous games, and soul drops from enemies are not nearly as generous. This is a bit disappointing, but it also means you cannot just farm souls for an hour or two and then become an unstoppable killing machine with just a few extra levels under your belt. This game does demand more skill from the player rather than being able to min/max your character and turn each map into a cakewalk, or at least it seems that way so far.This game has my vote of confidence so far, at least as far as the gameplay goes. It makes only a few changes, for better or for worse, but really does feel more like the first game, with a dash of Demon's Souls and Bloodborne for good measure. It may not have as many surprises as people would hope for, but really, if they stuck to making DLC for the first game instead of making sequels, I'd still be buying that, so what's the difference?"
Positive,Thank you Dark Souls.
Positive,whythefak did i refund this masterpiece
Positive,"""We didn't start the fireIt was always burningSince the world's been turningWe didn't start the fireNo we didn't light itBut we tried to fight it"""
Positive,"Meh its alright, might spend another 500 hours playing :/"
Positive,Dark Souls I was the bomb.Dark Souls II dropped the ball - Miyazaki's direct influence was dearly missed.Dark Souls III picked it back up.
Positive,"I've gained a new appreciation for Dark Souls 3 after 100%ing it. I've always liked this game, but felt that a few of the bosses were kinda weak/annoying to go back and re-fight on extra playthroughs. This is probably one of my only gripes with the game, as the areas, music and gameplay are all very solid. The first game in the series to have clean, fast movement with all the jank removed. It's hard not to recommend Dark Souls 3, it's a fantastic game."
Positive,"Don't know why.  Have not enjoyed any Souls title other than Demons Souls previously (also haven't played Bloodborne), but I'm loving the fuck out of the faster gameplay of DS3.Haven't had any of the issues you'll see people plaguing the reviews section with.  Not a single crash, not a single framerate drop, nothing.Windows 10Geforce GTX 970i7 2600k8 GB RAM1080p, solid 60 fps, no drops.Take it for what it is, seems to be a mixed bag in terms of performance.  Works for me, crashes for others."
Positive,Fought 5 enemies and got rekt to a boss10/10side note I have a few probelms but I'd still recomend1.) I cant alt tab out of the game.2.) Resolution is fucked up and I have to lauch the game through the Geforce experience to get it to work right3.) Any changes i make to the setting ingame seem to just get reverted
Positive,makes my penis hurt
Positive,PLAY THIS FUCKING GAME
Positive,"So... I died. I'm not very good at this, but it was still fun. I went again, and again, and again and again and again andagainandagainandagainandagain... Doesn't change the fact that it's still fun. :)"
Positive,This game makes me want to die...then I do over and over again.
Positive,Go on and get it. It's really good!Just wish it was better optimized. The visuals are nothing excepcional.
Positive,"I've been sitting here for 20minutes trying to write a positive review for this game, but kept on ending up writing love letters to Miyazaki. It's amazing, it *MIGHT* even be better than DS1. Challenging but fair, tons of great bosses, interesting NPCs and cool equimpent. 10/10"
Positive,"If you’re a newcomer you might get stuck at Gundyr.If you’re a casual gamer you might not keep up with Pontiff.If you’re a veteran you can still get tilted at Nameless King.However, if you desire to challenge the pinnacle standard of top-tier boss fights, seeking gratification and satisfaction, then this is a message from me to you… my dear to-be unkindled, future linker of the first flame, devoter of Software of the FromBuy this game, if you would.For that…is our curse"
Positive,"This game is great fun. It is quite hard to get the hang of but once you do you will not regret doing so since this game offers a variety of fun and new things to do.P.S. Don't quit if you die, learn from your mistakes and continue on."
Positive,"Okay, full update to my review. Original review below. After some tinkering and tonkering, I figured out how to get my DS4 controller to work. This is what I did:1. exit Steam2. go into input mapper and check the exclusive mode (if already checked, just try unchecking and rechecking. Doubt it would do anything, but I did that).3. Close input mapper, and restart it. 4. log into Steam again.5. Start up Dark Souls 3Note that while doing that, I had my keyboard and mouse disabled to reduce the potential for error. Also, I started getting disconnected more frequently, and just switched to offline and no problems. It's fun to watch people's ghosts and all, but more fun to get uninterrupted play time. Until online connectivity is fixed, I'm just going to stay offline. So besides me fixing my problems, I am having a blast so far. It's my first Souls game (a little Bloodborne prior) and it's awesome. Combat is brutal and engaging, enemies are ruthless, but not frustratingly so. I might get killed super quick, but I always notice something I could fix to get past that enemy on the time after that... or after that... or after that. The world looks gorgeous so far, I am able to run it on high with my PC, with framerates that aren't terrible, and it is beautiful. The world is incredibly detailed, with little things that just pull your eye in, which is good, because you will need to be paying attention to find some of those little nooks and crannies that let you advance.So, I give it a reccomend as of now. Definitely some adjustments that need to be made, but nothing gamebreaking for me now.---Original Review---I will be giving a negative review until Dualshock 4 controllers are supported, then I will re-evaluate.I will say though, that this is running rather smoothly for me. I know some people are having issues with the bonfires causing crashing, but I don't seem to be having any of those problems. Also, the game is a blast, I just wish I could use my Dualshock 4. That would make it perfect.I should also note that I am frequently disconnected from the server when playing online. Luckily the game boots quickly from the home menu. This is likely just an issue that will exist in its early state, and quickly get fixed. Server trouble isn't uncommon upon release, but still an annoyance"
Positive,Get gut or die trying
Positive,Pretty cute game. I managed to git gud.
Positive,"One of the best game's I've ever played. The most polished and action packed of the trilogy. From its world building and atmosphere to its challenging enemies and various play styles, it's the ideal Dark Souls game."
Positive,Visions of greatest game
Positive,"The conclusion to the Souls series and my first souls game, this is a very beautiful and rich filled game jam-packed with such memorable moments and soundtrack that will ring in my ears through the night. Throughout all the struggles and the many deaths, I've always came back to defeat each boss with my hands sweating and heart pumping adrenaline that made me cheer for joy when the Soul of Cinder fell. I would honesty recommend to anyone looking to getting into the Souls series and will definitely work my way through the DLC."
Positive,"One of the best game of this year. good:1. V.V.Very super good level design. Good designed checkpoint make the game much more hopeful although the game is hard. 2. Boss are challenging, but possible to beat.3. The story are hidden in the discription of items, it gives spaces for players to imagine the whole story.bad:1. The region is very small in the late game."
Positive,"First of all, I'm going to start by saying that at the time of writing this and having finished the game, I haven't met the minimum requirements to play it. Nope, not even close. Ran it on my trusty old piece of junk 2009 desktop.Despite my average 20 FPS I still have enjoyed the game a lot. From does it again, everyone!I loved every single moment of it (excluding the crashes before the 1.03.1 patch came out, of course). The amazement of finding and exploring new areas (and being completely taken away by the pretty scenery), the excitement of boss fights (some of them REALLY badass, mind you), the tension of the combat, and of course the jolly cooperation, which I have indulged into very often (because pvp sucks).I'd say the only ""bad"" thing the game has is just the usual signs of From Software Quality Programming (the heck is with all these Scaleform threads using up an entire core?), but despite all that it's a great game, and I can say for sure it surpasses its predecessors.I definitely recommend it, that's for sure."
Positive,"This is a great game. It's not ""incredibly hard"" like people label it, it's ""challenging"", but it's always fair. The way it tells the story is not typical, and the gameplay is one of the most rewarding experiences I've ever been through. I totally recommend it, for Souls fans or people new to the franchise."
Positive,"I was looking for a rewarding challenge, I found it.I was looking for a deep, compelling story, I found it.I was looking for adventure and mystery, I found it.It has been years since I've seen a statue missing or an alcove empty and paused to ask myself, what is the game trying to tell me? Often I would have to make a note and research it later if I had missed a clue or detail - I was always shocked at the results I'd find. It is beyond rare that depth of story matches gameplay, but for that very reason you're still hearing about Dark Souls years after.Without a doubt, Dark Souls 3 is the pinacle of 8th generation hardware and I would say the perfect use of console hardware and controller. Shoulder buttons for standard attacks not only changed the way the 360 controller was designed, but opened up the possibilities of more than just shooting your way through a game with trigger presses. Defying every convention and forging it's own path with no preconceptions, it not only set new standards but has defined itself as it's own genre. We live in an age of sequels and rehashes, cash in after cash in, but Dark Souls is akin to art and 3, the final chapter, is merely the refinement of Demon Souls and Dark Souls combined - often literally. Characters not only return, but are further developed or honed by fire into something more.Like STALKER, I recommend starting with 3, then 1, with Bloodborne and 2 as optional based on taste."
Positive,This game makes me suicidal.It's pretty good.
Positive,It's a good game

Positive,"My favorite game in the Dark Souls series. It has some flaws just like its predecessors, but a better port for PC compared to DS2 and the original DS, and it's absolutely gorgeous. Camera is still your biggest enemy though. Lastly, it's quite interesting to see how many assets and concepts in this game have been reused in Elden Ring (Those minor erd tree boys are more or less a copy of the giant swamp A holes, except they are bigger douchebags).All in all an awesome game and series worth your time!"
Positive,Beautiful graphics and such a blast when you get into it. Simply an amazing adventure and world to explore
Positive,fun game lol
Positive,It's pretty good.
Positive,"Good game, need some skills to play and need some patient as well. just do not give up if you get destoried by the first boss. keep trying and then you will start to enjoy it."
Positive,Git Gud Casul
Positive,this game is made by a berserk fan
Positive,Do i even need to explain why i gave it a 10/10?
Positive,Like Skyrim except literally everything wants to kill you and they are 100% more effective at it.
Positive,"A word of caution: after praising The Sun every day for 9 years I have contracted melanoma. Use factor 50, kids."
Positive,"One of the best games i've ever played, challenging, huge lore depth, rewarding and yet some how depressing. 10/10 would NG+Praise the sun"
Positive,"Best Dark Souls game, i can move and drink apple juice"
Positive,nice game but hard The graphics well system game is also fun
Positive,Better than Elden Ring.
Positive,"It's the most difficult single player game I've played, you can explore and experiment with a mix of single player or Player vs Player action."
Positive,"Enter the game- Amazing ""music menu theme"" boss ahead *omg i'm not ready*okay continue- ""Create character"" boss*too hard*I'm still trying beat this boss..."
Positive,"One of the greatest video game experiences of my life, absolutely my favorite souls game. You get so incredibly immersed into this strange, dark world, you start reading lore and start investing your time into finding out it's secrets. The difficulty is perfect, if you can't take it it's not for you but this game wont twist and turn and change its original intentions to accommodate other players, it is what it is and it's proud of it"
Positive,"First of all, I didn't have any perfomance issues with a pretty mediocre gaming rig (i5@4.3GHz, 8GB RAM, GTX 760). Only one crash in 60+ hours and stable 50 fps (limited to 50 via RivaTuner to fix screen tearing which was present at 60fps) save for a few fps drops  to ~40fps in some areas of Lothric Castle and Cathedral of the Deep.As for the settings, I had SSAO, textures and reflections on max, and AA on. However, shadows, lighting, shaders and effects are on low. I don't really see any changes vs. high/max, but those settings decrease fps by about 10-15%. To me this feels like the best PC version of Dark Souls upon release (of course, SotFS had a better optimisation, but it was released more than a year after DS2).The game itself feels like a good mix of DS, DS2 and Bloodborne. Sometimes DS3 it's definitely harder than its predecessors (those lothric knights, damn): the enemies are faster, more aggressive and unpredictable. Think of heide knights from DS2: SotFS with ridiculous attack patterns. However, I started as deprived, so there's that. Killing the first boss with a club is a challenge. But that's if you are playing solo. Summon at least one phantom, and the game turns into a walk into a park.And that's the main problem with the difficulty: since enemies are generally fast and aggressive, it's pretty hard to deal with that pressure solo. However, enemies usually don't switch targets too often, so you (or a phantom) can put out a lot of damage while AI attacks another player character. This makes boss fights too easy, while some of them are pretty impossible solo.Another problem is the level design. DS3 doesn't have an inteconnected world like DS one does or a non-linear progression like DS2 does. Basically, every location in DS3 is a thing in itself, and while there are shortcuts and secrets, you don't really feel the consistency of the world. Anyway, the visuals are great and while some locations will feel familiar to DS fans, this isn't a bad thing.What is really bad is network synchronization and cheaters. The game has been out for more than a month (since JP release), but there are tons of network issues and a lot of hackers. FromSoftware is banning the latter (along with honest players), but there is little to no improvement for the network problems. Invaders and phantoms having no animations, phantoms not able to travers the fog wall and help with a boss fights, game disconnects and so on. And there's also a slight lag in almost all pvp battles so that it's harder to parry and near impossible to score a backstab.Bottom line: despite its flaws, DS3 is a great PvE game, but PvP part still needs a lot of improvement."
Positive,"Good game execpt there is a major problem.made a new character, about to face dancer, can't beat dancer by myself....and phantoms can't enter the room.I was playing with a phantom the first time i entered the room, then after that, they wernt abel to enter ^.^ kinda a problem ya know? and i'll be damned if I restart my game because of a broken glitch that forces you to solo. I tried exiting the game, tried resting at a bon fire, everything.BEWARE THE DANCER. that's all I will say. She is broken with that glitch.EDIT:Randomly fixed itself, beat the Dancer.BEWARE THE RANDOM GLICHES.One of my favorite games honestly, I was once a casual player. And then I played darksouls."
Positive,"A fantastic game with so much exploring you feel like you want to explode, also don't cheat."
Positive,A Masterpiece of a game!
Positive,Better then Elden Ring
Positive,parrying is ez stop crying weaklings
Positive,its dark souls
Positive,"Why go run for an hour when you can play this game for 4 hours, same cardio workout"
Positive,"It is the love child of Dark Souls 1 and Bloodborne that I have been waiting for. This feels to me like the real Dark Souls 2! Amazing graphics, amazing level design, boss design that makes cry myself to sleep. What more do could I ask from dark souls? 11/10 will cry more"
Positive,"I'm sure you've heard of the Dark Souls series, you've probably heard about the difficult yet rewarding learning curve and maybe even thought to yourself this game isn't for me. However, give it a try maybe even find some friends to play with you and maybe just maybe you'll fall in love with this game like I have. If the price is an issue wait for a sale they usually come around the holidays or during the summer. If you've never played a Dark Souls game I recommend  buying the First game (Dark Souls) and just forget about the second game.Happy adventuring and make sure you praise the sun!"
Positive,"since elden ring was my first soulsborne and it being one of my favorite games, i was told that i would probably enjoy dark souls 3 as well & they were so right! i absolutely loved this masterpiece from beginning to end. spending hours on a boss and to finally defeat it feels very rewarding and makes u want to play even more. 10/10!edit: one bad thing about this wonderful game is that the pvp is filled with cheaters. over the course of 2 days of grinding concord kepts for the achievements, i've ran into a total of 5 cheaters making themselves invulnerable, being able to revive themselves to full health, etc. so, if you're looking to play this game mainly for the pvp aspect, i would avoid it at all costs imo."
Positive,it's just like Dark Souls
Positive,"At first this game made me want to slam my desk and break things, after getting the hang of it, i love it."
Positive,"I used to wonder ""How could someone play this game for hundreds of hours"". Now after finishing the game three times in a row, I don't."

Positive,"probably my favourite game of all time. if you're looking for a hardcore gaming experience i would definitely recommend this game.oh, also this is literally my favourite game ever made"
Positive,dont hit that one guy he will agro you forever in an essential zone it is terrible other than that the games kinda crazy
Positive,hard af but fun af
Positive,I've played all of the souls games in exception to Bloodborne (next to beat). This one has been the hardest by far. Removed DS2 garbage like armor upgrades and disgusting covenant grind. Love having the mana bar back!!! The perfect Demon/Dark Soul fusion!
Positive,"Amazing game series, my favorite of the three but sadly i was banned due to another persons abuse of the game via cheats. Its a great play but you have to be careful and you have to stay safe when joining others or invading or else you could get banned by its buggy anti-cheat or whatever"
Positive,I hate this game.
Positive,I like pain.
Positive,"Pretty good. Even better with a controller. Progress can take a very long time, allot of the game consists of grinding for souls. But the feeling you get when you beat a boss... words cannot describe."
Positive,Took over my summer and I'll never get that time back. It was worth tho.
Positive,"Great game! I like it more than Dark Souls 1, however the linearity of the world makes each playthrough more boring than the last if you get most of the items the first time around."

Positive,Probably my favorite game ever I think.
Positive,"ALthough the main story is short (can be beaten in under 30 with a lot of deaths), the game is all around one of my new favorites. It has the graphical style of both the first Dark Souls and Bloodborne, has combat pacing that is faster and more intense, had beautifully designed environments, has all the references you could every need, and will chizle you into the player you've always wanted to be. And best of all, it is fun as heck.With that said: buy the game and git gud"

Positive,"It's like Dark Souls 1 and Bloodbourne had a baby, a really fucking ugly baby and neither of them wanted to keep it so they threw it out to fend for itself. It still managed to get all of the bad habits from them both like Bloodbourne's pvp (player versus pussy) where you can heal quickly so fights last longer than they should and Dark Soul 1's cheaters. What you're left with in the end is a game that thinks you should think it's fun because it's a ""Souls"" game, it's a game that most everyone talks about being artificially difficult. Althought I agree with that in some ways because most every enemy takes the cheesiest way in order to hit you everything still has a decipherable pattern you can work out, they just moves quicker so it's harder to understand it. That being said, it's still a better game that Dark Souls 2. Fuck Dark Souls 2."

Positive,Its good. Don't tilt and you'll have a great time.
Positive,servers are back baby
Positive,amazing game one of the best but them hackers tho
Positive,Most polished Souls game. Pretty damn linear though. Lots of quality of life improvements. Combat flows nicer than any of the three. Dark Souls 2 PvP was better during its prime but this one is still really good for a Souls game. Co-Op pretty seamless. Overall probably my favorite of the three.
Positive,"People will complain about how hard this game is and I agree. It can be difficult at times. Yet it rarely feels unfair. If you die, it's because you know you messed up and the game isn't out to get you(even though some enemies can feel that way). Runs farely smoothly and I have rarely had any frame drops. Control scheme is a little different than most people are used to, but it's farely easy to get used. When it comes to difficulty, I really struggled at first. I couldn't seem to progress past the high wall of lothric, but after about 10 hours something finally clicked and I started understanding the mechanics and doing better overall. 10 hours may seem like a lot of time to spend just trying to figure out if this is something you want to invest your time in. I now have 71 hours into it and absolutely love the game. I would and have recommended this game to most gamers I know. Other things to mention. Enemy types are varied from location and all feel unique. Even if you can one shot a single enemy, if you aren't paying attention and they manage to land a hit, they can really mess up your day. The boss fights are where this game really shines. While it has the least amount of bosses across the entire soulsborne series, all of the bosses feel unique and fun to play. Another thing, you can just fly through the game if you so please, but the best experience comes from really exploring all of your surroundings. Their are so many items hidden away that really make your life easier. I think i've covered all the main points I would like to adress. I would defintely recommend this game to anyone and it's well worth putting time into. 10/10"

Positive,"If you have patience and can discipline yourself this is easily one of the most enjoyable and rewarding experiences ever. Worth at least 2 playthroughs (easily more) as you will miss things on your first time playing. Highly recommend if you are looking for a vastly replayable, challenging game. World and art design are also very memorable, especially paired with one of the best soundtracks I have heard. Overall, this is easily one of my favourite games of all time.Side Note: I like this game so much I ran around collecting 107 pieces of women's jewlery for an achievement...."

Positive,"This review is for the based game ONLY, not including the DLC content etc! There is nothing really bad to say about the game. I will get this out of the way though. The levels are super linear and don’t connect to other levels. Instead they have elevators and doors that connect to parts of a level you have already been in. These are just shortcuts that don’t actually do anything else but save time. While it is really great that they added these I would have enjoyed the Dark Souls 1 approach of making the levels have branching paths. Coming from Elden Ring & with a lot of practice, Dark Souls 3 felt like one of the easiest souls games I've ever had in my 1st playthrough and leveling up seems pretty quick almost as quick as Elden RIng leveling imo. Not a negative nor a positive just things I want to point out. Otherwise I only have praise. The combat is solid, not as smooth as Elden Rings but still decently playable even in ""today's standards"" as a friend of mine once told me, way better than DS1 by 10x! Bosses fights in the game are all unique & fun to go up against, at least some of them. The ones that are “bad” are just mediocre. Dark Souls 3’s story is really sad and thought provoking but it doesn’t overlap with the gameplay instead telling it through the bosses and the environments as you’re playing the game. The lore can be uncovered by reading the item descriptions but I would recommend just watching a YouTube channel VaatiVidya for that. The music always fits the themes of the game and enhances them to a different level. The game’s atmosphere is not anything special by the impossible standard Fromsoft has set for themselves but it is still recognizable and really immersive and not bad by any means.  Dark Souls 3 is a near perfect game where there are no bad parts but only a few mediocre parts. There are no perfect games but this is absolutely one of those special ones that get so much right and some parts are so close to perfection I just absolutely can’t give it anything else but a true 10/10. Cannot wait to play the DLC soon, and start more NG+ to try out different weapon builds in the coming future...."

Positive,"When Dark Souls was extremely popular, i was never interested in these types of games.To Hard, To much Grind, requires a lot of time to build up and progress and the lore was deeply complex.In todays day and age I welcome thee, and love it. Let the gaming industry fall down into the abyss, let it be devoured by undead developers and usurped by hollowed companies which lack humanity, and passion, for what was once a recognizeable and admirable form of art, that would link the imagination of many, and bring about new, genuine, captivating and sensational games.Let the whole world fall into Darkness so that one day tiny flames dance across the darkness like embers linked by lords past."
Positive,The game equivalent of crushing your penis with a rock
Positive,I want to play this game but controller camera controls makes me want to stuff my hand down my throat.
Positive,Just Yes 🤬
Positive,This shit sucks my balls you already know that I played it more than any other singleplayer game I own.
Positive,This game will make you scream and cry but in a good way.
Positive,"very good game, would play again. i also think that the game is really good, because the game is very good. because this is a very good game, would play this game again because it is really good. would recommend someone else to play this very good game, because i would also play this very good game again."

Positive,I want to hug you so much Fire Keeper for all you've done for me.
Positive,"Definitely get this game no matter what kind of a gamer you are, the reason is apart from the challenge there is fantastic  world to explore. Kudos just for the creativity of the world design and rest of it.In just two years time they developed such a good game while developing bloodborne together . you can have near 100 hours worth of content if you do not rush.It has a fast pace design compared to the other 2 games in the series. also pretty interesting boss designs... There is so much to tell, but yeah one thing I feel that is a down is the PVP. even though its fun I can still see hackers around I guess the publisher doesnt mind all of these actions, cause they ban u more than the hacker or modder.I wish I could get more of dark souls but yeah the epic legacy seems to end here. Also for people even though Demon souls and bloodborne have the same theme and idea doesnt mean they are from the same series a lot of elements of those games are shared but doesnt mean they are connected. Weapons are present everywhere due to From software liking those weapons more than actually having a connected lore behind it"

Positive,"Best souls series game, masterpiece"
Positive,"LEGEDARY.... I'd recommend beating every single boss, makes it a 'one of a kind' experience. Perfect amount of difficulty with a few frustrating areas/bosses but really satisfactory rewards. The ringed city DLC is absolutely incredible as well, the most challenging bosses are in the DLC and only a moron would neglect them. Interesting lore that adds on to the previous games in a fitting way. Overall a really solid experience, go for it! From Software is officially among my top studios."
Positive,"I'm extremely happy with DS3.I enjoyed DS1 and i was so exciting for DS2 however, DS2 was pretty much forgettable from every aspects.so this is why i didn't care about DS3 when it got released but i decide to buy DS3 with DLCS on sale and honestly i had great time with this game.the game got improved from every aspects , however there is some cons which is:-the curve difficulty is weird.-the PC port is meh, if you have mediocre CPU then your pc will struggle TO hit 60fps-some game mechanics are fucking useless like durability and poise-you're going to miss a lot of things in first game so NG+ Is neededthe game is hard but it's not impossible plus almost all extreme hard bosses are optional . overall, DS3 is great game and don't forget to buy the DLCS, they are important ."
Positive,You can sometimes roll in this game.
Positive,"A true masterpiece, my current all time favorite game"
Positive,best game ever

Positive,"Once again From Software establish themselves as experts in crafting beautiful, twisted stories and worlds. The use of music, audio, fantastic character and level design, as well as ""show don't tell"" creates this wonderfully deep, depressing atmosphere, that pulls you in, till you alt+f4.Obviously this game is challenging, but it is fair (mostly). The first boss took me quite a while, rage quitting for months. But I came back. That's the beauty of the game. Sure you can get upgraded weapons and armour, but the most obvious progression is just getting better. You dodge those attacks, parry the strikes and learn the enemies patterns.There are a few irritating sections (poison swamp), but to dwell on them would be a disservice to the fantastic experience FromSoft has made. Don't give up, come back if you quit, get through it. You'll thank me10/10"
Positive,played it a bit here are some things i did-throwing shit at dudes-being shat on-dying repeatedly -people jumping off a cliff after being given garbage-HACCC-bright stones being dropped onto men lying in star formation-more dying-pvp-realizing no matter how much you play this game there is always someone who will be able to kill you easily-FASHION SOULS-running around killing people as squidward-becoming mr.krabs and joining your brethren-looking under the firekeeper's dress for a solid hour-finally reinforcing a dark dark dark sword-killing the great onion man-stealing the bird's armor in exchange for a piece of bone-and finally dying repeatedly by one boss untill you give up the challenge run
Positive,friendship ended with Dark Souls IIIDark Souls III: Cinders is my new best friend now
Positive,Its like drugs it ruin your life but you like it.
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is a masterpiece, and a spectacular way to end the trilogy of Dark Souls. It can be brutal, but the urge to get a little further than last time makes this game almost infinitely replayable. Music is great, and the gameplay is rewarding. One of the best games I ever played. 10/10 would recommend. (I beat the game using Keyboard and mouse on NG, without help. dare you to do the same.)"
Positive,"Played through this game countless times on Xbox One with the awful 30 FPS that sometimes drops below that.  Got a new graphics card for my PC and bought the game on here, oh boy is this game even better now with silky smooth 60 FPS even in all the spots that cause the most slowdown on Xbox.  This is the right way to play this game, and I will complete it countless more times in my life.P.S. I mainly play PvE, PvP in Souls games has little to no interest to me whatsoever."
Positive,"VERY GOOD, I PLAY WITH MATE G SHI. he help me a lot, through thicc and thin . i kill best boss on first try, very easy for me, not so much for my mate g shi he try like 8 times before he kill him. i wish g shi was as good as me on dark soools 3. this is tier 1 on list, maybe better than witcher, but not sure. thanks for everything dark sools. I ENJOY  A LOT"

Positive,I'm tryna see the full tiddy 😡😡Edit: Iam softbanned
Positive,"It would be honestly difficult for me to sum up how much I love this game, along with the entire Souls series, in one review.To keep it brief, this game has helped me through some of the worst times of my life. It offers a whole new outlook on a person's depression. This game, at it's core, is about persistence. To keep challenging these bosses and areas despite the fact that they'll smack you to the ground. If you persist, and learn, you'll accomplish great things.To give up in this game can be akin to ""hollowing"". Going hollow in the souls series is when the undead lose their purpose, give in to their condition. Sometimes going mad. It boils down to them losing themselves. That's what it's like to give in to the condition of depression. It can cause you to lose who you are at your core, and at it's worst you lose yourself in a far more grim way, without going into detail.Playing this game has honestly helped me get up some days. I don't want to hollow, do I? No, I want to keep going, keep getting up, and if it comes to it I'll keep getting smacked down. Getting back up is what counts in this game, and it's what counts if you suffer the same way I do.To conclude, game's great, lore's great, gameplay may be the best in the series and oh yeah it also gave me a different outlook of the world, and myself.Thanks Dark Souls.Edit:good game"
Positive,Dark Souls is the best RPG I've ever played
Positive,"Very naicu gameu , recommend and play like a man . and don't be a filthy casul and use estus in a duel"
Positive,Gorgeous game ahead
Positive,"Really fun and challenging. Don't know why it took so long for me to finally get the game.Just one thing I want to rant about for a little bit is that there is no steam cloud or any other form of cloud saves and this is ridiculous for a game that came out in 2016. So if you lose your local saves then it's all over for you and this really is the last game you'd want to lose your progress on. The saves are stored in ""C:/Users/[your user name]/AppData/Roaming/DarkSoulsIII"" Go make backups!! Other than that I still love this game and would always recommend it."
Positive,this game suck
Positive,i like hitting thing with stick
Positive,This is the Dark Souls of video games
Positive,Very hard but very funny game with beautiful locations great bosses and tons of hours to waste 10/10
Positive,My favorite Souls game next to Bloodborne.-Greatly optimized-Environments look beautiful-Bosses are diverse and unique-Level design very nice-Combat smooth as ever
Positive,Great Gameplay.Great Story.Great Bosses.Great Soundtracks.
Positive,"A great action-adventure game in a dark fantasy setting.  Lots of replayability with the invasion system and all of the different builds you can try out.  Overall this is definitely worth a play, though it should be a bit cheaper considering how long it's been out."
Positive,"When you say that you hate the game, you dont hate the game, because it hates you.When you want to kill the game, it kills you.When you want to die because of the game, it dies first and takes your grave.I will always love it."
Positive,Its like the minecraft combat update
Positive,"I died at forst fighg, i try agin but cannt winning"
Positive,"Ashen one, hearest thou my voice, still?"
Positive,Good game I would say.
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is the final game in the series and it adheres to the formular, if a bit too strictly.The Good:+Solid ARPG gameplay that is difficult but fair. Moreover you can use many different playstyles.+Great Atmosphere and music which really enhances the experience.+Improves upon the foundations of DS 1 and 2.+Great main experience with plenty of optional quests, areas, and bosses.The Bad:-Many issues still persist from previous games, which includes bugs, poor camera, etc.-Multiplayer is still unbalanced. The invader is still heavily favored even though they are risking the least.-Much of the optional content is obscure and might require the help of a wiki.-Many of the main areas are heavily inspired by the original Dark Souls.Bottom Line:Dark Souls 3 is, like the rest of the series, not for everyone. But, those who are willing to invest will find an extremely polished ARPG experience with many ups and downs. Personally, I'm not sure I would rate this above DS 1, but it is certainly far better than 2."
Positive,i still cant get to first boss
Positive,I can't get past the first boss as a sorceror. I recommend this game to people who like stories but I dont like it to much
Positive,why does my character keep revivinglet me die already
Positive,"Compare to previous Dark Souls series, the difficulty has been lowered. Dark Souls 3 is not a so called ""terribly hard game,"" I personally felt 3's difficulty is lowered in order to recruit mroe new Dark Souls players. Don't be afraid from the internet meme ""Dark Souls Difficulty,"" try it out."
Positive,it maybe hard but it is really fun
Positive,THIS GAME IS CLEARLY EVIL 3 !!!
Positive,"Dark Souls isn't a game, it's a way of life."
Positive,Created a unexpected friendship and an amazing experience. 10/10.
Positive,Dank Souls a game made to make you hate your life but so worth it
Positive,This is fun even though i do die sometimes or a lot. I appreciate the challenge it gives and the game play is much faster and has more fluidity to it compared to Dark Souls 1 and 2. If you see it on sale and like to test yourself then i can say give it a chance.
Positive,"best single player game, super ambitious, briliantly atmospheric, jam packed with subtle details and easter eggs, masterful story telling, Schneider legs, lovable characters, checkpoint technology, dog graphics. Zero out of fiveeeeeeeeee."
Positive,"DS3 was my introduction to the souls series and I gotta say I'm hooked. I'm not a huge fan of most RPGs as they focus more on stats and allocating skill points rather than core gameplay mechanics. Dark Souls 3 has none of these draw backs. Sure the game has level ups and stat boosts but they are only there to make sure you keep up with the games pace rather than grind just to attempt the next area. The game is not easy, as my intro to the souls series I got my ass handed to me more than a few times. You will end up cursing developers and throwing controllers (maybe thats just me) but I promise you its worth it. The combat in this game is simple yet satisfying, each attack on its own is very shallow but thats where the player gets to use their own creativity. The game constantly pushes you to develop your own engagement style whether its rush tactics or magic (if ur a pussy). But where the game really shines is in the enemies.The bosses of dark souls play as mean as they look. In most games you see these giant intimidating foes but when it actually comes to fighting them their attacks feel too obvious and broad. As if ur fighting someone in a bulky monster suit struggling to actually be the creature itself and attacking in slow predictable ways. Dark Souls 3 has no time for this pussy shit. The bosses move how they are meant to move they are agile have tight hitboxes and many attack patterns that react to your own choices in spacing and attacking. The amount of memorable moments are insane and will stick with you like no other game has and the satisfacion for winning is unmatched. Highly reccomended for all, definately give this game a try it has a great backbone with its fluid movement and combat, its not perfect there is some horseshit it this game that will annoy you but trust me when I say its all worth it in the end. Have Fun"
Positive,"Challenging. Massive. Rewarding. This game doesn't hold your hand and treat you like a child. It kicks you in the crotch and reaches out a hand to pick you up, before kicking you again while you are down. But when you finally figure out how to stand up and take that Mf'er down. That reward is what this game is. 10/10 visuals, gameplay, story, replayability. Would recomment to anyone who even brought up the word dark or soul without even speaking about this game. Get it. Then GitGud"
Positive,"This is my first game that I played in the soul series, and I gotta say, best game I ever played. If you haven't played the first games I advise you to search for information on YouTube since the storyline can be quite blurry for new players.The graphics, combat system, and story (once you understand it) are amazing, detailed and it is clear that From Software put a lot of good work into it.However, this game is not made for everyone, since you'll have to withstand getting killed over and over again until you're smashing your keyboard against a wall. I highly recommend this game, and praise the sun"
Positive,This game made me quit my job
Positive,i mean its pretty bad
Positive,10/10 would get a scythe again.
Positive,One of the best games I've ever played.
Positive,Dark souls 3 is one of the best games i've ever played .I'm having so much fun in pve and pvp.Difficulty makes that game fun.My only regret is didn't buy dlcs.The game is stunning anyway. I absolutely recommend it.
Positive,Ye it's good
Positive,fire keeper feet 0.0
Positive,This is an awesome game.
Positive,"Prithee, be careful."
Positive,"Incredible game, a beautiful sequel to the saga, and a damn better one than DS2.Gritty, dark, atmospheric, oppresibve, and at the samde time hightly addictive and attractive to players who enjoy a challenge. Try it out, you won{t regret it."
Positive,Putting a toothpick under my toenail and running it into a wall would still give me less pain then playing this game. firekeeper a qtie thoughso 10/10
Positive,"This game is very good, the combat mechanics are complex and difficult at first, but after playing it for about 80 hours you might be able to beat it lolafter all, im just a filthy casual"
Positive,I hate this game.
Positive,BLOODBORNE ON PC PLEASE
Positive,Try finger but hole?
Positive,I love being Merlin while I get my old man spine broken by two bat demons from hell. Makes me pretty hard
Positive,"Initaly my brother had bought this game and i wasnt very interested, but i gave it a try and now i love it."
Positive,"Amazing game. Dark souls 1 was considered a flawed masterpiece, Dark Souls 2 was very polished but lacked the depth that DS1 had. I felt like Dark Souls 3 combined the best elements of 1 and 2 and created the quintessential dark souls experience."
Positive,"Having played Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2, and now Dark Souls 3, I can say without a doubt that this one is my favorite. While Dark Souls (the original) holds a special place in my heart for introducing me to the stunning and interesting world, this game gave me a sense of bittersweet finality. But, I guess I should try to review this in a more piece-by-piece fashion, as I could praise its general greatness all day.(There are going to be spoilers below for areas, but not bosses.)Graphics: ProThe graphics are fantastic in many areas, average in others, but never are they poorly done. Walking into Archdragon Peak, the Grand Archives, or Anor Londo gives a sense of not only the grand scale but also the accompanying attention to detail that these cames carry. Every segment of the game is finely crafted and immerses you in the action. This brings me to my next point.Combat: ProThe combat of Dark Souls 3 can either make or break your experience. At times it is fast paced, while in others it is methodical, however it never loses the trademark intensity of the series. This can frighten new players; many claim that this game is incredibly difficult. However, this is not necessarily the case. Becoming accustomed to the style of the combat and the mindset this game requires will reward one's dedication. The sense of pride and accomplishment one gains from defeating bosses, having died again and again to their titanic weapons or cataclysmic spells, is beyond anything I've experienced in other games. I swear I'm not a masochist.Story/Setting: Potential ConFor those who want a story told to them that has overtly complex and riveting plots, accompanying relateable characters whose motives and actions are deeply fleshed out, and gripping twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat... this game is not for you. However, I have grown to love the lore bites that one can find throughout the world. Following the trail of a bumbling knight throughout the darkest nooks and crannies of the land is enjoyable, but it is just as easy to pass right over him and hardly notice his existence. The same goes for the deep history of the many factions who have affected the world's current, decrepit state. The story of this world is covered in ash; those who seek the truth must dig deep to find it.If you are looking for a story-driven game that appeals to your finer side, Dark Souls 3 is not for you. Overall, I'd recommend this game to any and all who enjoy high fantasy with intense combat and a stunning world."
Positive,"This is one of those games where only the stubborn or skilled will survive. You know you're going to die. A LOT. But you're determined to take it all the way to those end credits, because gosh darn it you said you would."
Positive,This game made me quit my job and consume copious amounts of meth. 11/10 would induce poor life decisions again
Positive,"With over 300 hours,I can proudly say that this is my favourite game of all time along with the witcher 3 and ds1.10/10*Edit*Grammar"
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is a game I keep coming back to, and for good reason: I LOVE this game. Controls are nice and tight. Combat is extremely fluid and relatively easy to pick up. Multiplayer is a blast, especially with friends. Furthermore, the atmosphere, music, and (most) of the bosses are so good that it’s a joy to come back to, especially when trying out new builds.I will give one piece of advice though: Dark Souls 3 (and Souls games in general, really) is all about patience, learning, and timing. If you’re the kind of person who likes to run into the heat of things, you’re gonna end up frustrated and tired out. The two most important things to have when entering an area is a level head and patience. You will still die. You may even be invaded and have your lunch money taken. Do not be discouraged. Souls games are all about the world shoving you, and you shoving back two times harder.Now get out there and do some shoving."
Positive,"The areas are really well made and labyrinth-like but area connections are just linear. Most areas (undead settlement, road of sacrifices, farron keep etc) have horizontal plane layout that do not have verticallity. I absolutely admire DS series but the more i play ds3 the worse it gets to be honest. All new features like weapon arts adds unpredictablity in pvp. speaking of which ds3 has the easiest ""friend"" pvp access with a simple trick: passwords. long needed. If you looking to play with your friends i suggest buying this one. All in all i would still recommend this game but be aware that its not near ds1 level good"
Positive,"Fear not, the dark, my friend.And let the feast begin."
Positive,Quality game. I like the parts where you fight enemies.
Positive,I turned to Christianity because I needed God's help to complete this game.
Positive,"I am the Ember of my SoulAsh is my body, Estus is in my bloodI have consumed over a thousand soulsUnknown to hollow, nor known to CindersI have withstood pain in smashing my controllersAnd these playthrough will never be forgivingAs I pray, Unlimited Dark Souls III Works"
Positive,"So darksouls 3 is my favourite game i have ever played. And after recently finishing the game, all achievements, i can say. Its good. You should play it. Its definitely the easiest souls game so thats good if youre on the fence about it. And it still has an active online community. I am a bit salty that my max soul level character that had every single item in the game got banned. Seemingly because the anticheat thinks that max = cheating but allwell"
Positive,the ringed city is fkin goodmain game is decent but the DLCs make it so much more enjoyable
Positive,I definitely did not level my dex stat to 60 and spam R1 with CCS + 10
Positive,if u like getting rekt hard in the ass while enjoying high quality graphics with awesome bosses and spooky forest. then 100% recommand this.
Positive,Syrup chugging simulator
Positive,"Worth Playing, if you played previous game"
Positive,Be wary of good game.
Positive,Challenging and rewarding best game I have played in a while
Positive,Its nice. Wow!
Positive,I'm still bad.
Positive,"Objectively the best game of 2016, the only issues i see occuring are some crashes but it depends on the person, so personally ive experienced like one or 2 in 300 hours,  great story, addicting gameplay, fun and entertaining multiplayer, great coop, tons of content. liuke seriously one run of the game not 100% is like 40-70 hours, while speedrunning can durastically lower that time, it is only possible for experienced players, the main source of replayability comes from the different builds you can go through the game with, for  example,  my main has the most hours , however, i have a shrek build with a great club, a crusader build i beat the game with a friend who was also a crusader, a boss cosplay build cosplaying the dlc boss, and many more. the graphics, while lacking in some areas are beutiful, and the only noticable lacking comes from playing the game a shitton, meaning you probably wont notice it first time around, the music is incredible, each weopon feels varied and powerful, the armor sets are unique and form a large array of combinations, flaw wise it its  lacking, the only major flaw i can sum up is the connectio n issues between players in pvp, which can lead to some iffy things. however this does not affect the game as a whole, and only affects those who play a lot of pvp,  its level design is interesting and fun, and makes replaying the game that much easier, however compared to dark souls one it is not as immersive, and the main storyline doesnt hold as much impact, but compared to dark souls 2 its a masterpeice, as dark souls 2 was trash,with very few improvemnets, i am glad to say that ds3 keeps the improvements from ds2 and most of teh great mechanics from ds1, and has a lot of fanservice(in a good way) with reacurring weapons and armor sets as well as the continuation of some storylins from ds1, When i said objectivly  that ds3 waas the best game of the year, i mean it, overwatch, for all its prowess, simply doesnt have the content or replayability at THIS point in time to beat ds3, im not saying in the future, but in 2016 dark souls 3 is better, overwatch has a host balancing and competitive issues that simply ruin my motivation to play it, but ds3 doesnt suffer from balance issues, some builds are op, but you rarely encounter them, infact, most builds are dependant on the player skill, not the weapon itself. making it fun and interesting, as well as rewarding."
Positive,"I'm supposed to be playing Dark Souls 3, but this one player keeps kicking my ass"
Positive,*this game is hard.*Git Gud skrub
Positive,didn't think it would suck
Positive,Best git gud ashen one!
Positive,So... you like suffering?You like crying?You like rage quitting?You like broken peripherals?This is your game!
Positive,"play if you are kinky, cuz it hurts"
Positive,It's a fun way to get PTSD10/10 would die again
Positive,"It's a good game, especially if you have friends to play Co-Op with but there is a big issue with the summoning stones, sometimes they work, other times they don't. And the game is good up until you start playing PvP which is nothing short of horrible."
Positive,"""We are amidst strange beings, in a strange land.The flow of time itself is convoluted; with heroes centuries old phasing in and out.The very fabric wavers, and relations shift and obscure.There's no telling how much longer your world and mine will remain in contact.But, use this, to summon one another as spirits, cross the gaps between the worlds, and engage in jolly co-operation!"""
Positive,"By far one of the best games i've ever played. Great bosses, gameplay, soundtrack, and pvp. Great to see it go back to some origins of darksouls 1 gameplay"
Positive,"Well, it's cheaper than Euthenasia I suppose."
Positive,I curled up into a ball in front of the Firekeeper and she laughed at me. 10/10
Positive,"Dark Souls III: Graphics are Great, Music was Pretty Cool and Sounds were nothing really new but Nice. The game is Fun to play, To put hours into and PvP is not bad at all this time around.  The only down side is the Good Ending SUCK's it's Dark Soul's 1&2 ending's rolled into one LAME Ending.  I do recommend this game, Now down to business I would give Dark Souls III a 8 out of 10"
Positive,"This is by far one of my favourite games of all time, and as such I feel like I should review it. I have spent over 500 hours in every nook and cranny of the game, exploring every weapon/shield/bow, all the wepaon arts, spells, miracles, pyromancies, everything you can imagine I've tried. I bought this game expecting to love it an llive up to the hype and it did for the most part, and I did cut it some slack considering how much people were expecting but this is my impression as it has molded and aged since I first started playing. I am a heavy pvp person, but I also like pve so this might be a bit biased in that sense. Also sorry for spelling errors, I wrote this at 3 in the morning. TLDR at the endI bought this game and immediately started playing. I became ""Ill"" So I could stay home and enjoy it. I loved every second of it. It was like playing dark souls 1 (My favorite game of all) With better graphics and new areas! My my first hour I was in love. I had already enjoyed seeing all the new enemies up to the second boss. The main things that stood out to me were that they blended the mechanics from dark souls one, two, and slighlty bloodborne, beautifully. I noticed the weapon arts and I loved them! They were amazing and each weapon had a unique weapon art (Mostly) and it was a whole new world to me. Then I opened my character sheet.I saw that the starting armor for the knight gave me very low poise. I thought that maybe because it was starting armor it wouldn't be very tanky. Nope. I equiped my lothric knight armor and gratshield (I farmed them) and saw I had pretty high poise, so I went to the starting enemies. Useless. Poise had no affect on me being staggered or not. I was extremely disapointed and I gave up my hopes of being a tank, and moved on to the next boss. By around after pontiff I noticed as I was leveling VIT and equipping heavier armor my damage intake was the same. I tested it and defense soft capped at aroound 30 (10 highger than the starting set). I eventually found Smough's set (Heaviest set in the game) And noticed that my defense was still soft capped. I equiped ring of steel protection, and I shad roughly 32 defense. This is what really upset me, they tried to make it like bloodborne in the sense that dodging was better than being tanky. The smallest weapons could stagger you, vastly reducing strength viability in PVE and PVP. I was furious. I've been strength since day 1, and I loved using heavy weapons. In dark souls 2 poise was nerfed but still viable, and defense was godly if you had the stats for heavy armor. I could destroy people with their tiny curved swords, and I looked forward to that in dark souls 3 but I was let down. They tried to make up for it with Hyper Armor (Not being staggered and taking reduced damage while attacking with heavy weapons) but it wasnt the same. They rewareded dex weapon spamming and to make it even worse they made shields unable to be punished! As long as you knew how to block it was very hard to be hit by an enemy or other player. They also morphed estus from ds1 and 2. They took the instant healing from ds1 and the ability to move while drinking from ds2 and made a monster. Without Llloyd's talismen, its near impossible to punish healing in pvp or pve. The plus side is that I was able to change my stats and upgrade a long sword. I also dislliked that Scaling was not as advertised in the equip screen. My heavy broadsword had an S scaling in strength (Highest scaling) and my club had a A, but the broadsword did more scaling damage! Meaning what they told me when I was upgrading my weapons was incorrect. This was just sloppy in my opinion. To top it off, by the end of the game I realized there was a lot of copy paste from dark souls 1. Personally I liked this since I loved DaS1 but some people might see it as fan service and unoriginal. All of this, and the fact that and the fact that the creators are catering to the more casual audience instead of the majority of returning fans just to make more sales make the game a lot less more enjoyable than what it could have beem. These are what turned me off the most, others might think they aren't that bad.I thought the enemies and bosses in Dark souls 3 were very unique, and I enjoyed fighting them. Some spammy enemies were a pain since tanking was nerfed (RIP Haveling) but I eventually got used to timing and dodging. They made pve either 1) Timed rolling and attacking, or 2) Turtling and attacking. This is the esssence of souls games but they took it to an extreme, since if you dont do either of these 2 tactics PVE is EXTREMELY difficult. Bosses were alll new, only a few re-used, and some had very intuitive mechanics that made the fight way more exciting (Abyss watchers, Nameless king, Wolnir, etc). The last boss gave me chills and was by far my favorite fight of all the souls games because of how it related to the player.  It reminded me of all the characters I've made in the past, and how they all blended to form the soul you're fighting, and how the one who stoked the first flame, Gwyn, still had influence.  There are a few things that made me dislike pvp very much in this game. Summoner covenants were ass. I rarely have ever been summoned by blue sentinals or watchdogs oro aldrich. The game rewards spamming dex weapons and cheap weapon combos. I see the same 3 or 4 weapon combos allmost every fight and the game rewards them The game rewards turtling (Hiding behind a shield) The game punishes intuitive builds and creates a cookie cutter meta that makes most other builld unviable N O F U C K I N G P O I S E Fromsoft has shown effort to fix these problems, but not in a definitive way. They make minor changes to expand the meta but nothing concrete has been done. Did I mention poise? This is the main reson shitty weapon combos and spamming is viable. Also defense soft caps. The game rewards ganking Invaders have 30% less health than the host, invade gankers 90% of the time, and can have their only advantage taken away from them by an item that you get for free at firelink Overall invading is shit, and the thrill of killing gank squads has been removed from the game pvp in general is very strict in the sense that if you dont duel with buffs and the same 3 types of weapons youre gonna almost constantly loseAll of this, plus the fact that this is the last souls game. Fromsoft has gone back to ruining metalcore instead of making better souls games (Maybe bloodborne 2 but thats all I can say) so this is what were stuck with unless we go back to a previous game. The pvp gets very old very quick and the community is not helping. Creative builds and tactics are defined by gankers cosplaying and using offhand crossbows. Unique builds are punished and some of the coolest mechanics in the game are shit on by darkmoon blade twinsords/straight sword, greatshield of glory, offhand crossbow, and ""git gud xDDD"". THe game has become a cancer magnet.I loved the fact that playing through the game to make pvp builds wasn't a chore, something dark souls 2 was. Fighting enemies is continuously rewarding, and takes a while to get old. I spent around 150 hours in it over 2 weeks and I still enjoyed playing it. The game has the replayability that dark souls 1 and demon souls had, and introduces hundreds of new enemies to fight. By the end of the game I was already looking forward to my next playthrough. The game also makes co-op very easy, and does not reward backstab/parry fishing which is a huge pro in my book.As a returning souls fan, you will enjoy the pve while the pvp is bad to mediocre at best. For a new player, the pve may seem difficullt but you'll grow into it and pvp will seem fine. 6/10."
Positive,"This game is probably one of the most solid entries in the Souls series. It doesn't make any major missteps, the level design is consistently good and aside from one lategame boss the bosses themselves are all serviceable.It's a game that doesn't do a whole lot wrong, but it doesn't do anything spectacularly either. Whereas Dark Souls 1 could be very up and down, it had lots of really memorable and amazing moments. DaS3 is kinda like DaS2 in that a lot of it's most important moments end up being kind of forgetable and this is especially the case with boss theme music. In fact the music has the exact same problem as 2 did; it all just blends together into a mush and you can't remember anything. But you can say the same for the bossfights in general; outside of one or two near the end of the game they're all just kind of... there. They're not bad or anything but they don't stand out either. This is kind of exemplified with the final boss fight; it's mechanically a really, really good fight (it's not fucking nashandra or allant basically). But there's none of the emotional build-up and impact of DaS1 or Bloodborne, despite the game trying it's best to copy aspects of the final fight in 1.EDIT: Since replaying the game fairly recently I'd reconsider some of the boss fight criticism. 3 in general has pretty strong bosses from a mechanical standpoint, arguably the strongest line-up in the series alongside Bloodborne. However the music is still substandard for most of them. I can remember the Abyss Watchers theme and that's about it; everything else is the same orchestral choir singing with far too many instruments going off at once and no discernable melody or hook to grab you.And that's really the only major flaw with this game. It's the 5th in a series, of which we've been getting 1 of each year for the past 3. I think there's immense replayability in the Souls formula, but at this point the Dark Souls setting is starting to get old. The reuse of so many different weapons, items, NPC's and enemies ends up hurting the game more than helping it. Not just in a sense of it being shallow pandering fanservice, but it actively hurts one of the main draws of the series: exploring and finding new things and new lore. I struggled throughout my playthrough to stay engaged for long periods of time because I was finding the same shit I'd always found, talking to same or very similar NPC's with no new twists and finding the exact same lore for the most part.DaS3 really suffers if you've played BB or are already really invested and familiar the series. The callbacks could either be really fun to you, or they could make your eyes roll and wish for something new. Thing is we already got something new. BB used aspects and cliches of the series, but so much of it felt fresh and it was in a genuinely new and interesting setting and it was released a year previously. It already kind of felt like From and the Souls series had moved on, or were at least attempting to try interesting spins on the formula. But DaS3 ends up feeling like a step backwards.That might not be a bad thing for you though and DaS3 is certainly not a bad game. I'm just very tired of the Dark Souls setting and didn't think any numbered sequels were ever neccessary. If you have less experience with the series, don't care as much and haven't played Bloodborne then this could easily be your fav of the series and you'll probably love a lot of things in it."
Positive,"I was extremely skeptical about buying this game as I have never played any previous Dark Souls titles.  After a good long think, I eventually decided to buy it and refund it if I disliked it.   Lets just say it's now my favourite game."
Positive,Simply amazing i am veteran to the souls series and i think dark souls 3 is the best one yetit has the things i loved about dark souls 1 aka the amazing bosses lore and npc quest lines it felt new but also strangly familiar this is certinaly my new favorite game 10/10
Positive,"the feeling of exploration and discovery is as good as ever, The port could use some work but it's certainly an improvement over previous games."
Positive,"This is my first souls experience, and it is NOW MY FAVORITE GAME.. If you're looking for a fun, challenging, beautiful game. Dark Souls is for you!9.5/10"
Positive,"The first Dark Souls' feel and mechanics combine with Bloodborne mechanics to create one hell of a sequelBeware of release day glitches, save often"
Positive,The real sequel of Dark Souls
Positive,"Technically and lore wise the best Dark Souls of the series, the perfect game to end the trilogy, fun and challenging as always and with a lot of content, especially considering the two beautiful expansions."
Positive,"Best game I've played in the past years. Both the content and dlc is worth the price, community is amazing and a well thought game over all."
Positive,absolutely love this game cured all my depression and gave me another reason to look forward to life
Positive,"So I finally did the true + ending of the game, I honestly loved dark souls 3, the aesthetics (scenery/maps) and the intricacy of  completing many areas. I highly recommend it."
Positive,"nearly gave up after first boss, but just put the pad down, waited 10 mins then beat him on my 12th go , no other game infuriates you so much then gives you a great sense of euphoria as you win.Souls games never gonna be for everyone, but if you have the patience you will enjoy"
Positive,"In short, the cleanest dark souls experience. This game really doesn't try and stop you from being good at the game. The mechanics work as intended and the gameplay and story are superb; a must buy."
Positive,"It's Dark Souls. It'S FRIGGIN DARK SOULS!What more do I need to tell you!? ""GIT GUD""?!"
Positive,Its BOOTY but you'll want this BOOTY at a discount. If it ever goes back on sale that is.....
Positive,If you hate it stop and come  back  to it. if  you still hate it stop and come back to it again. one  day you will appreciate it as we all do. for it is glorious.
Positive,"Very snappy combat, surprisingly rich and deep lore, beautiful if very desolate graphics. Overall, a satisfying way to end the Dark Souls series."
Positive,Just when I thought I was out... they pull me back in.
Positive,"I am addicted, lost my job, my wife, my kids and my sanity to this game. Totally recommend it 100% 10/10"
Positive,This game is simply a Masterpiece; I love this game with all my heart and for so many reasons that I couldn't begin to put into words.Play this game and don't give up.Overcoming a challenging boss has to be the greatest reward in of in itself.
Positive,"This game saved my life.I am 33.My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.Thank you"

Positive,"My friend joined the military and was wanting to get into the souls series before he got shipped out, thanks to them not fixing the servers at a reasonable time we were never able to play, he will be back in 15 months and Im starting to think by the time he gets back it will still not be fixed. Thanks, I wanted to get my friend into this game and bond before he was goneEdit: About damn time, its finally back up"
Positive,One of the best games I have ever played.
Positive,"""Oh, dear, another dogged contender. This spot marks our grave, but you may rest here too, if you like..."""
Positive,*brrraaaaap* oops sorry
Positive,"I love the damn game, but it keeps crashing now. Ever since I reached the third boss in the game I keep getting white screens of death. WTF. There's no fix or patch for it yet, and from what I've been reading it has affected a lot of people. I really want to play the game, because I like it quite a bit. But cmon!!"
Positive,"As a singleplayer it's okay, though not a good port. The story makes no sense, people will tell you it's cryptic and deep but in reality it's hogwash. But the story never gets in the way of the gameplay, and that's good. Co-Op seems broken, it's way too easy to play the game through with a friend. Bosses fall like nothing. The Co-Op function is also half-baked, it would be nice with some proper implementation of the mode, where you could play through the entire game with a buddy without him being a spirit, and while also getting a boost in difficulty.The community is horrible, if you want the ""full"" experience then you'll need to play online. That means opening yourself up to be invaded. There are two types of people you can get invaded by; Cheaters (rare), and low-life who do nothing but grind the same areas in the same level all night, with a min-maxed character build they read about online, ganking passing PvE players. In the beginning there used to be honor, people would duel 1-on-1. That doesn't happen anymore. It's a cesspit.When you aren't getting invaded, the game can be a lot of fun, if you're into this type of game. There's loads of mysteries and secrets. Feels old-school, complete with the clunky controls and everything. Get it on sale, and I'm sure you'll get plenty of hours of enjoyment out of it. Just know that this fun comes with a bunch of caveats."
Positive,"One of the only Dark Souls games I've played repeatedly because I enjoy it so much. Playing this game blind is ideal, once you get your first playthrough in, the game will be so much simpler the second time through. But the first time.. omg the tenseness of some boss fights, not knowing what is coming next? Amazing."
Positive,I love this game no words to describe it. The gameplay is awesome when you over come a challenge you are filled with joy and when a boss beats you you will litteraly be furious and give it another shot. The sceneries are absolutely stunning. Usually in games today you will almost get hand lead to the end of the game the games arent even hard anymore. This game does not feel that difficult when you are playing it. It actually seems fair and you thorougly enjoy beating it. I will give this a 9/10 best game i have ever actually played.
Positive,"-1 for the lack in variety of viable pvp builds.-1 for the lack of Common Fruit various flaws like almost no sense in going to NG+ and further, almost no interesting game mechanics like power stances or bonfire ascetics, weakness of magic in duels and so on.This game is pretty ok, but online is not that big anymore (~6k players) and you'll wait hours until you get your 3v3.So, I'll give it 8 gangbangs out of 10."

Positive,"Love every fiber of the Ds3. Other comments did say you would die 'over and over again', and honestly that was an understatement. However I enjoy reflecting on what I did wrong and proved to fix it in order to move on ahead. The game loves to show you the boss of the area from the start from afar, so when you actually reach there you can look back and be proud of what you've accomplished. If it's one thing I love most about this game. its the scenery. There's never an area that lacks detail. All the while fighting insanely hard enemies, you kind of accept the fact that you're in a gorgeous hell. You're welcome to go the ol strength sword build, but feel free to mix it up from time to time from the large variety of builds. Currently I'm enjoying the Miracle build, and never knew how many bosses were weak to lightning..   I feel that it is unfair that weapons that balance the builds are all put into the dlc. However I don't own any dlcs. My encounter with them during invasions have crippled me. Whether it be lack of experience, or just incompetency.For instance the Ringed Knight Paired Greatswords. I'm not saying it's impossible to defeat a user, and I would suspect it would be easier to parry given dual wields always seem easier to parry (In my opinion), but the sword out put is insane, and the range is phenomenal. A few other dlc items I would say that breaks the game would be Demon scar, or Lightning Arrow. Although Lightning Arrow doesn't really break the game as much as the others, Miracle's down side are usually the slow cast time. With this miracle I feel that the quick casting can make others panic roll and you can catch them at the end of their endurance. And Demon Scar makes pyromancy more offensive. I find it best served with Black Serpent. You'll always get at least one hit in. Demon Scar is a way better counter part than Sacred Flame. All in all, though my review was more of a rant, I would highly recommend this game. I would probably give the base game 8/10. As a tip to serious buyers, the red glowing lines on the ground are community tips. Be wary, not all of them are as helpful as you would like."

At the beginning of the game it's a bit overwhelming, but when you make progress and look back you are filled with satisfaction. Also every time you beat a boss you get a nice feeling. 10/10 would recommend to a friend or anyone considering buying the game. (I have only played DS3 and it would be fun to play the other games.)

Positive,Hands down one of the best games ive played by far.
Positive,well as a long time souls fan boy I feel like I have to say this game is the shit but this game is the shit so yeahunfortunately for me tho dark souls doesn't like it when you copy save files (I reinstalled windows and tried to keep my saves) and it reset me back to square 1. still a fire game just like all the other souls games but I especially like the bloodbourne elements in this one 8/10 not enough overpowered lightning spears
Positive,"Difficulty that surpasses many other games, even of its genre. Rewards players for timing, exploring, and using your head instead of button mashing, weapons have weight and each enemy holds their own. Boss fight music makes you feel like you're taking on the world and when you beat a boss it feels as though you conquered the world. Would recommend this game for the substance, difficulty and the accursed journey itself. 10/10"
Positive,"Good game, I rate this a 9/10 few bugs that could be fixed but it's a soul game."

Positive,Dark Souls 3 is a great game with a ton of replay value. It has the great depth and quality of the other games and far less bugs and issues. Graphically it's well off and coop works well. I'd rate it 9/10.
Positive,"Welcome to Dark Shades, where nothing is vibrant except for your constant bloodshed as you come to realize that dying is the objective of the game. Spend 10 hours on the beautifully precise character creation screen only to watch your glorious masterpiece wither before your eyes that are probably stinging from the harsh lighting in your room at night when you fail once again to slay Gundyr, or at least the easy Gundyr. Also Yhorm is big.     10/10 Would die only to die only to die only to die only to die again."
Positive,"Darksouls is the best gaming series ever. While Darksouls 3 may not be the best entry in the series, it's still super fun! I would go as far as to say that its better than any non-souls game out there. After having experienced souls games and playing other games I often find myself wishing they were more like Darksouls. For someone new to the Darksouls series I think Darksouls 3 is the best place to start. (Especailly since Bloodborne isn't available on Steam). To put it in perspective I'll make a quick breakdown of each Souls game here:Darksouls 1 - Definitely dated mechanics, even with the remaster. Pvp is so easy to abuse and so poor quality that its not satisfying at all. What makes it worth playing is the interconnected world and the lore. The seamless and thoughtful way that the map is put together makes exploring very enjoyable and open in a way that makes you feel free. And being able to discover Lordran through item descriptions and NPCs still seems fresh after all these years. The following games didn't quite capture the lore in the way that this one did.Darksouls 2 - Funnily, kind of the opposite of Darksouls 1. The mechanics are probably the best in the series. The deliberate pacing and the way that your character controls allows for skill and talent to express themselves fully. This makes the pvp some of the best in the series, once you have achieved a level of competence. Unfortunately, the story and other pve elements suffer a lot. The map is probably the blandest in the series, going back to a hub design that feels somewhat like it's on rails. The enemies and most of the bosses are kind of bland and probably some of the easiest in the series, but the developers make up for it by shoving a ton of them together at once. Definitely quantity over quality. Its not all bad though, some of the bosses are genuinely enjoyable, you just have to sift through a lot of muck to find the gems. The DLCs are also worthy of note, and enjoyable.Bloodborne - All around solid game. The combat feels visceral, the world feels open, and the H.P. Lovecraft based lore is super cool. This is a great introductory game to the series as it reinforces good gameplay habits that carry through most of the other games. Darksouls 3 - This is kind of an amalgamation of the games that came before it. Its good enough, but gets a little hung up on nostalgia bating. The lore is on point but doesn't take any risks. The world seems larger than it is, which ends up being pretty good. New players might feel a little lost going through some of the maps because of their scope, but  they will never flounder long because the next bonfire is always close by. Pvp is also pretty decent. There are a few issues with it that prevent it from being as good as Darksouls 2. For example the roll takes very little stamina, so it can make it easy to mindlessly avoid people instead of trying to engage efficiently. The mechanics in this game are a little on the forgiving side which makes pvp slightly less skill based. Initially I was disappointed because it controlled more like Bloodborne than like the previous Darksouls games, but over time the mechanics have grown on me. Altogether a very solid game."
Positive,if i had to describe this game with only 2 words then i would say: YOU DIED
Positive,thats a good
Positive,"difficult but fair, its nice"
Positive,"this game is not like other games, you will hate it, you will rage quit it, but you will always come back to beat it."
Positive,be wary of amazing game
Positive,"Amazing game, with great graphics and plenty to do! Currently playing through NG+'s with a different build each playthrough."
Positive,"One of the greatest games I have ever played and easily one of the most replayable. The only lame thing about this game is how small the active co-op and pvp scene is these days, so If you are looking for a co-op experience I would reccomend playing with a friend! :)"
Positive,"Dark Souls III is without a doubt one of the best games I've ever played. It gave me the same effect that playing Dark Souls for the first time did. If you are returning to the Souls series, this is my personal favorite.  If you are new and just want to start with Dark Souls III, then watch the trailer that made me fall in love instantly!"
Positive,You'll love it and hate it. Totally worth it.Ones hatred soon turns into love.
Positive,"Its good, if you like getting gangbanged."
Positive,A good sequel.
Positive,Welcome Home Ashen One 😿😭
Positive,"Surprisingly it's really good. Combat is very well done, wish magic was a bit stronger, though. Obviously there are minor bugs, but nothing game-breaking. Gud geam."
Positive,Dark Souls III: Infinite Stamina Edition
Positive,"Miyazaki returns yet once again to bring us another souls game. Is it as good or better as the first Dark Souls or even Demon's Souls? no.  Is it as good or better than Dark Souls 2? In ways, yes. Is it still an amazing game? yes. Buy it."
Positive,"Hey guys JACKS BACK AT IT AGAIN. TODAY were talking about the infamous BLOOD i mean Dark souls 3 yes Dark soul 3. In this Review you will get to see all the amazingly new additions to the game from bloodborne. SO lets start, Dark souls 3 is the next title to the Bloodborne triliogy ending up in the fact that this game is just a re skin from Bloodborne and not really dark souls 1 or 2 (shudders at the thought of 2) with this game you will get invaded by T posing invaders and we all know what that means, you can't react or do anything against them you might as well hit the alt + f4 button because your chances of beating them when they chug on ther SUNNY FUCKIN D is impossible son. Lets get away from the online though. the NPCS are even more ridicoulous as i walk into any area enemies have BULLSHIT strats that make oyu think. ""yeah lets go grab that jug of bleach and just drink up boys."" or the fact that there bloodborne aggro like makes it impossible for a game thats dark souls speed. All in all I guess you could say From soft really made a great port for bloodborne to pc and slapped a new name on it."
Positive,"Oh, where to begin.Before I start, I just want to say that I think this is the most well thought-out, well designed Dark Soul's game. The level design itself will throw you off so often that you feel as though you're almost always lost. A single path can split into three or four different paths. The only downside I have with this game is that some deaths can feel unfair because an enemy ""grabs"" you instantly kills you or breaks your guard and hits you over and over until you're dead without giving you a chance to do anything about it.There were plenty of moments where my heart was racing as if I had just been running away from the cops in a high speed chase going 150 MPH.9.5/10 because it's the same old Dark Souls we know and love but made better than 1 and 2."
Positive,"+Great level design+Much more polished gameplay in comparison with Dark Souls 2+No adaptability stat+No health loss after death+Improved graphics+Combat has become faster (no so fast as it was in Bloodborne though, but still)+Interesting bosses with challenging and unique mechanics+No soul memory+Epic music as always+Comfortable to play with Steam ControllerFortunately, I haven't been experiencing crashes or framerate drops (i5 760, R9 290, 16GB RAM), but some people claim the game is almost unplayable for them. I hope From will fix their problems as soon as possible. The game itself is definitely way ahead of Dark Souls 2 in terms of almost everything. Every controversial mechanic was fixed and improved. I can really recommend this game to every single Dark Souls fan out there! It's worth it."
Positive,not very hard
Positive,played a lot on ps4 the best dark souls in my opinion
Positive,"It took me 1000 hours, but I finally beat Iudex Gundyr."
Positive,"Praise the sun. Well, it'll take awhile to praise it because of how long it took to get to the damn altar."
Positive,omg so hard
Positive,"To casuals, this game might be considered difficult. However to me, this game was very difficult."
Positive,big pp game
Positive,"The one and only way to describe the game!This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skillFifteen percent concentrated power of willFive percent pleasure, fifty percent painAnd a hundred percent reason to purchase the game!!"
Positive,"Great game, has entertaining PvE and PvP. Combat is the main selling point. High difficult with an extremely high expectancy to die often since the game is about learning the areas and adjusting. Enemies respawn when you die/rest to restore your potions (you get restorable HP/mana potions basically). You also lose all your souls (in-game currency) when you die although if you manage to make it back to where you die you can reclaim them all. If you die again before reclaiming your souls they're lost forever. Decent variety in what you can do PvP wise. You can invade other player's games using the red orb in which case you can get ember (increased hp and ability to summon other people into your game) as well as an item to unlock rewards from a covenant (NPC-based guild basically). You can also be summoned to protect people in their world against those invaders to earn a different reward for a different covenant. The remaining options in this type of PvP is to be the host (person who's being invaded) and fight or summon other players to protect you. The other type of PvP is a duel/fight club mode. You can summon/be summoned to duel somebody in your world or their world depending on who summoned who through an item you get that lets you place a summmoning sign on the ground. There are also 'fight clubs' that players make by summoning a bunch of people and letting them duel each other. This is most apparent in a later part in the game on a castle area that's fitting for dueling.Pros:PvP is very enjoyable and skill-based, although some balance issues with certain weapons, but overall a balanced game where you can upgrade most weapon and be viable in PvP. Spacing, maximizing i-frames during rolling, playing to your weapon's strength (animation speed, super armor, range, stunlock etc), and stamina management are the key parts of PvP.PvP has limits on who you can invade/help that takes into account how good your gear is and the game automatically scales down people who exceed the range. This only happens when you and a friend set a password to bypass the restriction as far as I know.PvE is surprisingly enjoyable as well coming from a person who loathes PvE in the majority of games. The knight type mobs are my personal favorite since they function somewhat like a player. There are also NPCs that can invade your game like normal players that function a lot like an actual player.Cons:Some weapons have questionable balance like the Estoc at least in lower tier PvP in the game. You basically spam thrust with it and can melt people.The way the game calculates damage makes mixed damage weapons pretty bad. Quality builds (STR/DEX) or builds that combine STR or DEX with another stat like INT or Faith are mainly king in PvP. This reduces the variety in build opportunities that hopefully will be patched to let elemental infusions be worth it.For PvPers, there is mild phantom range when fighting, but that is to be expected in this type of game since it'd be pretty miserable if you had to perfect connect with the enemy's model to do damage. Fights would drag on forever.PvP invasions can be frustrating for both sides when one side refuses to fight. If you're invading it's often 1v2 or even 1v3 meaning the host just turtles back while spawning an infinite amount of people to help them should somebody protecting them dies if you can't catch them while they're fighting a mob (invaders don't interact with npcs unless the host uses a special item that cancels that). Invaders can at least return home using an item, but if you're the one invaded it can be frustrating if the invader refuses to initiate vs you and turtles at the NPCs you need to advance. Invasions are only enjoyable when it becomes 2v2/3v3 or etc.*Minor con* Game could use more sets to spice up the customization since personally I only find about 3 sets visually appealing although there at least is a decently large selection to choose from. Comes down to preference and again is a minor con if not a con at all depending on your taste/preferences.*Minor con* Another minor con is it'd be nice if the game just had a straight up PvP arena you could queue for with matchmaking and such. Would make dueling easier and more consistent since one issue I have with dueling is that you have finite HP/FP (basically mana) and eventually have to rest or rejoin/die if in another world.Pro or Con:There's lore and such throughout the game, but it's not much of a hardcore story driven game like many other RPGs. Low amount of cutscenes with the game being more adventurous trying to figure out where to go and finding loot. This wasn't a con for me since I personally don't often play games for their story given I prefer PvP over anything.Armor doesn't mean much as long as you're at least wearing a piece in each slot. No significant difference in tankiness between armor. If you prefer more variety in builds this could be a con since there's no big enough difference for speed vs tankiness being an option as long as you weigh less than 70. This also however means you can wear whatever you think looks cool giving the game's customization more variety.Controller is highly recommended for this game. This is can be a con if you prefer kb+m. I prefer kb+m and adapted quickly to the game's controller and enjoy it a lot. You probably still could use kb+m, but I think you'd need to play around with the key binds first."
Positive,"FromSoftware has given us the wonderful gift of Dark Souls 3 and all of its, ""Your gunna die boy.""  Joking aside, Dark Souls 3 has by far been the most enjoyable experiance I have played in a souls game.  With its new face, new pace, and new weapon art sytsem, Dark souls 3 deviates from the norm, but at the same time staying close enough to home for experianced souls players.         PREFORMANCE I have not experianced any form of crashing while playing this game, the framerate never changed and was smooth as butter.  That being said, people are reporting about crashing and what not, I run a Nvidia GTX960, and I had no problems, make sure to cross refrence your configs with people who are crashing just to make sure you don't have the same problems. GAMEPLAYAll of the core elements of a souls game is here, for those who wanted more Dark Souls 1 in your Dark Souls 2, this is for you.  In fact, to sum this game up, it's just one GIANT homage to Dark Souls 1. Everything to the attack animations to the walk and run cycle feel like they were ripped out from Dark souls 1, polished, then put into Dark Souls 3, I for one love it.  Vertans of Dark Souls 2 can still easily get behind this game, just be warned about the new pacing, it might throw you off a bit, but with some practice you'll be able to easily pick it up. Veterans of BloodBorne, well you might be a little bit bored with the pacing, but don't fret! Dark Souls get its diffuculty from methodical enemies such as the knights in the game, and their GOD DAMN SHIELD BASHING, EVERY STUPID TIME.  Seriously though, if your a fan of BloodBorne you might very well love the Dark Souls series, just keep in mind it's not as fast, that doesn't mean it will be easy though!      The biggest feature of Dark Souls 3 combat has to be the new weapon arts, cool and flashy as hell, just what I like.  They do change the game though, in both a PvE and PvP standpoint.  PvE it gives a whole new range of tactics and combos. And in  PvP, new abilites to kill people to, ranging from lunging attacks to heavy downward swings.  I don't know about you but the stupid Ultra Greatsword upward strike gets me everytime, I don't know why, I just can't seem to dodge it.  STORY I'm not spoiling anything, you'll just have to play the game.  Dark Souls is very...subtle in its story telling.  All I am going to say is take in the environment, talk to everyone you can, read item descriptions, everything has a reason, you might very well be surprised what you find.CONCLUSION Dark Souls is not for everyone, it will put you down, and keep you down, the only way you are going to see those end credits is if you grit your teeth and push through the storm of hurt that is Dark Souls 3.  By far GOTY right here.  RATING 10/10"
Positive,"despite name, very large lack of souls that would be considered dark. like 8/10 lol"
Positive,holy shit that's a masterpiece
Positive,"As a fan of Dark Souls, I can say that this is definately my favorite of the series.  It has the quality in story and atmosphere of the first game, better visuals than the second game, and the more fast paced play of BloodBorne.  Essentially Dark Souls 3 takes all of the good and none of the bad from the last games in the series.Boss fights are incredible, and some of my favorite fights of the entire series are from this game.It took me around 38 hours to finish my first playthrough, and I'm sure I missed some stuff along the way.  The long and short of it: this game is absolutely worth it at full price.  It's been a long time since I've said that about any game, but this one can't be missed.If you need me, I'll be here on my second playthrough.  PRAISE THE SUN! \[T]/(Also, my rig specs are: GTX 970 4GB, 16GB RAM, i7 4790k overclocked 4.4Ghz.  I had solid 60 fps all the time on ultra settings aside from a few hiccups when loading)"
Positive,"I give a cautious recommendation -- this is a decent, if highly frustrating, action game without a particularly strong personality, and you won't miss anything if you skip it.Upon completing Dark Souls III, I'm struck with a peculiar feeling of emptiness.  There are startling vistas to gaze upon, true, and many, many things to do, but in the end it feels like a collection of left-over parts -- though fine parts they may individually be -- from other games.  And while it is a more cogent and polished production than the potluck that is DS2, it still lacks any of the original entry's burning soul.  I believe DS3's various dullnesses, as well as its jarringly fast gameplay, are merely products of a blind and halfhearted groping after fan expectations of difficulty and obtuseness.  What business do ultra-comboing humanoid bosses à la Devil May Cry have in a game with player-character movement this sluggish?  They don't have any, and thus it all feels terribly off.  If that level of speed is what you want, play Sekiro -- which is a far better game than this one."

Positive,best game ever made
Positive,"Helps me relax after work, a very fun comfort game"
Positive,"Really good, took what DS1 did and made it way better. The entire game is made to make you think you couldn't beat the game but you actually can. The landscape and atmosphere is so perfect in every area. Dude, as a music theory nerd the music for this game is so freaking good. If you don't get the game you should at least listen to the OST"
Positive,haha death go brrrr :(
Positive,multiplayer servers are back on :crabrave:toss them your monies (:
Positive,"10/10 Absolute masterpiece.  Don't let the perceived difficulty fool you.  Dig in and give it an honest shot and I promise you, this will become your favorite game ever... Until you play Elden Ring."
Positive,"DS3 is perfect for beginners to get into souls borne games. You are getting free game with a full OST album Dodging and rolling away is the key, parry is optional but can be quite fun if you get the timing right. DLC's are chef's kiss. Boss fights are great because of the character designs of the bosses as well as their move sets. Sure, it can be frustrating at times, just take a break then come back you will be able love it more.Would definitely recommend playing before Elden Ring."
Positive,"Paid and played every single Dark Souls game. But never got past first few bosses without giving up out of anger. Bought Elden Ring and now I cant get enough of these games. It jsut keeps calling me to play the damn game. Cant stop thinking about them now. Once you take the time to finally figure out the mechanics, you wont stop playing."

Positive,"I don't know why you're looking for Dark Souls 3 reviews in 2022, but this is a very good game and you probably know this already.I'm writing this review because I'm reinstalling the game to play the pokemon mod (pocket souls) for it. If the first line didn't sell you, we both know this one just did."
Positive,rollin rollin rollin rollin and im rollin rollin rollin rollin
Positive,"if you enjoy CBT, you'll probably enjoy this game. But why would you do this to yourself. Seriously. Just get a brick and throw it onto yourself, it'll be the same experience.Pretty good game"
Positive,10/10 would try finger but hole again
Positive,dont play this game
Positive,"Inshah Alllah , Miyazaki played well."

Positive,"Dark Souls III is one of those games that will put your patience to the test. It will make you angry sometimes but once you've accomplished something in the game it is the greatest feeling ever. I was much more intrigued from this game than Dark Souls 2 because I thought the combat was much more responsive and not clunky. The bosses were damn amazing and some were super challenging. They added weapon arts for the weapons and I thought that was a huge plus in my book. Also, it is much more easier to find players to co-op with. PvP is better than DS2 although sometimes you will match with people with their unbearable lag but I gotten used to it.There is also many weapons you can play with and many builds to experiment with. I've beaten this game about 5 times and still go back to it just to help people fight certain bosses. If you're looking for a game that will kill time then this is the perfect game for you. You won't be disappointed. 9.8/10 Great game!!!!!"

Positive,Unforgiving but worth the initial roadbumps.
Positive,wtf why is this game so good and addicting???edit: it's alright
Positive,Dark Souls 3 offers the most polished version of the familiar DS formula. A must have for any fan of the series.
Positive,Better than Elden Ring
Positive,"""YOU DIED ""are the two words that you will read every 5 min.playing this game is more like self-punishment.yet it is absolutely gorgeous game.cheaters are all over the PVP -_- which means a lot of people sucks in this game. frame rate drops in long gaming session but it is fine.                             *o* LOVE IT *o*"
Positive,"Pay no attention to the chorus of pompous, basement dwelling nerds. This is by far the best game in the Dark Souls series. If you like PVP, it is endlessly replayable, and the ""story"" is deep and vague enough to keep you interested for a long time. At this point, it's pretty cheap when it's on sale. I can't imagine regretting this game as a purchase. It's a no brainer."
Positive,"It's a relaxing game, suitable for everyone.10/10"
Positive,"It's good, but not as good as DS1 ;)"

Positive,"Amazing game! I have loved the Soul series since Dark Souls 1, and this (Dark Souls 3) is REALLY good! I do recomend everyone to buy and play this game!"
Positive,Dark Souls III takes what makes the first one good and improves it a lot.Story is on par with the first one and the gameplay is far smoother as well.Dark Souls III is a fantastic game and I highly suggest buying it if you're a fan of the first one.

Positive,"The prettiest yet weakest of the 3 IMHO. DS3 is everything you'd expect from a DS game but there's less of it, much less. I suppose thats the trade off for the graphical improvments, not one i'd make myself but I am not the king of FromSoftware.  It's essentially more DS with a new magic system and a return to the feel of the first game, with the exception of a few random easter eggs, acts as though DS2 never happened. Still a brilliant game with enough meat on it to still be considered a big game, It is dwarfed by the first two though in square footage.https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Priority-One"

Positive,git gud aga
Positive,"Well, it's here and it's a welcome return to form from From (try saying that when you've had a few drinks). At the core this game seems to have recaptured the old magic of the first Dark Souls, without resorting to just being a reskinned clone with a new map.The gameplay is fundamentally similar to the other two entries, albeit with some notable differences. All weapons now have ""skills"", some of which are shared between similar weapon types but usually confer new, devastating movesets or temporary bonuses such as increased poise or slow HP regen. These all consume a new stat, FP (focus points) which is shared with spellcasting. This new dynamic does improve the variety of gameplay vastly, although I feel magic has been somewhat left out of this, not getting the same bang for your FP buck, but maybe I'm not far enough in yet. Combat is also faster paced and more fluid, meaning you have to be even more careful than before about making yourself vulnerable.From a technical standpoint I think From have overall done a commendable job on making a PC version of this game, albeit with a few post launch bugs I've heard of along with minor networking issues but I've yet to find anything game breaking or even just more frustrating than the game itself. Graphically speaking it's pretty but I have noticed a few frame drops on my mid/high range system so I can't speak for those playing with older hardware. I have to give particular praise to something I haven't seen mentioned much, native integration of the Steam Controller. From have done a marvellous job in creating a smooth and comfortable control scheme taking full advantage of what the controller has to offer (having said that, given the way camera input works on it, I imagine KBM users have far from been left in the dark here, especially with regards to the way previous games handled targetting).Overall I think From have managed to recoup the atmosphere and tension (and indeed teeth grinding frustration) the original Dark Souls offers. This is truly the successor to the series I wanted, and while I would like to see more games in the future, this would be a worthy send off for a truly unique game series and I would have no regrets."
Positive,Servers Back!!! I don't feel like typing out the whole review again. Whats there to say. It's great. Buy it. Now.
Positive,this game is great. good for beginners who like a fair but difficult challenge with amazing world building and cool bosses
Positive,"Is Pretty good, but is jus game."
Positive,Excellent game. Not for people that give up easily. Hugely rewarding for those who stick with it.
Positive,"Mechanically, this is the best Dark Souls game in the trilogy. Lots of weapons, revisit old familiar places from the first game. Lots of familiar items and lore references. Fun bosses.The story is meh. And the new schtick with mutually exclusive NPC quest lines, as well as requirement for NG+ and NG++ to collect all the item variations, is only there to extend the play time without adding any actual content. Also, the main character's lighting is weird; the face looks ugly no matter what you do, and it's especially bad if you stand near any NPC, it's as if it's covered in crude oil or something. Also, the clothing is weirdly thick and cartoonish looking, there's barely any normal looking armor pieces that look good for some reason, so it's the weakest entry for Souls Fashion aficionados.The music is also very forgettable to me. However, the sound design is fantastic; the barefoot footsteps are like an ASMR."
Positive,Dark souls 3 out of 10 :D
Positive,10/10 plin plin plon made me cry
Positive,"It's too easy as is, glad ""Cinders"" mod fixes it! Enjoyed it waaay more with the mod."

Positive,"100+ days without multiplayer.They, also, removed the multiplayer tag of the steam page.This behave says that they will not fix it, just like elden ring stuttering.!!!! Ps: They fixed it, I can't believe it !!!!"

Positive,john dark soul = good game
Positive,how do i get out of firelink shrine
Positive,"An absolute gem of a game. Took me 5 years of owning the game to finally complete it and I'm so glad I did. The environment, atmosphere, the creepy npcs and music were outstanding. The combat, levelling, upgrading, level design, functionality and difficulty was a joy. Finally, the boss fights were magnificent.An absolute masterpiece in my opinion. 10/10.Ashen one, be sure to bring more souls.Thanks developers for making this. You have a new fanboy!- Looking forward to Elden Ring!"
Positive,"Dark Souls 3 is the ultimate test of your gaming skills and patience, as you die more times than A CAT HAS LIVES. The game's difficulty will make you scream, cry, and throw your controller at the wall, but you'll keep coming back for more punishment like a masochistic glutton for punishment. Dark Souls 3: the ultimate way to feel both accomplished and defeated at the same time."
Positive,"The Firekeeper is the embodiment of the perfect woman. She only speaks when spoken to, is always helpful, and even if she's beaten without reason, her first instinct is to ask what she is doing wrong. Need."
Positive,ye its dark souls you know
Positive,"This game is the very definition of Rocky Balboa. You will be struck down and tested to your limits. You will struggle and maybe falter. But you will always get back up and continue the fight. Do not expect to make rapid progress or breeze through the game. Speaking as someone playing this as their first Souls game, get only if you wished to be challenged. Have not yet finished this game as of writing, but enjoying every second of it."
Positive,"sure, I died to pontiff for 6 hours off attemptssure, I hate myself more because of this gamesure, I did become the creatures I killed by forming myself into an amalgamation of the hardest bosses sure, I still play with a wince of pain after every deathsure, I feel nothing anymore11/10edit: Just beat dlc. Yeah, so, Darkeater Midir, fuck you.12/10"
Positive,"Great game, pretty challenging and rewarding, fun with friends, and a stunning duo of DLC's100% recommend it to people who can deal with dying over and over, especially on the DLC, not saying the Base game is easy, but the DLC areas are hard, same with the bosses.ngl i really like this game even though i spent an hour on the first bossthe NG+(x amount) cycles make the game even harder, and currently i'm on NG++ and it's pretty hard, after ng+7 bosses stop gaining health and damage, but normal enemies do still gain more health and damage (i think)the lore of the game, while hard to piece together, is amazing, and well the music is awesome, the game plays perfectly and runs smoothly."
Positive,"For my first souls-type game, it was a very fun and enticing video game experience that I have not experienced in a single-player format. Very few times have I not been fully immersed into a boss fight. The soundtracks completed the atmosphere and was full of epic tracks that I will remember. The story progression of the game was simple: kill bosses and become ultimate chad. The side quests are fairly varied for being a non-open world like the Grand Theft Auto franchise. The Ringed City DLC with the Spears of the Church bossfight was innovative and I very much liked that aspect. The only thing I didn't like about the game was how small the Ashes of Ariandel DLC and how small it is. Both the Ringed City and Ariandel DLC cost the same price, but it feels like Ringed City had a more generous amount of content (Also shoutout to LilSippyCupX for allowing me to get the ""All Pyromancies"" achievement dude)"
Positive,"I almost missed out on a great game because of all the fame it's got (game being extremely difficult, etc) and me being a somewhat casual gamer. Turns out it's a nice challenge, and the difficulty makes sense with everything happening in the story. There's lots of exploration which I really enjoy, the music/atmosphere is glorious, the scenery is beyond beautiful, and defeating the bosses feels amazing. I know I still have a long way to go, but I'll keep getting better. Praise the Sun!"
Positive,"Not a lot of games keep my attention and I've never been one for a challenge but this game manages to keep me coming back for more. It's challenging but fair, frustrating but fun and while I don't care for the dialogue and don't really feel an attachment to any of the characters, I do get a sense of satisfaction after I beat a boss."
Positive,Its really good but if you are willing to give up on other human things it will become even better
Positive,pros: Not Dark souls 2Cons: Not Dark souls: prepare to dieConclusion: Dark souls 3
Positive,"Only thing, that was hard at this game was my pp. :)"
Positive,good game would happily die another 700 times to the dancer
Positive,Attacked multiple burn victims just to bring down what god worked so hard for.
Positive,This game is like an abusive relationship that you can't escape.10/10 Favorite game ever.
Positive,"This game man.... Its full of everything, from challenges and secrets to pvp, co-op and enjoyable gameplay, controlles at first seems wacky but its gonna be normal for you later on. Great game overall!Praise the sun!"
Positive,It's a legendary game that brings me to the brink of breaking my moniter.Edit: I have over 300 hours on this game now (I have an alt I play on also) and let me start on how much this game has changed my life. I know that sounds cringe but it made gaming actually enjoyable again and if you are debating on whether to get it I 100% recommend you do.
Positive,"Great story. It's a game that may make you feel lost or overwhelmed, or pitiful at times. But so does real life. You stick to it, and you get better. It's worth the effort. The sense of accomplishment isn't linear. It's a jagged, beautiful line. And the story is confusing and wonderful at the same time."
Positive,Dark Souls 3... the 3rd dark souls. its good times 3.
Positive,"The most hardcore game that I've ever played, 10/10."
Positive,"I refunded this game when it came out years ago, then I gave it another chance and wondered further outside the bonfire. 10/10 would die again."
Positive,"If ur into hardcore anal rape, well, boy have i got some good news for you"
Positive,The perfect conclusion for the Dark Souls series.
Positive,"i have now 100% beat the game.all achievements.multiple playthroughs.dexterity builds, strength builds, parries, shields, greatswords, dual blades, everything in between.i hate magic.every boss feels fair, though some are cheeky, except for the nameless king who just absolutely demolished my shit.on my latest playthrough, it took 5 tries at most to beat every boss (most done on first run, very happy w that) but nameless king took me about 20+ tries, it was a god damned nightmare and a lot of moves felt cheap.this game's good.you should always try the optional bosses once at least.don't let the few ""git gud"" people discourage you, most the community is nice B)"
Positive,"Very relaxing game, just pick a ultra greatsword, put your points in strength, and smash to the Berserk OST."
Positive,don't be pussy
Positive,game be gamin
Positive,I love to hurt myself.

Positive,"A great game that envelopes what true difficulty is. It has amazing lore that is depressing and melancholic, but it doesn't out right say it in the first place; you see, to find the snippits of lore you'll have to look in items, so collecting is a must. Or yunno you can watch the many lore Youtube channels out there. The gameplay is a huge improvement over past games, while DSR was very tight and felt good( and in my opinion was amazing in it's own right) DS2 was very jankie and clunky, this game is as smooth as butter: taking knowledge from Bloodborne to improve this title was a great choice. (9/10)"
Positive,A great way to torture your body and mind :)
Positive,may the flames guide you to buying this game
Positive,"A love letter to fans of the series.Edit: I just want to add that, despite really liking this game, loving it even, it is FULL OF GLITCHES. Most of them have ben around since the release and Fromsoft doesn't seem to care. They should be ashamed."
Positive,"This game is extremely fun, it starts off quite difficult, but the more you go on the bosses get more interesting and difficult and you begin to learn how to do them so much better and more consistently. The multiplayer is decent as well, and the replay ability is massive, being able to play the game as a strong heavy weapon character or a mage you can do a lot. The DLC is extremely fun, the bosses are probably more difficult than some of the main game bossesNG+ is also quite fun, it gets more difficult as you make more and more NG+ saves.Seriously recommend getting this game when it goes on a sale seeing as it is $100."
Positive,"I'm a DS2 fanboy, yes unpopular opinion but I love DS2 the most, come get it what's up? But, I honestly have to say that DS3 is the ultimate souls experience to date, in my opinion it beats Bloodborne and Sekiro as well, even though I LOVED the artwork and the atmosphere in Bloodborne (who doesn't? lol), but I really think DS3 beats them all, it's just a complete souls game and you can play it however you like, dual-wield, shield builds, tank builds etc etc... The graphics are great, however I did notice weird frame drops here and there and I do have a beefier machine, it's nothing that would bother you when playing but I have to say I did notice that this is not the greatest console port. DS2 and Dark souls remastered run at 60 fps and absolutely never drop bellow 60, DS3 however tends to go to Bloodborne PS4 30 fps lock level performance in some areas, for whatever strange reason... The story and the lore are up to you to discover and this is something I always loved about Dark Souls games, I'm old-school, I'm a DOOM and Quake player, I don't have time for long Witcher 3-esque cutscenes and dialogues, I just want to be thrown into the game and action and have fun, I'm not watching a movie, I'm playing a game and DS3 delivers exactly this as previous titles did. The combat has been vastly improved over the previous games, it's snappy, it's improved and it's fast! I really have to say that I enjoy it tremendously, it has that weight and slashing foes is so fun here. Keep in mind that it is faster than previous games and will kick your a$$ if you don't pay attention. Bosses also come in 'phases' and this adds another layer to the combat, although I'm not a fan of 'phases' in bosses I don't mind it that much. Anyways, I really wrote too much, just get the game, you won't be disappointed, it's a masterpiece and FROM software is definitely my favorite developer, their games crush all competition, their games are the best, no doubt."
Positive,"My experience playing Dark Souls III for the first time:-Spawned in.-Tried to memorize the controls, as its for a console-Accidentally drank a drink that restores me to full hp, twice.-Started killing a few monsters and thought 'I'm getting a hang of this!'-Walks through a fog and then dies seconds later from a boss-Tries repeatedly to kill the boss-Rage quitQuitting simulator 10/10!"
Positive,LOL YOU DIEDLOLLOLYOU DIED
Positive,This is the third Dark Souls game.
Positive,"Simply one of the greatest games of all time. Highly recommend for anyone to give it a shot, once you're hooked you'll wana play em all"
Positive,"If you ever thought about death being a good thing, this game might change your point of view"
Positive,"Finally I can finish this game and all DLC.Story is real good it's continue from Dark Souls PPTD.I love all of design of this game such as bosses, armors, weapons and scenes.Nameless King, Slave Knight Gale and Friede are really cool bosses.Score : 10/10"
Positive,(souls veteran)*kills dancer at +1*  noice*kills friede at +4 right after sages* noice*kills midir at +6* noiceget banned (replacing the save file in game directory did jack sh it)but why?i only broke the progression system
Positive,"A nice sendoff to a series that had started to show repetitiveness; while it borrows more than it probably should from its previous entries as well as its mechanical spinoff Bloodborne, the game still packs enough challenge, compelling boss fights, amazing environments and tidbits of lore that any fan of the series must play it.The difficulty is a heavily discussed aspect of these games that receives more attention than it should for the wrong reasons. There is no slider; instead, the game lets you build your own difficulty through your choices in starting class, weapons, armor, items and spells. Additionally you can summon other players or NPCs to aid (or hinder) you, which again lets you take control of the difficulty.That being said, Dark Souls III does feature several small improvements in many aspects that streamline the core experience while changing others that may not resonate well with experienced players; this includes weapon arts (skills), armor no longer requiring reinforcement, less restrictive covenant allegiance, more multiplayer items and covenant interactions, among others.In regards to DLC, if possible try to buy both for the full narrative experience as they play into each other but otherwise The Ringed City is the better value proposition, with more expansive areas, intriguing boss fights and a more satisfying finale for the series as a whole. Ashes of Ariandel is not bad  but is definitely lacking in content, with the PvP matchmaking the only remarkable feature it has to offer.New players can start with this title but playing at least the original game first since the world, like its combat, does not hold your hand while you try to understand its lore and characters. Wait for a nice discount on the DLC or the complete edition for the full experience; otherwise stick to the base game and the 2nd DLC."
Positive,"If you are even considering buying DS3 and your computer can handle it, then do. This game definatly has its multiplayer problems, but if you can look past that then this game has an amazing story, soundtrack, gameplay, and the experience will have a lasting impact upon you."
Positive,Have you ever wanted to try @nal? Play this.10/10 IGN
Positive,"After putting over 500 hours into this game I think I can safely say that this is one of my favorite games of all time.  If you want to have an amazing time, by this game."
Positive,Its really good :D
Positive,PRAISE THE SUN!  Is all that needs to be said. 10/10
Positive,One of the best games I've played.10/10Easier than all the other Dark Souls games.
Positive,"Awesome game! Great change in combat, but still a great game!"
Positive,this game is just a copy of minecraft
Positive,"After some playthroughs I must say, this is one of my favourite games.(And you should buy it now)-PROSlevel designbeautiful ostinteresting plotgreat replay valueinteresting boss fightseasy to learn (the hard way)faster than the other souls gamesthe firekeeper is hot-CONSfoam protector for the gamepad requiredno poisedark sword users"
Positive,"Minor spoilers I guess.It's great but I have some issues with it.I found the game to be a little too easy/short honestly. I clocked in finishing the game somewhere around 27 hours (and hell there was at least an hour or so of idle time leaving the game up in there), and BELIEVE ME, I do not shy away from exploring/taking my time nor did I summon a single person to help me with the bosses in the entire playthrough. It's hard to tell if this is because I'm just so used to playing these games by now, or if the game was lacking in some way that is not completely obvious to me. It just felt like I really breezed through it in a semi unsatisfying way. There were several bosses that didn't even manage to kill me a single time, and several more that took only one extra attempt. Also the fanservice references to Dark Souls 1 were a little heavy handed at times. Yes, Dark Souls 1 is good, I love that game, but please make me fall in love again instead of having all these callbacks and references to a game I already played. When you're picking up weapons and armor from characters in the first game, seeing actual characters from the first game, and revisiting areas that we've seen before you aren't really being creative at that point and are instead attempting to carry the game with cheaply implemented nostalgia bombs.Other than that it's extremely good and does not waver from the standard of quality that has come to be expected from these games. The gameplay, controls, and graphical presentation are as good as you would expect if you've played any of the others. I'll admit I was a bit less than hyped for this game since it felt like they were beginning to milk the series due to its remarkable popularity, but it did manage to surprise and delight me despite my cynicism. But please for the love of god slow down on the releases (I'm considering Scholar of the First Sin and BloodBorne as well when I say this). Give me time to miss the Souls series so I can actually be pumped for a new entry. There's no need to go on a Call of Duty release schedule for these games. Quality over qunatity all the way. They scraped by with a good game this time but they are beginning to push their luck in my opinion."
Positive,One of the deepest and challenging RPG i have played in quite sometime.
Positive,"To lazy to write a full in depth review about the game.Go buy it, it's kind of better than Dark Souls 2 and you could almost say it's Dark Souls 1 all over again.That's a good thing, btw"
Positive,"☠ Fine work, skeleton!"
Positive,Meh it's okay
Positive,Well as a player that played Dark souls 1 and 2 Ill say that the game is awesome but the fps rate dropping need to be patch still a very epic game afterall.9/10 will get ten if not some fps drop =3
Positive,"Best game everFull of waifus, nice people and without hackers and meta"
Positive,It's a decent game.. Good for young kids or those with disabilities. Very approachable.
Positive,"In my opinion, the best game of the series. Great matchmaking, good PvP/netcode, amazing PvE, and it ties up quite a few loose ends to the previous 2 games. Would recommend for anyone who is a fan of the SoulsBorne series, or just wants to get into Dark Souls in general."
Positive,"When the game was up for pre-purchase it was 509.99MXN2 weeks before the game release Bandai raised price to 1099MXN ONLY FOR MEXICO, was the only latin american country it was raised.One day before the game release they tried to adjust the Deluxe edition price; Instead of 1499MXN they set it for 14MXN by accident.Got this game for 0.80 American Cents (USD).Karma is a bitch isnt Bandai?"
Positive,pvp with homies numbawan
Positive,"More like DS1 in it's overall experience, with some elements of DS2 stuck in for good measure. A Decent game and fun to co-op with friends."
Positive,Use a controller
Positive,good gamethe crystal sage can go fuck themself
Positive,"In my opinion: Out of the 3 Dark Souls games, this one is the best, shortly followed by Dark Souls 1 for its nostalgia and for introducing me to the entire genre/series.Dark Souls 3 is simply amazing and everybody and their grandparents should atleast give it a try.If you dont like it, fair enough, but atleast give it a go!From the amount of weapons and different playstyles, over the beautiful scenery and into the lore connecting the entire Souls-universe; This game offers you everything you could ask for.. Well almost everything.Just like the other Soulsgames this one has its downsides, some weaponclasses are stronger than others (in pvp anyways). But that doesnt mean that not all are viable.Some bosses are very.. inconsistent with their moves.And it had some initial bugs. However all of this shouldnt matter for the first playthrough!The bugs are gone, pvp isnt something I would do in my first playthrough and I wouldnt know what bosses do when facing them first time as well.. so yea, go grab yourself a copy and start playing! ;D"
Positive,"For anyone whose already familiar with the Souls series and genuinely enjoyed the first two games, this is just more of those. It's incredibly fun, theres still a fairly large playerbase ready to help (or murder) you, and it's really just such a great game. I do appreciate this one a lot more than DS2 simply because the classic strategy of hiding behind a shield an attacking once the enemy stops isn't really an option anymore, they've evolved most of the foes so that now their attacks are more than just 1 or 2 hits or there will be more than one way to get damage done past your shielding. With that being said, if you're brand new to the series, this isn't a bad place to start from, the game certainly carries with it all the familiar tones of the previous games and you're honestly not missing out playing them in any particular order."
Positive,It's just like dark souls
Positive,At least FROM can count to 3 amirite *cough* *cough* VALVE *cough* *cough*
Positive,"You want to PvP? Do you want basically win every single time in arena to the point it makes you mentally ill?Use the Lothric Knight Sword, Gargoyle Flame Spear, Washing Pole, Gaels GS, Exile GS, SplitLeaf GS.thats it, gg ez"
Positive,"In the Age of Ancients the gaming world was unformed, shrouded by fog. A land of gray crags, fun video games and Everlasting Dragons. But then there was 3D and with 3D games came mainstream appeal and disparity. Nito unleashed a miasma of QTE events and disease. And Seath the Scaleless betrayed his own, and actual game mechanics were no more. Thus began the Age of AAA Gaming.Only, in the ancient legends it is stated, that one day an undead developer shall be chosen to leave the undead asylum, in pilgrimage, to the land of ancient lords, and finally figure out how to do castlevania in 3D. What a time to be alive.Nameless, accursed gamer, unfit even to be pacman.Your fate is to buy and solo all three Souls Games.There's gameplay and stuff."
Positive,"Alright here's an actual review.  I was gifted this game by my great friend Alex (luky on my friends list, go give him bjs for his good work).  Honestly, I would have never bought this game.  I woulda bought Rise of the Tomb Raider instead and never would have experienced this masterpiece.  This is the first Dark Souls game I have ever finished, as I couldn't even run DS1 on my old laptop and I kinda forgot I had it :P   Anyway, there are lots of neat secrets in the game, the controls are amazing, the graphics are amazing, but not so amazing that they'll fry your $200 GPU (60fps on max with a GTX 960), and the bosses provide a great challenge.  Honestly, you could just run through most of the levels and go straight for the bosses, but I wouldn't recommend it on a NG run.  Once you get to NG+, the game gets alot easier.  I was able to beat NG+6 pretty easily, and I'm trash at Dark Souls.  Is this the easiest Dark Souls game?  Maybe, I've never played DS2.  Of the two I have played (1 and 3) yes, this is the easiest.  It does, however, have some really, REALLY fun bosses, while DS1 made me suicidal with Ornstein and Smough.  Overall, I would whole heartedly reccomend this game to everyone (except Tom.  FUCK YOU TOM.)"
Positive,"这是我近年来玩的最棒的游戏（或许我玩的游戏也不多），说实话，一开始我玩这个游戏接触的是盗版，但是还是买了正版，不仅仅是游戏内容所带给我的快乐，更多的是久久不能平复的心情。无论是前期令新手感到绝望的难度，或是感到疑惑的剧情内容，通关之后的感受却是不一样的成就感和快乐，或许是这个游戏更适合我这样富有挑战心和冒险精神的年纪。在这个游戏里，如果你是一个新手，你可以依靠简单的一招一式来解决战斗，有时会很难，但战斗机制却不复杂；相反，如果你是一个老玩家，你甚至可以利用复杂的战斗方式轻易的取得boss的余火之力，所以总的来说，游戏耐玩性挺高。玩过之后，那种想与人分享的心情却是久久不能忘却，好的游戏总是令人回味无穷，也留给玩家很多思考很想象的空间。Translation：This is the best game I have played in recent years (maybe I don't play a lot of games), to tell the truth, I started playing this game is pirated, but still bought a genuine, not only the content of the game to bring me happiness, more is a long time can not calm the mood. Whether it is in the early stage to make the novice feel desperate, or the content of the plot, after customs clearance is not the same feeling of achievement and happiness, perhaps the game is more suitable for me such a challenging heart and adventurous age. In this game, if you are a novice, you can rely on simple strokes to solve the battle, sometimes it can be difficult, but the fighting mechanism is not complicated; Conversely, if you are an old player, you can even use the complex fighting way to easily get the boss's residual fire, so overall, the game is very high. After playing, the kind of mood that want to share with others is a long time can not forget, good games are always memorable, but also left to the players a lot of thinking very imaginative space."
Positive,"Just killed all the bosses including optional and DLC bosses. Now I can officially say, I hate this game it sucks. And you can't tell me I'm wrong or stupid or just bad at it, I've completed it."
Positive,Alternative Title:Dying Simulator :)
Positive,"Servers are back now, so... thanks? I guess? Only took seven months.Not gonna go all out on some multi-paragraph review. The game's ok. Not the masterpiece it's made out to be. About 65% of the time I played the main game I wanted to kill myself because of how annoying it is. Still kind of fun overall, somehow. Its main redeeming factor for me is its PvP, which accounts for more than 3/4ths of my playtime by now.6/10 decent fun if you think ""haha funny rolling knight game"" and don't buy into the ""this is the pinnacle of gaming"" bullshit."
Positive,"Ah Dark Souls.. And with that I mean every Dark Souls or even Souls game.. You either love it or you hate it. I think I just love to hate it! Just to quote the entire internet; ""these game are rock hard but never unfair"". As soon as you understand a particular enemy and learn its move set, you will be able to dodge its moves and block its attacks. Swinging in your own attacks and kill it bit by bit, while avoiding his or hers.. Patience is key my friend. If the last three sentences don't sound like something you'd enjoy, then by all means do not buy this game. Because this is the Dark Souls experienceDamn that sounds awful, so what makes the game appealing Druss, my man? Well it feels fantastic if you finally beat a section of the game and finally find your next bonfire. It gives you the feeling you really really fought for it. That one f*cking boss that has killed you now for 30 times and you just cant figure it out? Willing to give up, because you have a social life right? (we all know we don't, who are we fooling?) Well wait till you DO figure it out and send it back to the dark pits of hell, you feel like a frikkin boss! And that for me is a good Souls game.Dark Souls III, is a solid last entry to the series I think, although I still have to buy and play Dark Souls II. The game world is chock full of lore that is totally left open for your own interpretation, the only thing certain is that you have to fight your way through hordes of enemies out to kill you without remorse. Your main goal: rekindle the fire and a new era of light? ...or do you? 10/10 would go to this misery again!Replay value? -Hell yes, it has:- 3 different (plus one well hidden) endings. - 6 optional bosses and areas. - 10 classes with totally different play styles. - Tons and Tons of different weapons and armors to totally reformat your gameplay (no exaggeration)....... Starts game and builds new character.."
Positive,"Swung my straight sword at a dude after I took out this sword in his chest. I had won, after playing sword swing simulator with a few rolls, I had finally done it. Wiping the sweat from my brow only to be told in my stream chat ""Melethril, that was the tutorial boss"" I glared into the camera.""I can't git gud"" the end"
Positive,"hey steam sale buyers, watch out for the invaders hohohohoh"
Positive,not bad not bad
Positive,"Aight, as a long-time player of the souls series, I'm going to try my best to give an unbiased review of this game (funny, no?) in an attempt to give an actual look at the game for anyone wanting to purchase the game.PROS:= texture quality: there are only a few graphical mishaps in the game, even on the lowest settings, and the textures that exist are high quality= armor physics: all of the physics related to the equipable armor sets are insanely detailed and quite accurate to real-life= music: the music for every boss is unique and powerful, setting the stage for what you will fight. This has been a high point for the entire series= responsiveness: the controls are incredibly responsive and the motions are fluid, something that the first few games did not have= PvE: of all the games in the series, the pve in this one is most likely the best. The enemies are appropriately scaled to the reccomended level per area and they are only difficult if you are not prepared. There weren't as many hidden traps for me, but that might be because I am used to the series by now= lore: a staple of the series, it is just as cryptic and confusing as ever, and the final dlc held info that was a long time coming= wow effect: almost every area you will enter is diverse and strange, making you wonder what you will uncover and what you will face= endings: as the end to the series, this game delivers in a subtle way. The series started in an obscure way, and that is the way it ends, not with a boom but with a whimper.= casting system: in past games, if you wanted more casts of a spell, you had to aquire it again and again, but this game allows for casting whatever spell you want due to a shared magic pool, allowing you to diversify.= emphasis on a health stat: in previoius games, the health stat wasn't too important as you would get small bonuses to your health as you leveled up. In this game, you will get no bonuses, making the stat that much more important.= easy optimizing: to make a build as good as it can get, you only have to meet certain caps, usually around 40. You can always go further, but at this level, you aren't investing too much, making the meta level of 120 very doable.CONS:= PvP: this one needs to be broken up into a few subsections     - latency: probably the most annoying aspect of this game is the terrible connections between players. If one of you has a bad connection, you both have terrible hit recognition, and this can cause a whole list of problems     - one-shot combos galore: half of the people in PvP are running builds designed to stun-lock you into submission, no matter how heavy your armor is or what buffs you have (poise, anyone?)     - build variety: this was far worse at the beginning of the game's life, but even with all of the boosts to non-physical weapons, a quality build will still win out over any other build. Luck build? A moss will render it useless. Mage? Have fun with terrible split-damage weapons. Dexterity build? Looks like you are limited to 4 or 5 actually viable weapons. The past games had metas, but at least most weapons were viable against the meta.     - invasions: I've always liked invasions, either as a host or an invader, but this game allows for estus use for both invaders and summons, which most of the time makes it incredibly unfair for any invader. This coupled with near instant summons makes it difficult to successfuly kill the host.= layout: as the series progressed, the world design got incredibly linear, making the game seem less interconnected and less maze-like. Some may see this as a bonus, but it makes the game feel more like a level-based game.= reused material: again, some may see this as nit-picking, but when a large portion of the armors and weapons in the game are reused from the first game, it becomes less nostalgic and more of a ""an old armor again?"" moment. They have become more defined and of greater visual quality, but the diversity died a bit.= stamina consumption: rolls take way too little, weapons take about enough, spells take way too much.In conclusion, I still really enjoy this game and the series in general, and I believe everyone should give it a try at least once. It's difficult, but not in a way that is unfair. But if you are a die-hard fan of the older games, this one may not be your cup of tea. It may not be as hard, but it still has it's charm. At the time of this review, I've played about 250 hours and I plan to play more, and I still recommend this game, but there are a few things that urk me that should be mentioned but aren't due to either a chorus of ""git gud"" or hype overload."

Positive,"The game that I learned to love, by hating it.Literally, this game changed my perspective on what ""Hard games"" should be defined as. Dive head first into solo online play to really discover just how punishing the game can really be. Learn how to survive in the harsh world you're thrown into by dying over and over again until you learn from your own failures; be it from experiencing an area for the first time, getting destroyed by a heartless player controlled invader, or even getting your camera stuck in a wall. If you manage to beat this game from start to finish on your own, you'll probably agree with me when I say that it was a journey worth having."
Positive,"145hr to finish the last of the DLC and find the stuff I missed. Combat not that hard, misleading difficulty. It's closer to a rhythm game with timing attacks and dodges. With immersive world building and addictive exploration. The mystery and hints of the story really grabbed me by the collar, then flung me to a cliff overlooking a pit of YT lore videos. The bosses are great but fighting to reach them and getting hyped by small lore drops about their past, was excellent."
Positive,Be wary of Dark Spirit
Positive,A good way to end what you have started.Embrace the darkness once more!I'd rather watch my kingdom fallI want it all or not at all...
Positive,10/10 would praise the sun again
Positive,"It's just fantastic how they can throw the game at community and let them figure everything out.10/10 game, 9/10 community - dark sword users"
Positive,"This is the game that made me really love games. I have never played a game that was this addictive, from the highest of highs when beating a boss to the lowest of lows, being beaten over and over again by the same enemy. Every death just makes you want to play more.The soundtrack is also amazing and I love the customisation options, it's great as far as combinations of armour and appearance go. Took me about 80 hours to beat the main game as a newbie to video games in general, but if you're an old hand then it will probably be shorter for you. Buy this game, you will not regret it."
Positive,An amazing game just like 1 and 2.Not as hard as them but still it's pretty hard and it brings back some tactics from ds1 (kicking and ragdolls :P) its like combining bloodborne and ds together to make a game that is absolutely perfect. I absolutely recommend this game without a doubt and its worth its price and im only 3-4 hours in and i love it already. I cannot wait to see what else this game has to offer.
Positive,Give a bird alcohol and you get to praise the sun! 10/10.
Positive,"I could actually play this one!More fun than difficult, definitely better then the first."
Positive,dark soul 3
Positive,H A N D  .  I T .  O V E R .
Positive,So this game i may only have about 7 hours on it but this is so far the best souls game imo the boss and even the minions are hard to beat lol i hadnt had a single crash either i do get small lag spikes and fps spikes once anda while but its not a bother :D
Positive,This is definitely the easiest Dark Souls so far. 80% of the weapons arent viable since they cant get infused or buffed. Literally every DS2 mechanic got removed.Great game for new Players. Hope From balances the game out soon
Positive,"the game was quite untense until I met Nameless king.Upd (01.05.2023): With this masterpiece I realized that everything is possible. Bosses in dark souls is analogy of climping up in real life. You can reach anytihing. If you're not prepared right now, pay attention to a theory quastion of a topic, don't drop your goal. If your hands fell just come back to it after rest."
Positive,"I almost lost my sanity to complete this game 100%, but I've done it. I would never go farm those knights ever again tho."

Positive,it the funny darm sols but the third one hoo wee
Positive,"In my personal opinion...... the first game is the best ""Dark Souls"" of the series. This one is the better ""game"".I was not too fond of it though. Way too easy compared to the others. The Nameless King's difficulty is overrated.There are elements that I do like. The NPC quests are better than the previous two games, excluding (again in my personal opinion) Lucatiel of Mirrah from DS2. The references to the previous titles are well done... if you can spot them.And then came The Ringed City... and I got sliced, burned, shot with hundreds of arrows, killed by poison... (long list inserted here)... and got eaten/torn/burned/stomped by Midir.I love this game!"
Positive,I beat dark souls ON STREAM
Positive,I am the Dark Soul 8/10
Positive,One of my favorite games ever made. I highly recommend Dark souls III.
Positive,You'll get raped in Catacombs just like in Paris by migrants.
Positive,"Besides the dangerous hackers, this game still has solid gameplay mechanics and a good experience. I only played Dark Souls II previously and I can tell you, this game feels like a massive improvement and can get quite addicting. As low as my hours are as of this review, they have all come from playing most of the day away, in just a few days. If you don't want to risk the hackers, set game mode to offline, but I would also encourage using online because the experience isn't something you find in most games. I had been wanting to pick this game up for the last month and I'm glad I was finally able to get it. I was lucky to get it on sale price, but I'd be lying if I said that the game wasn't worth $60."
Positive,i don't really like this game its too scary but my firiends beer and bg (bg is really fat) are making me play it
Positive,"""This game is challenging, has really nice atmosphere, and is really immersi-"" ""Invaded by Dark spirit SisterFister!""""Blue spirit Dindu Nuffing summoned through concord"""
Positive,"Good story, Combat system 8/10Prolly 1 of the best games.I died for like ten hundred timesFrustrating to the point that you'll badly want to try hard and finish the game."
Positive,"As someone who never played the souls series before I'll say that this game has impressed me a lot, the content, combat styles, the diversity of enemies, aesthetic of the locations you play in and coop made this game for a great experience overall besides the frustration from being killed by other players and loosing my hard earned souls lol. I definitely recommend this game."
Positive,I got this game on sale for 15 bucks and let me say im very impressed. The game is extremely hard and extremely rewarding and you really feel a sense of relief when you kill that boss that has been whooping your ass for the past hour. the scenery is another one of this games greatest pro's. its beautiful for being a dark fantasy setting. The enemies are also extremely creepy and cool looking. Theres so much to this game and i cant wait to play  more and beat some of the harder bosses. definetly one of my favorite games on my steam library. ten outa ten
Positive,"As a person who is kind of timid, I disliked Dark Souls 3, because the atmosphere of the game just makes me nervous. But as I kept playing this game, the nervousness was still there, but something came along with it - excitement. It is alwasy very exciting when you anticipate unknown enemies or invaders ahead, and the sense of achievement aftering clearing an area/obtaining certain weapon is just tremendous. I played the game mainly with a friend and those were some of my happiest moments when it comes to gaming. This game might be a little bit overwhelming for people who have zero experience with the Souls series, but once you immersed yourself within this world, it will just be harder and harder to pull yourself out *( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)*Highly recommended. If you are timid like me, ask a friend to play together, I am sure that will also be some precious moments for you guys. :)"
Positive,got banned for absolutely no reason 10 out of 10 would die again
Positive,"Dark Souls fit in a very strange niche in the gaming community, but I can say it has done well to fill that itch for most people."
Positive,They sure put a lot of soul into this one
Positive,"A few bugs and game crashes, etc., but I kind of expected that right after release. Otherwise, AMAZIIING! :^)"
Positive,Dark souls 3 is fn amazing even tho i have raged at it and im only 2 hours in
Positive,praise the jolly cooperation
Positive,"you, you.me, me, pickle-pee.me, me, pump-a-rum."
Positive,"I gotta say, Dark Souls III has really impressed me so far. Gameplay is very responsive with rolling and combat and the game lives up to its name. If you're like me, you're probably going to be raging a lot as i have so far ( More than i'd like to admit ). The game runs extremely well with the 4790K and 980 TI as i would expect and i have so far had no issues other than being randomly tabbed out of the game. Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone whether they have played a DS game or not as it's definitely an entertaining game."
Positive,The best game available. Could not recommend any higher. Buy it now.*Known side effects include broken computer equipment and losing your life ingame and out*
Positive,"From what i have played it seems pretty good , im sure after i get past Iudex Gundy it is gonna get much better!"
Positive,"This game is the way to go for someone who is new to the franchise, the combat is dynamic, the lore and music are just as amazing as in the previous installments and the gameplay is more fluid than ever. The game does however sacrifice replayability on the altar of open areas sadly which makes the world feel real on one end but makes avoiding enemies a better strategy than fighting them, this makes consecutive playthroughs consist of nothing more than running from A to B and taking out the boss. A boss which is likely an absolute pushover, Dark Souls games usually get a lot easier the more you play with them but out of the whole franchise, this was the first game where even after finishing it for the first time I felt like it was not hard enough. Most bosses are gimicky, some are too clunky, very few of them put up a good fight. Luckily the Ringed City DLC comes in to save the day, 3 of the 4 bosses are the best bosses in the whole game, the areas are not jokes either. The DLC is the ""end game"" area the base game was missing, but unfortunately you must play through the entire rest of the game every time you want to beat it because for whatever reason the developers decided to remove the item which was added in DS2 which could reset areas. The PvP is quite all right for the most part, co-op is very much fun too.Overall, the game is a good first-time experience but lacks the gameplay quality of the first two games or Bloodborne, making it less interesting long-term. But thats coming from someone with over 800 hours in the game so you know it aint all that bad.9/10 with DLC, 7/10 otherwise"
Positive,"its good, but not as good as dark souls 25/7"
Positive,I like it
Positive,-You can roll and destroy objects-Occasionally little mental meltdown cuz u die 15 times on this same enemy and lost all your souls10/10 you should buy and play this game.
Positive,veldig kult spill mange takk
Positive,"One of the hardest games ever made, dark souls 3 is a wonderfull game but it cant beat the first one. Dark souls 1 is still the best DS game for me."
Positive,"So as of now... 2.3hrs of playtime, still not done the tutorial. People really do not lie about the difficulty. I am playing on keyboard and mouse but will get a controller soon. Slowly getting a hang of things. I hurt. Please send aide."
Positive,"Back after 200hrs + in game...So Let me begin my review now :---{Graphics}---☑ You will probably die by falling a couple of times looking at the gorgeous view☐ Good☐ Decent☐ Bad☐ Don‘t look too long at it- Looking at the graphics you will be out of out of words. From the start till the end the detailing done to the places and characters is truly master class. Specially for a game which was released back in 2016.---{Game play}---☑ Very good ( Well its ds series )☐ Good☐ It‘s just game-play☐ Meh☐ Watch paint dry instead☐ Just don't{It works pretty good, and the creatures make the game interesting}---{Audio}---☐ Out of this world☑ Very good☐ Good☐ Not too bad☐ Bad☐ I'm now deaf- There are some places where the audio will give you jump scares. XD---{Audience}---This game is not recommended for casuals. It will make you rage and cry. ---{PC Requirements}---☐ Check if you can run paint☐ Potato☐ Decent☑ Fast☐ Rich boi☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer- Become of the wonder graphics its highly recommended to play on high graphics settings.Even on my 960 i can run it on high. So there shouldn't be a real problem with the PC requirements.---{Difficulty}---☐ Just press 'W'☐ Easy☐ Significant brain usage☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master☐ Difficult☑ Dark Souls- From the game name itself you can understand what your going to go against.---{Grind}---☐ Nothing to grind☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks☐ Isnt necessary to progress☐ Average grind level☑ Too much grind☐ You‘ll need a second live for grinding- Souls is everything in this game and if you die, you will lose all your souls and you will need to recover them. If you die while going to collect them ... you lose those previous souls. (Sadness Ahead )- Plus if you meet some stronger enemy.... which of course you will meet every 15-20 mins and then the enemy starts bullying you. I'm petty sure you wont stop grinding unless you can beat his ass up.---{Story}---☐ No Story☐ Some lore☐ Average☐ Good☑ Breathe taking- The creator of this game has created an amazing story. Each and every enemy/ npc/ area and boss has a lore. And each of these lores are class. Even the storyline of each npc is great.- In short dark souls is a cycle of age of fire and age of darkness.---{Price}---☐ It’s free!☑ Worth the price☐ If it's on sale☐ If u have some spare money left☐ Not recommended☐ You could also just burn your money- I am ready to pay any price for such games. And if there is a ds4 (if) im really willing to pay a high price for such a class game.---{Bugs}---☐ Never heard of☑ Minor bugs☐ Can get annoying☐ ARK: Survival Evolved☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs- Very rarely have seen them myself but experienced some controller and minor shuttering issues. (Probably due to new windows update being new stuff not sure)---{?/10}---☐1☐2☐3☐4☐5☐6☐7☐ 8☐9☑10My final words to you:You have to play this game at least once in your lifetime.( Or any of the soul series game) To experience the difficulty and pain of playing this game. The rewards which await for you, while travelling through lothric and to linking the fire back are just amazing. Each boss you slay will give you immense joy and satisfaction. And dont ever forget to PRAISE THE SUN!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Positive,If you are a masochist then play this game
Positive,Praise the sun! dog
Positive,Sad because i didnt get to smooch nameless king but the game is ok ig + midyr
Positive,"very good game, now tell sony to let you make Bloodborne 2 thanks"
Positive,10/10 Would smash another keyboard!
Positive,Karim is milking the s.h.i.i.t out of it
Positive,"A great and difficult game to master with very good lore, if you can find it. At first bosses will be really hard but you will feel really good when you manage to kill the boss that just killed you more than 30 times. Combat is really awsome and diverse. There are many weapons to choose from and also magic, pyromancy and miracles for many different type of playstyles.If you want to make the game easier just play with some friends in co-op, but beware other players will be able to invade your world to kill you aswell.10/10 game in my opinion"
Positive,"This game saved my life.I am 27.My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.Thank you"
Positive,"[THIS REVIEW CONTAINS NO SPOILERS ABOUT SPECIFIC BOSS FIGHTS OR LEVELS][BOUGHT IT WHEN IT WAS ON SALE FOR 18CHF]‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‏‏‎‎‏‏‎ ‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‎‏‎‏‏‎ ‏‏‎‎‏‏‎ ‏‏‎‎‏‏[RATING: 9.5/10]In my opinion, this is  the best  dark souls game in the dark-souls-frachise. This game is really challenging and the difficulty is actually suitable. One of the best things about Dark Souls 3 is that, it doesn't matter if you have never played a souls-like game before, you can still learn a different type of your playstyle and you are going to have a lot of fun by practicing it. Positive:-This game doesn't get boring. You can have such a great time because you are going through a lot of great designed stages and bosses. -The Soundtrack is on top! Almost every boss gets a remarkable theme! -If you have played Dark Souls 1 and 2, then you are going to get nostalgic feelings.-I personally don't enjoy PvP fights, but this game offers the best connection and options for those fights. -Leveling is well balanced. And if you play the DLC's, you get even more souls so you can level higher up!Negative:-To be honest, there is nothing wrong with this game. It still had a few stages that I didn't like going through and maybe they could've been better designed. But that argument doens't count much. This game made everything better than their predecessors. I had a good time playing it and enojoyed almost every single moment/boss. And yeah...this is everything you need to know before buying Dark Souls 3. I would recommend you to buy this game with the DLC's. It's better if you can buy it when it is on sale. And as always, getting information in the world wide web is at your own risk."
Positive,tons of people hate pvp because of walmart connections but personally I feel this is an advantage to the poor minorities.
Positive,"You'll try. You won't know what's going on. You'll think dying is bad. Your friends will explain things to you, using words like, ""Estus shard"" and ""Praise the sun"" and it won't make sense. You'll give up after dying repeatedly on the tutorial boss only to finally kill it and then die to a dog that scares you into falling off of a cliff. Three months later, your friends will convince you to play again. You try it out, only to fail yet again. This time though, you understand that's part of the process, just as your friends had reassured you. You'll roll. You'll roll again, then again. You've done it! The dog that once scared you into jumping off a cliff is dead and you've miraculously taken no damage. Renewed vigor fills you and you continue on. This time you ignore your friends, resorting to the wiki to answer your questions and your own curiosity to guide you to treasure. Suddenly things begin to make sense. You go to bed.You wake up with this incessent urge to play again, oddly intrigued by the story even though you're ""not that type of gamer"". ""Why do I enjoy this?"" You'll ask yourself. Soon, you're rolling in real life, to dodge your responsibilities solely to play this game.Didn't think it'd happen to me. It did. Buy it while it's on sale so the first three months of you not really playing it don't feel like, ""Such a waste of money."" It's not a waste, even at full price. Amazing game and story. So damned confusing at first but it's worth it. I promise you."
