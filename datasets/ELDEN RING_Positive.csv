Positive,First time with a Dark Souls type game and loving it. I am 52 so apparently it's never too late to get good.
Positive,"The note said ""chest ahead"" at the edge of a cliff with nothing in sight...there were plenty of bloodstains but they must've missed the jump... I had to be sure"
Positive,you can hug a woman
Positive,"I'm a total noob when it comes to Souls-Games. Usually I play RPGs on easy mode to enjoy the story in peace.Obviously there is no proper easy mode in Elden Ring, but the game allows you to play it in your own pace.I literally spent the first 12-14 hours just riding around on my horse which I named Dolly, picked up flowers & only killed some easy enemies. The more I played the more I got confident & noticed that I'm able to kill some small dungeon bosses, because the game allows you to level up without going for the big bosses. When I felt strong enough I went for my first story boss & it was fun, not too easy, not too difficult. Like that's the great part of Elden Ring: you don't have to be this awesome Souls-Veteran to be able to enjoy the game. You can just take your time with everything, explore the beautiful world from the get go & just enjoy the view & smaller bosses.The game doesn't push you to kill a certain difficult boss in order to get somewhere ingame. You're not forced to farm the same enemies for hours on end until you're strong enough to continue your journey. You can just keep exploring & will eventually level up in the mean time. & if you're not getting any further with a specific boss, then you can just leave it be for now & do hundreds of other things instead.I would also like to mention that the open world is done really good! You're able to explore every single corner & the game even rewards you for being curious. There are no useless areas in which you waste your time. You're always getting some kind of reward everywhere you go."
Positive,"If you rush you can make it the hardest Souls game you've ever played. If you take it a bit slower, it will be similar in difficulty to the old games. If you take it very slow and out-level content it also fits the bit more casual player, although don't think it will be easy.The open world and ""questing system"" are the new benchmark for the entire genre. For me it's one of the best games I've ever played.Opinion might change along the way as I am only half way, will update accordingly."
Positive,"This game feels like...walking out into Hyrule field after the Great Deku tree. I did not think I would ever experience such an overwhelming feeling of amazement again. Please bring back this level of gaming. I'm so tired of paying $14.99 for skimpy DLC and $29.99 ""season passes."" Just give us complete works like Elden Ring. I promise you'll get all our money.And honestly? This game is the new example in evaluating all others. Why should you pay $60+ for a game that's not even half as complete as Elden Ring?"
Positive,"First game in a long time where you get exactly what you payed for and exactly what was advertised, no micro transactions, no battle pass, just a massive playground where the only one limiting your enjoyment and progression is you. The only thing as grand and marvelous as the world itself are the horrors attempting to keep you from your goals. Elden ring is as hard as you make it.Flaws are few and far between (a few npc quests were unfinished and guess what, its already been patched-looking at you coz!). I wish other game developers put as much love, care, and dedication to its games, its fans, and its employees as FromSoftware has. My advice, explore the world when you get stuck on a boss, go off the beaten path, strike first, strike hard, No mercy."
Positive,it ruined my life and I have no one to talk to 10\10
Positive,one day i’ll be strong enough to beat soldier of godrick
Positive,"Elden Ring was my first soulslike.It was kinda overwhelming when starting but I had tons of fun in my first blind run.Like that's the great part of Elden Ring: you don't have to be this awesome Souls-Veteran to be able to enjoy the game.You can just take your time with everything, explore the beautiful world, enjoy the view and smaller bosses.The game doesn't push you to kill a certain difficult boss in order to get somewhere in-game. You're not forced to farm the same enemies for hours on until you're strong enough to continue your journey. You can just keep exploring & will eventually level up in the mean time. & if you're not getting any further with a specific boss, then you can just leave it be for now and do hundreds of other things instead."

Positive,"You don't lose when you die, you lose when you quit"
Positive,"First impressions and on the fence: I am an older gamer and a father of 4 boys. Elden Ring was the first game for me in the ""Souls-Series"" that I have really played. I did buy Dark Souls 3 and try to play that once it released on Steam, and it took me nearly 3 hours to kill Gundyr; only to find myself constantly invaded, and relentlessly killed when I was trying to play with my youngest son, Griffin afterwards. Needlessly to say, I quickly put that game down and moved on with my life. Years later, my sons showed me Elden Ring and I fell in love with the trailer. My wife encouraged me to try it and be open; maybe this would be a better experience. Time would tell. My gamers of all age and creed, I have put in 1000 hours in and I have no intentions of stopping.  I told myself that I would give an honest review from my point of view if I ever played the game for 1000 hours.Arising as a Tarnished: I can safely say that this game is one of the best games that I have ever played in my life; I have played many. I have experienced such a range of emotions of this game, and no matter how many times I failed at a boss or a mechanic, I always knew that I could better myself if I applied myself; a nice lesson learned in life that transcends quite well into the gaming universes. Once I was able to get my noodle around the mechanics of this game, I fell in love and I could not put it down; I still cannot. You just have to be patient with yourself and believe in yourself. That is one of the many cornerstones of life that leads to success and in these Souls games, it is no different. You can quite literally play the game however you want. Any build you can think of, any style you desire, you can do it here.  Your limits are only set on your imagination and will power.  I have created many different kinds of builds for my complete playthroughs and I never get bored beating the games and repeating the content as a different character from the hit MOBA: League of Legends. Support beyond the Fog:As an older gamer, and father of 4 boys, my time is limited, and it is always an opportunity cost when learning how to play a new game. The community that surrounds Elden Ring are amazing as well, which was very strange at first. I did not expect a game, that is heavily singleplayer, to have an immense amount of care, and support from a community. From this community, the amount of resources of knowledge and guidance they give, often reminds me of my first time playing Star Wars Galaxies, EverQuest and the original World of Warcraft.  From wikis to video playthroughs, and everything in between, anything you could possibly want to know, and answers to the questions that you did not think you could have, the community has your back. Keep this in mind if you are ever stuck in this game, or on the fence about this game. The resources are there for you, the support from the community is there for you both in and out of game. Shout out to Fextralife, Fightincowboy, Giggathiccas, Onion Samurai, Titus Actual, YMAH (the goat), and Steelovsky for helping me in all aspects of the game. If you are ever struggling, please look any of those up on how to better yourselves in PvE or the PvP Aspects of the game. A Seamless Land, that is as vast as the oceansWhen I reached the 25 hours mark, I told my wife that this game reminded me a lot of Nintendo's 1998 hit classic ""Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time"". That world space was so vast for its time, it was like nothing that the world of gaming has ever seen before.  Seamlessly wondering around, adventuring around, didn't matter if you got lost or hit a dead end, I was so engaged back then to explore and find what wonders and secrets held, low and behold, Elden Ring delivered that same experience that I had in my youth. That was so captivating for me and it really left an impression on me of what it means to explore in a game and actually enjoy yourself. It has been literally decades since any game has been able to deliver that experience again and trust me, I have bought nearly all those AAA open world games that have sucked in comparison on delivering a wholesome experience. Final ThoughtsWhen I buy a game, I invest my hard earned money AND my limited time in it. I expect to have a good time with my family and friends that also play that game. I took a leap of faith with this game; especially after my first experience with a FROMSOFT game was quite miserable (LOL not anymore, I have nearly 100% Darksouls III and absolutely love the Dark Souls games, yes including DS II). Needless to say, this game has not only surpassed my expectations, but it has been quite sometime (I would say 5 years) that I have thoroughly enjoyed myself playing a game. Gamer-Rot is a hard experience to endure and live through as a passionate gamer, and Elden Ring got me out of it. Elden Ring has paved the road for me and my sons to spend more quality time together. Thank you Elden Ring. Try Finger, But Hole."
Positive,"I would write a more indepth review, but im too busy playing Elden Ring."
Positive,Every time I hop on this game i either have a great time or am contemplating suicide. Best game ive ever played.
Positive,"This being my first FromSoftware game, I was a bit nervous about the difficulty as I'm not usually a fan of hard content (or very good at it), but to my pleasant surprise, it wasn't as daunting as I'd thought it'd be, and it actually ended up becoming one of my favorite games.I can't remember the last time I had this much fun just exploring and running around in a game's open world, and realizing the sheer scale of it all was both exciting and overwhelming. I spent something like 50 hours exploring Limgrave alone and getting familiar with the gameplay and controls.If I had trouble with a boss or an area, I'd just go somewhere else on the map until I felt ready to take it on, and there's plenty of things to do before even beating the first story boss. Creature summons were also a huge help, and I was very happy with the options available. Trying out new weapons was fun, and even finding new ones for the lore bits was very compelling and made me want to collect them all.My first playthrough ended up being something like 300 hours long, though plenty of those hours were spent doing random things like climbing hard-to-reach places to enjoy the view or leaving fellow players a message!I also spent plenty of time stubbornly dying to enemies I wasn't quite yet ready to take on, and there were two specific bosses that I had a really hard time with, but finally beating them felt SO satisfying, and it was worth all the rage I'd felt when dying repeatedly to them.I asked for help from some friends at times, and there are a lot of funny moments to be had when playing with others. It's also not that difficult to find a random player to summon if you need help with a boss or dungeon. When you're in a boss arena, you can't be invaded, so if you're worried about that, you just have to limit summoning other players to when you're fighting bosses.Though honestly, the invading wasn't as scary as I'd expected, especially when you have the option of asking a hunter for help. I have some great memories from when me and my friend were invaded, times where we got absolutely decimated but also close calls that made us whoop or sigh in relief!I loved the npc's, although some of the quests felt like they ended too suddenly :( Also, I don't care what anyone says, Fia's hugs are nice and warm.Seeing my character in cutscenes, however few, felt very satisfying. Especially as I can't help but dress up for that purpose alone lol.The only bad experience I really had with the game was towards the end. I absolutely hated a certain zone (Farum Azula, cough), and it was the only zone I ended up trying to rush through. Moving around the environment was annoying especially because of the enemies. It's also the only location where my game crashed multiple times. I have to say the location boss was awesome though, as was every main boss honestly. The optional boss in the area was also one of my favorite designs and one of my most memorable experiences in the game.Other than that, I had a few stutters here and there, but nothing too disrupting to my experience.Even if the game seems difficult, I think giving it a chance is really worth it. The game gives you a lot of options if you're struggling, and there are plenty of playstyles you can give a go. Suffice to say, I'm super excited to see what the future dlc will bring and I highly recommend the game! Also, sometimes you really just do need to git guud (I never did git guud myself tho.. :/)"
Positive,"Medium performance issues (as of 2/28/22) but GOTY game. This game is amazing and absolutely dripping with content. FromSoft didn't make Dark Souls 4. This game is Dark Souls 4, 5, and 6 all in one. Absolutely massive game and the open world part doesn't feel like an attempt to pad the game like most games, here's why:- Picking up items in the open world doesn't have a pickup animation. This might not seem like a lot but go play something like Dragon Age: Inquisition and you'll know what I'm talking about.- You can pick up items while on horseback (also no animation), Greatly speeds up looting while in the open world- Summoning pools makes getting summoned for bosses is easier than ever. All you have to do is be in the same general overworld location as a pool and all location get a summon sign- Sooooo many more bonfire locations. Can also fast travel from almost anywhere using the in-game map.- packed with stuff to do. Very rarely are you walking/riding for long periods before running into a dungeon/boss/camp/npc/etc. Every single side location has something to discover, Plus you never know what you're going to get and the feeling of discovery is unlike any other game out there.There are a lot of improvements over previous installments as well. In no particular order, here are some of my standouts:- POWERSTANCING IS BACK BABYYYYY. Was always my favorite thing from DS2.- Slottable weapon arts. Taking the weapon art system from DS3 and making it even better. This system is also tied to the weapon affinity system which allows you to switch up the scaling of a weapon at any bonfire. No more committing to a specific element or stat.- The open world makes the game more accessible. Hit a wall with one zone? Just go somewhere else and come back when stronger. Sekiro had this a little but this game it's extremely pronounced.- The statues of Marika make it so the runbacks for bosses is not nearly as grueling. These statues work as ""respawn only"" bonfires that you can choose to respawn back at and are usually just outside a boss fight room after a lengthy run. You can't rest at them or adjust your build there, but they prevent the grueling runback and allow you to smash your face into a boss over and over with minimal downtime.- Having a dedicated jump button but keep the power of jump attacks. Risky usually, but can also be used as a counter to low swinging attacks. This also adds into the next system of...- Poise breaking enemies. Is done by heavy attacking, jump attacking and guard countering. Adds even more move types to the game and makes every weapon a totally different playstyle and adds to the replay value.- What are guard counters? After successfully blocking and attack, you can follow it up with a special heavy attack that has high poise damage. Allows for more critical hits. You might think this makes it easier but it takes more skill than you'd think to time these ripostes and it always feels good.As with any game, it's not for everyone, but if you love souls games, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by missing this one. If you've never played a souls game, this is the best one to try. The most accessible by far. No crazy hard tutorial bosses, the new ashen summoning bell gives some great support in difficult areas, and the fact you can always leave harder fights and come back to them later makes it so you rarely run into situations where you know booting up the game means you're gonna be brick walling until either the boss dies or you give up."

Positive,"You get to be best friends with not just one, but two jars."
Positive,"I bought this game out of spite because one of my best friends convinced me for the 5th time in a row that ""Soulslike is for me"" even though I could barely be bothered to play up to the first boss in previous entries.  He's not wrong that the game seems perfect for me: a character customization heavy ARPG that actually makes the player work to play better, not farm harder, with mysterious lore, gritty aesthetic, and rogue-like punishment.  Yet time and time again, as much as I want to be enamored by the game, I find myself too frustrated to justify spending time improving, and default to things that are more forgiving.  I am weak.But when I walked out of the gates and saw The Lands In-Between for the first time my jaw hit the damn floor.  I immediately identified multiple places I wanted to explore, and I felt like there was nothing stopping me from doing it.  Of course, the first thing I investigated reassured me that many things could, in fact, stop me from doing it.That's actually what I realized I needed from other Soulslikes.  I don't mind a linear path, but I don't like feeling trapped in the same mistake.  When I'm playing Elden Ring, if I can't figure something out, I don't feel like my entire experience is blocked.  I can walk away and go check out something nearby, maybe find a spell or new armor that gets me through the fight that was stopping me.  I'm always progressing, even if I walk away.  That option solved my biggest problem with getting into the genre.What KEPT me, was all the stuff I'd hoped to get out of the other games.  The characters are vague, but the details they share are just specific enough to cause a sense of wonder.  I actually feel like I'm a part of this huge world torn apart by a tremendous war.  I didn't feel important at the start...but I slowly started to say ""Wait you think I'm not tough after I took down [[redacted]]?!""  I actually felt like the world was reflecting my actions and I worked to earn my place as the difficulty rose, and it was fun doing it!I felt this way when I was a kid and played The Legend of Zelda for the first time.   The storytelling is enough to get you interested in doing things/going places, but doesn't flood you with details.  Dungeons are fun to explore and you know you'll get something out of them.  There are clear rules to getting to the end, but your path there is mostly up to you.  It's wonderful!Now to be clear, there are some issues I have.  The UI is pretty unintuitive, the important things are difficult to recognize as such, but honestly they're so small compared to the highs I really don't care.If you want your hand held, you'll hate this.  If you want to feel like you're discovering a new world that will constantly have you wondering if you can survive the next encounter and push a little further every day, this is for you."
Positive,Please Bring Bloodborne on PC

Positive,"Elden Ring, while imperfect, is the best implementation of an open-world action RPG that I've ever played. It feels like the culmination of every iteration of FromSoft's 'Souls' games into one truly amazing experience filled with intrigue, struggle, and eventual triumph. Fantasy, third-person, open world, action RPG, 'Souls' gameElden Ring is basically Dark Souls 4, or Dark Souls but now you can sneak, jump, and ride a steed around the open world areas. You start by creating a character and choosing a class to determine your starting gear and stats  (e.g. Astrologer to be a spellcasting sorcerer, or Samurai to be a katana-weilding DEX melee build). You progress through the game by traveling around the map and finding items/gear to upgrade your equipment setup and defeating enemies to gain 'runes"" that you can spend to level up or buy items from shops. 'Sites of grace' are the bonfire equivalents in Elden Ring, and most of the time they visually display a path of light that indicate the direction you need to head in to progress the main story through locations of major bosses. There are plenty of these grace sites littered everywhere in the open world and within dungeons so it is easy to fast travel to where you want to go immediately.Elden Ring is an open world game and there are various minidungeons/secrets hidden away in every corner of the map. It is to your advantage to seek out these locations to find rare materials and unique weaponry that may or may not change your play style altogether. The open world feels like there is always something waiting for you to discover, such as powerful enemies that drop unique weapon arts (ashes of war) or an NPC standing around waiting to offer you a quest. With the introduction of a day/night cycle, there are even some bosses that only spawn at nighttime in specific locations waiting to ambush you, but offer unique drops as well.Elden Ring, at launch, was pretty shaky in terms of PC performance. I personally played this game to completion with below minimum specs (AMD FX 6300, RX 480) averaging 40-50 FPS at High settings. I encountered no game-breaking bugs/detrimental FPS hiccups in any playthrough, though the only issue I encountered was that enemies would sometimes become invisible on my screen whenever a large group of enemies were in an area, but they were still lock-on-able and would render again when I got closer/killed some of the group (this is probably just because my CPU is ancient). In terms of graphics, Elden Ring doesn't break new ground when it comes to overall presentation, but it is a very colorful game compared to previous Souls games. You can really tell when you enter a new region when all the colors transition from one palette to another and the sky/landscape dramatically changes as well. Dark areas are also pretty spooky as you can only see far enough from the light of your torch or lantern and enemies hide in the shadows very well.  The long story short is: the Elden Ring was shattered into fragments and various demigods took the pieces to gain the fragmented powers within them. You are a 'Tarnished' which is basically a pseudo-undead human who is guided by grace to seek out the pieces of the Elden Ring, put them back together, and become Elden Lord in order to bring the world back to ""order"". (All of the details in between for NPC's and items is basically found in NPC dialogue and item descriptions for you to piece together, or until a genius puts all of the information together in a YouTube lore video)•Combat feels the best it has ever been for 'Souls' games. Sneak attacks, jump attacks, ashes of war, NPC summons, mounted combat, guard counters, power-stancing, and everything else feels very, very good.•Touching more on ashes of war, they basically allow you to add (and remove later) a unique skill to most non-unique weapons in the game. They also allow you to change the scaling of a weapon to a different one of your choice (if you also have the right whetstone) so you can make a weapon scale with INT or FTH even if it originally didn't.•Boss encounters are exciting and challenging. If you feel underprepared, you can always to back to the open world and look for missed locations and items to better prepare yourself. (Also, feel free to use your ash summons whenever possible; it is a game mechanic after all)•You can build a character however you desire, whether it be dual-weilding greatswords, holy knight, melee-spell-casting wizard, or pure archery.•There are lots and lots of weapons to try, leading to more replayability as you try a new one in a future playthrough•The crafting system is interesting as you can create consumables and throwable items when out of combat. You can even create bow/crossbow ammo which is very neat.•Just when you think you're near the end, the map expands further and there is even more to discover.•Compared to the other Dark Souls stories, Elden Ring's story feels the most digestible at face value without feeling completely puzzled from the outset.•PC performance isn't stellar if you are bothered by occasional FPS spikes or the rare game crash on loading screens. •Not game-relevant, but the game doesn't fully ""exit"" when you quit out until a while later.•Early game bosses reappear as 'mini-bosses' or just wandering around later game areas leading to some feelings of reused content.•There is a massive spike in game difficulty from the mid-game to the late-game. It feels weirdly balanced when enemies all of a sudden go from doing 1/5 of your HP in damage to 1/2 of your HP in damage.•UI could use a feature to compare stats of shop items with currently equipped items•Online connectivity can be hit-or-miss. Sometimes when you are summoned to another world, you get a ""connection error"" and the game boots you back to single player. •Be wary of hackers when playing co-op/PVP. Previous exploits have occurred where upon death, you would return to single player but be instantly dying forever because the hacker put you in an endless death loop. That exploit was patched, but we all know how hackers don't just give up.•(Not a negative for me, but maybe if you like PvP): You can only invade other players if they are participating in co-op. Basically, unless a host uses a specific item, invasions usually lead to 1v2 or 1v3 scenarios (note: AFAIK fight clubs are only affected in that # of summonable participants is limited). I don't invade, but I've seen many people whining about this change when it makes sense why it is this way.•So many important names sound very similar to each other that it could be difficult to remember who is who (e.g. Godwyn vs Godfrey vs Godrick).•'Great Runes' are pretty underwhelming in terms of power. •Although I enjoy the game design of not having a dedicated questlog ingame, it is still to your benefit to just read an NPC's quest guide off the wiki to keep yourself on track.9.9/10; easy recommendElden Ring has set my bar for 'open-world RPG' standards. The added gameplay features like jumping, horse-riding, sneaking, etc. make the game's action much more interesting and fun than previous FromSoft games. The game kicks my ass at every step of the way, but the struggle and eventual triumph is worth all of it. Though it is not without fault, I love this game and can't wait for future DLC.  Checkbox reviews are lazy copy & paste bullsh*t. ASCII art reviews tell you nothing. ""Let's be honest, I only wrote this review for awards"" is a waste of everyone's time. If you are interested in genuine & detailed game reviews, feel free to check out my others here (or don't, I don't tell you what to do)."
Positive,Play this if you also enjoy getting your balls crushed by a hydraulic press.

Positive,"Easily the best game I've played in many years, and it deserves a longer review than most of you have patience for. I highly recommend it, and here's why:Like many who play this game, this was my first ""Soulsborne/Soulslike"" game, as it is the most refined and user-friendly version of FromSoftware's game design ethos. I avoided the Dark Souls series for many years. I had a presumptuous view of FromSoftware and their visual aesthetic that made me feel this game was just sad edgelord material. I was so wrong. Like all FromSoftware games, Elden Ring revels in struggle. Only the most basic combat mechanics are explained to the player; the rest is trial and error. It challenges you to tease out its mysteries, not just of the world and lore, but of the combat mechanics and UI. The game asks you to STRUGGLE (you need to be open to that to fully enjoy it), and oh boy, did I struggle...I struggled to simply navigate the user interface, to find the extra info on weapon damage and scaling, armor ratings and status defenses, even item descriptions full of implicit lore that give the player a small understanding of what's happening in the Lands Between. I struggled to accept that not every field boss in the overworld was meant to be defeated when you first encounter them. I struggled to avoid traps and ambushes. Even when I gave up trying to play solo and attempted to use the Co-Op multiplayer system, I struggled to understand the seemingly obtuse system of items that enable it. Even after, I struggled against skilled and relentless Invaders, many of whom have been invading players since Dark Souls 1. I'm ashamed to say I struggled to not uninstall the game and play an easier one with a more forgiving learning curve. Such was my frustration.Most of all, I struggled to get acclimated to the combat mechanics... Until, a whole 40 hours (and many deaths) in, something clicked. I started seeing and feeling a flow to combat, requiring a skillful dance between dodging perfectly into attacks and identifying narrow windows for my own attacks. I started to understand every movement and attack option's purpose and viability in different scenarios. I started understanding how to most efficiently manage my stamina, consumables, and other resources. I started seeing challenges and opportunities where before I only saw difficulties and defeat.This began a shift in my mentality. The developers were not taunting or trolling me, like many players seem to think; they were inviting me to experience a true power fantasy, to feel a tangible sense of actual progression in skill and understanding. The game does not say ""git gud, noob""; it says ""rise, Tarnished"".So many modern AAA games are released with a product mentality first and foremost, and not even as good products; they are often unfinished, rushed, bugged, and bloated with profit-maximizing strategies like microtransactions. Elden Ring is the first game I've played in a decade that felt like a complete game, full of hundreds of hours of content. So many games frontload their ""best"" content and force you to engage with it to force your interest, but much of Elden Rings best content is hidden or blocked by combat and platforming challenges. I have almost 3k hours logged, and I'm still finding out new things the game has kept hidden from me. This speaks so much to the confidence the developers have in their vision of an adventure fantasy game centered around discovery.The game is not perfect. There are still some bugs and glitches present from launch that have no clearcut development solution. Many bosses, enemy types, and other assets are re-used all over the map to mixed effect. Some lategame and endgame content feels rushed and spread out. Perhaps worst of all, like all games with an active PvP element, the player community is rife with toxic players who seem hellbent on griefing others into making them uninstall the game.Even with these glaring imperfections, this game shines like a diamond in a sea of coal coated with cheap craft glitter. It stands head and shoulders above almost all other modern AAA games in terms of intrigue, combat satisfaction, exploration, and story, and it doesn't even flaunt it. An understated and nuanced gaming experience is such a delight in an era where games are intended to feel more like blockbuster Hollywood movies rather than progressive adventures. Elden Ring is the culmination of FromSoftware’s singular and robust design philosophy, honed over decades of trial and error. If you experience only one Soulsbourne game in your entire life, let it be Elden Ring."
Positive,"My mother has always been a gamer. She played many various series throughout the decades, but her most recent interest was Elden Ring. I've personally never played any of the Souls games for my own reasons, nor did I have much interest, but my mom would tell me about her grand adventures exploring The Lands Between. She was always enthusiastic about it and I would listen, even if I had no idea about anything she was saying.On April 7th, my mom had a stroke and I found her slumped in her chair. She was rushed to the hospital but, after five long days, she passed away. After the funeral and some time to grieve, I was going through her things and found Elden Ring on her computer. It dawned on me that she never finished this game she was so ecstatic about, so I decided I would complete it in her memory.Elden Ring is a fantastic world of exploration and discovery. It allows the player to cheerfully change course as they discover the next distraction every few seconds. There's hardly any required order of activities to perform and you can serpentine across the world at your leisure.The gameplay is challenging, but rewarding and exciting. Hitboxes are tight, animations are fluid, and everything controls well. Melee combat is weighty and the enemies react in a satisfying manner. Magic is powerful and varied in execution to keep things fresh. Just about everything is viable, so have fun with it. There's many small rewards to enhance your gameplay hidden around, so it pays to take your time and comb over areas you think you've completed.Dueling against other players is also exciting. They're capable of everything you are, so you have to stay on your toes. Be ready to counter their actions and punish openings.Difficulty is high, but not impossible. I spent enough time wandering early on that the first real boss fight was no issue at all. You can also level up and grind stats, if you want/need. Some fights are obviously going to be harder than others, but you can learn most of them and overcome anything the boss throws at you if you relax and read their inputs.The story is interesting, but obtuse. Not enough is explained well in-game, and I relied on some abridged lore videos to better understand what's going on. I'll refrain from spoiling anything here though.I played through the first half of the game on my own, offline. Then I decided to try online when a friend was continuously asking if he could join. Both are enjoyable experiences, but I would suggest offline/solo play if you're a slower and more thorough individual.I enjoyed the time I spent in Elden Ring alone, with friends, confused, triumphant, and even despaired. It's an exhilarating experience that invaded my dreams and had me theorycrafting builds during my work hours. I'll enjoy many more hours in the near future when DLC arrives.I hope my mother enjoyed watching me play and was satisfied with the story path and ending I chose. I will never forget the life she gave me and the struggles she faced along the way. There are so many things I never got to say, so many milestones in my life she will never get to see, and locations we never got to visit.To anyone reading this, please do not take for granted the time you have with your loved ones. Life really can surprise anyone at any time, anywhere. Every day you wake up with breath in your lungs on this beautiful planet is a gift. Spend it together."

Positive,"This game delivers the entire experience in a way I've never quite seen. I'm new to the souls-like genre, and FROMSOFTWARE games. Here are the thoughts: I've spent 200+ hours in this game as of writing this and I've barely left the starting area - Limgrave. My nightmares consist of Runebears, traversing the mist, and boss fights. I've been startled, pillaged, rekt, and absolutely confused many times, but I wouldn't change any of it. I remember the first time I saw a giant I had Attack on Titan flashbacks and began trying to summon my inner Captain Levi. It's just a blast. An absolute blast. The greatest feeling of accomplishment is when you start to beat bosses or new enemies on your first attempt. You can feel your ability, your reaction time, your muscle-memory coming more and more into play as you practice, and it creates a thrilling experience. Struggling with an enemy type for hours only to come back a few days later and realize how much stronger and faster you've gotten is a very rewarding experience.I was a bit nervous about the difficulty as I'm not usually a fan of hard content (or very good at it), but to my pleasant surprise, it wasn't as daunting as I'd thought it'd be, and it actually ended up becoming one of my favorite games.I can't remember the last time I had this much fun just exploring and running around in a game's open world, and realizing the sheer scale of it all was both exciting and overwhelming. I spent something like 50 hours exploring Limgrave alone and getting familiar with the gameplay and controls.If I had trouble with a boss or an area, I'd just go somewhere else on the map until I felt ready to take it on, and there's plenty of things to do before even beating the first story boss. Discover new dungeons, Cave, Hidden Item, Secret Spells, Underground, Mini bosses etc.. Summoning Spirit were also a huge help, and I was very happy with the options available. Trying out new weapons art was fun, and even finding new ones for the lore bits was very compelling and made me want to collect them all.Even if the game seems difficult, I think giving it a chance is really worth it. The game gives you a lot of options In open world amazing quest, beautiful scenery that is pretty enough reason to try it. If you're struggling, and there are plenty of play-styles, magical spells build as well to play with.This is the game which actually teaches you that  Quitting is not an option but dying is"

Positive,"Out of pure frustration, I often get up and find myself doing some chore around the house.  At least half of my play time is just being afk doing the dishes or loading the washer or dryer. My house is spotless now. Thanks Elden Ring. No ultrawide support. 9/10."
Positive,"So, I came into this game as a person who hates the Souls-genre. I'm not that good at combat in video games as I typically like games where you can just hack or slash your way through everything. So when Elden Ring was announced and talked about pre-release, I was like ""Nah, i wont like it."". Fast-forward to when it released I was watching a few friends play it and it looked amazingly fun. So I was like... I gotta bite the bullet and try it.Lo and behold it was the best decision ever! Elden Ring while a souls-game has a feature to it that actually made it a lot more comfortable for me to play than any other souls game: It was open world without a defined path you have to take. Sure, the grace sites tell you WHERE you should go, but you can generally ignore them. Also sure, you have to beat certain things in order to ""win"" the game, but you can like ignore that for a really long time and just explore. I had so much fun exploring the game and just messing around with magic that it really didnt feel like a souls game until like mid-game. That's when the bosses started to get really punishing for me. However, I only had to really call in my friend like three times? One of those times was just because it was like eleven at night and I was exhausted and just really wanted to get past the boss.So, honestly, without going further into it and allowing you to explore on your own, YES get Elden Ring, even if you typically hate Souls games. This game is literally the souls-genre redone in a way that almost anyone can get into it. One last thing to mention before i peace out, but I have REALLY bad ADHD to the point where it's rare that a game actually keeps my attention. I was absolutely hooked from start to finish with this game."

Positive,"I consider this a good game, so you should check it out.This game has it all:- obnoxious NPCs who won't tell you what you need to do- 1,000,000 bosses- enemies- invaders who'll give you free items, or pain if you're unlucky- dog- sniper lobstersEnjoy"
Positive,"After 98 hours I believe I have fully finished the game, completing all bosses and completing what I believe are all 6 endings to the game, although I'm convinced there's 7 and now confidently write my review on the game.For the sake of not wasting much of your time with this review i will start with the bad- Weird FPS stuttering issue, I didn't really get this bad compared to most people seemingly but I did encounter it in a particularly foggy and snowy area of the game. Hopefully they can fix up these PC port issues quickly.- The worst PvP invasion system out of all their titles. The only way you can invade is if someone has summoned help already, that means the invader has to always 2 v 1 at a minimum but in fact most of the time they are actually 3 v 1ing as the person being invaded will summon in additional help. I personally think this invading system is absolute garbage awful design and it's especially tragic with how well the rest of the game is designed and it really cuts deep with the potential this title had in regards to PvP.- Bad summoning multiplayer system. I believe this game has a level scaling system if you play multiplayer with your friends and use a password so your high level character can help out a friend, however for absolutely no reason, this is not the universal multiplayer system and they did not extend this level scaling system to the random summons to help people or the random invading PvP. This means that I, with my level 165 character are destined to never be able to use multiplayer system to help out new players kill early game bosses even though they actually have a system in the game that I should be able to use in order to do this.- An issue that almost all open world games have towards the end of the game. Copy and Paste enemies and bosses where unfortunately due to the scale of the game that variety of bosses and enemies gets thin, and you get bosses that are 2 or 3 man of previous bosses. Also due to the nature of an open world if you explore and happen to successfully grind through a difficult or area you're underleveled for, this will ultimately mean you have thus overleveled another area. I had this problem myself where I explored and facesmashed through a couple of massive hidden zones and thus overleveled probably 2 main zones I had to progress through later. Having said that in the last 2 or so zones and especially the last hidden zone of the game I seemed to be at the correct level for them so it seemed to equalise regardless towards the end of the game. - I believe the game actually tricks new players into a more difficult experience. At the start of the game you are given a direction of where to go through arrows on the map pointing you where to go. The arrows in Limgrave, and in Liurnia point you towards a major boss / zone that is actually substantially more difficult than the other major boss and Points of Interest in the zone. I believe for the sake of new players they should somehow adjust the arrows. I highly recommend new players, especially to the series as a whole explore zones to their maximum before actually following the arrows which seems counter-intuituve design.Now let's talk about the good parts- There are a couple of systems in place that make it the most accessible From Software title for new players. The main system is the Spirit Ashes system that is basically an offline summoning system that summons an upgradable NPC or group of NPCs to help you. This system alone makes the game exceptionally accessible for new players to the series as these NPCs are frankly and I believe intentionally busted, if a player ever gets bored and wants to progress a frustrating part of the game they can pop one of these and fly through it.- Another major plus to this game compared to previous titles is the sheer variety of builds, especially through the Ashes of War system that allows you transform any standard weapon to scale with any stat. This with the sheer variaty of weapons, armour etc. that are already in the game adds massive replay value to the game over time. Also the game has a built in easily accessible respec function. I'm already looking forward to trying new builds through new game+. The culmination of this variety in builds really solidifies Elden Ring as the Magnum Opus of the Souls combat system, which once again makes how bad the PvP is sting extra hard.- Open World, Storytelling and Characters. I really enjoyed the Open World myself and believe it was a great evolution to the series that just requires some kinks sorting that I've discussed previously. You can actually see landmarks on the map without having visited them yet. Caves, Towers, Churches and especially the Ruins are all clearly visible on the map before you have visited them although there are also some hidden ones for the people like me that also like exploring.Overall I found the world and zones themselves very varied and interesting going between zone to zone, so that's definitely a big plus of the Open World design. Whilst From Software isn't the pinnacle developer of graphics, From Software has always been phenomenal at environmental design and they carry on their form in Elden Ring.- I enjoy the Elden Ring story more than other Souls titles. I found it had a much stronger foundation that you could more easily understand and follow, it made you want to explore the world more and interact the NPCs regularly. Elden Ring didn't leave a lot of the story vague, throughout the game it solidified the lore into quite an easy to understand package and I believe this is a plus personally.In my opinion Elden Ring has the most interesting NPCs and also Quests out of all the titles. I love the secrets in From Software games and fortunately Elden Ring has a good few of them that were a treat to discover with all the NPCs. The NPC quests were quite long, fleshed out, interesting to the story and if you explored the game fully weren't really terribly difficult to miss. They also contributed a lot to a few of the endings which I found really cool.Middling things that can be positives and negatives- The ambient soundtrack for the zones is the best out of all the From Software games, however I found a lot of the actual boss music quite hit and miss. Overall it was good enough for me to buy the Soundtrack so there's that I guess.- They managed to make, in my humble opinion the worst 'poison swamp' area out of every souls game. Take that as you will. Hidetaka Miyazaki spared no expense in the creation of this area.Closing NotesTo summarise this review, I strongly believe this to overall be the best From Software title for a singleplayer experience and possibly the worst for a multiplayer experience. New players and Veterans alike can have an absolute blast due to the systems they have implemented. The sheer freedom in this game is incredible from the build variety to how you explore and progress through the game which gives this game a ton of replay value compared to previous titles and also gives Elden Ring the strongest combat in a souls game so far. The story is interesting and in my opinion more concrete than previous From Software games which made it very fun to learn about as you played through the game, the NPC quests are the most interesting so far. The PvP invasions had the potential to be the best in all Souls games due to the aforementioned build variety but they messed that up, hopefully they will change it. The multiplayer with randoms is unfortunately hindered for absolutely no reason. Hopefully they fix the performance issues, luckily I didn't really have any except a little bit in one zone.Naturally this review is all my opinion, if you disagree that's cool. If you have performance issues that's unfortunate, hope they fix them.Your review is 4,745 characters too long. Please shorten it and try again. Bruh."
Positive,"Being my first souls game, I was convinced I would be wasting my money, and that the first boss I encountered would kick my ass. And I was proven right in no time, by the Grafted Scion. “But you were expected to be defeated by that one!”, you say. Worry not, the Tree Sentinel was also quick to put me back in my place once I had built the tiniest bit of confidence after beating the tutorial boss.The game is fantastic. It got more and more rewarding as I progressed, and I was happy to beat the game a second and a third time, finding out new secrets during each playthrough. There’s no compliment I can come up with that hasn’t already been used to describe this game.There are so many weapons with so many different builds to try. Bosses can be frustrating but there’s so much fun to be had. Even what is considered to be one of the toughest fights (looking at you, Malenia) is incredibly fair and fun. And the spectral horse you get is most likely the best horse I’ve ever ridden in any game, ever.If I had anything to complain about, are the platforming sections. But after looking it up a bit, apparently FromSoftware never really knew how to do those, and they are so few and far between, that's hardly a reason not to buy the game.I could also complain that I was unable to romance Boggart or Blaidd. They’re so cool.10/10, the DLC cannot come a day too soon."
Positive,"This game reminded me how much I missed exploring an immense open-world and how gaming industries have lowered my standards over the years. No unnecessary guidances, no go-and-pick-some-flowers to craft healing portions constantly, no warnings. The only thing the game requires is people to explore this open-world. Beautifully written. I dont think I will be obssesed with a game like this for a long time."
Positive,"It will seem unfair, almost rude and insulting to play, at first. Every step of the way Elden Ring challenges what you think you know about action games, and video games in general. You're plopped into a world with little to no map markers. Zero quest log. Dialogue is spoken once to you by npcs, better remember what they say! And the world is completely open. It takes modern open world concepts that have been overused and some how makes them feel fresh. The reward of continuing on despite your many failures, is what makes Elden Ring so unique and enjoyable to play. Nobody in their right mind would release a game like this in 2022. But here we are. Elden Ring feels like it's from a different time period in gaming. Like it came straight out of the 1990's early 2k's but with the graphics and precision you would expect from a title in 2022. Without all the bloat and nonsense. Elden Ring doesn't waste your time when you play it. It's just a masterpiece. It's like the game we have all been waiting for. If you have been playing games since you can remember and loved Ocarina of Time, the Elder Scrolls and multiplayer games like Halo. There is something you will love in this game. The multiplayer alone is an exceptionally unique and wacky experience that I highly recommend.10/10, wish I could replay it all over again for the first time."

Positive,"Since the release of Skyrim on 11/11/11 I have been craving an open world experience with rewarding combat, build theories, crazy-beautiful aesthetics, and a real sense of accomplishment (items, dungeons completed, etc).This game delivers the entire experience in a way I've never quite seen.  I'm new to the souls-like genre, and FROMSOFTWARE games.  Here are the takeaways for me: 1. Combat is extremely rewarding by being unforgiving.  At first glance, it's hard, but as you delve just a little deeper you realize that combat in this game is an art form that takes practice, and then more practice.  The satisfaction is higher than any game I've played in the last decade.  The light attacks, heavy attacks, blocks, parrying, sprint attacks, sneak attacks, all play a little different and allow you to really pick your method or avenue of approach.  2. Items in game (from armor and weapons, to craftables and ashes) are each, individually, potentially game changing or build changing and can really flesh out a 'build'.  It's rewarding to find items in game as any one of them could be the weapon of choice for your desired build.  3. Open world is absolutely stunning and feels very scary, yet very exciting.  Every new enemy seen needs to be studied, practiced, and learned for optimal combat.  New enemies can be scary as you don't immediately know their capabilities.  Boss fights are hard (some more than others) and many enemies are the type that require you to come back at a later time when you have stronger tools, or more HP, or you git gud.  Roaming new areas is thrilling and you begin to truly have to balance and manage your HP, FP, and Stamina while in combat.  The lighting in caves with torches or lanterns is immersive and you feel the danger.4. Character building is straightforward.  You level up as you beat enemies and use the runes (XP, currency) as you see fit to either purchase things, or level up....etc and you can decide what attribute to increase.  Trying new weapons, new armors, is both fun and interesting.  The need to knows: 1. Game won't hold your hand.  You are in a labyrinth with many things that all can kill you.  You will not know exactly what you're doing, where you're going, or why you are existing. 2. Everything you see can kill you if you become too careless.  Slow and steady usually is the best method.  Slow is smooth and smooth is fast.3. Ashes of War, summoning and crafting must be experimented with to understand.  Again, no hand holding.4. You will ask yourself, ""How in the world am I supposed to ever be able to complete this?"" Many, many times.5. Puzzles and secrets abound, exploration and a good memory are key.  6. While there is a multiplayer experience (PVP and PVE) it's a bit confusing and from what I've experienced so far, not necessarily mandatory.  The single player experience is strong with this one.I've spent 42 hours in this game as of writing this and I've barely left the starting area - Limgrave.  My nightmares consist of Runebears, traversing the mist, and boss fights.  I've been startled, pillaged, rekt, and absolutely confused many times, but I wouldn't change any of it.  I remember the first time I saw a giant I had Attack on Titan flashbacks and began trying to summon my inner Captain Levi.  It's just a blast.  An absolute blast.  The greatest feeling of accomplishment is when you start to beat bosses or new enemies on your first attempt.  You can feel your ability, your reaction time, your muscle-memory coming more and more into play as you practice, and it creates a thrilling experience.  Struggling with an enemy type for hours only to come back a few days later and realize how much stronger and faster you've gotten is a very rewarding experience."
Positive,"Playing Elden ring is like being married to a guy who's attractive, charming and funny, you're basically soulmates and everything is perfect.

Positive,"FromSoftware said, ""Hey, we've never done an open-world RPG, I guess we can take a whack at it."" Then they delivered the best game of the genre in over a decade (perhaps ever). Everything I dislike about modern OWRPG games is gone from Miyazaki's masterpiece. Other AAA games just keep copying the success of Skyrim, but having bigger and bigger maps with wide open level design, 1000 map markers telling you exactly where to go and what to do at all times, and combat systems that are generally pretty lackluster and simple.Elden Ring shatters all of those contrivances with a fresh approach. The world of Elden Ring is admittedly massive, but unlike other games in recent memory, no corner of this map ever feels empty or boring. The level design is lightyears ahead of most open world games. Verticality, labyrinthine platforming, and environmental puzzles are back on the menu after being abandoned by the hundreds of Skyrim clones this past decade. The ""legacy dungeons"" as they are known here, are on par with the best of FromSoft's Dark Souls series (which is famous in part due to its long track record for stellar level design).The combat system and character customization are familiar for fans of FromSoft's previous entries, but in the new context of the OW genre, it feels better than it ever has. The addition of jumping mechanics, simple but satisfying mounted combat and exploration, and a heavily customizable weapon skill system compliment the play style of a huge game like this. Weapon balance has been a bit shaky since the launch of ER, but recent patches have helped every playstyle feel satisfying and powerful without sacrificing the challenge.Speaking of difficulty. This game is difficult. More difficult than people unfamiliar with the developer would expect from a game of this genre, but not quite as difficult as the more punishing examples from other ""Souls-like"" games. The game does not hold your hand or litter your map with dozens of quest markers and points of interest. If your map is marked, it's because an NPC just told you that they would mark your map, or you've just discovered a new fast travel point. The game subtly guides you to the next major objectives through unobtrusive visual cues and context.Another way the game accomplishes this task is by avoiding the shortcut most developers take to ""level the challenge"" to the player's current level. Elden Ring allows you to go wherever you want to go, but if you enter an area that you are not ""supposed to"" yet, then you will be punished by 15 foot tall hyena beasts, giant demon crows, and plagued wolves that will bleed you out in seconds. You will either naturally gravitate back toward the areas appropriate to your level, or you will rise to the punishing difficulty and be appropriately rewarded for your determination. Every area feels rewarding. Discovery is an element that is difficult to get right. Even in some of the best OW games ever made, the lazy answer to reward exploration is to create 200 collectible items hidden in obscure locations that award trophies or minor character progression. Elden Ring makes genuine exploration feel rewarding nearly every time. Somehow they have significant secrets hidden nearly everywhere. if you spend 5 or 10 minutes striking out into the unknown you are almost certain to find sexy loot, a secret dungeon, an interesting enemy or NPC, etc. (but none of it feels like ""Hooray, you found your 147th korok seed!"")A few points of criticism are the performance issues that have been present since the launch. Despite having graphics that feel more like they were released late last generation, there is some persistent stuttering even in the most powerful rigs, so a consistent 60 fps can be a bit elusive. While the art direction and style are phenomenal as always, the graphics themselves are a bit dated. This is most likely due in part to the long development of the game, and partly due to FromSoft insisting on using their same old engine instead the newer options. Some long time fans may find the gameplay systems to be a rehash of ""Soulsborne"", and have heard some fans say that they wanted more variation this time around. I personally do not agree with this take, as I've played every single FromSoft game since Demon's Souls on opening day, and Elden Ring did not strike me as stale, but I do understand why some would see it this way.I see these drawbacks as very minor in the greater scheme of this game, and they do not take anything away from the spectacular execution on virtually every level of game design. Though I may be slightly biased in favor of FromSoft, If I am trying to have a modicum of objectivity I am comfortable saying that I think Elden Ring is one of the best open-world games of the last 15 years, in the same tier as the likes of Skyrim, Breath of the Wild, and The Witcher 3. However, my more subjective view is that this is likely my favorite game of all time.Either way, this game is an easy 10/10."

Positive,This game is all about dying.Dying because you were out skilled.Dying because you were under leveled.Dying because you were ambushed.Dying because you were outnumbered.Dying because you fell off a cliff.Dying because someone left a message telling you to jump.Dying over and over again against a boss.Dying inside because you lost runes.Dying inside because you wasted a consumable on an easy battle.Dying inside because some fights feel impossible.Dying at the realization of how large this game is.But for whatever reason I'm dying every day to keep playing.
Positive,"I have spent hours in both the base game and DLC. Here are my thoughts.I am in no way a hardcore player. This is the only game I have ever played by this company.  This game pissed me off so much because I didn't understand that is was out the box a difficult game.  I have since then completed 100% of the achievements and got through the DLC.  The DLC is rough but if you you just want to progress and beat bosses with ease, there are options.  Spirit summons, youtube cheese videos.  I enjoy exploring. I love the graphics and sometimes I want the challenge of a boss.  However I have completed the game made it enjoyable on my terms and don't care if I don't kill the boss without a summons.  I don't get paid to play games, so I take advantage of everything I can find and do in the game to go from point A to B.  I recommend the Base game and the DLC.  I looked at the DLC as how can I defeat and cheese the new bosses.  Not how do I learn the mechanics so people will know I am a good player.  I just don't care, I want to beat the game start to finish.  If I can do this and I am not a good player, then spend the money and beat it your way in anyway you see fit."

Positive,"The game is frankly weak. Let me start with the cons that outweigh the pros: the open world feels empty, and it copies mobs from Dark Souls, even though this is a new universe and game. It's very difficult to follow the path planned by the developers because if you find the boss later, you'll be too strong for him and will kill him on the first try. An open world is not suitable for this genre. The quests, as always in the games from this studio, are rubbish. In Dark Souls, they could be completed intuitively, but here, maybe 0.1% of players will finish them without guides. You practically need to get into Miyazaki's head to figure out where the quest character is standing this time.There are few good bosses  8 come to mind, and it's even funny to call the rest ""bosses."" There's a lack of a coherent local plot, and instead, we get more vague, global nonsense about gods and aliens.Now for the advantages of the game: the beautiful locations, a sea of interesting weapons and spells, and the 8 good bosses. I especially liked the capital, though sadly, it was the only location that truly impressed me."
Positive,"After beating the basegame 3 times & the dlc there are a few things i noticed:1. The game really likes tree's. Golden Trees, Big Trees, Sentient Trees, Dead Trees, Burning Trees, Tree Knights???2. Never take a nap in a coffin, you will wake up at some f*cked up places. (Of course you do)3. NEVER take advice from somebody who played the game before you did, chances are they are 100% wrong and biased because they think there is a ""correct way"" of beating the game4. Just play the game the way you want to, this community has some really weird people thinking they do some sort of ""pilgrimage"" for beating this game a certain way & you're wrong if you dont do it the way they did.5. Speaking of point 3, Age of Order Ending (Goldmask Dude) is the best one, you cant tell me otherwiseGreat Game"
Positive,"Elden Ring is a very good game that not only deserves game of the year but is easily a candidate for game of the decade. Good gameplay, fascinating story, tons to explore, beautiful world, interesting characters, fair monetization, tons of replay potential, little to no bugs... Pretty much anything a game can do right, Elden Ring does right. I believe this is a game that everyone should own.That being said, I do have somewhat of a bone to pick with this game. That bone being how lonely and depressing it leaves me feeling while playing it. For clarity, I’ve played and finished all three Dark Souls games and understand that it’s pretty par for the course with Fromsoft games of this genre. Maybe I’m just tired of this trend in the series, or maybe it’s the current state of the world leaving me looking for a more upbeat form of escapism.Regardless I couldn’t bring myself to finish the game seventy hours in. After lengthy play sessions I found it impacted my mental health for days afterwards. It’s a depressing world; once great, now all but dead. Everyone in it is either dead or dying and of those remaining, only a handful aren’t actively trying to murder you. They’re sprinkled around the world serving as beacons of hope in a world where there is no hope, and there is no future. Try as you might, there is nothing you can do to help these people. To add onto the lonely nature of the game is the depressing ambient music playing constantly in the background and the ravaged landscapes littered with war torn battlefields. The utterly decimated remains of cities, and fortresses once great, now inhabited only by lifeless husks, or mindless monsters. You’re late to the party; there’s no  war  to fight. The war is already over. You’re not the hero sent to  save  the world, you’re the janitor sent to clean up what remains of it in the hopes that a clean slate can birth a brighter future.I think something that could have helped alleviate this constant feeling of loneliness would have been to implement a city full of people. Something to show the player that there’s more than just five people on this planet, there’s actually something to fight for. Instead we’re left with a hopelessly nihilistic perspective of the world of Elden Ring. No doubt by design; yet, nonetheless soul-suckingly depressing.Ironically this game serves as a beacon of hope in an industry full of unfinished, half-assed, rehashed, overly-monetized garbage. Godspeed Fromsoft, and long live Miyazaki. Praise the sun.EDIT: Also, give us  actual  co-op please. Not only would this help alleviate the feeling of loneliness, but is a long desired feature for the souls-like series."

Positive,"I first played this on console when it released and quite enjoyed it. Having made the switch to PC gaming, i wanted to replay it on Steam to be ready for the DLC.Some people will tell you that Elden Ring is the easiest game from FromSoftware and well, they're right to some extent. This mainly lies in two things: first, the open world structure allows you to skip a boss if you're feeling overwhelmed to come back later, after getting more levels and gear. That's something you couldn't really do in their previous entries. Also, you have access to a variety of powerful tools: weapons, skills, builds and summons that can make your journey much easier.You want to do it the hardest way possible? Great, skip those, you're in for a challenge. You could use some help? Use them or summon a friend to assist you. I can perfectly understand that some people have busy lives with work and kids and don't want to spend their game time wiping dozens of time on a boss, but still want to experience the FromSoft touch. There's no better way, just play the way that gives you the most fun.The game is Exploration with a capital E. No symbols to tell you where to go, no quest diary. It can be intimidating, specially if you tend to have FOMO. The good part is that, by closely looking at the map, you will find clues to places of interest. The play area is huge, so is the content. At times i felt like it was too much, but at least you can't accuse FromSoft to deliver you an incomplete game.Some graphical assets are heavily reused, that's true, but it didn't really bother me that much. Speaking of graphics, if you like dark fantasy atmospheres, oh boy, you're in for a treat.That game is making FromSoft accessible to a wider array of players and it's perfectly fine with me."
Positive,"A week ago I was diagnosed with a terminal illnes and the doctors have given me a year at best. I'm so glad I was able to play this masterpiece before I go. I don't know how many people will see this; but I recomend to you to buy this game if you do see it. Gameplay, atmosphere, bosses, ost... everything is masterfully crafted. Thank you FromSoftware for your game."
Positive,"I honestly believe all of the people who say that Elden Ring has unplayable fps and microstutters. I've been lucky to be in that Goldilocks zone where my hardware doesn't encounter any of that; any frame rate dips only occur when quickly moving through environments. Load times are about five seconds at the most when using fast travel on a i79750, RTX2060 and 16GB of RAM.The game itself is a marvel. The addition of jumping, reintroduction of powerstances and weapon arts make it the darkest of all Dark Souls. Just refund it under Steam's <2 hour played policy if you're encountering performance issues, otherwise you're missing out on a really neat game :)"

For those of you like me who enjoy comparing stats on your loot and figuring out the best build for the right situation, this is the pinnacle. The ONLY thing I would caution is that if you have a life, kids, etc. this game might suck 600+ hours of your life like it did me.Thumbs way way up"
Positive,"I had never previosly played a From Software game before Elden Ring. I had very little experience with souls-likes, my only one being CODE VEIN which I had been playing on and off at that point, and never ended up finishing. By all accounts, this is not a game I ever thought I'd be interested in.But there was so much excitement about it on launch. It looked amazing. A friend had taken a week off work just to play Elden Ring. And so on an impulse, I purchased it too.Playing Elden Ring for the first time was one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had.""The gold that enshrouds the heavens. The great tree which begets the pillars of light.O Tarnished, hasten to the foot of the tree.""Elden Ring is set in an open world of the Lands Between. It's jaw-droppingly beautiful, diverse, and most importantly - very good at encouraging and rewarding exploration. I will not say anything more - it happened more than once that getting into a new area would leave me in awe, and it is really worth experiencing on your own with minimal spoilers.The gameplay loop in Elden Ring is fairly simple. You explore, you kill monsters, you get stonger by acquiring gear and levels, and use all this strength to beat big bad bosses to become the baddest boss of all - the Elden Lord.Combat feels nice and smooth, and it's pretty easy to get the gist of even if you're new. You have your normal melee weapons, you have bows, you have magic... and each weapon also comes with a special strong ability called Ashes of War. And all of it works, and looks, and feels absolutely amazing.And if that's not enough, the game offers an ability to summon NPC spirits to aid you in battle - specifically in bigger fights and boss fights. This makes Elden Ring very accessible to newer players, who are trying it as their first From Software game. Don't get me wrong though - it is still very challenging.Best part - due to the open world nature of the game, if you're stuck somewhere, or just don't like the place, you can simply turn around and leave! Return later, or not at all, it's really up to you.You can play with the controller or on keyboard & mouse setup, the latter of which works very well so you don't really need a controller if you don't already own one....I'll actually go on a side tangent about controls. Unlike DS3, where it is impossible to get the UI to display keyboard controls, which makes playing on KBM an absolute headache of confusion, UI in Elden Ring fully supports KBM (you just... still need to find how to switch it because the controller controls are considered default, sigh), and the game itself is nicely* optimised** for KBM controls. (*not perfectly, just nicely)(**you can do everything you can on the controller, you may just need a bit of time to figure out some Ashes of War with double component - there's some clicking trickery involved)""All I wanted was to fight. To fight, as a warrior, to the last...So, Why? Why, O guidance of grace, will this door not open?""Elden Ring is a game that I really want to recommend to everyone... But I'm sure that, despite what I think about it, it might not be everyone's cup of tea (my boyfriend is still not letting me live that recommendation down...). But, if you enjoy beautiful worlds, poetic and enigmatic storytelling, and engaging exploration, and you aren't afraid to try something scary and new - maybe this is something you should really, really give a go.10/10 best game ever"
Positive,"My first souls like game and never thought I would enjoy these type of games, but this one left me wanting more, so will be playing all of FromSoftware games.I usually get burnt out in such massive open worlds, due to my OCD making me have to go everywhere and pick everything up, but for some reason I didn't with Elden Ring. What an amazing game!"
Positive,WARNING : This game can ruin other open-world games for you !!! ( especially games from Ubisoft  )
Positive,i did it
Positive,"TLDR:Elden Ring, while imperfect, is the best implementation of an open-world action RPG that I've ever played. It feels like the culmination of every iteration of FromSoft's 'Souls' games into one truly amazing experience filled with intrigue, struggle, and eventual triumph.GENRE:Fantasy, third-person, open world, action RPG, 'Souls' gameGAMEPLAY:Elden Ring is basically Dark Souls 4, or Dark Souls but now you can sneak, jump, and ride a steed around the open world areas. You start by creating a character and choosing a class to determine your starting gear and stats (e.g. Astrologer to be a spellcasting sorcerer, or Samurai to be a katana-weilding DEX melee build). You progress through the game by traveling around the map and finding items/gear to upgrade your equipment setup and defeating enemies to gain 'runes"" that you can spend to level up or buy items from shops.'Sites of grace' are the bonfire equivalents in Elden Ring, and most of the time they visually display a path of light that indicate the direction you need to head in to progress the main story through locations of major bosses. There are plenty of these grace sites littered everywhere in the open world and within dungeons so it is easy to fast travel to where you want to go immediately.Elden Ring is an open world game and there are various minidungeons/secrets hidden away in every corner of the map. It is to your advantage to seek out these locations to find rare materials and unique weaponry that may or may not change your play style altogether. The open world feels like there is always something waiting for you to discover, such as powerful enemies that drop unique weapon arts (ashes of war) or an NPC standing around waiting to offer you a quest. With the introduction of a day/night cycle, there are even some bosses that only spawn at nighttime in specific locations waiting to ambush you, but offer unique drops as well.GRAPHICS/PERFORMANCE:Elden Ring, at launch, was pretty shaky in terms of PC performance. I personally played this game to completion with below minimum specs (AMD FX 6300, RX 480) averaging 40-50 FPS at High settings. I encountered no game-breaking bugs/detrimental FPS hiccups in any playthrough, though the only issue I encountered was that enemies would sometimes become invisible on my screen whenever a large group of enemies were in an area, but they were still lock-on-able and would render again when I got closer/killed some of the group (this is probably just because my CPU is ancient).In terms of graphics, Elden Ring doesn't break new ground when it comes to overall presentation, but it is a very colorful game compared to previous Souls games. You can really tell when you enter a new region when all the colors transition from one palette to another and the sky/landscape dramatically changes as well. Dark areas are also pretty spooky as you can only see far enough from the light of your torch or lantern and enemies hide in the shadows very well.STORY:The long story short is: the Elden Ring was shattered into fragments and various demigods took the pieces to gain the fragmented powers within them. You are a 'Tarnished' which is basically a pseudo-undead human who is guided by grace to seek out the pieces of the Elden Ring, put them back together, and become Elden Lord in order to bring the world back to ""order"". (All of the details in between for NPC's and items is basically found in NPC dialogue and item descriptions for you to piece together, or until a genius puts all of the information together in a YouTube lore video)STRENGTHS:•Combat feels the best it has ever been for 'Souls' games. Sneak attacks, jump attacks, ashes of war, NPC summons, mounted combat, guard counters, power-stancing, and everything else feels very, very good.•Touching more on ashes of war, they basically allow you to add (and remove later) a unique skill to most non-unique weapons in the game. They also allow you to change the scaling of a weapon to a different one of your choice (if you also have the right whetstone) so you can make a weapon scale with INT or FTH even if it originally didn't.•Boss encounters are exciting and challenging. If you feel underprepared, you can always to back to the open world and look for missed locations and items to better prepare yourself. (Also, feel free to use your ash summons whenever possible; it is a game mechanic after all)•You can build a character however you desire, whether it be dual-weilding greatswords, holy knight, melee-spell-casting wizard, or pure archery.•There are lots and lots of weapons to try, leading to more replayability as you try a new one in a future playthrough•The crafting system is interesting as you can create consumables and throwable items when out of combat. You can even create bow/crossbow ammo which is very neat.•Just when you think you're near the end, the map expands further and there is even more to discover.•Compared to the other Dark Souls stories, Elden Ring's story feels the most digestible at face value without feeling completely puzzled from the outset.WEAKNESSES:•PC performance isn't stellar if you are bothered by occasional FPS spikes or the rare game crash on loading screens.•Not game-relevant, but the game doesn't fully ""exit"" when you quit out until a while later.•Early game bosses reappear as 'mini-bosses' or just wandering around later game areas leading to some feelings of reused content.•There is a massive spike in game difficulty from the mid-game to the late-game. It feels weirdly balanced when enemies all of a sudden go from doing 1/5 of your HP in damage to 1/2 of your HP in damage.•UI could use a feature to compare stats of shop items with currently equipped items•Online connectivity can be hit-or-miss. Sometimes when you are summoned to another world, you get a ""connection error"" and the game boots you back to single player.•Be wary of hackers when playing co-op/PVP. Previous exploits have occurred where upon death, you would return to single player but be instantly dying forever because the hacker put you in an endless death loop. That exploit was patched, but we all know how hackers don't just give up.•(Not a negative for me, but maybe if you like PvP): You can only invade other players if they are participating in co-op. Basically, unless a host uses a specific item, invasions usually lead to 1v2 or 1v3 scenarios (note: AFAIK fight clubs are only affected in that # of summonable participants is limited). I don't invade, but I've seen many people whining about this change when it makes sense why it is this way.•So many important names sound very similar to each other that it could be difficult to remember who is who (e.g. Godwyn vs Godfrey vs Godrick).•'Great Runes' are pretty underwhelming in terms of power.•Although I enjoy the game design of not having a dedicated questlog ingame, it is still to your benefit to just read an NPC's quest guide off the wiki to keep yourself on track.NUMERIC SCORE (if you care):9.9/10; easy recommendElden Ring has set my bar for 'open-world RPG' standards. The added gameplay features like jumping, horse-riding, sneaking, etc. make the game's action much more interesting and fun than previous FromSoft games. The game kicks my ass at every step of the way, but the struggle and eventual triumph is worth all of it. Though it is not without fault, I love this game and can't wait for future DLC."
Positive,"I am not a ""Dark Souls"" player. I have tried them and bounced off hard because I am just not that coordinated nor patient. That said, this game rapidly became one of the 5 best video games I have ever played. And I've been playing them since the 80's.If you like exploration and adventure, this is the game for you. And as a byproduct I've actually gotten better at combat. Like actual skill.I'm now over 100 hours in, and I've only defeated the 1st main boss because I'm having so much fun with exploring. I haven't had a moment of boredom or feeling I've played this out. I'm hoping it is another 100 hours because I'd rather it didn't end. I'm hoping to stretch it out until the DLC."
Positive,"my first message was ""try tongue, but hole"" souls games never change."
Positive,"I had bought this game before and ended up returning it because I didn't think i'd be able to progress in it. I had never tried a Souls game before and told myself it was too hard. I play games for fun not to beat my head against a wall. I finally told myself i'd try again. I'd really give it my all. Today I beat the game, downing every boss including Melenia. Elden Ring is one of the best games i've ever played and i'm glad I decided to give it another go. What a journey. Thanks FromSoftware! <3"

Positive,"I have 59 hours in this game and I think I'm still 5-10 hours from beating it. (lol good one, it took me about 80 hours to beat my first play through and then I kept playing. I found TWO new areas after I had beaten the final boss) I have done nothing since 4pm on Thursday, February 24th but wake up, play this game, and go to sleep. If you are concerned about not liking open worlds but you like FromSoft games, just give Elden Ring a chance, I swear it will be worth it. Most open world games for the last decade are full of nothing. They look nice, but have next to zero substance. Elden Ring's open world is comparable to Breath of the Wild, and no game in since BotW's release has made me feel the way BotW did. Every way is the right way. There is insane new stuff around every corner. You'll think you have dementia because every 20 minutes you'll find some insane new thing and forget what you were actually trying to do beforehand. It's not a graphical marvel, but FromSoft has never had the chance to apply their style to a fully realized world, and the Lands Between are jaw dropping at times, and always stunning regardless of your location. While at its core its still SoulsBorne, it's hard to compare to the rest of the series because of how much of a difference the open world makes. Elden Ring was worth the wait, and is easily one of my favorite games of all time. This game is worth full price and always will be and you should support FromSoftware and buy this game at $60 if you can afford to do so. Hopefully they will be making memorable and creative games for the forseeable future.If you are worried about the PC performance issues many people have complained about, here is my input on them. I have a 2070 super, 32GB of ram, and an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-Core Processor 3.59 GHz. It only occasionally (every 15-30 minutes maybe) stutters when I'm in a large open area or when there are lots of particle effects on screen. It's not unplayable, it is a second or two of reduced framerate. It has never gotten me killed or made the difference between life or death in 60 hours. It is locked at 60fps, which is not a problem to me and it shouldn't be to you either. Like I said, FromSoft games have never been graphical innovators. The difference between 60 and 120 frames is negligible and FromSoft has made it clear they're working to optimize it as much as possible. There has been noticeable improvement from day 1 even. You could probably run this game just fine with a 1070 as the recommended specs suggest. It's not unplayable unless you're a complete snob, in which case I suggest you remove the graphics card from your rear end."

Positive,"I'm only writing this review because Shadow of the Erdtree was finally announced and I want to go on the record for anyone who never got around to playing it yet for whatever reason. If you heard about the DLC and are thinking ""yeah, maybe now is the time I'll finally dive in"", then this is directed at you.Elden Ring is not for everyone. If you don't respect the grind, then it will kick the shit out of you without remorse. There is no easy mode, no save-scumming, no cheat codes, and absolutely no hand holding. Yeah sure.. you can rely on Youtubers and Wiki pages to tell you what some of the ULTIMATE BUILDS might be... but even if you're relying on a crutch like that, you STILL have to put the work in and ""git gud"" when it's all said and done. It also takes a while to even get access to all the weapons/gear that those guides expect you to be using, not to mention earning the experience needed for the build to be viable. So my suggestion to you is to worry less about building an exact carbon copy of a character that some other person already played as, and just try to take it all in and experience it for yourself first.I got every achievement, defeated every boss, and it was the most rewarding grind I've ever embarked upon in a game. I made a lot of mistakes along the way, but I learned from every single one of them. I got my ass kicked every time I booted up the game, but every triumph I celebrated was unlike any other thanks to all of those ass-kickings. From the hardest boss fights to the most annoying mobs, you truly feel every single victory... and that's where I got hooked because the sense of accomplishment you get from progressing in Elden Ring... I'm telling you, it is the ultimate dopamine shot.Now, I personally loved the story, but it's definitely a subjective experience. Elden Ring is a mythological story about gods and demi-gods, and if you take the time to read through the item descriptions, look closer at the game world, and try to fill in the gaps kind of like a detective would, then you will probably enjoy it too. If you are expecting the cutscenes to be the only thing you have to pay attention to in order to know what's going on, you might be disappointed. Without a quest menu or anything like that to keep track of things, the game forces you to do your own due diligence and keep track of the NPCs you've spoken to, and to really listen to what they say because completing side quests isn't like most open world games that just plop a waypoint down for you to walk to after you've skipped all the dialogue. You need to listen and think about it, and if you've already progressed through certain points of the main-story, then you might not even get to experience some of the side quests. This aspect of Elden Ring can be a bit frustrating because you really aren't given any indication if you've missed a part of a quest or if you missed a quest entirely until it's too late. I will just say that if you're bee-lining it straight to the main bosses, you are definitely missing a LOT of what makes the game so good (and you're also missing out on side quests that lead to valuable ITEMS and EXPERIENCE!!!). So if you don't want to miss anything, my advice is to take it all very slow, and just try to clear regions and talk to everyone you see before moving on to new areas. If you think you missed stuff, keep in mind that you can always try again in NG+. Multiplayer is completely optional, but opting in to allow invasions can be rewarding because testing your build against actual players is pretty fun, plus you get to also see what other people are doing with their characters. Sometimes seeing someone else in action can inspire you to try new stuff, or it can make you aware of a flaw in your own character. I will say that I personally played with the player messages turned off though because I didn't want to read possible spoilers, and I felt reading messages left by other players all over the place broke my immersion.. but to each their own.If you've never played Elden Ring before and are finally considering a run through the game for the first time... I truly envy you because I would do anything to wipe my memory and play it again for the first time. It is a game like no other, and it will test you in more ways than one. Just don't get discouraged when you hit a wall.. because we've ALL been there... all you have to do is learn to overcome it. Once you do, I promise there is no greater feeling in all of gaming."
Positive,"I've sacrificed my schooling, relationship and health for this world. 10/10 would do it all again"
Positive,"My brother bought this game for me just to laugh his ass off and he was 100% sure that I wouldn't make past the 1st boss because the game is hard as heck. Well here I am, finished the game whose laughing now broo? Anyways Elden Ring is an amazing game and I fell in love with it even though I had my doubts at first lol, some of the bosses were extremely challenging and heck I wanted to give up many times cause I was frustrated as heck even some mobs were difficult to kill but once I got deeper into the game I just wanted to finish it and now that I have finished it, it's a bit sad that it's over ;'(The game has such a beautiful graphics and the map is unbelievably huge, sometimes I would just waste my time exploring the world it's crazy how big it is and the soundtrack is remarkable and would get goose bumps from how amazing it is. Got hooked into the game too much that I even searched for it's lore.ELDEN RING IS MASTERPIECE I'm glad that I gave it a try!!!POOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT"
Positive,"I still hear these words in my nightmares...Other than that, I'd recommend Elden Ring.I'm really bad at souls-like games but still enjoy them. Can't dump 1000 hours into any of these games to ""git gud"", so I thought I would give Elden Ring a try. I've read that it's a bit more forgiving than Dark Souls or Bloodborne, still challenging but not in a ""git gud""-kinda way.These articles and comments were right.While I still struggled at a few points, it never felt unfair and I was never ""stuck"" cause of Elden Ring's open world. Whenever a boss turned me into tomato paste 30 times in a row, I turned around and progressed on a different route. Fighting a different boss, defeating him, getting stronger and returning to the other boss again.I really enjoyed the game and I am looking forward to the DLC."
Positive,"100% Completed this game on both Xbox and now Steam. It's my favorite game of all time, and I've been playing video games for over 40 years. Runs great on PC, didn't have any issues. If you are nervous about playing this because you've heard it is difficult, don't listen to that criticism. This game is only as difficult as you let it be. There are plenty of ways to ""easy mode"" your way through the game. Give it a chance! You will love and adore it as much as I do by the time you are done. And I guarantee you will want to give the other souls games a try!"

Positive,"This is going to be a long one, go get a cup of coffee if you care enough about it. You know that feeling of being completely hooked to a brand new thematic world? Elden Ring manages to do it just as you start your journey in The Lands Between. Fight your journey through dungeons and catacombs, find treasures, get to know your enemies and discover brand new areas, each containing new lore and development that can be discovered by various meanings, talking to NPCs, reading items descriptions, finding patterns that links the bosses and lords of that area to the creatures there. It's everything we always wanted in a Classic Fantasy Medieval RPG. For the first days If I could I would not have stopped playing this game by any means, I just wanted to discover more and more and unravel it's secrets, so much fun, especially when you have friends to talk about and when you realize, they are in a totally different area that you don't even got to explore yet, but the game gives you that freedom, you are allowed to do what you can in order to progress, by your own pace and your own way. The combat got much better from previous titles in the soul series, being able to jump is amazing and having your horse to battle along side you creates a feeling that the other games simply couldn't give you. The hitboxes are better, the battles are fluid ( When you don't have that FPS drop from nowhere, but I'll get there ) and I truly believe that everyone can enjoy this game, you are the one who defines the actual difficulty of the game, there's a reason people can beat this game without getting hit, and even though of course, many bosses are tough especially if you want to play a certain way, you can and will GIT GUT, take your time. After you are done with that annoying boss the adrenaline rush you will have will be worth it. The soundtrack and the world sounds are just amazing, you can hear the noises inside dungeons, the miners banging their pickaxes against the rocks, the screeches of the creatures, the mad-whispering of the anguished souls, the water flows, the birds chirping, everything feels natural and involving. Everything made so that the world feels alive and true to it's nature. As far as the lore goes, it's a Souls game, it will be cryptic but this one gives you much more to know about, it hints you about it's mysteries and what's happening in a way that feels more natural and approachable. And all the endings and ways to get there will allow you to speculate in your own way if that happened because it had to be this way or you couldn't really do anything else about it, letting a lot for your own mind to imagine and distinguish. You'll have your own theories at the end of the game, wondering what could possibly follow your decisions. What will happen to that world after that lowly tarnished changed it. Well,  not everything is as amazing as it could be, being very straightforward, some recycled bosses felt a bit underwhelming and the optimization could be much better. After the first patch things got better, and it's far from being unplayable, but the game still struggles in some areas, and that it's not dependent on hardware, rather, it's probably related to the way it was programmed. Hopefully the will keep following with the intended patches and keep improving that segment as much as they can.All in all, it truly is an amazing game and I'm happy that it managed to keep up with our expectations, it's certainly a title that Ill keep coming back to play more in the future. It's hard nowadays for games that have an open world to not feel empty and to not make the player feel tired, they sure managed to do it in a much better way than other recent titles could, and that alone is something that I was sure looking forward to."

Despite my initial frustration and hesitation, the game's challenges became opportunities for growth.

Positive,"""A man may be destroyed but not defeated."" -Ernest HemingwayThis game is the first souls-like game that I actually played from the start to finish. I tried other titles but gave up on them quickly after a couple hours. So first thing I want to say is this game feels more welcoming to the genre than other titles.I don't know where to start about talking this game. Rich open-world, very rich combat, interesting lore, amazing designs... It has been a while since I really really felt excited to keep playing one game. I wanted to push further my character, my equipment, my gamestyle as I progressed through the game and see different bosses. Especially the satisfaction you get from beating a boss after using your equipment optimally is unmatchable. I actually felt that I rose to Elden Lord title from being a Tarnished that others has been looking down at.Lot's of the content is actually optional to progress in the game, and I usually skip most of optional stuff in other titles because they are mostly unpleasant chores. I felt different while playing Elden Ring, I actually tried my best to not miss anything at all. I wanted to see what every loot is, what enemies or mini bosses I could see and what missions I could progress. I could agree that NPC quests are a little bit hassle to follow and usually you might need to check wikis but I assume that is a standart for the genre. Even that really didn't bother me all because I liked NPC's too. They were pleasant to interact with and see how they progress with you as their quests go on. Even if you don't care NPC's I think anyone would still be excited to see what loot a dungeon contains in this game because there are lot's of fun stuff out there.I found combat fun, it is still hard but they were aware about the game they were developing. Just go out there and grab those different items, spells, armors, swords, consumables... First it might be a little confusing and overwhelming but you quickly get used to managing items. Then fight anyone however you desire to. They gave you freedom with such a rich list of items. As you get better and your equipment gets better you feel the improvement on your way to kill your desired boss. If you are a hardcore souls fan you can also beat anything with a stick too.Whole lore is actually pretty interesting but also hard to follow and learn. This is one of the things I assume ""genre standard"" so it didnt bother me much. Game doesn't tell you anything much, you read it all from items descriptions, NPC dialogues and other stuff like that. You also actually don't have to learn lore to follow the game though and just play for the combat experience. Another thing is game does not really lead you much at all so it might be really confusing and overwhelming. You can play it blind and keep wandering around till you find a lead or you can pop up a wiki page and follow it too. You might think looking at wiki's might destroy your fun but to be honest, as someone who finished their first souls-like game, it really didnt kill my joy because it is better than being stuck somewhere for hours you know. This game is a long journey and you'll get the hang of it, you just might need a little bit patience and help first couple hours.Recent open-world games mostly felt %80 empty for me, but this game is different. Almost every part is a delightful adventure. I am both content and happy with the money and time I spent with this game, which is a rare feeling actually nowadays especially with the new titles. Even if you are not acquainted with genre, just don't hesitate and jump for a pleasurable adventure. Go wander out there and find your favorite equipment, find your favorite boss to fight with. Just sit and enjoy how a spirit of fighting rises within you as you progress through game. I am sure most people can enjoy this game as I think this game is really a welcoming and pleasuring one. I personally liked this game so much that now most of the other games that I play now feels dull. I am planning on buying the DLC now.A protracted and tough adventure awaits you, Tarnished Warrior. Do not give into despair and keep fighting, be assured that you will soon be blessed with contentment."

Positive,"Game is bloody brilliant. They took the classic Dark Souls format and made it more accessible in 3 ways.First, there's more to do. More items, quests, and materials to collect means progression feels more meaningful. Second, the graphics are much prettier.Third and most important, the game feels easier. It's not *actually* easier, but the open world structure means you don't get stuck bashing your head against a really hard boss fight. If an encounter is too hard, you just go around it and find something else to do while you get stronger. You probably won't even attempt the first boss until you've hit a major power spike. This means less time head bashing and more time making progress and improving your character. Feeling stuck was one of the chief complaints I had about the Dark Souls series, and it seems like From Software has fixed that.Edit: I was super butthurt by the stuttering too until I followed the steps in this thread and completely fixed it! https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/t0q22j/possible_fix_for_pc_frame_rate/"

Positive,"It's been a while since a video game made my jaw hit the floor, and ELDEN RING managed to do that multiple times.It deserves all the awards it gets.  Solid 10/10."
Positive,"Elden Ring was one of the most thrilling and satisfying games I've ever played. The atmosphere completely drew me in, and I had an immense pleasure exploring the world for hours. The game's difficulty might seem intimidating at first, but as I played and learned the enemy attack patterns, the challenge further motivated me. Each victory gave me a tremendous sense of accomplishment.The gameplay was fluid and finely crafted. The controls were responsive, and my movements directly translated to my character. It required time and practice to master the combat system, but the process was incredibly satisfying for me. The inclusion of different weapon and magic options allowed me to diversify my playstyle and provided opportunities to employ different strategies in each battle.In terms of in-game richness, Elden Ring did not disappoint me. There was always a new area to explore, a hidden item to discover, or an intriguing character to encounter around every corner. The bosses' designs, stories, and fighting styles were remarkably impressive. Engaging in side quests and making choices to unravel the stories of characters further connected me to the game world. Additionally, the time loop system allowed me to experience different encounters and events, making each playthrough exciting.Elden Ring's story completely immersed me. The lore and world design were profound and captivating. The backgrounds of the characters, the history of the world, and the events unfolding in this chaotic realm constantly pulled me deeper into the game, fueling my desire for more exploration.In conclusion, Elden Ring was an unforgettable experience for me. Its beautiful gameplay, challenging nature, richly crafted world, and captivating story kept me glued to the screen for hours. It's a magnificent game that everyone should try."

Positive,"went through all stages of grief while fighting Malenia solo, got depressed for losing a shit ton of runes by falling off a cliff, grew anxiety cause everything's trying to kill you, lost all the nerves in hero's graves...overall great game 👍🏻"
Positive,"Heartwarming family friend game.  A girl appeared from nowhere and helped me a lot, cool adventures together, that was lit.  Met another girl in some ruins, we talked, met her pet wolf and did some errands for her.  Met her mother who gave some lecture in her library.  Met her brother which was super nice to invite me for his festival with some amazing fireworks, lots of cool people there.  Met her other more fancy brother who invited me to join their family, nice hospitality with some snake bbq in his place.  Asked her hand (btw many hands)... her father was a bit annoyed by it, something about rings or one specific, btw a lot of talking about THE right ring, had some disagreements, they got tired and then disappeared to get some rest.  Married her.  10/10  Would recommend  Obs: Her other relatives are a bit odd, serious woman saying it was the blade of her brother, looking for her brother ( pretty sure she is too overprotective ), her brother in the other hand... passed out (maybe hangover?) with some other guy singing ""Nihil Nihil Nihil"" in some weird bloody-messy mansion, the other ones were too old and too grumpy imo."
Positive,"Elden Ring. A game that has exceeded my already high expectations. FromSoft have managed to somehow create a huge (and I do mean huge) open world version of Dark Souls with lots of Bloodborne and Sekiro in the mix too that surpasses them all in pretty much every way. A game full of wonder, secrets and excitement all the way through. The art style and soundtrack are glorious and of course there's the challenge. It's tough at times but rarely does a game feel so satisfying overcoming those challenges. Great fun.A fantastic gaming experience. I highly recommend Elden Ring."

Positive,"While i'm not far into it, so far it is great. All negative reviews are due to the stuttering. I have a 3070 and I googled a solution.WIth Nvidia GPUs go to Nvidia control panel and change the global shader cache size in 3d settings to unlimited. Also limit the fps of Elden Ring, I have it set to 60 fps. So far no problems on my end. Hope this helps somebody choosing to get the game.If u have AMD GPUs I don't know specifics so please ask google sorry for not being able to help, but I know it is a similar process.Now 30hrs in the game is so good tooNow done with the game it is amazing"
Positive,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

Positive,"my dad said if this review get 100 likes then he will buy elden ring shadow of the erdtree collector's editionedit review: MY DAD BUYING IT, THANK YOU YALL <3"
Positive,"I started the journey as a lowly tarnished, with only the guidance of grace to guide me on a perilous path of struggle, hardship and suffering. I stumbled, I failed and I died. I came back up again, learning from my mistakes.In the journey, I faced many great enemies. Some I admired and respected while some I loathed and hated, yet thankful for them all.I made friends, learned from teachers, faced-off adversaries, fell in love, cried in loss, and shared on the happiness of each and every characters of the game. For those who may call me their consort, their lambkin, their tarnished, or even their lord; i express my thanks.This game was my second entry to fromsoftwares, ( the first being sekiro), and I am at a loss of words to express the emotional rollercoaster I went through during my playthroughs. I now understand why their games are so well-celebrated and has such a vast community.It doesn't matter if I am a lowly tanished, I shall never put my foolish ambitions to rest."
Positive,"I’ve 100% completed Elden Ring on PS5, got the platinum trophy which was an absolute blast, and now I’m diving into it on PC. FromSoftware, you’ve seriously outdone yourselves. Elden Ring is nothing short of phenomenal, and it's hard to imagine how you'll ever top this.From the moment I stepped into this vast, mysterious world, I was hooked. The blend of deep lore, challenging combat, and stunning landscapes is just incredible. The gameplay is smoth and perfectly balanced, making every fight feel like a rewarding test of skill.Exploring the world of Elden Ring is pure joy. It's packed with secrets, hidden paths, and lore that keeps you wanting more. The environmental storyteling is so rich that every corner of the map feels worth investigating. Each region has its own uniqie look and feel, so exploration never gets boring.Now, let’s talk about the only thing that annoys me: the catacombs or dungeons. This has been a problem since Bloodborne (my favorite game of all time). Even though Elden Ring does it better than Bloodborne, every dungeon still feels a bit like an AI-generated copy-paste job. But hey, they’re still fun.The character builds you can create in Elden Ring are better than in any Souls game before it. Whether you’re into melee combat, magic, or a mix of both, the depth here is just amazing.In short, Elden Ring isn’t just a game; it’s an experience. FromSoftware has set a new standard for the genre and maybe created a new genre, and I can’t wait to see what they do with the DLC. If you haven’t played it yet, do yourself a favor and dive in. You won’t regret it."
Positive,My friend who I play ELDEN RING with said if I post a review on this game and it gets 2000 likes and 500 Awards that he will buy me a RTX 4090 and 2 Kilos of canned beans. So I'm just gonna leave this here. Help a brother!
Positive,"It's a beautiful open world game, the best I've ever played, a great experience."
Positive,"try finger, but hole"
Positive,"Elden Ring is the best selling FromSoftware game, the 2022 GOTY and one of my favorite games of all time. Many think that Elden Ring is merely Dark Souls with an open-world twist, but trust me, it transcends that simplistic comparison.Note: This review is entirely spoiler-free. Any potential spoilers will be concealed in black boxes, so feel free to read without concerns about plot reveals.Elden Ring's character creation stands out as the best among all the previous Souls games developed by FromSoftware. The face visuals are more detailed, and there are additional customization features. The effort put into character creation really paid off, providing players with more opportunities to craft unique and distinct characters.The opening cinematic in Elden Ring, a tradition in Souls games, left a strong impression on me. The art style, quality, and voice acting exceeded my expectations, making it one of the best introductions in video games.For those new to this gaming style, Elden Ring may be challenging initially. While I, having played many Souls games, didn't encounter such issues, my advice is to be patient. The game's difficulty is fair. If a boss feels unbeatable early on, it means you're not prepared. Explore more, level up, get better gear—soon, the game becomes more manageable. Surprisingly, Elden Ring felt the easiest among the Souls games I've played from FromSoftware, at least until Malenia kicked my ass for 7 hours straight before I beat her....Some folks argue that mixing an open-world style with the Souls formula messed up Elden Ring. Here's my take: it's a bit of both. Having a huge map is cool, but it's tough for devs because they can't just copy-paste empty areas. So, they filled it with stuff like ruins and caves. The downside? Some bosses start feeling a bit repetitive. I get it's hard to make a big map and balance it with creativity at the same time, but meeting the same mini-boss a bunch of times got a tad boring, even though I got used to it.On the positive side, the open world showcases stunning landscapes with distinct vibes in each region. The immersive atmosphere, especially at night, is captivating. Elden Ring's design, featuring captivating night skies and distant, beautifully crafted structures, prompted me to capture numerous screenshots—an aspect I genuinely adore.However, the open-world setup also poses challenges with quests. Side quests are easy to miss, especially for those playing blind. Elden Ring's vastness means NPCs can be overlooked without exploring thoroughly. While some give hints, it's not foolproof. Not everyone may value these side stories, but they play a significant role in the game, as I'll elaborate on in the next section.The caves and catacombs scattered throughout the vast lands offer an enjoyable exploration experience, enriched with puzzles and mazes. I relished navigating through each one, and the inclusion of a cooperative element by summoning a friend to explore together adds another layer of fun to the exploration process.Side quests in Elden Ring are essential for me, adding significant depth to the overall experience. Without them, the game would be less enjoyable. While some may not prioritize side quests, I encourage giving them a chance. Personally, when I invest in a game, I want to explore all aspects. Delving into NPC stories enhances the game's coherence, as these side quests are intertwined with the main lore. Skipping them means missing a deeper understanding of the story. While you can watch them on YouTube, experiencing them firsthand is incomparable.The uniqueness of each NPC's story in the side quests was something special in Elden Ring. Going through them step by step and keeping track of each character's journey proved to be incredibly rewarding. Emotionally, these side quests had a significant impact on me, and I strongly advise against ignoring them if you decide to play the game. I know it's tough to keep track of all of them, but I managed by using Word and doing some Google research. I did get spoiled at times, but for me, it was better than missing out on these rich and engaging stories altogether.Elden Ring's lore is truly beautiful and well worth delving into. The game is undeniably complex, especially for newcomers like myself. However, once you start paying attention to item descriptions and NPCs' dialogues, connecting the dots, the story unfolds into a masterpiece that's unique in every way. Initially, I chose to remain ignorant, avoiding YouTube videos and online articles to steer clear of spoilers. Still, I eventually had to seek out essential lore to grasp the basics without ruining the experience.I stumbled upon a spoiler-free Reddit post explaining the fundamental lore, aiding my understanding of the game. Despite this help, my first playthrough left me perpetually confused—a familiar feeling I've grown to love from previous souls games. After completing the game, I turned to VaatiVidya's YouTube videos (the Souls lore guy) for a deeper perspective. This transformed my view, prompting a second playthrough on the same save file. Now, I appreciate the interconnected details; As an example, even the design and symbols on the enemies' armor carry meaning.Bosses are undeniably crucial in Souls games, determining the overall quality of the experience. While I acknowledged earlier that the game has repetitive mini-bosses scattered throughout the vast lands, the main bosses are a different story. Each is uniquely crafted, presenting a special and distinct challenge. Not all of them posed significant difficulty for me, except for two late-game bosses, but I genuinely enjoyed every fight, regardless of the level of challenge.However, my disappointment lies in the lack of memorable soundtracks during boss fights—a departure from the impactful music in previous Souls games. Despite logging 178 hours (for now), I struggle to recall a single boss theme, even for the main encounters (the final boss fight is an exception). Elden Ring fell short of my expectations regarding the musical accompaniment to these pivotal moments.Elden Ring introduces fresh mechanics, such as Ashes of War and summoning spirit ashes, along with a wide array of weapons—an excellent addition to its expansive world. While the gameplay remains familiar to previous Dark Souls titles, the added features enhance the overall experience, making it feel even more engaging.The game is so vast that there's a lot more I wish I could discuss in this review, like its online features and the different endings. However, I'll keep it short, especially about the endings due to steam limitations.Elden Ring features multiple endings, and some players choose to end their journey with the default one, which I personally find less interesting. Therefore, I strongly recommend pursuing the other main endings, as they offer a much more captivating experience than the default one.As I conclude this exploration of Elden Ring, I encourage fellow Tarnished to venture beyond the conventional and embrace the myriad tales this intricate world has to offer. May thou journey be filled with discovery and triumph in the Lands Between."

Positive,"Yeah! Pretty good!Some advice for newer players and veterans alike: upgrades to weapons matter more than the stats they scale on; get your quality-of-life stats to a reasonable number (Vigor to 30 AT LEAST - preferably higher); abuse the new guard counter mechanic if you're playing a more melee-focused character with either a shield or a two-handed weapon; the jump attack mechanic is more powerful than ever before and does additional poise damage - USE IT; don't get overly attached to your runes - deaths will happen, so don't let yourself get all worked up because you lost a bunch; remember to breathe and take breaks!Magic *can* be extremely powerful. I'm sure everyone has seen the ""Get OP in 10 Minutes"" clickbait nonsense videos. What those don't account for is player experience and skill. While you can follow those guides to get a good lead, the game isn't going to roll over for you. Get comfy with the idea of losing to a boss a few times so you can figure out its moveset and openings.Sorcery players: the amount of intelligence to equip certain spells and gear is outrageous in Elden Ring. Don't let an equip requirement of 70 INT distract you from your QoL stats. Get your Vigor and Mind up. Your QoL stats will carry you harder than that fancy new spell or staff, I promise. And don't be afraid to upgrade weapons you don't necessarily love! Weapon upgrade stones are plentiful, and you can purchase more of them from NPCs once you find the items to unlock them in shops.Just beat NG+2 and got all achievements. Happy to answer any questions."

Positive,"If you are thinking ""hey this game still cost full price after almost 1 year!"" consider that:- they released a finished game- no particular blockin bugs- can be played solo or coop and also pvp- has a lot of replayability- hundreds of hours of gamplay- no microtransactions- lot of modsand name any other game achieving 3 of these results in 2022. the value you obtain for the full price is huge and it will still be for another couple of years.That being said the main downside I've found after my first run of the game is that we are also paying the price of some QoL updates added from the Dark Souls saga namely 2: Spirit Ashes and Golden Effigy.Now we can almost ""matchmake"" to find a game to join or to find coop partners and we have upgradable NPCs that can be summoned during boss fights (as opposite of DS, you don't need quests or requirements to have them so basically you can get free help in any boss fight), these things sounds very cool and they are when you are roaming the open world and fighting flying dragons as a melee fighter, but especially in the last segment of the game the boss fights are clearly designed around these helpers, and making them full solo doesn't require a ""git gud"" DS attitude but a ""git godlike"" one. And as someone who has beaten most of DS3 bosses in solo, I'm fiding this a bit disappoiting, especially with extremely punishing bosses like the Fire Giant."

Positive,What if instead of the frenzied flame it was called the freaky flame and instead of burning the Erdtree to the ground and incinerating all that divides you just sucked Radagon's toes.
Positive,"Elden Ring is a fantastic masterpiece that serves as a template for what excellent writing, gameplay, and environment design can feel like when done in great detail and when these elements interconnect and feed each other. No other game is as challenging, fun, and addictive as this title; Miyazaki and his team have truly outdone themselves with this entry in their list of soul games. If you ask me if Elden Ring is a hard game, it is not, and the same applies to all Dark Souls titles as well. The best word to describe these games is ""authenticity,"" as enemies offer a challenge based on what they are. Yes, a Dragon shooting a fireball will hurt, but it is a dragon, so it has to hurt. Otherwise, it would be a joke with wings. If there is something one can learn from these games, everything matters. For example, the number of enemies is a reasonable challenge, while three or four can be a quick death.As its heart, Elden Ring demands precision, commitment, and patience. While an enemy in the open might be easy to deal with, the same enemy in a different zone, such as a close corridor, can become a nightmare. The player has a lot of options in what they can do, from their builds, where they progress their character and watch it grow, unlike in any other game, but in how they will approach a fight or a challenge that is in their way. It is a game where bosses are more on the offensive guide than previous titles. You can enter the fog gate, and they are already springing towards you. FromSoftware has outdone itself in some spectacular fights, such as Malekith, where having a berserk-inspired boss with a giant sword that can jump into the air and throw slashes at you is not only a fight that makes you tremble with excitement and fear but also a graphical show of how the team has come a long way in animations and boss design. To experience defeat and try again is the means to become an Elden lord.Elden Ring's shift to an open world from the secluded areas of previous installments enhances its best quality: exploration. As you traverse the vast, intimidating landscapes, the world of Elden Ring comes alive. You can feel that you're not supposed to be there, but like a mouse that sneaks into a kitchen, you push forward, discovering secrets and facing fearsome foes. This sense of adventure is at the heart of Elden Ring.The enviroments being so varied not only visually but also in their layouts give each zone a distinct sense to it. The emotion you feel as you fight foes and the relief when you get to that next grace means that knowing where to go or not knowing where to go changes your experience with the game. Lakes with water that could drown you, giant islands with tornadoes, a volcanic manor, or ancient flooded cities are just some of what Elden Ring offers to those who dare to venture into the Lands Between.George R.R. Martin's influence is evident in the game's intricate lore and complex characters. I beat just the core game, but I was distracted by side quests from other characters. That quest became compelling and a facet of the game where I enjoyed progressing them and discovering what would happen to the characters living in the Elden Ringworld. Blaidd, for example, is a cool werewolf with a compelling story, while The Witch Ranni is a fan favorite, and her quest will take you to incredibly secret zones.The game is also full of secrets, as I stated before, but the quantity of these secrets is so absurd that I beat the game three times by now across PS5, Series X, and now PC, and I keep finding new stuff I didn't see before. To my shame, it took me three times to realize the game has a crafting system...haha. One can play Elden Ring, beat it, and replay it, and they will have an experience that is still extraordinarily fresh and wonderful. It is a colossal success to fit so much in one game and keep the magic of what makes it special and able to last in the long term.Regarding multiplayer, the game can be fun to play with friends but suffers from it a bit. Co-op can make boss fights into a joke, while invasions can sometimes be annoying when you invade someone, and they proceed to do a 1 VS 3. The core experience is to play alone and use co-op when stuck in a fight, but there is also freedom to play in any way. In a way, Elden Ring misses those fights in Dark Souls 3, where bosses were supposed to be able to take three players at the same time.Elden Ring is a masterpiece that redefines the genre of open-world games—a title where all elements of the experience are worked to perfection and have no weak spots. A must-play for all gamers, whether a seasoned souls-borne veteran or a newcomer to the series, you own it to yourself to try this game and seek the unforgettable journey that Elden Ring offers. Be prepared to face challenges, frustration, discovery, adventure, and triumph.10/10 MASTERPIECE:) If you enjoy and find the review helpful, please follow my curator!  StarsDeck"

Positive,"Elden Ring breathed a whole new life into the Souls formula. Not only has it brought back past Souls enjoyers, but it's also touched the hearts of new and unfamiliar players; both of whom have praised this beautiful masterpiece.This is the first time I've ever been enthusiastic about nominating a ""Game Of The Year"" award.Thank you From Software and especially the community for helping to create and foster memorable experiences that will be embraced for years to come."

Positive,Git gudI didn'tStill on the grind 🫶
Positive,I couldn't recommend enough. It's like every game FromSoft has ever made put into one beautifully crafted experience.
Positive,"Short version:Pros:+ Amazing world-building and lore+ Stellar locations and landmarks brimming with enemies and wildlife+ Exploration feels rewarding+ Responsive and satisfying combat+ Outstanding amount of content+ Tons of replay value+ Epic soundtrack+ Superb visuals+ Splendid voice acting+ Challenging boss fightsCons:-  Limited, janky co-op play- Horse combat could be better“Long” version:Elden Ring is an RPG developed by FromSoftware Inc and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment. It is an ambitious game that attempts to bring the Dark Souls formula to an open world setting.I really enjoyed Dark Souls I and III but I was never the sort of person to pre-order any of them and would always wait for a massive sale. With Elden Ring, I remember watching the reveal trailer and thinking it was not for me because of the huge open world. I have grown tired of the Ubisoft open-world formula so I lost my interest immediately. Fortunately, some gameplay videos came out and they looked glorious so I decided to give it a try.Turns out it ended up being one of my favorite games of all time!Just like other FromSoftware’s titles, Elden Ring’s approach to story is interesting.You play as a Tarnished on a quest to become the Elden Lord. You get introduced to some events and characters on your journey and must rely on side missions, item descriptions and character dialogue to know more about this world. This might discourage some players, but I found the whole setting and story to be epic.Elden Ring’s gameplay is great.The core gameplay loop has remained untouched – you go from checkpoint to checkpoint (called sites of grace in this game), disposing of enemies on the way, earning runes (currency) and allocating them to numerous stats that increase a plethora of things like HP, mana, stamina, immunities, etc.If you die, you lose all your runes and must go back to pick them up. If you die before getting to them, however, they are gone for good. Every time you rest at a site of grace, all your healing/mana items come back but all enemies respawn too.Exploration feels way better than before, as you now have a responsive, dedicated jump button. Additionally, you can now ride a swift and nimble horse named Torrent to quickly travel through the huge open world.Plentiful sites of grace, where you can rest and level up, also allow you to quick travel with ease.Exploring further but also revisiting areas is always encouraged, as there are always useful items and gear just around the corner.Combat has also received a facelift.It feels more responsive and fine-tuned. You still have a myriad of options when it comes to weapons, armor and other trinkets.You can focus on swords, whips, staves, crossbows, shields, you name it… These have their standard attacks but also activated abilities that add versatility into the mix. The sheer amount of personalization present here is awesome. You can pick from an absurd amount of armor and talismans, mixing and matching with different sorts of weapons. The options for weapon/gear combos are endless.Enemies are as relentless as ever and feel super satisfying to slay. Some might feel impossible to beat but there is always something you can do – a different approach you can take, a different weapon, maybe coming back after you are more experienced.There is always something to do in Elden Ring. The open world nature of the game allows you to visit whichever area you desire. This might end up killing you, but you might also find a new weapon or upgrade materials to make yourself strong. This might be a double-edged sword for some players. Personality, I loved it. I managed to find a spot that had considerably easy opponent to beat that were worth a lot of runes. After a few visits to that area, I managed to level up a great deal of times and felt quite overpowered for a good portion of the story mode. Thankfully, a lot of the side quests and bosses put me back in my place by killing me repeatedly.There are two more aspects of gameplay I must touch on and I will start off with horseback combat.Mounted combat is fine, but I feel like it could be better. I have been told by friends that it really depends on what kind of weapon you are carrying and that makes sense, but, at the same time, the camera can get in the way if you lock onto targets and the whole combat aspect always feels a bit janky and unsatisfying. You can certainly cheese a few bosses while riding Torrent and you will get more skilled as you become more experienced, but I do not think it is as enjoyable as regular combat.The final feature I want to mention is online co-op. It is present, but I think it has been poorly implemented. Summoning other players might not always work, as I had trouble finding my friend. When we finally got to play together, the summoned player would always return to their world after someone dies or after defeating a boss. I can see why some people enjoy this but I would have loved to be able to complete the story with a friend and not being sent back every time we kill something.Furthermore, you are bound to a single location while playing co-op, as the game summons walls of fog to prevent you from going to other areas. You cannot ride your horse either, which is very unfortunate.You could say it is due to technical limitations but, in this day and age, I do not think that is the case.It is not a deal-breaker, obviously, I actually prefer playing these games on my own, for the most part – but adventuring in such an epic world with a friend, employing different strategies to overcome amazing bosses sounds terrific and you only get a small portion of that, which is very disappointing.Invasions serve as the PvP component of Elden Ring and these are fine. They do not happen too often and you can disable them entirely, which is nice. The game also includes some story-driven invasions that give you an extra challenge to face.I always say that Dark Souls game do not have great graphics but feature stellar art direction. Well, in Elden Ring , the graphics are absolutely stunning and the art direction is flawless. Environments are distinct and masterfully exude feelings of beauty, peace, rot and desperation; sometimes, at the same time. Really, I spent so much of my playtime just taking in the gorgeous vistas. It is art.Sound design is up next. Another win, in my opinion.Sound effects are amazing - hits feel visceral and impactful and ambient noises make the world feel lived-in. It is beautiful.Voice acting is top-notch. Every single delivery is spectacular and Elden Ring actually made me care about the fate of a few NPCs, something that never happened in any of the Dark Souls games. I will protect Roderika, Hewg, Miriel and Sellen with my life.The soundtrack is immaculate - there is something so thrilling about crossing a wall of fog and coming face to face with a towering monster while epic music plays. It really hypes you up and gives this grandiose feeling to the whole experience.So, yeah… I am a big fan of Elden Ring.I want to play it, even as I write this review. I played it for 100+ hours on my first week with it and I cannot wait to start a new playthrough!It is an easy recommendation that will give you tons of high-quality content. It fixes the problems I have had with the open-world genre by offering a map filled with objectives that do not feel grindy. The gameplay is great, the visuals are breathtaking and its sense of scale is of legendary proportions.Final score: 9.5 out of 10.If you enjoyed this review, please consider following my curator page."

Positive,"There's been a lot of talk about size and scale, particularly in open world games. Elden Ring defies the normal (and correct) criticisms that open world games are full of dull tasks and extensively copied content. It's a game full of mechanical choices, systems in play, and rich environmental storytelling. No area of the game feels completely alike and so little feels wasted.Elden Ring is likely to be challenging for most players, it being a From Software game. It has many of the trappings of the other Soulsborne games, but based on my own experience you are given more varied tools to deal with problems you might be having. My favorite thing about the open world nature of the game is if you are having a lot of trouble with a specific spot or boss, just go somewhere else for a bit! There's always something new to find.The final few hours of the game are, in my opinion, weaker overall. The bosses get dirtier, stats are scaled against you MUCH more heavily in comparison to the rest of the game as well. Elden Ring suffers from what I believe is an intentional design choice that has been made since Dark Souls 1, but it's a choice that essentially results in ""First half of game ends up feeling better than second half overall.""Basically Elden Ring is an extremely impressive achievement in open world game design, and succeeds in being a culmination of all of FromSoft's work up to this point. Whatever that means to you should govern your decision of whether or not to play it. I had a great time, and maybe someday I'll pick it up again for New Game+. Think I'm good for now though!"

Positive,"I don’t think there is anything that hasn’t been said about Elden Ring at this point. It is the grand adventure everyone calls it out to be. The new Benchmark for Open World Souls Games, or any that will try to follow.  When I learned that Elden Ring will be an Open World Game when It was announced I was scared that it will ruin the amazing world complexity and architecture that the previous games had. This was always one of my favorite things about the Souls Games. The logical interconnectivity between the different areas. And thankfully I was proven wrong.FROMSOFTWARE succeeded in every aspect to make an enormous open world without sacrificing any of the atmosphere we all love. There is more to do, more to fight, more to discover than in any previous game and far too much to even name here. While I personally don’t think the game is much, or any, easier than the previous games, it is far more accessible through various quality of life additions, like the ability to mostly teleport to a grace, or the Spirit Summon system.   Tl;drElden Ring is the new peak of the Souls Series. A must play for every fan of the genre, and a great first game for newcomers to the franchise."

Positive,"Let me get this out of the way first: Elden Ring is amazing. Game of the Year without contest and probably the most impactful game release of this entire decade. The open world genre has been stagnant and formulaic to a fault with massive maps full of absolutely nothing of value. Even critically acclaimed entries in the genre like Breath of the Wild, while excellent games still, all fail in giving their open world much meaning other than scenery. Breadth of an ocean; depth of a puddle. That defines the open world genre today, and Elden Ring has come along and stomped every competitor into their graves. It is the pinnacle of design for an open world RPG and will be what we measure newcomers and previous efforts by. It is also a culmination of everything Dark Souls since they first released Demon's Souls on the PS3 so long ago now. Every lesson they've learned over the time From Software have been releasing games in this style has been put to work making their magnum opus, and it will be exceedingly difficult if not impossible to improve.That said: they also keep making the same mistakes, and that will likely not ever change. A 9.5 or a 9.8 for sure, but it cannot be a 10 for me. You're free to disagree or even troll the comments but I do have the achievement for all the achievements here. I've done nearly everything of value and substance and have combed the entirety of the game. Despite the fact I love it dearly and am still playing, the game has some problems I take personal issue with. So since you know the game is life-changing and amazing as was already fairly obvious, I will now talk about what I dislike.Poise has become what seems like a dirty word at From Software since Dark Souls. They've gradually removed its effect and importance over the game releases to the point it feels like there's no reason even show it on your character sheet. I can wear the heaviest armor in the game, swing a colossal weapon, and equip the one talisman that provides Poise to the player. It doesn't matter, because startup frames for any weapon of any size and any weight will be interrupted constantly by any enemy at all. Even the smallest and weakest. Even the wild deer and sheep can interrupt you if they hit you during startup frames. I'm not asking for the ridiculous Poise we had in Dark Souls. Where we chugged Estus and spammed R1 in front of the endgame boss while donned in full Havel's gear. I just want it to have meaning. Why would you give us a wealth of amazing Incantations that summon literal fucking dragons, and have anyone and everyone able to just smack me out of channeling it?Vigor is a more vital stat than ever before. Not only do the bosses ramp up in damage dealt to a ludicrous degree but weapon arts from special weapons and certain Ashes of War from players can have astronomical numbers. Moonveil, the peoples' champion right now, can two-shot most players with the 'weapon art' and all you need is INT to pump the damage. 40 Vigor and preferably 58 is needed to stand a chance against lategame bosses because as you'll have seen from many complaints, the bosses can kill you. Quickly. In just two or three hits. Sometimes even with soft-capped Vigor. It's not very fun and wasn't at all needed in prior entries to make the fights against bosses meaningful and difficult. Having to play near perfectly just to see a phase change or a second health bar or another boss immediately is not very fun. Call it old age but I did get the achievement for ALL THE ACHIEVEMENTS. Bosses and enemies also have attacks with barely any if at all startup frames which will hit you instantly and cannot be prepared for or dodged without luck. You're just going to take damage whenever they feel like it, and fuck you. Not to mention the true evil of all From Software games, where it's utterly embarrassing they can't manage to fix it ever - input queues.Branching off the way bosses are designed, a lot have overly cheap abilities or relentlessly quick attacks. Worse still - the game has input reads. Did you think the boss was simply relentless? No, it was meant to end its combo string and take a moment to pause and let the 'fake' stamina bar recharge. Instead, you take a sip from your flask and it triggers and immediate combo from the enemy almost no matter when or what they are. You can test how ridiculous the input reads are in this game at a fort in Caelid. There are two large lion enemies with blades on their arms that can't exit the doorway. You can target them inside, then turn to face the wall extending outside, and cast spells into thin air into the wall. Every cast nearly, they will do a large jump to the side to dodge the projectile. Not based on being targeted. Not based on the projectile being near. Just because you hit the button. This actually makes the Sorcery which summons blades from portals the best in the game for some time, because enemies will dodge the input and forget the spell effect still hasn't happened. It's a horrible system and an amateur level oversight from someone like From Software.All-in-all these are fairly nitpick problems and they can easily fix things by adjusting numbers. Be it in damage or turning off input reads and queues or giving Poise meaning and an actual effect, all numbers problems. Easily fixed with time. If those issues got resolved then I'd likely amend this review and give the game a 10 out of 10. But with all these mistakes From Software should and does know better than to make, it almost feels intentional. When it feels intentional, I can't help but feel it's personal. Which is baffling considering how amazing in every other respect this game is.9.5 or 9.8 but not a 10, sadly."
Positive,Best game i have ever played in my life
Positive,try finger buthole
Positive,"Possibly the best game I've ever played to date.Going into the game as my first FromSoft and Soulsborne game, I didn't really have any high expectations of what was to come. With most games I play, I usually play for 3-4 hours in one session and call it quits for the day - but with Elden Ring? I'm spending upwards to 10 hours a day playing it. It's just  that  good. While yes, I do have over 80 hours played at the time of writing this review, I'm still not entirely finished with the game. I'm currently at the endgame of the base game and still have tons to explore and do (not to mention the DLC I have started a few hours ago).Now for the game itself: Yes, it's good. The art direction, voice acting and lore are unlike any other I've seen before. Sure, the graphics don't look too ""realistic"" either, but the great art direction and style make up for it - giving it a rich world surrounded by some colorful and great looking regions in the world itself.If this is your first FromSoft (or Soulsborne) game like it was mine, don't go into it expecting it to be easy from the get-go. It was hard. General enemy types used to kill me left and right at the start of the game, but with enough patience and progressing through the story, I've managed to overcome even the strongest of foes the game had to offer.Should you buy it? Absolutely."
Positive,"I am a 55 year old biker and trucker father, and probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 15 now. My son got this game for from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 12 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories."

Positive,"First Impressions were that the DLC was WAY too hard. I ended up walking away from some bosses to collect the items needed to become stronger and returning to the boss later, it paid off. THIS IS A MASTERPIECE. Anyone who leaves a negative review for difficulty is either just being ignorant or lazy. The Artwork, Cinematic work, Views, Weapons, Armour, Locations are all INCREDIBLE. In my honest opinion it isn't better than the base game but it is a wonderful addition. (P.S. Elden Ring was my first FromSoftware Game.)"

Positive,"Elden Ring is a delicious late afternoon wine and cracker platter under a sweltering sun, cooled by a spring breeze and relaxing backyard music. The wine, the good of Elden Ring, it is intoxicating, addicting, aromatic and fruity, yet aged to perfection. The cracker, the difficulty, it is hard, rough, gritty and perhaps a little tough to bite through. Heck, some of the crackers on this platter are so stiff and unpalatable it could be hardtack. But there is no such crunch in Elden Ring, and these crackers, that cannot be overcome by lathering on a thick layer of cream cheese. How much cheese you apply to your cracker is up to you, but what you'll come to learn is that there is no right way to enjoy this wine. We all have our own idea of how much cheese we like. Some enjoy so much cheese that the cracker becomes obscured, perhaps there might as well not be any. Some enjoy their crackers dry, to compliment the complex blend of the wine as was intended.In either case, you will find how you like your game and enjoy it."
Positive,"It's amazing. It's everything you've heard. It's open world Dark Souls. Please play this game.However.... I'm quitting before the end. Here's why, as briefly as I can put it:It's too hard. Not like, oh it's challenging git gud. It's too hard as in, the bosses towards end game (even some of the regular enemies) rely on exceedingly long combos WITH AoE's that will kill you in 1-2 shots. Many feel cheap, rather than challenging. Not QUITE Bed of Chaos cheap, but pretty close. I'm feeling like when I die, I didn't cheat the system or find the right cheese rather than build any skill for the next fight. I'm discouraged, I hate the gauntlet of having to dodge 12 times flawlessly and hit once, then repeat... or just summon a bunch of people and cheese the bosses. It's not fun any more. I quit."

Positive,"At the first glance this is a game made for people who think they're better than others, while in reality it's a game made for psycho-masochists to play in order to improve themselves in that regard. Apart from its nature, it's also a very beautiful and well-made game that makes you think you're going to have a good experience, while in reality it will get you hooked on masochism, but it's still a masterpiece if you're interested in this kind of stuff.Recommended rating: 8/10 for normal people, 10/10 for people with ""some"" mental problems (like me).Hidden Tip: get drunk or drugged for a fully immersive experience (30/10 Rating)."
Positive,"When you thought they couldn't do better, they do.Highly recommended for all the people who are looking for a big challenge and enjoy exploring a lot. From Software has refined their formula in every possible way, so stop reading this review and just play this brilliant experience. What will be next, I look forward to it."
Positive,"Every review is subjective and aligns with the perception, tastes, and/or interests of the person writing it. I’m someone who views video games as another form of artistic expression, which is why I do NOT assign a score. I don't believe art can be measured or quantified. I’ll simply share my personal experience while avoiding spoilers as much as possible. Elden Ring is essentially a culmination of everything FromSoftware has refined over the years in their previous titles, wrapped in a vast open world that invites exploration and discovery. If I could describe Elden Ring in one word, it would be ""Lost."" Like other FromSoftware games, this one is filled with moments where you’re not entirely sure what you’re doing, who the enemies are that you’re fighting, why they’re there, where you should go, or what the correct path is. Yet, that sense of being lost isn’t frustrating; it’s a driving force that pushes you to keep going. There’s something magnetic that urges you to press forward, to explore every corner of the map in search of an NPC, an item, or any clue that might give you some direction. But as you progress, things only become more convoluted. When you finally defeat an enemy, a tougher one appears. When you think you’ve grasped a part of the lore, new information emerges that forces you to rethink everything. The game constantly keeps you in a state of uncertainty, wondering whether you’ve taken the right path or strayed into a dangerous detour.The only clear indicators of progress in Elden Ring are the boss fights, a few scattered dialogues, and some of the graces placed across the map. The sense of accomplishment from defeating a boss is unparalleled, it serves as a reminder that despite the confusion and challenges, you are making progress.One of the standout aspects of Elden Ring is the sheer size and richness of its world. In open-world games, I’ve always enjoyed exploring every last corner of each zone, and this title was no exception. The world’s vastness, both visually and in terms of content, is impressive. The thrill of discovering a new area or finding a well-hidden secret is what drives me to keep playing. However, as I explored, I encountered one of the game’s most criticized aspects: repeated bosses. While it’s a common practice in some games, I expected FromSoftware to maintain their unique touch of originality. Perhaps the decision to reuse bosses was driven by the ambition to make the world as large as possible in their first attempt at an open-world game. Personally, I wouldn’t mind it as much if these bosses became increasingly challenging or had new attack patterns, but in most cases, the fights feel nearly identical. Despite this shortcoming, the overall experience wasn’t “tarnished” (xD), I thoroughly enjoyed every battle, striving to improve with each encounter.The Erdtree expansion brings new mechanics and a narrative focus that complements the base experience of Elden Ring. When I first accessed the expansion, I thought it would be similar to the DLCs in the studio’s other games: having a high level would be enough… I was wrong. Erdtree introduces a unique mechanic that intertwines with the game’s lore. If you choose to ignore that detail, be prepared to suffer like never before. What’s fascinating is how this expansion not only adds content but also manages to maintain the essence of what makes Elden Ring special while expanding its world in a way that feels natural. Despite all the new content, both Elden Ring and Erdtree are, in my opinion, the most accessible and, to some extent, the easiest experiences FromSoftware has developed. That’s not to say they lack challenge, but the open-world design, with its emphasis on exploration and freedom, somewhat softens the experience.In conclusion, I can confidently say that Elden Ring is the best game they’ve created in terms of ambition, design, and execution. However, interestingly, it’s not my favorite. Despite everything I’ve mentioned, I don’t feel the desire to replay it, cause it feels like a one-time experience. This contrasts with Bloodborne, my favorite game from the studio, which I could play over and over again. Despite being technically inferior in several ways, Bloodborne has an atmosphere and design that I find more appealing and invites me to a better ""dream""."

Positive,"Upon booting up Elden Ring, you’re immediately given a glimpse of what is to come through the brilliant soundtrack. Starting off with a few disparate, calm strings, the main theme slowly morphs into an epic melody of grandeur, valor and unrelenting ambition. Despite having already heard this track in trailers, I was blown away — shattered, even. I knew I was in for something special. Whereas previous Soulsborne titles had you trudging through claustrophobic sewers and maddening towns, Elden Ring is a far bigger, more ambitious adventure. Reaching across numerous regions, The Lands Between are massive and filled with things to discover. Even after 20 hours, I was still finding new things in the first area. Perhaps I had missed a cave tucked away in a canyon or failed to peruse a nearby forest; once, I even stumbled upon an expansive underground area that you could easily miss. It’s magical, really. Much of the wonder comes from the design ethos. Gone are the myriad of question markers and intrusive quest logs you would find in other titles, instead replaced by something as simple as your own curiosity. FromSoftware uses this as a tool to compel you forward. When you see a fort in the distance, you will feel urged to go there, and the best thing is that it was you, and not the game, that decided so. Elden Ring relies on your participation, and I love that. As you traverse these lands, it’s hard not to be impressed by the topography. Uneven hills and deep gorges combine to create a world that cannot simply be navigated by holding down your left joystick, its gargantuan structures serving not just to undermine you but also as waypoints on your journey. It made me realize how flat and easygoing the landscapes in open worlds often are. In The Lands Between, even the geography is your adversary, constantly bending and defying rules.  My first 30 hours with Elden Ring were some of the best I’ve had in gaming, and I was ready to name it FromSoftware’s magnum opus. But then, a realization dawned. There are many reasons to love the Soulsborne titles, but one of them is the handcrafted quality that permeates throughout. Every corner of the world feels like it was designed with a specific purpose in mind, one that you would probably understand through your ponderings, and each encounter offered a new challenge. These were games that not only encourage you to explore, but also feature enough secrets to warrant doing so.  This still rings true here, but for every two surprises, there was a moment of utter disappointment. Reused structures and bosses are frequent, to the point where every foe not overtly important to the narrative will be fought multiple times. It also undermines the sense of discovery, since you can only happen upon so many identical, dilapidated churches before you wonder if it’s worth it. This is truest for the many dungeons and caves. They all have the same visual identity and rarely differ in terms of enemies, and I have a hard time naming just one of them since they all blend into one large portion of copy-paste tedium. Eventually, I began looking at these as optional bonus levels rather than integral parts of the world. And honestly, I think that is the best approach. It is also in this repetition that the developers misunderstand what made their bosses so special in the first place. Like telling a joke, these encounters require careful build-up: a harrowing walk through a town gone mad or slowly making your way up a castle. The bosses were never the main attraction; they served as final send-offs, stages of thrilling and heart-pounding action to juxtapose the relatively quiet exploration. This still applies to the linear locations, but once you step into the open world, Miyazaki starts hurling bosses at you like he’s a kid training for a sports match.  That’s not to say the boss fights are bad. When you come across one of the more sophisticated fights and composer Yuka Kitamura starts sending symphonic shockwaves through your ears, this game is delightful. With a few exceptions, the mandatory encounters are consistently astounding and satisfyingly grueling, rounded off by exquisitely rich and repulsive visual design. These moments are truly special. Elden Ring keeps on going. Just when you think you’ve seen it all, it turns out there’s still another half of the story left. Had it featured enough content to sustain this length, it could’ve been a monumental achievement. Unfortunately, that is not the case. There’s an entire region where the only unique foe is the boss at the end, the rest being awkwardly recycled enemies, and one of the best places in the game suffers from a similar issue.Yet I can’t help but love Elden Ring. For weeks, I was enthralled by its world, and when I wasn’t playing it, I was thinking about where to explore next or how to approach the boss I was stuck on. When I present these criticisms of the game, it’s not because I despise it, it’s because I care. Had this been a disappointment, I would’ve just shrugged and thought little more of it. Through The Lands Between, FromSoftware toys with an interesting dichotomy. While the landscapes are gorgeous and downright breathtaking, they are far from safe. Mercenaries in tattered armor, oversized crustaceans, draconian soldiers the size of giants, and even living jars — everyone and everything is out to kill you. Even if there aren’t many enemies specific to one region, there are still plenty of creative enemy designs. The open world also gives you a lot of freedom in how you approach these. You could sneak your way through an enemy camp, get up close and personal with a comically large greatsword, or ride in on your horse, slashing wildly at anyone in your way. This makes the notorious difficulty far more approachable, and I’d imagine that more people will finish the game because of it.  The combat system itself is akin to Dark Souls 3, but there are enough additions to make it not feel worn out and dreary. Sekiro’s posture system, where an enemy’s stance can be broken to leave them vulnerable, has been subtly integrated: the enemies don’t have wavering stamina bars over their heads, but this means you aren’t pressured into a style of play. The stance mechanic is there, you can use it if you want, but it can also be ignored entirely. When combined, the stance system and Guard Counter result in battles coming across more as duels than the old hit-and-run affair. There were times where I had to run away, either to heal or get a break from the heat of battle, but I spent considerably more time facing my enemy head-on. You could argue that not enforcing these improvements leads to some players resorting to the tried-and-tested tactics, but I like the freedom it brings.  Another enemy you will face is the performance. While the game runs at 60fps most of the time, there are some drastic problems with frame pacing and stuttering. I didn’t find it too distracting, but those on lower-end PCs might be more affected. It’s hard not to compare Elden Ring’s selection of enemies and locations to previous FromSoftware offerings, but part of me believes we should look at it through a different lens. For while it is like these in certain departments, it’s also a title that seeks to provide a different experience, one much more flexible in its design contours and of a much grander scale. Rather than scold it for the ways it compares, we should appreciate it for the ways it differs. Visit A Cup of Thoughts for subjective reviews with a touch of personality."
Positive,"» Elden Ring is an absolute masterpiece, having mastered the art of showing without telling. It is vastly different from other open-world games I have experienced such as The Witcher 3 and Skyrim, which are story and questline driven. From the get-go, Elden Ring does not impose any particular playstyle or route on you. You are completely free to do what you want to from the very start of the game. You can finish the main storyline and beat the final boss, or you can explore the entire map without ever seeing the main bosses. It truly is up to you with no outside influence. This sense of freedom in choice and exploration in any open-world game is refreshing.Not to mention, Elden Ring has also mastered the art of subtlety. For example, for a game like Skyrim, there are various elements such as the character dialogues, leveling system, and various landmarks that I could clearly point to in contributing to the game's success. However, this is not the case here. It is hard to place a finger on one specific thing that makes Elden Ring so enjoyable. Many times I have gone in to play this game for half an hour, only to become immersed, losing track of time and playing for hours on end. I believe that the game's features, i.e. the combat system, transportation, landscape, lore, storytelling, etc., complement each other in a way that none of them are overbearing. At the same time, these elements come together in such a fluid manner that I, as the player, cannot notice it and am drawn into a level of immersion that I have not felt from any game before.» This game has one of the most enormous and intricately detailed worlds I have ever seen in gaming. I have not had a single moment where the map felt desolate or empty; there was always something to see and explore. The castles, cities, and fortresses that you must traverse in this game are truly awe-inspiring. They are all massive, unique, and filled with a plethora of secret areas just waiting to be uncovered. The landscapes of the world are also astonishing. The sheer variety and scale of the environments are a sight to behold. Players can expect to explore vast mountains, forests, fields, deep caves, ancient ruins, and even hidden underground civilizations. It is clear that a great amount of work went into the design of all of these areas, as they are all exceptionally detailed and have complex lore, realism, and beauty to them that makes them a joy to explore.» The combat in this game is utterly masterful, blending elements from many of FromSoftware's previous works including Dark Souls 3, Bloodborne, and Sekiro to create an extremely tense, fluid, and customizable combat system. The amount of variety in terms of different playstyles, build variation, and weapon types are enough to make the combat in this game endlessly enjoyable.You also have more freedom in how you approach combat than any previous souls game thanks to a bunch of familiar new systems that are used in interesting ways here. Stealth is a more viable option thanks to the addition of crouch-walking, which finally lets you sneak by tough enemies or get behind them for a critical hit; there’s now horseback combat in large, open areas which gives you more mobility and the ability to attack on both sides with your right-handed weapon, but has the drawback of taking away your ability to roll out of the way of big attacks; you can craft items on the fly using materials found in the world so you can be ready for whatever a situation calls for; you can summon a large variety of creatures to fight for you, each with their own unique abilities and situational advantages; and most substantially, you can equip Ashes of War to your weapons and completely change their affinity and skill.The Ashes of War system essentially combines two elements of prior Souls games – weapon affinities and weapon skills – by making them items that you can freely equip to your armaments. For example, let’s say you find a really good rapier and like the moveset, but are building your character with a focus on the Intelligence stat, which means it won’t get the kind of damage bonuses it needs to be a viable weapon. If you find an Art of War that bestows a magic spell onto a weapon, you can equip it and transform it into a magic weapon, thereby giving it Intelligence scaling on top of whatever skill the Ash of War has. Best of all, if you eventually decide to re-spec into a different build, you can still keep the same weapon and just put a different Ash of War onto it. Of course, you also have to find a specific item to unlock the different affinities, but it's nonetheless an incredibly smart addition that allows for a ton of variety in your preferred weapons.» The boss roster of Elden Ring is also extremely difficult and unforgettable. Most of the boss battles are remarkably challenging, rich with lore, and breathtaking. The complex fighting style of the bosses cannot be overlooked. Many of the bosses have extremely intricate, fast, and punishing attacks that are both tough to avoid and fun to fight against. This makes the battles against the bosses feel like a dance, as you rhythmically dodge their devastating combo attacks before finding small windows to go on the offensive. This is nothing new, as this style of boss encounter is exactly what the Dark Souls series pioneered. However, Elden Ring perfects this age-old formula by giving the bosses bigger movesets, greater speed, and more complex combos than ever before. Some of the bosses can hammer you with 10-hit long combos with little margin for error, and the player must master a boss' moveset if they ever hope to come out on top. When you combine this with the grotesquely stunning visual design, you get some of the tensest and most engaging boss battles in history.On top of all this, the epic scope of the boss encounters and vast areas is further heightened by Elden Ring's stellar musical score. It perfectly conveys the emotional connection that you should have with whichever boss you are fighting. Many of the soundtracks in this game are utterly blood-pumping in a way that few other video games can match.» Overall, in my opinion, Elden Ring more than lives up to the enormous hype surrounding it, proving to be one of the most memorable, challenging, and complex gaming experiences of the last century.Was this review helpful?» If so, please leave a rating. Awards are also greatly appreciated!"
Positive,"As I'm entering my 50th hour in the game I think it might be suitable to start writing a little review.This entire week (besides of the times I spend sleeping, eating, doing mundane household chores and ofcourse work) I spend inside of elden ring, and boy what an week it was.First of, While I am in fact a gamer, and spend most of my life in games, I'm not the type whom tends to go looking up guides, tricks, etc... to understand my games any better, guess this has changed a bit, because never, AND I MEAN NEVER EVER. have I been invested in a game as much as I have been in this one.The world is gorgeous, the gameplay (just like any souls game ofc.) is unique, intresting and challenging.Each and every one of the bosses feels completly different, every time I start a bossfight with a little (healthy amount) of fear, scared what challenge awaits me this time.Like I said before, I'm entering my 50th hour in the game, and I still feel like I know so little about this game in the best way possible, it engages me to look up guides, look up info.It encourages me to re invent my play style, learn new moves, learn new weapons, change up my specs etc....I'm sure the next couple of weeks I will spend even more time inside of this marvelous world, and I'm sure I won't regret a single moment of it.I adore it, I love it, and this game truly brought me back inside the magical world of games.Thank you for another suitable entry in the souls franchise.Thank you for giving me a truly magnificent world to explore.Thank you for bringing joy into a mundane life."

Positive,"Journalists: ""This game is literally just a Dark Souls in open world""Me: ""Thats....why I'm here""No, literally. Best 60 € I have spent on any game. I enjoyed every bit of this physical and mental torture. Once again, Miyazaki  and whole Fromsoftware did a perfect job. The only thing I would complain about is that there are plenty of copypasted bosses over and over again."

Positive,"Elden Ring is a game where your main focus is to end the shameful title of ""Maidenless"" given to you, a poor tarnished. Killing demigods to pat a blue witch, enchanting jellyfish ghosts to pat a british blonde girl, being beaten to death to pat a handicaped ginger with wings, all for the sake of maidens and honour.Oh, yes. There were something about mending a rune too or whatever."
Positive,"Tarnished champion, thou walked the pathThrough so many obstacles ye unleashed the wrathYou once were commanded to kneel into miseryBut stood your ground and achieved a victoryNow You, lowly tarnished, standing by first graceFace the journey thou should embraceHere beginneth ye road to be treasuredMake it so it shall be remembered"
Positive,"Elden Ring is the latest game developed by FromSoftware, a company well-known for its Souls franchise. This time, FromSoftware took a departure from its standard linear/semi-open world approach to its game development. Instead, it opted for an open-world approach, with heavy reliance on Souls’ game mechanics. After I learned that Elden Ring would be developed as an open-world Souls game, I was worried about how the game would turn out. However, Elden Ring turned out to be something far better than I had imagined.Pros:-A vast world filled with activities, secrets, sidequests, enemies, and bosses that will entertain players for hundreds of hours-A wonderful sense of exploration that is unparalleled in its scope and design-Boss battles that are difficult yet extremely satisfying -Beautiful graphics that show noticeable improvements over older titles, such as Dark Souls 3 and Sekiro-Great map system that guides players in the right direction and helps them search for secrets and activities. -A wide variety of weapons with different ashes of war that allows for diverse gameplay-An intuitive and efficient weapon upgrade system -A wide variety of spells, incantations, talismans, and armors to choose from -Stellar aesthetics/art design  Cons:-Performance issues: micro-stuttering and framerate drops that got better compared to the launch version but still need more work -While enemies/bosses are mostly fair, a few of them are overly difficult and can feel a little cheap Overall, I think Elden Ring is a masterpiece that offers new possibilities to an open-world genre, which has become somewhat stale in recent years. Similar to what Breath of the Wild did five years ago, Elden Ring proves that the open-world genre can evolve and become something truly remarkable."

Positive,I hate this game so much

Positive,Rennala's toes can wiggle.
Positive,"Cute little indie game. There's a few cool hats and a nice horse. You can make friends with several charming characters and you can even farm (souls from fingers on the roots of an eldritch tree within an infernal mist) if you like. Perhaps one of the prettiest games I've played in a long time. Still, I have nightmares about the little men who play brass instruments, and I can never find the sewer. It's quite like Stardew Valley in that they both have a hidden sewer level."
Positive,"At the time of my initial review, I was having significant hardware issues. I have since changed my setup and I am having a much better time. This game truly is amazing, and while many say its ""Dark Souls but bigger"" I don't think that's an issue. The game is gorgeous, the combat is fun and captivating, and the challenge pushes you to find new strategies you'd never have thought of otherwise. I love this game. Thank you, Dark Souls. :)Edit: FUCK this game hardOverall, 9.5/10"
Positive,"""Even if it does violate... The Golden Order.""These are some of the first words you will hear in Elden Ring. It plants a mystery in your mind that persists until the very end. I knew right then that this game was something beyond special.Elden Ring is a difficult game, especially for new-comers like me, who are new to the Souls-series of games, but that did not stop my endless amazement and sense of wonder every step I took. The environments, the bosses, the silent storytelling of the world around me was so.. unique. The more I played, the more I wanted to know, and I fell deep down the rabbit hole of this game's world.I will never forget the cinematic landscapes you see for each new area, the distant castle walls or giant golden trees. It is truly something you need to experience.The gameplay itself is quick and tight, the bosses pose interesting challenges that respect your time. Slaying a boss, especially the ones in the main story, feels like you really did something substantial, as often the world changes around you in their absence.You are only ever given one goal in Elden Ring that truly matters.Become the Elden Lord, no matter the cost."

Positive,"I wanted to wait to write a review until I was a good ways into this, and at 185 hours I'm only just getting into the endgame on my first playthrough. And with a game of this size and scope I think you really need to get pretty far into it before offering an opinion.I've played all the Souls and Soulslikes and I went into Elden Ring with expectations based on those experiences. But what I've found is that it's not really a Souls game, it's Dark Souls 3 meets Skyrim, and necessarily more Skyrim than Souls but with less structure than either of them. That's not necessarily a bad thing, there's nothing wrong with mixing genres, but I think that a lot of players will find their expectations challenged no matter which direction they're approaching it from. You could be an RPG gamer looking for an edgier Skyrim or a Souls player looking for something similar but a little less demanding. So it takes some time to get used to the unique feel of the game but beyond that initial learning curve it's a game with very broad appeal. It's a huge open world game, and coming at it from the ""I want Dark Souls 4"" direction, I've found progression to be slow and a little confusing. I've gotten bogged down at times exploring, doing side stuff, but then that's not really any different than what I did in Witcher 3, a game I loved,  and other RPG's. I've also found that when you focus on progression the difficulty ramps up a lot, you're clearly expected to take your time poking around, killing birds for arrow feathers, checking out dungeons, and so on.It's this mixing of genres that's the essential concept of this game. In terms of other aspects of the game like combat mechanics Elden Ring doesn't reinvent the wheel, the combat is pretty similar to what Souls players are used to going back to the first Dark Souls. It has a plot very similar to Dark Souls 3, requiring you to kill a list of bosses in a series of different areas in order to unlock the final area and final boss. What's different here is that in Dark Souls 3 the vagueness of your goal isn't problematic because you're going to be channelled along in a linear manner. But here you're just presented with a huge world and told to figure out how to accomplish your overarching goal on your own, without any direction. So if you're a big fan of open world games and you just want to have a lot of fun roaming around, exploring, fighting a few bosses, without being pressured to get to specific goals, then Elden Ring works beautifully, And particularly if you have limited time for gaming you could happily spend months exploring the Lands Between. And players looking for a more structured experience can also have a good time here, provided you keep an overarching goal in mind and stay focused on that and as long as you have some sort of a plan for how you're going to get there. So one player may spend a lot of time dungeon crawling to get the runes(souls) needed to keep levelling and another player may just skip all of that and go farm for a while. Works both ways. And that's the beauty of it, it's intended to appeal to a lot of different gamers,  and it's done a very good job with that, particularly in drawing in a lot of players who haven't played a Souls game but are looking for something similar but more approachable. They clearly put a lot of thought and creativity into it and you have to admire them for what they've accomplished here. It's not a perfect game, there are problems , the various pieces don't always mesh well, but it's a unique experience, full of interesting content, and after a lot of thought I very highly recommend it."

Positive,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2022 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

Positive,"Best game I've ever played. 9/10 and only because the game doesn't support ultrawide monitors. It's also possible to get banned for using a fix from the internet, because of this I was forced to play this game outside of steam. I really hope that someday this problem will be resolved and I can play this game again."
Positive,"And you shall find beauty in all of Elden Ring's menacing horror as if it was a painted masterpiece. From Soft has set the bar once more, higher than Radahn's Meteor Leap & Dive. Will you let yourself be hyped up by the intro soundtrack or will you snuff out any feelings until you're flung into The Lands Between? You'll not have a chance but to be bewildered by the time you're escaping your initial confinement passing by your soulless, cold deceased maiden.You're made out to be by everyone a maidenless tarnished however I've not set upon eyes on any encounter that doesn't require your modest assistance. The options you're served will kindle your thoughts in the beginning up until the end if your excitement of discovery shan't subside, an array of armaments and plethora of secondary tools or even the abundant sorceries or incantations which will scorch, freeze or simply erase from existence anything standing in your way. Gritty ashes of war can be attached to your preferred weaponry to massively raise their special ability to annihilate at will. If there's one word that anyone who experienced this journey can describe as, it's simply exploration & versatility to the extremes, how can one stick to the same setup when one is offered on a plate more than Sir Gideon would dream of. All of the previous titles' mechanics were adopted and developed with delicate care to create intense close-ranged battles, far-ranged archery contests or devious stealth offing. Dreamy landscapes with nothing but terror coming your way, you can never be prepared to escape with your body intact, yet you're always to return for the treasure or just to enjoy that view one more time regardless of the cost. One of the best artworks I've ever experienced in any video game, the refined style developed fits perfectly the realm and its doomed characters. All locations have their own flavor of uniqueness, pristine sceneries or truly beyond any sane hellscapes which will leave you feel like it's a phenomenon you fled breathing. Don't forget to bring an ally at your side if need be, be it tarnished or spirit ash of an ancient legendary outlaw.Storytelling lets you cut together portions of long forgotten past, memories by remnants or the seemingly ever living demigods themselves; cryptic masterwork à la Souls engaging you just the perfect amount to be left wandering & wondering endlessly. Almost every being regards their ideals highly to mend the fabric of existence against the majority's convictions, though sincere also purely selfish. It's not enough that your eyes will be delighted at masterfully crafted artstyle, the soundtrack is going to profoundly heighten your hearing in a majestic way sung by stunning orchestra whilst torn apart by a massive enemy in front of you. Voice acting is even more prevalent in quantity as in quality conveying emotions and life to any character met along the path. They have gone all out with the budget to enhance the mythical beings all around the universe. Gameplay has some of the richest mechanics I've ever witnessed, you can combo and slash your way through either crudely or grandiose dancing. Power stance or elegant dual wielding has come back stronger than ever letting you slice and dice or massively drop colossal armaments onto unsuspecting foes. Enormous defended castles and manors are present in the magnificent level design, open areas make you wonder what awaits you while closed off dungeons test your reflexes with near death experiences, it's all so very sophisticated as we're accustomed to typical From Soft infernal hell. Demigods have no mercy towards your tarnished heritage and no hesitation to prove your worth in their presence, one of the most outstanding enemy design ever on a scale so epic that you don't have time to appreciate it all in one go; someone must extinguish thy flame. Torrent is your trust worthy spirit steed for the duration of your whole adventure, the more you appreciate him the less your suffering will be. Exquisite armor sets designed to genuinely spark your interest of looking particularly unique, setting apart the others paving your belief that you'll march to the end and reach the Erdtree that's been burning bright in your sight at all times. What you've read is only a tiny fraction said of The Lands Between, everything else is left for you to all observe in this once in a life time masterpiece.[✔]- artwork & graphics- storytelling & characters- stunning world building- gameplay mechanics- build versatility & replayability- OST & voice acting- legendary boss fights[✘]- nothing worth mentioning"

Positive,"While fighting against one of the hardest boss in the game, you learn two important things.1. That her name is Malenia.2. And she's the Blade of Miquella.10/10"
Positive,OHHHHHHHHH ELDEN RING IS SO DAMN GOOD
Positive,"I know this game has gotten glowing reviews but, no one said it was addicting. It's so refreshing playing something that is not coddling or holding my hand...feels like old school gaming. BTW: if you're having issues with crashes, what worked for me was uninstalling geforce experience and playing it in borderless windowed mode. Unfortunately, you can't use HDR but, better than crashing randomly."

Positive,Elden Ring (Dark Souls IV)
Positive,got some awesome moments with friends. made some core memories :D
Positive,"This is the only game that I can tolerate stuttery mess, disconnects, and horrible crashes. That's how good this is. Addicting gameplay and the atmosphere is top notch, exploration is very rewarding. You can reallly feel that you are playing the game, and it doesn't feel like the game is playing  out for you. The game respects you and treats you as an intelligent human being  by not holding your hand every step of the way. It has a refreshing take on open world formula that diverges away from the tide of Ubisoft style formulaic approach seen in many games. Elden Ring is just a crowning masterpiece  of an achievement and will surely stay relevant and enjoyable for many more years to come.."

Positive,"truly phenomenal and beautiful game, tragic and intricate lore, engaging npc sidequests (i love you alexander), pain in the ass dungeons & also not that hard i only died well over a hundred times to fire giant the rest was ez btw (im lying)starting out lost in the beginning and gradually learning the mechanics n boss fights has been one of the most rewarding feelings ive felt in gaming since bloodborne ill nvr stop talking about this gamei think my only complaint is that there's no post-game dialogue, i would've loved to speak to all the npcs that rooted for the player, especially hewg, after fulfilling his dream"
Positive,"Well... I did it. I finished a ""Souls""-type game. Am I glad I did it? Yes, I think so. Would I go back and do it again if I could? No, probably not. Not for a very, very long time anyways.Seriously. It's obviously a well-made, high quality game, But MAN, does it have some issues.WARNING: This review is more of a vent than anything. I actually do think it's a decent game, just not worthy of the hype it's garnered. The combat is based almost entirely around timing and learning enemy attack patterns. This isn't a problem in and of itself. The right kind of player would love learning the precise time to press space against each kind of enemy. However, I am not that kind of player. I like to play base-builder type games and occasionally mix in some hack-and-slash rpg and shooter titles when I don't feel like thinking too hard. If I'm going to put in effort to master a game, I like to do it by planning my moves ahead of time and experimenting with the tools I'm given, not by mastering each in-the-moment micro-twitch movement. If you're like me and flip-flop between games like Team Fortress 2 and Factorio, I'd recommend staying away from this one.However, I think that the timing-based combat where one of the game's first huge problems rears its ugly head. For a game so heavily based on timing and careful movement, it has some awfully laggy inputs. Dodge-roll, one of the most important moves in the game, has a delay on it, about a half second, between when you press the button and when your character even starts to move. In the middle of this game's tightly timed fights, that's HUGE. It took me hours upon hours of wondering why dodging felt so bad before I realized what was going one.After looking at some online guides, I learned that this delay is apparently part of every Souls title and that most players simply consider mastering it to be part of the challenge. I suppose they're right, but think about it anyways: A significant portion of this game's challenge finds its source in intentionally poor, laggy controls.I'm also not sure that the developers ever heard the phrase ""quality of life"" when designing this game. There are all kinds of weird, inconvenient things in this game that simply defy explanation. Why aren't the all-important health and mana potions bound to a unique key? Why can we only use the special effect on our right-hand when we can just briefly unequip it to use our left-hand weapon? Why do equipped-but-unused weapons add to your carry weight? If you're quick with the menus, it's perfectly possible to keep your auxiliary weapons hidden in your inventory and then only equip them when needed. So... Why make us deal with the carry weight issue? Is rapid-clicking through menus supposed to be another combat skill we master?And I think I would be amiss if I didn't point out the poor early gameplay progression of sorcery/intelligence characters.I picked the ""Astrologer"" starting class, since I felt like playing a spellslinger. I booted into the game and started looking for better gear. But... Nothing. I tried everything I could think of. I followed the path the game sent me down. Nothing. I headed east to the higher level area. No new spells. No new staffs. Still nothing. It was beyond the twenty hour mark that I finally got a new staff as a random drop from an enemy in the high level area. And it was garbage. Literally worse than my starting weapon unless you happened to be using one or two ultra-niche ""rock breaker"" spells... And I only found them found those hours and hours later still!It was only when a friend clued me in to their location that I was finally able to get my hands on some better spells. Although they were actually pretty close to the starting area, there's nothing directing you there. If you happen to miss the one particular set of ruins where the vendor is hiding, you're screwed. No new spells for ages.Even then, it was probably past the fifty hour mark that I finally found a staff able to replace the starting staff (which by then I had upgraded to be better than most non-unique staffs), and hours more before I hit the minimum level to use it.Let me emphasize something. My friend TOLD me where to get better spells. I started this game determined not to look at the wikis. I tend to be really bad about that, using wikis to look up secrets. However, this was not the game with which I should have made that resolution because, to paraphrase that same friend's words, ""This is a game meant to be played with the wiki open on a second monitor.""Now, we reach the crux of the game's design flaws. THIS. ENTIRE. GAME. IS. MADE. OF. SECRETS. Like, seriously... I'm not sure that it's possible for a single player to complete a single side quest in this game without looking up instructions on the wiki. At least, not without spending hours upon hours upon hours scouring every last corner of the map for the next arbitrary NPC location and talking with every character second and third times to make sure that some new dialog option hasn't appeared. Even characters who supposedly ACTIVELY WANT YOUR HELP will barely tell you what they want or even why you should help them. e.g. One character, upon first meeting, will ask for your help in her ""war against the Erdtree."" At this point in the game, I still barely even knew what the Erdtree was other than really tall and glowing. There is no option to ask her why she wants a war against the Erdtree, or how even her cryptic assassinations quests help to combat the Erdtree.That character was nothing but a small contributor to what I consider to be the game's single biggest problem. This game is so cryptic, so utterly and incomprehensibly obtuse and obsessed with secrets, that I don't think I could have told you what the plot was had I not read it on the wiki. Everything else I could have forgiven if the story had just... y'know... Made sense.What's your character's motivation? When you start the game, you are greeted with a cutscene instructing you to ""become Elden Lord."" Why? Who is my character? Why did they just wake up in this temple? Was the voice in the cutscene something my character experienced? As far as I can tell, this is the story of some psychopath who wakes up and immediately goes on a rampage, killing half the remaining lucid people in this undead wasteland and subjugating the other half. Part of the fun of an open-world game is supposed to be learning about the world, meeting its people and seeing how they live. In Elden Ring though, the world seems to be nothing more than setpiece. A pretty backdrop while you ride between dungeon to boss fight to dungeon. There are people who like this stuff. Lore junkies who will spend hours making crazy theory videos on Youtube. However, if after playing through a whole game I can't identify any motive other than ""go kill stuff and get stronger so you can sit on the chair next to the big tree,"" I think there might be a problem.The game's problem's can be summed up in one fight: Maliketh. Apparently, you fight him to get something called ""Destined death."" What is that? It's never explained (Cryptic Lore). He moves incredibly fast, and your attack windows are comically slim (Janky timings). Forget Malenia, this is the real hardest boss in the game.  However, there's a secret item that exists specifically to fight him. You'd be lucky to find the item without going to the wiki and looking it up, and even if you did find it you'd be hard-pressed to figure out how to use it (wiki on other screen). He kills you quick. Fights tend to last less than a minute. However, the nearest respawn point is a thirty second walk away. There is no reason it couldn't have been right next to the boss door. It didn't add any challenge, all it did was make the boss take longer (quality of life).TLDR; If you just want to git good at fighting big bosses in a pretty landscape, this game is for you. Otherwise, maybe don't believe the hype."

Positive,"I am a 45 yo mother, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single mother to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my husband had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
Positive,My playtime of this game will tell you how much I liked it.
Positive,A bit late but it's one of my most beloved games I've ever played in my life. I hope the DLC will answer some lore questions we've been asking for so long and bring many more awesome bosses and weapons for pvp!

Positive,tutorial was pretty neat. Time to dive into the Things Betwixt
Positive,"First of all, I want to congratulate From Software on the amazing job they did on this title. Even my wildest fantasies over this game would shy over what the product actually turned out to be. Is it perfect? Nothing is, but it's my new standard for what perfect should aim for. This is From Software’s first attempt at a truly open-world game and you would never be able to tell from the game itself.From Elden Ring, you can expect a solid open-world experience with refined souls-like combat and a great world to explore on top of your spirit steed Torrent, a mount. Not everything can be done as soon as you find it, and sometimes leaving and coming back stronger and/or with better tools is a better strategy. The game somewhat suggests to you where the direction for the main story is with light rays that stem from most “grace”, the checkpoints, but it’s merely a suggestion. Know, though, that these games are by design not heavily guided, as to offer you an experience that is about discovering and conquering this world at your own pace and timing, filling in the blanks, so be prepared for it. It’s not your run-of-the-mill open-world game where you follow one objective marker after the other, and there is no “hold my hand” mode either. Failure is part of the experience.I believe From Software often talks to the player through its narrative. In Dark Souls 3 there is a dialogue that strongly rings this bell for me:“With this, I will paint a world. […] Twill be a cold, dark, and very gentle place. And one day, it will make someone a goodly home.”I think this can be seen as a metaphor for us players entering this new world that while evocatively familiar, won’t be the same. In this specific example leaving behind all the “rot”, or baggage that comes with making sequels to an already complex lore. Stagnancy, a topic Dark Souls 3 and Sekiro touch on a lot.Elden Ring is a new world written together by Miyazaki with George R. R. Martin, writer of Game of Thrones. Mandatory: “Where is Winds of Winter?”. From Software in the years showed their community how they don’t need to stale over the same IP for 12 mainline entries to sell copies or maintain a fanbase. The way they develop their stories and worlds benefits from not having sequels and leaving some loose ends. It is not incomplete, 95% of it can be understood just by paying attention, and the 5% remaining is up for speculation by design. As custom, the narrative won’t be front and center, instead, inviting you to read descriptions, listen to dialogues of NPCs, connect the dots, and find your way around. You might not be able to do everything in a single run, but there are not many Elden Rings out there and a game like this should be savored and when possible replayed.Elden Ring while open-world, did not ditch its detailed world-building and beautiful level design. Alongside the open map, there are “legacy dungeons”, which are more like a classic area in any souls game, but on a scale never seen. The best example is if the bottom of Anor Londo has ever made you wish you could explore it, in Elden Ring you can. The longer I played Elden Ring the more I noticed how From Software repurposed some old ideas, but with a better implementation. Dark Souls 2 had some interesting features like how rolling in water would lower your lightning and raise your fire defense, or rolling in poison would stick to your clothes and slowly build up poison status. These were good ideas but inside a game that barely used them. In a gigantic open world, though, there will be more opportunities to make use of these mechanics, and so it was nice to see them return stronger than ever.During the development of Bloodborne, Miyazaki said how limiting was for him to make the “Chalice Dungeons”, which had to be procedural. This requires rooms, or tiles, not only to be interesting but also to be able to combine them in multiple ways. Elden Ring takes what they learned from that and instead has static dungeons that have unique loot inside and unique minor bosses.This game is HUGE, and it felt magical to realize how big it is. The map is obscured from the start and can be discovered with fragments that will show its features, but not unlock its contents. There are many points of interest on the map that can be spotted from looking at the map itself even if there aren't icons immediately shown, like ruins and dungeons/caves that you’ll be able to explore as you drift away from your main objective to be immersed in this world. Something open-world games often suffer from is loot fatigue, but it was never a problem for me as there is unique loot as a reward everywhere, rewarding your curiosity. From new Weapons and Armor to Spells, Incantations, Ashes of War, and Spirit Ashes; there’s always a reason to explore!New are the “Ashes of War”, which are weapon skills or unique moves that can be equipped for all, but special weapons. You can find them in many ways and once applied to a weapon can also make you choose with which stats you’d like the weapon to have affinity with. Any Katana could now scale on Strenght with a Heavy ash, and that allows the player to truly play however they want. Lastly, Spirit Ashes can be found as loot, which when used summon a specific creature as an ally to fight for you during fights or anywhere where a purple tombstone icon appears.The game also has a co-op system that allows you to play with friends, but sadly, it's just the same as in previous titles, and chooses to block the use of the mount and some activities on the map, something I wish was different. In an update, a PVP Arena was added as free content, adding a one-place stop for PVP players in different modes!I’ll get a bit more technical here. One of the biggest complaints of the Souls series, especially Dark Souls 3, was that while the movesets of weapons were well done, during a boss fight there was no reason to use anything but your R1, aka the base attack. The player also feels discouraged to use a shield the better they got at the game or use jump attacks and charged heavy attacks as it would lock you in long recovery animation. This is not the case in Elden Ring. First and foremost, weapons have now a combo system. Spamming the base R1 attack won’t swing a theoretical sword left and right doing a 1-2, 1-2, but it’s a 1-2-3-4-5 where all numbers are different moves and 5 is a “combo finisher” that has a higher recovery time. So, per sé, spamming while possible won't chain infinitely until there is stamina. Additionally, two weapons of the same family can be used together for dual-wielding movesets, and shields could be ditched for staffs to make a mage-warrior. Moreover, a jump button has been added like in other games, so jump attacks are easier to perform and deal more posture damage. Bosses can have their posture broken with heavier attacks, but rarely with just R1. Even blocking with a shield now is a useful tactic as you can counter-attack after shielding a hit from an enemy with very generous timing, which will also deal more posture damage. You can also summon your mount during fights in the open world and attack from it.I won’t go too much into detail over the boss fights to avoid spoilers, but I will shortly say they were all really good and I found some that have possibly become my favorite in all From Software games. There were one or two bosses that did not tickle me right, but in a game with this much content, not everything can.This game, just like Dark Souls the first time I played it, set new standards for me.I strongly suggest it to people who want a fair challenge in a beautiful action RPG open-world fantasy experience.It feels like any number wouldn't be enough, but if I really have to it would be a 10/10."
Positive,"After playing the DS Trilogy exclusively back to back, i decided that the next game should be Elden Ring as it is close regarding the gameplay. The game started and it was from the beginning very familiar, given of course the new stuff and the items that were similar to those from older games that worked however differently to an extend. And it felt like it was going to be an amazing adventure already. And it was.The numerous locations were very different from each other, thus giving a big diversity from one location to the next. The weapons available seemingly having an endless variety and the smaller details like day/night and the weather, really made a big and good impression. I decided to approach the game like every other open world game i have played in the past, explore as much as possible ( in this case finding as many sites of grace as possible ) and then start exploring. And did i explore.. Searched every little corner, every hole, every dungeon, every plain and every castle, excited to see what i am going to find... Very nice variety, very nice ambient music, interesting enemies and amazing epic bosses battles. And for the most part, the game was great. But it was just that...Normally with a game of that genre, like i did with the DS games, i would describe my experience, but this game is too big to do that, so i believe that just being one more voice stating how good the game is , is good enough. However, i would have to note some aspects that i didnt really enjoy and some that affected my time with the game in a bad way. Starting with the worst one, i played the game on Steam Deck and during almost my whole playthrough i was being put in offline mode, which after some search about it, found out it's a problem of the game, a problem that it hasnt been addressed yet ( i didnt experience not even one invasion for example). The other kind of issue i had with the game is mostly based on my point of view. What i didnt like was that although i enjoyed it very much, the npc variety, i found it lacking. I understand that this kind of games dont have npcs as a main point in their narrative, but still i would expect more from an open world game... Thankfully the world building ( change of day and night, enviroment, weather, item descriptions and statues ) and the epic battles thoughout the whole game made a much bigger impact and when i finished the game, i was left with a similar feeling like with the dark souls games... Elden Ring was great, but i was left wanting more. Of course more to do, more to explore, but also more to care about since the plot wasnt that interesting and i never felt engaged. Maybe everything being more ( despite we wanting that or not ) open world is not the the way this kind of games thrive in. It felt like Bilbo Baggins said - feels thin and stretched, like butter scrapped over too much bread... And the reason the bread felt still tasty was due to its many quality components.An amazing game overall nonetheless and highly recommended to everyone,because of its nature maybe also even more to newcomers of the genre.Transferred my game over a pc and doing summons for people that need help for the final boss of the main game, daily EEST 20:00 - 21:00 except Wednesdays. Also feel free to add me if you need help with any other boss.Edit-Update: As of now, the problem where playing the game through the Steam Deck without owning the DLC would cause you to get stuck at playing offline, it has been resolved and now you can play online properly."

Positive,"It's beautiful. It's addictive....and it's hardIf you don't want to stress and just enjoy stories, this and games like this isn't gonna be your jam. If you want a challenge, in a world very beautiful with so many styles of combat - then this isn't even a question of should you buy this. Elden Ring will give you what you want. Worth Full Price"
Positive,"edit: this was originally a negative review due to performance issues and glitches, these have since been patchedElden ring is a fantastic culmination of fromsofts design lessons from dark souls. While i have some personal hiccups here and there, its undeniably a fantastic game.For the first attempt at making dark souls an open world game, its crazy how well it was executed. The term ""open world"" might make you wince a bit seeing how for most games ""open world"" means ""we made a big empty map of nothing and filled it with objective markers to pretend there is content. There might also be concerns on how the dark souls formula of tightly designed challenges and areas would function if the world is now meant to be freely explored on your own pace. But i can honestly say they found a good way of mixing both together. The world may be open now but youll come across castles or caverns that are tightly designed like the areas of old titles with shortcuts, bonfires and bosses at the end all without loading screen or obvious level transitions. The game will simply force you off your horse and uses clever level design to prevent major skips from happening so you get that tight level design youre so familiar with. The combat is better than ever and uses many lessons learned from previous titles while also mixing in brand new ones to give a fresh but still familiar dark souls feel. The story has the usual vague feel to it, but puts in a bit more effort to try and convey whats happening than previous games (although its very likely youll still need to look up videos by the end of your journey to really understand what you just went through).I could go on and on on what the game does to well but the review would turn out to be very wordy, its easier to say what i didnt enjoy to allow you to come to your own conclusion on if the negatives are enough to push you away from trying this title. But keep in mind that any negatives mentioned dont outweigh the sheer amount of positives this game has to offer.1. The main story path is actively scaled to curve insanely hard at the first boss, so when you get to them you'll find yourself struggling super hard and start questioning if you're doing things right. The game is designed that way to encourage you to leave the boss alone and explore instead (to get new weapons/armor/abilities etc) but its not at all clear when playing that that is what you're meant to do. 2. While the game boasts an impressive 238 bosses, its worth noting that a massive amount of them end up being just regular enemies with beefed up hp and damage. Not to mention having a ton of repeats of the same boss with slightly different attacks.3. The nature of the open world means that its entirely possible (and arguably unavoidable) that youll end up completely overpowered for some areas/bosses which robs you of a fun fight in a lot of cases. (Luckily the main bosses needed for the main campaign dont really have this issue and are scaled quite well with your progress)4. The multiplayer is once again a pain in the butt to use. If youre playing with friends, prepare to grind tons of flower pedals as youre required to use one every single time you die and want to re-connect with friends which also opens your world up for invasions which are arguably more annoying in this game than any other. Because areas are so incredibly large, its not uncommon to get invaded but spend 30 minutes trying to find out where they are hiding because the pvp invasions are not limited to the small castle/designated areas, its entirely possible to be invaded while out in the open world. It literally turns into an hour long hide and seek session and is more annoying than any fun that could be had from the combat, so its better to disconnect and re-connect with friends than it is to deal with the whole thing. People have taken to modding in a better multiplayer that fixes most of these issues.Thats it! If none of those bother you much then you should have bought this game already."
Positive,"At a 150 hours I said ""Nope, won't do it no more"" after getting stuck on another ""golden horse boi"" before Maliketh. And 3 days later I realized I got so far and that I'm slightly addicted to this game and I have to complete it... This game is a little bit like the relationship with your ex-boyfriend. The sex is so fucking good but he treats you like trash. 10/10. Would bang again."
Positive,"Elden Ring was released almost 3 years after the first announcement but i can easily say that it was definitely worth the wait till the end. I think it is an excellent upgrade to Dark Souls 3. I loved mechanic of the ashes of war, big open world, and build variety quite. There are badass and cool bosses like Malenia, Maliketh, Mohg etc. but i have to say Dark Souls 3 has cooler bosses like Slave Knight Gael, Sister Friede and Nameless King. PvE: I have stopped counting after the 15th run. Lore in the game is beautifully and smartly designed.PvP: It is hell of a fun but please don’t use hp estus in the middle of the duel guys come on! In addition, maybe u can show some respect to people who duel by not interrupting their fight. These criticisms are for people who play that way, so i don’t blame people in general or the game itself.Long story short, Elden Ring will be on the top unless Bloodborne 2/Elden Ring 2/ Dark Souls 4 releases.  “This game is a blessing to the world.”  This is the sentence i have been telling to my friends since it was first released and my opinion has never changed at all. My recommendation rate is 11/10.One more thing to say :) i hope we can get a dlc soon."

Positive,"So after completing the game more than 4 times on Steam and 2 times in seamless coop, I can confidently say this is the best open-world RPG ever made. For me, it was The Witcher 3 holding the title for years, but now we have a new Elden Lord to claim the crown, haha.The lore in Elden Ring is something else. From the mind of R.R. Martin and direction from Miyazaki, this is not just lore but an experience of its own. From cool to mysterious to dark, every backstory of particular NPCs or bosses is different, making you want to explore more. Since I've completed the game with 100% side quests and main story guidance, it’s pretty easy to get lost in the woods or ruins if you don’t have guidance to chase the lore.The DLC for Elden Ring is a game-changer. After diving into it, I can say it adds so much to the experience. The new areas are breathtaking, just like the main game, and the fresh challenges and bosses are a blast. The lore gets even richer, pulling you deeper into the world with new stories that make you want to explore every corner. Completing the new quests felt rewarding, like a sweet bonus for all the time I’ve spent in the Lands Between. If you loved the base game, this DLC is an absolute must-play!Apart from the lore, the combat is challenging yet fun to mess around with, xD. It’s a typical Souls-like game, but here you get a vast open world to explore for new weapons, magic spells, incantations, and many more things to kill the dead. On top of that, every weapon or spell has its own visuals or ambient effects, which look stunning on high graphics—just like a visual novel or something. The graphics are breathtaking; the world is beautifully made and designed. From Limgrave to the nightmare called Caelid, haha, every area feels creepy yet beautiful.In short, I’d say Elden Ring isn’t just a game; it’s an experience that Miyazaki-sama has done for us. Ngl, even if you’re weak or a pussy, you need to play Elden Ring once in your lifetime. Just like RDR 2, Wukong, The Witcher, and many more, it’s rare to find such a masterpiece these days that respects your time and money invested in games.10/10 – A fucking masterpiece. Miyazaki GOAT."

Positive,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
Positive,Even Malenia's feet are enough
Positive,One of the games ever made.
Positive,"After over 300 hours of getting killed, I think I can now qualify to make a proper review on this game. The only con I've got is that the quest system is very confusing. I got locked out of so many NPC quests. I later realized that there are online guides to help aide you for these quests.Everything else is a pro! I am a type of person that just sticks to what I know (and that's SWTOR because I've been playing it for years, been part of the same guild for years and I'm a ""late bloomer"" when it comes to games so I've never really ventured beyond that.) But nothing has prepared me for Elden Ring and when I started playing Elden Ring, all hope died. Hope as in real life because this game will suck many hours of your life. But you will love it!I fell in love with this game Elden Ring. It is also my first game I properly play for Souls. I admire how you can explore and you don't need to no rush on boss or story - you have freedom to collect and loot and enjoy every single dungeon and kill all that comes in your path and do this game at your comfortable pace. Enjoying the beautiful views you see along the way. The scenery is beautiful, the music is beautiful, the voice acting is beautiful. I love everything about this game. I started playing it thinking I could not progress because it was too difficult for me but now I am wearing Malenia's armor and blobbing along having as much fun many hours later as I did when I begin!Highly recommend. Beautiful game."

Positive,"Let’s get a few things straightened out here. You know what Elden Ring is. I don’t have to explain it. I have fully beaten Elden Ring twice. I think it is, overall, a good game. But it is not a masterpiece like you may have heard. It has its amazing upsides, but significant downsides as well. I want you, the reader, to decide if this game is right for you.Let’s get started with the basics. Elden Ring’s core gameplay loop is the Fromsoft Souls classic; you attack the enemy and roll to dodge through attacks. However, it is also sort of an amalgamation of all previous popular Fromsoft games. The stealth from Sekiro returns, as well as the jump button. The speed of combat returns from DS3 and Bloodborne, with enemies faster than ever before. And long forgotten mechanics from the underappreciated Dark Souls 2 return, like powerstancing, the ability to combine two weapons of the same class for a unique dual wield moveset.Frankly, there are too many mechanics to cover in a review that has a character limit. But the CORE of the combat is still the same as before. If you like Dark Souls, Bloodborne, or Sekiro, you’ll most likely like this.However, as you know, Elden Ring is open world, a first for Fromsoft. This means that enemies can come from anywhere, at any time. You have to be on alert constantly or else you can easily find yourself stuck in a massive ambush. On the plus side, this means a lot of player engagement and freedom. But, on the other hand, it means a LOT of content is missable or, frankly, not worth your time. Any dungeon you encounter can either gift you with your new favorite weapon, a core spell for your arsenal, or even a fantastic new talisman. Or, that same dungeon could give you something completely irrelevant to your current build, like a katana for your strength pure, or a faith weapon on your sorcerer. This makes exploring and discovering a treat, but also somewhat tedious, and often kills replayability. What’s the point in going through an open world full of secrets when you know every secret, and know 90% of them aren’t important?Where the game truly shines are in its legacy dungeons, giant sprawling fortresses and cities reminiscent of Sekiro or the levels of the Souls series. The perfectly paced enemies, dense layout, and unlockable shortcuts and checkpoints make them a joy to go through. But on the negative side, the rest of the dungeons range from alright to outright miserable. The vast majority of them follow the same cookie cutter design of cramped tomb tunnels or dug out caves, and they get old pretty fast.That leads to a core criticism of the gameplay as a whole: while the core loop is quite enjoyable, you’ll soon realize a lot of assets get reused throughout the game. Many minibosses are simply late game common enemies with a health bar that give mediocre rewards on defeat. Some enemy types are continuously reskinned to suit the new area. As an example, the basic soldier enemy is reskinned to be a regional soldier for nearly every single area in the game, with little to no change in moveset, regardless of their army or colors. Some minibosses are re-used up to 10+ times, and it gets very tiresome to see the new flavor of the month reskin after reaching the end of another copy and paste dungeon.But the biggest criticism I have for the game is the bosses. With Bloodborne, DS3, and Sekiro, Fromsoft showed they have the true talent for making a memorable and difficult, but balanced boss experience. Sadly, they dropped the ball somewhat for Elden Ring. Many bosses are rather “cheap” in nature, relying on insanely heavily delayed animations to bait and catch rolls, or on input reading, an AI tactic where the enemy reacts the same frame you press a button to give them the perfect response at your detriment and beyond any human’s possible reaction time. Endgame bosses especially feel heavily overtuned, either crammed full of gimmicks, like spraying lingering bleed-inflicting flames on the ground, healing on every hit, and inflicting HP drain, or simply having gargantuan health bars and dealing 900+ damage on every hit, turning even a glancing blow into a sudden life or death situation.I still think the gameplay and bosses as a whole lean more on the positive side. But they distinctly have their flaws, and players NEED to remember to use every tool at their disposal. Even though it plays like a Souls game, it is NOT balanced like one, and will severely punish you for assuming you can approach it like one.As for the story, it is quite excellent. Those familiar with Fromsoft lore can expect the usual vageueness  & bits and pieces of scattered story to be found. Elden Ring definitely has a much denser history compared to the Souls series, but that makes it more satisfying to piece together.And thankfully, Fromsoft provided us with a key NPC, Gideon the All-Knowing, to provide us key information about who we need to be killing and where they are. His addition is invaluable as a player resource.Simply put, the game looks absolutely phenomenal. I do have my distinct issue with the color palette; that it clearly needs to remember colors other than gray exist in some areas, ESPECIALLY in dungeons, but the special effects and enemy designs are 100% on point. The open world especially looks reasonably believable and realistic, with every region having its distinct atmosphere that sets it apart from the others. You can load into the game anywhere and immediately know where you are just based on your surroundings.The “Remembrance” bosses especially hold absolutely nothing back, with strikingly unique designs and insane levels of SFX and color variety. They alone help the game stand out.Thankfully, no criticisms in this category. Weapons feel meaty, attacks have weight, and the music is still up to the historically excellent Fromsoft standard. Not much needs elaborating; look up the OST for Godskin Apostles or Mohg, Lord of Blood. You’ll be hooked in seconds.GeForce RTX 3050Ti 4GB | Intel i7 | 16GB | Windows 10 Elden Ring is VERY demanding in the specs department, and to top it off, its capped at 60 FPS. Even with good specs like mine, I would still suffer frame drops in areas.Most concerningly, the Elden Ring multiplayer servers at the moment are an absolute MESS. At pure random, you can suffer a “connection error” and completely disconnect from your host, whether you be invader or ally. This is thanks to the horrible implementation of Easy Anti-Cheat. I cannot physically count on all my digits how many times I was helping a host beat an endgame boss and got booted out of the session with ZERO warning either a mere minute after joining or significantly into the fight. Solo play using spirit ashes or NPC summons is unaffected, but temper your expectations if you’re a career invader or sunbro.At the end of the day, I had a net positive experience with Elden Ring. The world was very enjoyable to explore, and most of the major story bosses that actually had some thought put into them are very memorable and exciting. However, if you decide to play, you NEED to be prepared for the rotten apples in the basket. Be willing to use every tool at your disposal to win; because Elden Ring certainly will.Follow our curator page, OCG-Curations, if you like and want to see more reviews like this one."
Positive,"Elden Ring is arguably the best game in the series, delivering an expansive and fascinating open world that's a joy to explore. The landscapes are breathtakingly beautiful, truly some of the best visuals seen in gaming. Each area is packed with secrets and challenges that keep you engaged for hours. The bosses are a standout feature; they're brilliantly designed and offer a tough but fair challenge, although a few do repeat throughout the game. Devs really nailed the climactic feel with the last two bosses—both feel like true final bosses and provide a satisfying end to an epic journey. I enjoyed Elden Ring so much that I couldn't stop until I had unlocked all the achievements. It's a masterpiece that's not to be missed."
Positive,"This game made me realized what I was missing when I gave up trying to complete Dark Souls 2 back in 2014. After putting 100+ hours into this game in less than a week's time, I want to go out of my way to soon pick up the rest of the Souls series and play the heck out of those alongside still playing Elden Ring...and finally beat Dark Souls 2, too."

Game mostly only stutters when it seems it is loading something in , besides that i'm at stable 60 FPS ( and yes 60FPS locks on modern PCs do suck , believe me difference between being used to 100+ and 60 is massive ) .And yes, me not having bad performance doesnt invalidate other people's issues at all. Just wanted to say that performance issues are not universal."

Positive,THE BEST GAME IVE EVER PLAYED JUST BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Positive,this game is like a game that was made by the game developer fromsoftware and is a game they made
Positive,"Coming up on 300 hours of play and beating the game multiple times. In a market where games keep releasing unfinished or stay in alpha/beta forever, this game has had the best release I can remember. People like to compare Elden Ring to DarkSouls 3, which is pretty accurate. Darksouls 3 was one of my favorite games of all time and Elden Ring does it quite a bit better. Lets start off by talking about the strengths of Elden Ring.-The massive world. Elden Ring's world is huge, maybe too big. You see a mountain in the distance, you can climb that mountain. You climbed that mountain and now see a castle or ruins in the distance, you can explore that area too. The thing about DS3 after thousands of hours played, the levels start to seem very small. I don't think this will ever be the feeling Elden Ring players will encounter. The map is also very detailed and enjoyable to look at and make markers for.-Character Creation.10/10. Its amazing since it has so many settings to play with. You can also change your appearance and name later in the game. One of the best character creators I have had time to tinker with. If you tried, you could probably make your character look like your real life avatar ;)-The graphics and optimization. ER has many settings to be tweaked and seems to do a good job running on older machines. Some of the game does have some optimization issues but they are resolved and unnoticeable for the most part. The graphics on high-maximum are pretty amazing for the scale of the game. Might not be as good as Demon Souls remake quality but then again the world is massive and something had to give. The art is amazing, new weapons, skills, and tilesets. Of course they reuse many things from the old souls games, which is actually smart considering the scale of the game. If you consider all the new art they added, the reuse of old material is welcomed by myself.-The music and sound for the game are next level. I actually feel myself being unnerved by some areas music so much so, I am hesitant to go back and find items in that location. I play a ton of games like Escape from Tarkov or Warzone, so I know about bad sound lol. The developers will put sound cues on many important items like Scarabs. These sounds work well for training players, who want to discover secret areas, to listen to less prominent noises.-Crafting is a new mechanic to the game and is done very well. The game is huge and being able to interact with the environment through harvesting definitely makes it slightly more immersive. The crafting motivates players to look all around hoping to find an ingredient for cure poison or scarlet rott. coupled with the ability to make detailed markers on the map, you can set up some useful crafting routes. -UI and controls can be finicky, especially if you are new to the genre. I am glad they kept the same as the past titles but some other people will not like the double bound controls. Personally I am use to this department.-The multiplayer. This is where ER could shine quite a bit more. ER has decoupled summoning players and the stat boost from the Effigy(Arc Rune). I think this is a good idea. The game is meant to be played with others which is why they added ASH SUMMONING.  Ash's can be very strong, sometimes better than a co operator. Great addition but what is really disappointing is, the 4 player maximum count. DS3 you could get up to 7 players in your game. This was great for fightclubs or just playing the game and being invaded. I understand the decision to reduce to 4 maximum players was probably made because of network instability. Even with 4 players its unstable. I know they are working hard to resolve this and have talked about it openly. This is not the only problem though. There is also no multiplayer PvP arenas like DS3 and DS2. This is kind of mind blowing considering how many arenas you come accross. I am hoping this is resolved through DLC kinda like they did for DS2. The mutiplayer has some weird hitches people don't understand as well. You can't summon a co operator with duelist in your world. You can't summon a duelist if you are invaded. You can summon a co operator, then a duelist, and then be invaded however. The sequencing for who enters the world of the host is very important. 2 Players cannot connect to a host world at the same time. This is problematic since invasions are out of the hosts control and sometimes occur at the same time as a host trying to summon a player which results in ""Unable to Summon"" or a disconnect. Once the disconnect occurs there is also a cool down before summon signs will appear again.  Once I figured out how it works, I resolved 95% of the disconnection issues.-Balance is another controversial ER topic. There are a few builds which are abusing some mechanics that make PvP not so great. Fire's Deadly Sin incantation is mostly the root of these problems but some other builds using blood hound dodge can also be very frustrating to fight against. I am sure FromSoftware will fix it but its still something that needs to be talked about. If you are trying to duel and use a reasonable build around SL 130, you will probably be disappointed with the results. I am not saying its impossible to have good fights but the chance you go against a great oak shield or eclipse shotel is high. Don't even get me started on moonveil katana and bloodhound step users though xD.ConclusionAll in all the game is not far from perfect in my eyes. The game just released and it was a near perfect release from my experience. The balance will get ironed out so no points deducted to my score for the game in that area. I do have to deduct some points for the multiplayer. I am sure these issues will also be resolved or lessened when the community learns how to do the workarounds. Relative to other game releases for the past few years, I think 9.5 is a fair score. Its almost perfect and soon with a patch or 2, or DLC, it will be there. Very rarely do we get to experience a work of art like this game. I do recommend trying to play without a wiki or guides but more so use them as a tool to point you in the right direction. This game is so full of wonder and mystery, most the enjoyment is just discovery or being awe inspired by the view of an area thats new, huge, and you get to explore.9.5/10 Best release I can remember."

Positive,"Three stages of playing Elden Ring:1. (Learning): ""These boss attacks are bullsh*t; they are too quick; there is no way to avoid them; what were they thinking when they designed this?!""2. (20+ deaths): *Complete silence while dodging attacks after getting familiar with bosses' patterns.*3. (Post Boss Clarity): ""That had to have been one of the greatest fights I've beaten; what an incredible design!""Elden Ring was my first FromSoftware title, and my initial response to this game design was to reject it. But, in all honesty, this game taught me that determination and willingness to put effort into overcoming an obstacle are always possible if you put your mind into it.But if not and if you are struggling to beat certain pieces of content, the game allows you to overcome those obstacles with variety of other tools, which is a great thing.Overall, a solid 8 out of 10 from me; imperfect but an incredibly fun game."
Positive,"Game developers should learn how to design an open world game from Elden Ring. The map is filled with secrets after secrets, dungeons after dungeons and many more meaningful activities that directly affect your character and progress. It's simply a genius game design. I never got bored throughout my 70 hours of playthrough. Not even once.What made me fall in love with the game was it's universe. I have always disliked the Japanese style of story telling that how the world was just too weird and were filled with silly and out of place jokes combined with cringe characters. I just couldn't handle it. On the other hand, Western style story telling was more serious and had more intriguing concepts but were executed poorly and lacked a soul to keep me interested. This game is the perfect middle ground because this world was created by George R. R. Martin and the game was done by a Japanese studio. Only downsides of this game are it's UI (fucking awful) and they couldn't calculate Torrent's fall damage but those two are irrelevant in the grand scheme of things and can be easily disregarded.Also, how about giving an option to respec before starting an NG+ or atleast a fucking warning?Overall, 10/10."
Positive,"I bought this game because of Melina p0rn on Twitter,I got killed 10 times by Tree sentinel,I delete this game,What a great game/10."
Positive,"Terrible game, saved the girl, she hates me now. All the other ones are ridden with STDs.Thank the three fingers for just burning it all.Ps:it's a masterpiece"
Positive,"The fallen leaves tell a storyOf how We Tarnished became Elden Lord.In our home, across the screen, the Lands Between.Our seed will look back upon us, and recall.An Age of Elden Ring....떨어진 잎사귀가 말한다....그 치세는,엘든 링의 시대라고 불릴 것이다."
Positive,"This is my first FromSoftware game, but not my last.  The world is expansive, horizontally and vertically.  Very few times is there a load screen, as almost all of the world is one giant map.  Given the size, it is quite impressive.  The plot...   well, you will need to be a sleuth, online guide reader, or completionist to really get what is going on.  I really just got the main plot, but even that was over 90 hours.I bought it slightly on sale, which is great, but any dark souls fans will get their monies' worth out of it.EPic grand open  world that is dark forboding and creepy.  Not for everyone, but as of this writing over 20 million copies, so maybe it is for everyone.YOU WILL DIE ALOT8/10"
Positive,"After getting 100% I can safely say this is in my opinion the best soulsborne game.Everything is viable, there are plenty of astonishing skills/spells/weapons and armor to try. When you see a video with a title ""OP x item"" I can assure you there are 100 others just as good or even better. Play how you like, it will carry you through the game. Also the scenery, atmosphere and music are so good it is hard to fathom that this game actually exist. It was also a bit harder game for me at least at start, few of the bosses are absolutely brutal in melee combat but I managed to UGS my way through eventually.And now for a few bad things. Some things are still bugged (arcane scaling weapons) and performance issues and occasional crashes otherwise was a smooth run.Edit. Now that those few things are mostly fixed the game is just a masterpiece 10/10 would die to instant curse or bleed again."
Positive,"Try fingersBut holePickle...on a more serious note, this is genuinely one of the greatest games i've ever played and not putting it in my top 10 would be criminal after the hours of enjoyment i've had. the world is breathtaking, there isn't a single area of the game where if you stop and take a breather for a second or two, you'll be hitting F12 a couple of times. the variety of locations are insane. i won't say much to avoid spoilling, but i was often shocked at the amount of ideas they managed to cram into this world without it feeling unnatural. there are some traps in the game that teleport you to late game areas, and you'll be shocked at how big the map is, how cool the areas are and how the fucking common dog just one taps you. it makes it so when you actually reach these locations through progression, it feels really good to not get one shot or actually one shot the enemies that were giving you such a hard time. besides that, exploration is fun and feels actually really good. usually in your skyrims and copy pasted ubisoft open world titles, you just look at your compass at the top of your screen, and hold W in the direction that has the most appealing icon. sure you're ""exploring"", but you're not actually looking at the route you're taking. in elden ring, the compass only tells you the cardinal directions, so if you want to find anything, you either have to look at your map to see if there are any points of interest or actually look around using your eyes to spot interesting things. this gave me the same feeling i had with breath of the wild a few years ago where i'm supposed to do one thing, but i just see another cool thing after another i just get sidetracked for hours. the bosses are what you expect from a soulslike, tough, maybe rage inducing (if you suck) but fair. if you haven't played a soulsbourne game like i have before this one, this is easily the best intro you could have to them. all the bosses are great, the build variety you can have in this game is seemingly limitless + if you struggle too much on a boss, you can just go into the open world and come back when you're better. the only flaws i have with this game is that it's in a serious need of a questlog (it's not normal that i have to have the wiki open on my second monitor just to remember what a NPC said 60 hours of gameplay ago) and it could take the ULTRAKILL way of death. what i mean is that if you die, you click R, no loading screen, you spawn right back into the boss room. i fucking hated the commander niall runback"
Positive,"Update: this is my vote for Game of the Year.Elden Ring is an emotional roller coaster, that is both challenging and rewarding. The game was mostly problem free of technical issues, and nothing game breaking. Beating the game was a joy, but there is a great deal of content that can be missed with only that in mind. The story is not in the main boss fights alone, but in every element, behind ever hidden wall, in every item description, and in the choices that you make. Elden Ring is an epic that your character lives through; and not just a series of cinematics and narrations. The graphics are fantastic. While they are not cutting edge realistic like some games, they are complete, artistic and beautiful. Elden Ring is a masterpiece of art, as can be seen throughout the Elden world and all that resides within. There is a clear passion seen in the many spells/incantations, as well as the combat actions and poses. The controls are fantastic, and yet a little frustrating. There is a learning curve to the controls, due to a small delay to input and character reaction. This is due to the way that the core of the game operates. It is not a long delay, but if you have fast reflexes, you will find it impact how you play. You will have to train yourself to be more patient, and treat combat with a slightly different approach. Once this is mastered, the combat is very fun. There is a great diversity with numerous weapons having their own style, timing and bonuses (many hidden). My favorite aspect of Elden Ring is the story. The story is simply beautiful and something that I believe reflects well the history of humanity. Maybe even the present. Possibly the future as well. I will not spoil the story, but it is worth experiencing, and very well done. There are many characters to be introduced, but they have decent depth, and the voice acting is done very well. My one dismay is the soundtrack. I found it to be lackluster, and some of the songs to be headache inducing. Overall, it is mostly neutral, and you can just as easily forget it is on. Except for the few that have a constant high pitch tone that just repeats. In short, Elden Ring is a must play. While still early in the year, Elden Ring is the game to beat for Game of the Year, and I am doubting anything will come close."

Positive,"Let me start by saying this was the first game I played created by FromSoftware (well except for killing the first boss in DS3 - which doesn't really count, does it?). I wasn't caught up in the Elden Ring hype and I wasn't really interested in the game even after it's release. It didn't even come up in my mind to even look at it, as I thought it wouldn't be the right game for me. And oh boy was that a mistake. About a month ago I finally decided to look into the game and almost instantly decided to get it.Not being interested in the game from the start actually made me enjoy it that much more. I wasn't hyped up from any trailers, media or rumors. I went into the game with a clean slate. And it was amazing. From the first time hearing the AWESOME soundtrack in the menu to exploring the crazy world of Lands Between - and let me tell you I barely scratched the surface of what the world has to offer.The world really feels alive. It's crazy how from previous - mostly linear - games the devs managed to create such an impressive open world. The map is HUGE and there isn't an area which feels empty and out of place. Each location really feels different and tells it's own story.There are some let's say tedious locations, I'm looking at you Mountaintops of the Giants, that get a bit annoying after playing through the game several times. Nevertheless even these snow-covered depressing hills deserve a special places in any gamer's heart. I won't mention any other locations because it would be a sin to spoil any of them.Locations being behind us, let's move onto the people inhabiting the Lands Between. The NPCs are there for themselves not for the player. That makes them feel really alive - you've never met this guy? Well he certainly doesn't care because he was doing his thing anyways. And that's crazy. The world is constantly evolving and the NPCs are too. And not just that, the people you meet during your adventure are as interesting as it gets. There weren't many times I could certainly say ""Okay, this NPC is good, pure-hearted and they will surely stay that way!"". The craziest thing is you might not meet even half of the NPCs if you're just playing the game for the sake of reaching the end.Bosses will kick your ass and those bastards will look cool doing it. Damn I wish I was born a cool boss too. But hey tough luck foul tarnished. Get some shiny gear and kick their ass for a change. After all you're ambitious and surely not foolish at all - Margit the goat fanboy.Elden Ring has 6 unique endings. That's all I'm gonna say about that. Though don't expect to be an Elden Ring Expert after your first... or tenth playthrough. The lore is, as FromSoft is known for, hidden in every possible way there is. You get a new weapon? You thought, it's lore in disguise. You got a completely useless pot which is completely useless? Oh wait it's got ten paragraphs of lore in it's description. Honestly if you really want to know atleast a bit of lore or you're interested in a certain character, I recommend you to look up external sources about them, such as youtube videos or useful lore sites. But be warned, there are still numerous mysteries which even the most notorious loreheads are still uncertain about. But hey, that's the beauty of it all, isn't it?I have to say, I don't think there currently is and for a long time will be any better entry point to FromSoft games. Even though, Elden Ring still doesn't exactly help you get through and still kicks your ass every chance it gets, it's a fun ass kicking. And I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone even a bit interested in the genre or in the game itself.It might even be time to announce a DLC reveal, what do you say FromSoft? ...pretty please?TLDR: Game of the year - do I need to add anything else? Wait... Actually I do. There are Waifus. FromSoft boys truly outdone themselves."

Positive,"Well, now that I've beaten it exactly at 100 hours over the span of 3-4 weeks I think I can give a penny for my thoughts. Elden Ring is great, the scope of the the world is expansive and daring for Fromsoft to challenge in comparison to their previous games. I'd say they nailed it, the world is pretty fun to find yourself wandering about and finding meaningful content that such as loot, quests, lore, etc.Of course if you're not an open-world fan I can see this still being a game that you'd be reluctant about playing, however I'd say give it a shot if you can and see it for what it is like. There are various ways of tackling Elden Ring, you can spend your time exploring and getting more stronger and making things more accessible or you can choose tackle only the Legacy Dungeons (areas that are more traditional to the Souls games) and enjoy it that way. Any and every way you choose to tackle Elden Ring are all valid, don't let anyone else tell you otherwise.There's also PvP which I've only done a few hours doing and well, it's a mixed experience for me, especially with players spamming the same build (Moonveil or Rivers of Blood katanas) at Soul Level 150. But perhaps you can find a better experience than me with PvP later on as more people experiment more with builds.The game also has some glaring issues, performance most of all being the worst offender even after the patches. I'm running a rig quite above the recommended setting and the game loves to dip frames below half of what it's capped at (being 60). It gets incredibly frustrating when your fighting a boss then your frames decide to tank making you vulnerable to hits and possibly ending your run. Doesn't happen often but when it happens it's noticeable. Another thing I'd have to say is a pain in ass is the camera, there are many times where'd you have to fight the damn camera since it loves to adjust automatically, especially when you're fighting giant bosses on Torrent (your mount). It's very frustrating and was not an issue in the previous Fromsoft games (DS3, Bloodborne) because it WAS a setting you can TURN OFF.Aside from these two main issues I have with the game (which are fixable), I think it's a very enjoyable game and a good entry-point for newcomers to the Fromsoft Souls games. Definitely worth $60 if you've got the rig for it. Have fun and git gud.Oh and of course, Ranni best girl."
Positive,"I was forced to play through this games by  my acquaintances for their amusement and now the nightmare is over. A dude bought me the game, then i had to pay him back if i liked it, and then I had to stream it for him and a bunce of others for there entertainment... I started early on the game's original release and went for a shield/spear & scythe faith build only to be ridiculed for it. But as I played and defeated every boss on my first try (This is a lie, but true story if the boss was a dragon), I showed them how powerful faith and the ability to send homing-holy rings of light at a short distance really is! But I met a boss that I could not defeat, a boss that had resistance to holy damage and who effortlessly beat me time and time again until i was in the high double digit number of attempts, and her name was Malenia, she broke me and i was less of a person for it, they told me to change my build, to abandon my faith to giving up on your build that I have had since I the start and never changed, and go for a bleed build og arcane heresy. All tho Malenia was an optional boss, she was the last one i had to defeat before challenging the last 3 bosses in the game, and with the humiliation she had made me suffer through she was no longer an optional boss for me, she was the boss that broke me and I stopped playing... A piece of me died in that boss room, my hopes and dreams, and I did not return to the game again.Fast forward 2 years and before the dlc was released I again was forced into the game against my will. They mocked me, teased me for not beating the game, that I was defeated and broken. But they made fun of how boarding and bad faith was and a fire was lit in me, one that did not want to stop burning until I had shown them the true power of faith. So I returned...Once more...To the broken world of the land between...And the uhallowed halls of Malenia...Cue the main Elden Ring theme song. With no warm up, no new game, no changing of build, no try out on lesser enemies, just pure faith I went back in to pick up where I had left off. But this time with a companion, a friend that would end but as the main character in my story, Black Knife Tiche. I was defeated time and time again the first night. I spent 4 hours with minimal progress, switching between me halo scythe + Winged Scyth and the Black Knife.I died so many times, over and over again, before phase 2 and right after it began.Day 2 didn't start any better, 3 more hours it took, until, finally, Tiche got the final blow in on Melenia and I could finally move on.The last 3 bosses went down easy, but in the blur Tiche was the one that got most of the killing strikes on them. and we beat the game. I was happy, I could have felt it there never to return to this game... but alas, they would not allow me. they forced me into it, to buy and play the DLC so they could have something funny to watch again. The DLC is easy, first tried all the bosses (this is also a lie unless there was a dragon boss). But my run ended when I got to the last boss of the DLC, he was easy until he got holy resistance and killed me effortlessly again and again. I was told that so many changed their build on the last boss, used a food item as a weapon and to not give up... I gave up... and left the game a second time.The terror of returning to the game a third time, it sceard me, I was fed up. I didn't care for the game, I would rather just leave it as an open wound in my gaming library as so many other games. But... cue the main theme once more.Now after months of group pressure by my so-called good acquaintances, I had to pick it up again because they were bored and wanted to watch me beat my head against a wall. I went back in, no warm up, no go out and try my skills against lesser enemies, no changing of my build. go right through the fog and into the boss room. It took 3 hours over 2 days and a lot of deaths for me to finally beat him with faith and holy missile rings to finally put him down. With the cheers of the people watching me i quitted the game and uninstalled it as fast as I could. 155+ hours on that on faith character and 208 level ups, I am done with this game and i will not play it again, the anger, the anxiety, the pressure, the relentless nightmare, it is finally over... It's ok I guess for a game. It's not just simple like, or didn't like this game, not a simple yes or no, positive or negative review, its just to complex. Its a game that is more about the journey from start to finish and what you do during your adventure. My journey was one with joy, excitement, trauma, sweat and tears. And I'm happy for finally beating the game and not having to pick it up again.                                               ---------------Afterthought---------------This review is now the thing that consumes me, I have edited it 3 times already, and I can not stop thinking about it. Is it enough, does it tell my story, will it help others? Is  this what the game left me with, a curse, a festering rot... a scarlet rot, that will for now and always be on my mind. Did I really beat the game, when I let it defeat me twice, did I really keep true to my faith when I gave up so many times? Maybe it would have been better if I never went back the first time to fight Melenia, I wish I never had, but I will have to live with that, not knowing if I would have lived a happier life without completing the game, and it is draining me...TL;DR:Was forced to play this game by ''acquaintances''. Played the game, could not beat a boss because of my fate build, didn't play again until right before the DLC was released, killed the boss that gave me trouble, went into the DLC same thing happened with the last boss, didn't want to change my build just because I couldn't beat a boss, left it again. forced back in, killed the boss and uninstalled it as fast as i would, will never play again (I hope)."
Positive,"Would it really surprise you to hear gamers that the GOTY 2022 is worth your time?   Quite simply put, a triumph in gaming. The most interesting open world since Red Dead 2 & Witcher 3. The best combat in any souls game before. The amount of weapons & class building options are insane. I love this game so much. I'm not even close to being finished with it yet, so I am looking forward to writing a more in depth review once I have finished all of the content. >Update. The more I keep playing, the more I love this game. It's so much fun and has an insane amount of replay value. I have started playing with my younger brother and progressing in my own world mostly solo but then bouncing over to his to help him do the same dungeons/side quests/escapades that I have finished in my own game. It has really stretched out my first playthrough in the Lands Between to a massive one! Also trying to get every weapon/quest done you can before finishing your first playthrough makes it a colossal amount of content. It's great. If you loved games like Skyrim (The first time it was released) & you maybe have been feeling games not 'aw-ing' you as much as they use to then I think maybe you're missing something like this in your life & you couldn't go wrong buying Elden Ring."
Positive,"FromSoftware has refined their formula and successfully applied it to an open world format, raising the bar and setting a new standard for the genre in the process. Building on the strengths of its predecessors while drawing inspiration from other games, ELDEN RING is a superlative example of open world action role-playing and environmental storytelling.Highly recommended for those that appreciate challenging combat and enjoy exploration. The critical acclaim is well deserved, the negative criticism is mostly due to technical issues, which I thankfully did not experience much of (more on that later).ELDEN RING includes features from previous Souls games: messages, competitive invasions, cooperative summoning, bloodstains, and phantoms.An introduction to the multiplayer system can be found on the publisher's website here:https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-introduction-the-multiplayer-systemOnline/offline can be toggled via in-game settings. Switching between online/offline does not require restarting the game, but does require returning to the main menu.I'm running the game on Arch Linux with an AMD Ryzen 5 2600 and NVIDIA GTX 1060 6GB. On the High preset, frame rates were in the 30-40 range with occasional dips. Medium preset allowed for frame rates in the 50s with fewer dips. I'm using Feral Interactive's GameMode to boost performance. The game runs a lot better than I expected. https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode#gamemodeInitially, the game failed to launch due to EAC. As of March 5th this has been fixed. The game is now fully functional online with EAC enabled on Linux.If you have issues with EAC, you can disable it by renaming the exe files in the game's directory as follows:Rename start_protected_game.exe to start_protected_game.exe.backupRename eldenring.exe to start_protected_game.exeThat will allow the game to run, albeit only in offline mode.On Windows, fullscreen mode defaults to 60Hz refresh rate, even if the screen refresh rate is set higher. Run the game in borderless windowed mode or use mods to remove the 60Hz limitation. (This issue does not affect Linux.)Frame rate is capped at 60 FPS by default. Use Elden Ring FPS Unlocker (Windows) or Elden Ring Proton Patcher (Linux) to uncap it.https://github.com/uberhalit/EldenRingFpsUnlockAndMorehttps://github.com/gurrgur/er-patcherNote that most mods will require disabling EAC.

Positive,"I mean, it's alright, like... overrated af in my opinion, I mean... You know what though, that's typically how the booschitt goes, you feel me...10/10"
Positive,Some people ask if Elden Ring is worth playing? Are you worthy enough to play Elden Ring?!?
Positive,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
Positive,▰▰▰▰▰▰▰▰▰▰ - 10/10
Positive,"Game is great. I'm only putting the negative review because it crashes a lot. In the 4 hours I've been playing, it's crashed about 3 times, annoying me enough to write this. Other than that, the game is awesome, just poorly optimized for pc I'd wager (no surprise there given FromSoftware's history with pc ports).Edit: switched to recommended because they've fixed the crashes apparently. Music is 10/10. Voice acting is one of the best I've ever heard in a FromSoft title. Combat is fluid and, to some extent, intuitive; same thing with Torrent's mechanics (the horse). Many easter eggs and content to look for. I've played over 20 hours and I haven't even beaten the 1st story boss because I've dedicated myself to exploring first. Dungeons are awesome and bring you back to that classic Soulsborne feel aka no horseback fighting or fast travel at any time. Overall, a solid 10/10 for me for many reasons, even new players have found themselves hooked on this whilst older players of the series, like myself, are delighted to get more from FromSoftware's games."
Positive,This game is an instant classic!
Positive,"I personally haven't experienced any of the performance or controller issues I've seen so many people speak of, despite running it on 5 year old hardware. And without spoiling anything, this game is exactly what i hoped it would be."
Positive,"I hated Elden Ring, I gave it 24 hours on my first try and concluded the game was too hard, the controls were terrible and the whole thing was confusing and unfriendly to non souls like players and I never touched it for many months after that. However there was always a nagging feeling that I should try this game again so besides trusted friends' opinions, I also started Remnant 2 and found I enjoyed the difficulty and it reminded me of Elden Ring... so here we are. It turns out ER has one of the most impressive open worlds I have ever experienced in a game. It never holds your hand and it gives you nothing for free, in fact you will have to endure a lot of pain to progress and start to feel like you are not dying to literally everything you encounter. Quests and storylines are not laid out plainly on the map for you, there are no markers for the next tower or collectable and important areas can be so hard to find to the extent some are behind invisible walls most people would miss.The more you discover the more you realise how absolutely massive this game is, in fact there is an entire world underground that is almost a game in itself and there were so many times I had to just stop in awe of a new area that opened up to me simply from wandering almost aimlessly and the game rewards this kind of exploration. There are only very subtle indicators as to where the game suggests you should go but it mostly allows you to just explore and put yourself in areas you are far too weak (or strong late game) to be in. They really made something that completely rejects the standardised open world formula we have become accustomed to and while it can be immensely challenging and confusing, it is also very rewarding and made me want to explore every area and check every corner to see what I might find. I can’t recall the last AAA dev made game that made me want to explore so much because the world itself was just so fascinating (even if some creatures are repeated throughout). No wonder many mainstream devs hated on ER so much, it really shows up their boring and safe standardised formula  The sound is amazing and I particularly liked the voice acting of some bosses who use what I can best describe as Biblical terminology that really fits in with the demi-God characters. Though many of the human characters mouths flap around rather than in time with their dialogue which is pretty lazy. While the graphics are not next gen, they do a great job of making the most of what they have with some truly breathtaking scenery that had me hitting the screenshot key many times. However the game defaults to 60FPS on PC which is a joke in the 2020's. There is also no ultrawide support and while they added Ray Tracing that looks really nice, even at its lowest setting I found it wasn't worth running as the impact on performance is brutal and they didn't add DLSS/FSR to help and it isn't like I am running this on a low end system. So is ER absolute perfection as the fanboys would have you believe? Well....no, no it isn't. Minor issues first; the controls for PC are a lot better than earlier souls games I have tried (and refunded) but they are still quite awkward, which I guess is why a lot of people recommended I use a controller. The lock on system is mostly fine but at times it forces weird camera angles, or will lock on to a goat or flying insect rather than the enemy wrecking your face. Also, why did they make it so if you want to resurrect Torrent (your horse) mid battle, it asks you if you want to use a petty flask and defaults to NO lmao?! So mid fight you have to choose to bring torrent back, quickly press arrow key to select YES, then wait a second or two for Torrent to come back! I died so many times to this stupid confirmation mechanic alone. I also hate how you cant view the map if a random enemy has you in sight. I get that they probably want to stop you from fast travelling out of bad situations you get in to but why cant I at least view the map to find out where the hell I am? It brings back memories of the mud crabs in Skyrim where a random one you cant see would spot you and prevent you from fast travelling until you tracked it down. Can we all just agree that the key for the map in RPG games should always be 'M' rather than G? Now to the controversial part that many get very upset with if anyone dares to mention it - the difficulty. Now I knew this game would be challenging and indeed it is but some of the boss fights, particularly later on, felt for me that they crossed a line from being difficult to just plain frustrating and very un-fun. Also some of these bosses are repeated (the strongest ones aren't thankfully) and/or doubled up which just feels cheap and lazy to me. Some of their moves are so difficult to react to and can one shot you, doing the same boss fight dozens of times over may be others idea of fun but it certainly isn't mine. At times it felt difficult for the sake of being difficult, rather than providing interesting strategies from bosses in each encounter. Again the lock on system can put your camera in very unfortunate positions, so it can be a case of toggling that on and off to get around it. Bosses attacks frequently clip through walls or pillars etc and in a game this difficult, I feel being hit from behind a concrete object (or even one shot killed) is pretty damn frustrating. Some of these bosses gate-keep you from progressing further in the story and while I agree there should not be an 'easy mode' I do think it is a shame that 2/3 of players appear to give up if achievements are any indication. It's a shame because there are a lot of late game areas that are just as amazing as ones earlier on but many will never seem them and to be honest I totally understand why some would say screw this and quit the game. They do allow co-op, summons and NPC allies to assist in fights but as a solo player many will struggle without additional help. While apparently far better than previous souls games, there can be occasions where you have an annoyingly long trek back to a boss fight. The 'Stakes of Marika' are apparently new additions that act as close spawn points after boss fight deaths and they are great but there were several fights where I had to trek annoyingly far and when you die over and over that gets a bit tiresome.It was only through perseverance and grim determination that I managed to get through ER, my first true full souls experience. Even at this point I have items in my inventory I do not know what they do, character story-lines I have no idea if I finished or not and mechanics I don't really fell I fully understood. There is a reason people have 1000+ hours in what is essentially a single player game - the depth is staggering. I have tried to do every non-essential boss and quest and complete everything possible (though I will copy/paste my 90% save game to get all endings) but I am sure I have still missed countless hours of content. Elden Ring has been one of the most challenging, infuriatingly frustrating, yet mind-blowingly beautiful and memorable gaming experiences I have ever had (hence the long rant lol). While it is not perfect I feel if you have the patience and persistence, it is one of the most rewarding gaming experiences ever and it makes me want to go back and revisit previous souls games. I am so glad I gave Elden Ring a second chance!"

Positive,"I love this game. The atmosphere, art direction and exploration is amazing. The difficulty is just right to me - I don't have good reflexes, but the freedom the game offers allowed me to still beat all of the bosses. Lots of fun builds and tools are available to play around with. If you struggle you can always prepare items or summon a spirit ash to help yourself out. You can even respec your whole character stats - great QoL there!"
Positive,"Wow, I simply cannot do this game any justice by attempting to write a review on how incredible this game is but I will try my best.Elden Ring is an enormous game with so much for the player to discover, even now 200 hours in I myself am still finding new hidden areas and secret bosses/quests I've missed in other playthroughs.As someone who is completely new to Souls games I was slightly nervous coming into Elden Ring after hearing the difficulty of certain bosses and areas however being an Open World game and allowing the user to go to different areas, level up or just come back later gives any new player a fair chance and doesn't make certain encounters unbearable like other games from the souls genre.Personally I find the graphics, lore, characters, storyline all to be 10/10. Elden Ring doesn't just feel like a game, it's a story where you a Maidenless Tarnished rise up the ranks slaying Gods, Legends and Shardbearers to become an Elden Lord but will you go for a happy ending? Maybe you like destruction and chaos and want to see the world burn, Elden Ring lets you decide the fate of the lands between.I'd highly recommend this game to any souls fan as it's proclaimed as the best in the genre ever, any open world game fan as there's so much to explore whether it's dungeons, caves, forests, mountains or any gamer who likes a challenge. Want to test yourself against some of the hardest bosses in gaming? Try Malenia on for size.In conclusion this game stands alongside Skyrim as my favourite game I've ever played and it truly is an 11/10."
Positive,"Elden Ring is undoubtedly a generation defining game. It turns the open world meta on its head, removing the pointless filler quests and NPCs that make you get things for them that they really should be getting for themselves. Exploration is encouraged and rewarded. You aren't held to a linear path, and if you 'git gud' you can take on end game bosses while hugely underleveled.The world is beautiful - it might not have the best graphics, but the art direction is incredible. I've often found myself on a cliff edge just looking out at the view, seeing how far I've travelled and how far I've still got to go.Combat is challenging, but once you've learned an enemies move set and figure out how to beat it, there's a real sense of achievement. You can beat any boss with any build so you can play the game how you want. If you don't want to take the time to learn a move set then a cheese is usually available. Enemies are numerous and varied, and you won't get bored fighting the same enemy over and over again. Even where enemies are copy-paste jobs, they generally have an additional attack that you weren't expecting as you progress in the game which adds to the flavour. A common criticism is that the game has no story, but it does, it just isn't given to you. You need to go looking for the story and complete side quests to understand the implications of your actions and how the characters fit together. There's also a lot of 'visual storytelling' in the game, and taking in the world around you helps to understand what's happening in any particular area. There are a couple of negatives - it could do with a few quality of life improvements, e.g. a more liberal use of map markers and slightly better menu navigation and sorting options. There are also some small balancing issues later in the game, and one particular boss with a specific move that relies a little too much on RNG to get past.These issues don't take away from what Elden Ring is. It's a masterpiece and you should play it."

Positive,Its Kinda Funny Cuz it's only been 2 months since 2022 started and i already know the Game Of The Year ResultsUpdate : now that i've spent over 300 hours on this game i can really say that i (almost) enjoyed every second of it which is rare for someone like meHere's the things that i hated the mostsometimes when you not even fighting anything you can't access the map cuz somewhere something is agro on you and you gotta wait for it to leave you alone or find it and kill it .Weapons are not balanced yet (for both pvp and pve) which is fine cause the game just droppedLow fps and stutters on some of the most important open world areas ( i got a 3060 btw and my friend has a 6900 xt which is equal to 3090 and even he's getting drops) You can't ride on mounts in Coop Mode .I think that's all that i remember for now tbh the game is perfect and beautiful at the same time its not even a game at this point it's an Art it has some issues that every new released game had Especially an RPG Game and its Hopefully gonna get fixed soon and i don't know what other people that disliked the game expected from a newly released fromsoftware/bandai namco (souls like open world) gameThat's All

Positive,"Comparing this game to other FromSoftware products one aspect after another it’s clear that Elden Ring isn’t as smooth as Sekiro, doesn’t have bosses like Dark Souls, and its story isn’t as good as Bloodborne, but looking this way at anything will make no sense, you simply do not order salad in Subway and then put one star review saying that they refused to sell you a salad.Elden Rings lore and story.Game’s still fresh, Vaatividya still works on lore, and so far we barely can piece together coherent explanation to what happened before we set foot in Lands Between. It offers some similarities to ideas that Dark Souls used before, and it’s open for speculations as much.As for the story of the game, we’re thrown in fractured world only hundred years after The Shattering, war that no demigod came out victorious leaving Lands Between in stalemate. We’re tarnished, once stripped from the grace of Greater Will and exiled, coming back to Lands Between, resurrected and yet again guided by the very grace we were stripped from, with one goal – to become the Elden Lord.World of Elden Ring.To summarize how big Lands Between are I will say only this: there’s always more.Elden Ring world is made up from five main parts on surface level, this already sounds like enormous place. But wait, there’s more – each part has legacy dungeons, big structures that player can get lost for hours and still be surprised revisiting the place. There are also catacombs, minor erdtrees, ruins, villages, and so on. It is very densely packed and it gives hours upon hours of additional content to go through. Still not enough? There is literally 3 major underground locations, each bigger than the last one. And for the dessert - whole legacy dungeon floating above the sea near the coastline of Lands Between.It is big, but is it pleasant to look at??To answer that we can go back and look at last two games made by FromSoftware, Sekiro and Dark Souls 3, and precisely Fountainhead Palace and Irithyll of the Boreal Valley. FromSoftware seems to like dragging players through countless swamps and catacombs, difficult bosses, and whatnot to build up the hatred towards another location that we might need to go through to finish the game, and then every negative emotion leaves the body, because we’re presented with what’s called ‘the best area in the game aesthetically’, that’s the case with Irithyll, that’s the case with Fountainhead palace, and that’s the case with… nearly every legacy dungeon in Elden Ring. Progressing through the world of this game is like going the best location in one souls game to another best location from different game. I think there also is beauty in elevation, and Elden Ring does exceptional job at that too. Lands Between are not flat, they’re constantly changing elevation as we progress through the game, but not only between main parts of the map, also between locations in those parts. FromSoftware creates dark fantasy and I, personally, think that currently there’s no one in the industry better at doing so.Gameplay of Elden Ring.The most important part for some, especially if advertised as ACTION RPG. Just a reminder, you’re Tarnished, a nobody with a simple task to become the Elden Lord, against various demigods, with a stick and wooden shield. The game is not easy. It is not the hardest FromSoftware game, but it’s still hard, especially for newcomers.What to expect? Dying, a lot. Elden Ring, like any From game has no difficulty slider, there’s one difficulty – Get Gud. Fortunately for Tarnished, Elden Ring provides a lot of different mechanics to ease the pain such as: magic, summons, broken status buildup (bleed, cold), co-op, cheesing, and last, but not least (for PC) – modding. There already are mods to change the difficulty by lowering health and attack damage of nearly everything in Elden Ring. To experience the game the best way though is to go through it yourself, learn to fight, optimize your build and try again, because there’s no better feeling in FromSoftware games than beating hard boss yourself.Will you get bored? I don’t think there’s a chance to get bored in this game, even with such simple combat mechanics, because there’s also variety of builds, with easily over 200, probably even more weapons, over 100 armor sets for your fresh Elden Bling, and many more configurations with new addition – Ashes of War. If that’s not enough, let’s talk about variety of enemies. Remember seeing total of 19 enemies in God of War from 2018, winner of Game of the Year? There’s over 140 unique enemy types in the game that are vastly different from each other (except for reskins, not many of them though). Also, rats are back, now with madness status to make your life even more miserable. There’s actually a lot of enemies that you will hate with passion, you will go on reddit and vent about it, and you will see that vast majority of players also hate them.I am Malenia, Blade of Ashina, and hasitation is defeat.TLDR : The game is the only rightful choice for Game of the Year."

Positive,mmm Melina mommy
Positive,"Game improved a lot since release date, no more stutters or crashes. I haven't had a single fps drop down for the last 30 hours of gameplay. Game is awesome and runs smoothly now. Worth playing it!"
Positive,THE ELDEN RING!   THE ELDEN RING IS REAL!
Positive,"Since nobody will see this,i'm gay and like my ass getting destroyed"
Positive,"I'm playing this at 900x600 on a 1050 laptop card at 30 fps, and it's one of the best games I've ever played. So much fun, a combination of the best bits of every Souls/Bloodborne/Sekiro game. Probably my game of the year.10/10 would get booby-trapped warped to slave mine again."
Positive,"Not the best combat out there, you will die, and i mean, a lot. Elden Ring is so rewarding, so fulfilling.You will have to go back and forth multiple times, because you are probably under-level, but that's why this game is so unique and special. I never thought i would like souls-like games, but exploring this open-world is something i have never seen in any other videogame ever before. it is truly remarkable.Every location you explore is incredibly built and designed, with tons of secrets, hidden places and doors, multiple precious items, and incredible views to see.I truly think everyone should play this game, atleast once, in his life, it is simply incredible, something taken from fantasy books.Just have in mind that you're most of the times, the victim. You will have to farm EXP, kill a lot of mobs, get good gear and upgrade it, until you get stronger, in order to go into new areas of the map, search a lot online, you will probably need it, as zones have level caps, but this game wont tell you anything, literally, anything, but well... i guess that's the beauty of it.Be patient, do not rush enemies, study their moves and patterns first, then take your move and kill them, dodge or parry exactly in the last second, remember, this is Elden Ring, exploration is key, if you cant beat an enemy, do not worry, come back later.For 3 times i thought to myself, i m not ever playing this again, but i was wrong."
Positive,"Overall, Elden Ring was a positive experience for me. The variety of spells and equipment it offers and the amount of builds you can do makes it one of those games worth revisiting despite its length, while the non-linear structure of the open world allows you to make your new adventure flow completely different from the previous one. Unfortunately, Elden Ring is not without its issues, and at least for me personally, there's quite many. I won't go into every detail since I admit that a lot of them may come down to a preference, but here's two big problems I believe most people who've also played the game will agree on:- By the second half of your playthrough it will become very noticable how the game almost crumbles under its own size, which results in repeating enemies, dungeons and bosses (not to mention the fact that FromSoftware already reuse some of the content from their previous games). I understand that it was a compromise to keep the world as big as it is, but it also doesn't make interacting with those on repeating encounters any less dull. - The quest system in this game is pure nonsense (and no, this isn't me advocating for the introduction of quest markers). First, in many cases, once you progress a quest to the next stage, the NPC you're looking for will move to a completely different place on the map without giving you even a slight indication where to find them. Secondly, the directions they give you for their tasks are often vague at best too and often you won't even realize you did or found something that can prompt another interaction (e.g. Sorceress Sellen's quest line). Basically, the probability of you finishing some of the quests in Elden Ring comes down to pure luck, unless you're following a guide. It's the opposite extreme I'm not a fan of, but FromSoftware pretty much force you to choose between the two. I could go on and on about the issues I listed above, as well as some of the more subjective ones, but I think this review is long enough as it is. Like I said in the beginning, I had a good time with Elden Ring, and despite its problems, I think the game is well worth your time and the asking price."
Positive,"If you're looking for a detailed and comprehensive review of Elden Ring, you've come to the wrong place. Instead, here is a recipe for some really good chocolate chip cookies.- 2 1/4 All-purpose flour- 1 teaspoon baking soda- 1/2 teaspoon salt- 1 cup butter, softened- 3/4 cup granulated sugar- 3/4 cup packed brown sugar- 1 egg- 1 teaspoon vanilla- 2 cups chocolate chunksHeat oven to 375°F. In small bowl, mix flour, baking soda and salt; set aside.In large bowl, beat softened butter and sugars with electric mixer on medium speed, or mix with spoon about 1 minute or until fluffy, scraping side of bowl occasionally.Beat in egg and vanilla until smooth. Stir in flour mixture just until blended (dough will be stiff). Stir in chocolate chunks.Onto ungreased cookie sheets, drop dough by rounded tablespoonfuls 2 inches apart.Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until light brown (centers will be soft). Cool 2 minutes; remove from cookie sheet to cooling rack. Cool completely, about 30 minutes. Store covered in airtight container.Enjoy!"
Positive,"Do you know what's worst about this game, apart from the repetitive bosses and toxic players? The open world. And basically, Elden Ring can be your first, easiest or most difficult game from FromSoftware and it's up to you which solution you choose. It took me a while to understand that I don't have to run where the site of grace shows me and I don't have to fight every mob or small boss I meet on my way. There are so many elements that allow us to trivialize the game and bring it to a critical state where we can defeat the boss on the first try (and the game becomes easy at this point, maybe too easy), there are so many easily accessible items scattered around the map, just waiting for you to find and collect them. That's why the experiences of Elden Ring players differ so dramatically and it turns out later that someone completed the game with a weapon that wasn't fully upgraded, walked only on the main bosses and only on 6 Estuses, and I could explore, look for side bosses, upgrade my weapon to the maximum level and the number and power of Estuses and have no major problem completing the game and the experience is immediately uneven. This only shows that the game can be difficult, but it doesn't have to be. As I got more and more interested in the game, I easily noticed that part of the Elden Ring community is a kind of... special social group of sweaty little guys who have epileptic seizures when you say that you defeated the boss using summons or generally didn't do it the way they did, which means probably harder, with no hit and with a stick. People are able to insult you up to 3 generations back for using normal mechanics in the game, which are absolutely not forbidden and are optional. Gamer culture is pure rot and no matter how you play, people will always find a problem with something.This game has quite a lot of lore and it will take us some time to understand all of it and it will allow us to understand how much we could have missed while playing the game, but it will also allow us to understand the stories of the characters we have to face in the fight. The way Elden Ring is told requires reading items, listening to all the dialogues with understanding and connecting the dots, and yet most players will end up on VaatiVidyj's channel looking for the meaning of the fight with a given boss. But in a nutshell, Elden Ring is really a big family problem.However, I don't think Elden Ring would be a good Soulslike for someone who has not had anything to do with this genre of games before, because I think the open world can quite easily overwhelm and lose a new player and also make each subsequent Soulslike seem too easy or too difficult. It's all depends how you'll be playing this game. boje się eldeniarzy"
Positive,I would give my grandma's virginity to play this game for the first time again
Positive,"first die, then 100%"
Positive,your messages are not funny
Positive,"In all honesty I think the game is great... played it a year or two ago and completed it. It was super fun with all the different  builds  you can do and all the endings to go along with it. There are plenty of boss fights with different sort of weakness, while you also have yours.Along with what I've stated above, I would also say it's fun because of the open world and caves you can discover and off course the lore of the game.The Elden Beast boss fightDesign and phase aside, a lot of players mostly took issue with the mechanics of the Elden Beast. The boss, is large, moves constantly from one side of the arena to another. Literally, makes most of the fight require the player to chase the boss rather than fight it. At a distance, the boss can also spam spell attacks. Which makes it super unpleasant to fight. The CommunityI think there's an amount of players and fans who are cool, but sadly I would have to say that it's ruined because of brain-dead people who tell you what's the right type of way to play and have some sort of god-complex over a video game. Most of Dark Souls community over the years have been known for being egotistical, narcissistic and think that they are above other players because they are playing a different build or whatever. Grow upConclusionIf you can avoid the type of players above, I would recommend this game 100%. As I said in the first paragraph, for the open world and all different ways to play, I think this game has a lot of replayability and I don't think one stupid boss fight should ruin that experience.Get the game and stay away from cringe lords."

Positive,Open world bits get a bit choppy and the game definitely needs some serious optimization on PC. That said the dungeons perform okay and the game has been fun so far.
Positive,"Elden Ring is a fantastic open world Souls game with amazing design, bosses, and the environment itself. But what makes this game truly the best is there are cats in this game! You can encounter multiple cats in various areas, find items related to cats, and the best part is that cats are part of the lore, which is why I consider this game to be the best cat game! Let's hope there will be even more cats in the DLC <3"
Positive,"Lots of content, bosses, and weapons. Great replay-ability with the variety of builds you can create. Worth $60. Had 100+ hours on my first play through, and 100 more on the DLC. If you like souls games then this game is a gem to play."

Positive,"An absolute 10/10 must play masterpiece! From the world and enemy design, to the mysterious bits of history you piece together as you journey through the game, everything is dripping with consideration and meticulous world building. Top three games of ALL time. This game has fundamentally changed open world games forever. Allow yourself to get lost in it's world, it's lore, and it's gameplay and you will not be disappointed. Do yourself a favour and buy this, discounted or not. It is worth every penny several times over. Bravo FromSoft!"
Positive,"I cannot recommend the game right now, fps inconsistency and heavy stuttering are giving me headache and nausea. Such a shame, as it is probably one of the best games ever released ...Edit (Patch 1.03.2): After some updates and getting used to stutters and drops (which are less common than at launch), it is one of the best game ever released, but still lacking optimization."
Positive,This game brings me back to my childhood of having games that were frustrating and difficult but very  rewarding once you figure out how to advance past something you've been stuck on.  The challenge along with the variety of ways you can play this game and the absolute beauty of the world and story make this game one of my favorites and one I can see myself playing over and over again.
Positive,"The best Souls game to come out in years and a masterpiece that may rival even Skyrim and Witcher 3. This is the ultimate love letter to Berserk, Game of Thrones, Middle Earth as well as several other fantasy myths. I love the scope and scale of this world and at times it feels like you are inside a painting. Gameplay is challenging enough and that is expected. The lore is also pretty solid. There is enough content to last you dozens of hours per playthrough with several different builds.No doubt this will be talked about for a long time alongside the countless memes and references. The best game to come out this year so far. Only downside is EAC but that can be disabled if you want offline mode. Hoping BLOODBORNE comes to Steam someday!!!!"
Positive,"If you like Dark Souls: Elden Ring is just like Dark Souls, but with more Dark Souls in the Dark Souls.EDIT:After beating the game twice and working on a 3rd play through. 200+ hours in, I have to say...It's pretty good."

Positive,dogshit game tbh
Positive,"It's perfect, now stop reading the reviews and play Elden Ring.Edit: of course it wins GOTY, its the best."
Positive,"REVIEWS AND SUGGESTIONSLore : 9/10Graphics : 8.7/10A.I: 9/101) Start with 10 classes to choose.- Each class got different stats which some of them are requirements to certain weapons and spells (incantations & sorceries).- Don't worry about character creation and default armor from each class, u can change them later without any cost.2) MASSIVE world!!!- Roam freely unless need certain key or story progress to proceed.- You're able to fight anything, any creatures, any bosses as long as u can handle it based on your skills.- Doesn't matter where you roam, try to reach any possible reach area since there might be hidden items, armor, weapon or bosses (rare reward).- Look for caves or dungeons, some of them need Stone Key to access or covered with illusion wall (roll to to break them).- Take your time, enjoy your journey, its really massive world, I won't spoil anything. :)3) Game mechanics- I can tell its like Dark Souls + Sekiro + Nioh 2.- Any action cost stamina like running while in battle, rolling, attack & guarding(unless your shield strong esfakk).- A lot of useful items, be sure to check them in your inventory or crafting recipe. Some of them(dropped items) are exclusively for the boss.- Perfect hitbox, it doesn't hit u unless its REALLY hit you, sweet dream for DBD players.- U can dodge roll, guard or parry incoming attacks. But not all attacks are parry-able, its not like Sekiro where u can even parry shockwave or giant snake bite with your godly indestructible tiny 'toothpick'.4) Currency, upgrade and level up- Runes can be obtain by killing something or sell something to smithy.- U will left your Runes near your death location and u will lost it if u died again while failed to re-obtained them. Almost like Nioh 2.- U can upgrade ur weapons only, but 'mild' upgrade for certain armor by Alter at any Grace (checkpoint).-- Normal weapon need Smithing Stone to upgrade, need more of these, max at level 25.-- Special or boss weapon need Somber Smithing Stone, need one for each level, max at level 10.- You'll need more Runes as your level goes up.5) Coop and PvP- Coop max 3 players. One party leader and 2 supports.- Coop PvE limitations; -- Coop PvE can't be fully roam like solo session, you can't summon your horse or use any Spirit Ash Summons (NPC assistant).-- Can't walk together go inside cave or dungeon. For this you and your friends must went there(beyond blocked border in in PvE) on your/their own first, unlock the checkpoint and prepare for multiplayer summons.-- Only party leader can obtain or pickup rewards.-- Assistants will be send back to their world if the party leader died.- For PvP;- Invaders can initiate PvP by invading random players. Beware newbies for they will coming for you at 'low level' checkpoints.- I'm not sure if their server is not that good or the invaders internet connection, but most of the time I go against laggy invader. Are you playing from the moon mate?! And spamming that Moonveil spell? Coincidence? I think not!!6) It could be better if;- We can have equipment loadout so its easier for us to change to different builds.- Layered armor for fashion epic adventures.- Better equipment upgrades and drop rates for NG+ to match against tankier bosses or they should have additional deadly moveset for higher levels.- Option to automatically skip watched cutscenes, specially for final boss.Bonus:1) Use Rainbow Stone to measure your jump height to see if you can survive the fall, I know there a lot of message told us to ""Try jump"" while there a lot of blood spot around it. If the stone landed fine, then its fine for u too, but if it shattered, it means you'll die.2) Also spend your runes on Vigor stat, don't just focused on damage unless you're a parry master, Ongbal. That guy reflect is really good! Do pay him a visit if you don't mind about spoilers. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdGyaKUgO9hM2C0cH-Xe8LQ3) I prefer to free aim giant bosses instead of lock on, its easier since lock on will messed up your camera.4) You can use a weapon with 2 hands for better damage and use weapons for both hands as long as its the same type.5) Don't savagely kill any with dialogues you've met, most of them redirect to subquest with better rewards.6) You can begins NG+ once you want more 'spicyness', please note that starting NG+ will reset all of your checkpoints and lost all key items, means that you must obtain them again.7) Don't stress if you died multiple times, we all the same. HahahaOnce we familiar with their move, then we own them.I'm currently in NG+6, trying all options in NPCs subquest, they begin to hit harder now, while I need a lot of runes for my level. lolIts been a very long time since I'm enjoyed this much, this masterpiece is really worth the hype , I think its easily the GOTY,Thank you and well done FromSoftware!!"
Positive,Foul Tarnished. In search of the Elden Ring.
Positive,bro this game gave me a foot fetish
Positive,This is what you get when you mix darksouls 3 and skyrim i think this is what amazon was trying to do with new world. amaizing game :)
Positive,"So Elden Ring is my first souls-like game that i have ever gotten 100% achievements...AND IT WAS AMAZING!!! this is the best game i have ever played and i loved every minute of playing it! the story the world the characters I LOVED ALL OF IT! i felt like a kid in a candyshop except the storeowner and everyone in the shop is trying to kill me as i keep dodging them trying to steal candy for myself giggling wildly to myself as i have gone mad from being touched by a giant burned and smoldering hand that only has three fingers, but hey at least i get some awesome looking eyes! so yeah i can't wait for the dlc to come out! this game get's a golden 10/10 from me!"
Positive,"Having a dark souls game as an actual open world was always a dream for me, I can only complain of the game performance being the only issue that I struggle to play with, especially if I want to try and play online with a friend or help people.I have spent already around 60+ hour simply just lost the track of the main story or the main path of the game events, just roaming around exploring every ruins,caves and buildings, simply to get weapons armors, skills and what so ever.I finally decided to go on the main path, and I been highly addicted to just wake up and have some exploring around the game world, I quite recommend everyone to give Elden Ring a try, the difficulty can spike a little at some areas, I can say more than previous Dark Souls series, but it's doable, the game is quite friendly to new souls players who hasn't played previous titles as well. In short this is defo Game of the year.Updated!You can simply play and be anything you wish to be in here, with more options to rebuild your character.I will give even a more detailed review about the game as a whole when I finally decide to finish it, which I doubt it will be anytime soon.."
Positive,"So, the game in my opinion is fantastic and I do not regret buying it, but it does have some severe flaws which the community defends with their lives.I'm not great at writing reviews so forgive me.ProLarge worldOpen worldRan flawlessly on my system at 4k, though I have a 4090 and 13900k so that's not saying muchWeapon selectionMultiple combat stylesGreat charactersBeautiful scenery and graphical modelsSense of progressionMultiple endingsConsEndings were basically the same and very short, very underwhelming after 100 or so hours of gameplay.The inventory system is the worst I have seen in a long time, very difficult to compare item statistics. Despite their insistence on weight being a major part of the mechanics you seem to be able to carry every weapon and armour i the game on your person. I actually didn't realise having ""heavy weight"" was severely limiting my dodge mechanic until 10 hours in at which point the game became significantly easier.I found the consumables in the game generally useless. I ended up using a small lantern for dark areas and health potions. The other items I just hoarded without feeling the need to use them.I listed weapon and armour selection as a pro but I found that I didn't really use them. My starter armor (vanguard) and an early game sword carried me through the entire game. Differences between the armour seemed mostly aesthetic.I didn't really feel I had the opportunity to play with other styles of combat due to heavily investing in my current style of gameplay. Yes you get the option to respec later in the game but by that point I was comfortable and didn't want to suddenly change to a spell caster from melee combat despite the ridiculous amount of spells I was obtaining.No journal or list of completed objectives. Some people can't be glued to the game day after day, there is no excuse for this missing ui element especially due to the very poor quest line progression, and to have it is not ""hand holding"".Little to no guidance on npc questlines, despite what people say on the forums. You can accidentally find an NPC in a random location, get perhaps a hint off them of a quest line and if you are lucky you will encounter the next part of the quest but then not realise its a part of a quest! These quests may only be completed in some scenarios once you have discovered 90% of the game by which time you may have even forgotten the interaction with the npc at the start of the game.You can inadvertently lock yourself out of certain quest progression, miss it completely or with lack of guidance break the quest or fail it instantly. I will give you one example which may be a slight spoiler but it demonstrates the point well. There is a non human npc that wishes to become human, the npc attains this goal and when you chance upon this npc and try to interact with them you get three dots ""..."", rest at a site next to this npc and they will be dead. I looked this up online and it turns out you have to get a random item from a specific set of circumstances which you must activate next to the npc to prevent this. Completely random with no guidance. There is also another major npc at the start of the game you can miss because the only way to find them is to perform an in game emote (which you first have to obtain) at a certain location.Then there is the fact I almost completely missed a major section of the game. The haligtree is a separate area which is optional, to get to this area you must use a medallion at a certain location which is also used with another medallion to progress the main questline. It is not obvious at all that you must use your d-pad to switch medallions to get to the optional area. I even think I missed this as I didn't have the haligtree medallion complete at this point and location became useless after you discover the next bonfire. Again I only discovered this as I approached the last boss of the game and was confused about not encountering certain bosses. A game SHOULD NOT require you to look up questlines online, even if the community defends it by saying ""you should be more observant"", ""you should keep a notepad and write things down"", what ridiculous statements.The start of the game is incredibly difficult (I don't mind this, I actually enjoy it), but once you start levelling and getting used to common enemy animations the game becomes progressively easier to the point of tedium, with the exception of bosses which are compensated with much larger health pools or difficult to dodge AOE attacks.I didn't really dabble in much pvp. I tried it a couple of times as I was forced to from single player content but I ended up being almost 1 shot everytime so I'm not sure what's going on there. That experience put me off exploring that aspect of the game completely.I wish there were some npcs I could enjoy consistently interacting with or keeping the company of. There are a couple of npcs I liked but interaction felt shallow. End game none of the npcs really mattered with the exception of your maiden or if you were going with a specific ending."
Positive,"Performance is unreliable, but 95% of the time you're good. It seems that after a long playtime, performance levels out. I've heard from Digital Foundry that performance varies greatly across systems. It's a complete lottery.Performance gives a very bad first impression, the first boss you see will give huge stutters, but after that they become very rare. 7700kRTX 2060 6GB16 GB RAMUtilization well below 100%, all memory types below max and yet it still stutters sometimes, much more in first 2 hours.Made a video to illustrate my exact issue. At this time I wasn't aware that performance got better with time and this was on 1.02.1 on launch day:I would say this is not representative of any other part of the game. The beginning just seems much worse.All in all, really good game, but you get serious burnout at the end because the game is insanely long on first playthrough. Took me 93 hours to complete. The bosses in this are the worst of the souls games except for Dark Souls 2."
Positive,"TLDR:Elden Ring, while imperfect, is the best implementation of an open-world action RPG that I've ever played. It feels like the culmination of every iteration of FromSoft's 'Souls' games into one truly amazing experience filled with intrigue, struggle, and eventual triumph.GENRE:Fantasy, third-person, open world, action RPG, 'Souls' gameGAMEPLAY:Elden Ring is basically Dark Souls 4, or Dark Souls but now you can sneak, jump, and ride a steed around the open world areas. You start by creating a character and choosing a class to determine your starting gear and stats (e.g. Astrologer to be a spellcasting sorcerer, or Samurai to be a katana-weilding DEX melee build). You progress through the game by traveling around the map and finding items/gear to upgrade your equipment setup and defeating enemies to gain 'runes"" that you can spend to level up or buy items from shops.'Sites of grace' are the bonfire equivalents in Elden Ring, and most of the time they visually display a path of light that indicate the direction you need to head in to progress the main story through locations of major bosses. There are plenty of these grace sites littered everywhere in the open world and within dungeons so it is easy to fast travel to where you want to go immediately.Elden Ring is an open world game and there are various minidungeons/secrets hidden away in every corner of the map. It is to your advantage to seek out these locations to find rare materials and unique weaponry that may or may not change your play style altogether. The open world feels like there is always something waiting for you to discover, such as powerful enemies that drop unique weapon arts (ashes of war) or an NPC standing around waiting to offer you a quest. With the introduction of a day/night cycle, there are even some bosses that only spawn at nighttime in specific locations waiting to ambush you, but offer unique drops as well.GRAPHICS/PERFORMANCE:Elden Ring, at launch, was pretty shaky in terms of PC performance. I personally played this game to completion with below minimum specs (AMD FX 6300, RX 480) averaging 40-50 FPS at High settings. I encountered no game-breaking bugs/detrimental FPS hiccups in any playthrough, though the only issue I encountered was that enemies would sometimes become invisible on my screen whenever a large group of enemies were in an area, but they were still lock-on-able and would render again when I got closer/killed some of the group (this is probably just because my CPU is ancient).In terms of graphics, Elden Ring doesn't break new ground when it comes to overall presentation, but it is a very colorful game compared to previous Souls games. You can really tell when you enter a new region when all the colors transition from one palette to another and the sky/landscape dramatically changes as well. Dark areas are also pretty spooky as you can only see far enough from the light of your torch or lantern and enemies hide in the shadows very well.STORY:The long story short is: the Elden Ring was shattered into fragments and various demigods took the pieces to gain the fragmented powers within them. You are a 'Tarnished' which is basically a pseudo-undead human who is guided by grace to seek out the pieces of the Elden Ring, put them back together, and become Elden Lord in order to bring the world back to ""order"". (All of the details in between for NPC's and items is basically found in NPC dialogue and item descriptions for you to piece together, or until a genius puts all of the information together in a YouTube lore video)STRENGTHS:•Combat feels the best it has ever been for 'Souls' games. Sneak attacks, jump attacks, ashes of war, NPC summons, mounted combat, guard counters, power-stancing, and everything else feels very, very good.•Touching more on ashes of war, they basically allow you to add (and remove later) a unique skill to most non-unique weapons in the game. They also allow you to change the scaling of a weapon to a different one of your choice (if you also have the right whetstone) so you can make a weapon scale with INT or FTH even if it originally didn't.•Boss encounters are exciting and challenging. If you feel underprepared, you can always to back to the open world and look for missed locations and items to better prepare yourself. (Also, feel free to use your ash summons whenever possible; it is a game mechanic after all)•You can build a character however you desire, whether it be dual-weilding greatswords, holy knight, melee-spell-casting wizard, or pure archery.•There are lots and lots of weapons to try, leading to more replayability as you try a new one in a future playthrough•The crafting system is interesting as you can create consumables and throwable items when out of combat. You can even create bow/crossbow ammo which is very neat.•Just when you think you're near the end, the map expands further and there is even more to discover.•Compared to the other Dark Souls stories, Elden Ring's story feels the most digestible at face value without feeling completely puzzled from the outset.WEAKNESSES:•PC performance isn't stellar if you are bothered by occasional FPS spikes or the rare game crash on loading screens.•Not game-relevant, but the game doesn't fully ""exit"" when you quit out until a while later.•Early game bosses reappear as 'mini-bosses' or just wandering around later game areas leading to some feelings of reused content.•There is a massive spike in game difficulty from the mid-game to the late-game. It feels weirdly balanced when enemies all of a sudden go from doing 1/5 of your HP in damage to 1/2 of your HP in damage.•UI could use a feature to compare stats of shop items with currently equipped items•Online connectivity can be hit-or-miss. Sometimes when you are summoned to another world, you get a ""connection error"" and the game boots you back to single player.•Be wary of hackers when playing co-op/PVP. Previous exploits have occurred where upon death, you would return to single player but be instantly dying forever because the hacker put you in an endless death loop. That exploit was patched, but we all know how hackers don't just give up.•(Not a negative for me, but maybe if you like PvP): You can only invade other players if they are participating in co-op. Basically, unless a host uses a specific item, invasions usually lead to 1v2 or 1v3 scenarios (note: AFAIK fight clubs are only affected in that # of summonable participants is limited). I don't invade, but I've seen many people whining about this change when it makes sense why it is this way.•So many important names sound very similar to each other that it could be difficult to remember who is who (e.g. Godwyn vs Godfrey vs Godrick).•'Great Runes' are pretty underwhelming in terms of power.•Although I enjoy the game design of not having a dedicated questlog ingame, it is still to your benefit to just read an NPC's quest guide off the wiki to keep yourself on track.NUMERIC SCORE (if you care):9.9/10; easy recommendElden Ring has set my bar for 'open-world RPG' standards. The added gameplay features like jumping, horse-riding, sneaking, etc. make the game's action much more interesting and fun than previous FromSoft games. The game kicks my ass at every step of the way, but the struggle and eventual triumph is worth all of it. Though it is not without fault, I love this game and can't wait for future DLC."
Positive,"I got my brother in to playing this game.  Which is not much of a feat but he seemed dead set against playing a ""Souls"" game.  To be honest, I'm no fan of Souls games either.  But the RPG aspect gave me enough hope to give it a try.  So far I have cursed out loud more times than I care to admit.  This can get real embarassing when you are living in a hotel for work purposes and you come out of your room and people are just like ""What the hell man.""  My brother summed this up this game perfectly.  ""Skyrim on insane difficulty.""  This is the highest praise I think he's given anything. If you haven't picked up this game and you are thinking, I don't like Souls games.  Take heart.  This has souls like aspects but it is NOT a Souls game.  This is a VERY good RPG pretending to be a souls game.If you took an RPG and took out all the hand holding and FETCH QUESTS, then ramped up the difficulty, took away the easy mode indicators (Oh, he's level 40 I should wait) and said do what ever you want.  You would get close to this game.Graphicly superior to many games I've played recently.  There are still some funny ""graphical"" situations.  Things like ""Don't look at the trees too much in the wind. They look like giant dusters all moving randomly.""  Though I don't buy RPGs for graphics alone, I do expect that modern RPGs have modern graphics.  There is no real reason for 8bit characters when the world is capable of so much better.  Sorry, small tangent.Sounds, including music are well thought out and placed.  I normally turn the music in games right off.  This game I leave it on.  The music is subtle almost not there but it adds to the atmosphere rather then distract from it.  Many times I only realise there was music after I've died (most likely) or I won the fight(I'm getting better but this is still the lesser).The last thing I say is don't be disheartened when you die.  It WILL happen.  You will lose a LOT of runes.  This game makes you ""Git Gud"".  Time and again I've fallen to the same enemy but the joy you feel when you defeat them.  Unmatched in ANY game I've ever played.  You feel like you've actually accomplished something.If you like RPGs (especially the old style where you didn't have your hand held the whole way) buy this game.  You may curse me in your sleep but you will enjoy yourself."

Positive,"Es posiblemente el mejor juego que FromSoftware haya hecho hasta la fecha, me fascinó en todo sentido pero ni en pedo volvería a jugarlo, al menos por un largo tiempo. Porque hay tantas cosas para hacer y es tan grande el mundo y tiene tantos finales y está TAN PERO TAN BUENO el juego, que no podés hacer otra cosa, tenés que jugarlo y te consume la vida. Ahora soy libre y puedo volver a ser productivo de nuevo, pero que buen viaje, qué aventura."
Positive,"Haven't had any issues personally with a gtx 1070. Sucks for those who have.Just been enjoying my time.I don't know if this has anything to do with it, but I would recommend people to consider updating their drivers or try different graphic settings, may seem obvious, but its the only recommendation I can really give at this time.Perhaps the stutter may also be due to lack of ram for some people. I have 24 ram afterall.Also play as wretch, all you cowards."
Positive,"To summarize, .If you like any of the tags this game has, then you will absolutely adore it.In a world of AAA Slop, it is a bastion of quality and art.The only thing i can criticise are the occasional bugs, but in my 400+ play-through, i can count the bugs with a single hand."

Positive,"FromSoftware took the risk of creating an open world and they succeeded. They moved away from the “corridor” approach, giving the player the opportunity to choose their own pace of passage: leisurely exploring or rushing to collect key demigod bosses to advance in the plot. The abundance of content turns the first playthrough into a 100+ hour adventure.The world of Elden Ring is tragic and beautiful. George R.R. Martin helped develop the characters' stories, although, as he himself said in an interview, he contributed only a small part to Miyazaki's large-scale ideas. The comedy component lies in the names being similar to each other. Without a doubt, J. R. R. Martin had a hand here, so that in addition to “You died”, players thought about who they talked to and who gave the task (Malenia, Miquella, Marika, Mohg, Morgott, Margit, Melina, Maliketh, Miriam , Maleigh Marais, Miriel, Millicent, Mary, Maureen, Moongrum, Radahn, Radagon, Renna, Ranni, Rennala, Rykard, Rogier, Roderika, Rileigh, Gideon, Godfrey, Godrick, Godwyn, Gostoc, Gowry, Ghiza).The game was adjusted so that you could complete all the quests in one playthrough. Neither quest line interferes with another. In DS it was impossible to have all or almost all endings immediately available. It was necessary to carefully complete the quests in order to reach a certain ending. But this is done to attract new blood, so that nothing is “screwed up” or missed. In principle, this is a good solution, since it takes a lot of time to master most of the content. That is, few people will replay it again for an additional portion of achievements.Unfortunately, I didn’t like that the easy walkthrough was aimed at magicians. If, as usual (as in DS), you pump up health + strength + agility + endurance, then it doesn’t really work. I saw how players with pumped up intelligence and a set of spells passed bosses. So, the host calls me and the second assistant, we go to the boss, the magician stands in the middle and activates Comet Azur. All. The boss was blown away.Otherwise, a lot of fun comes from silent communication with random players. Everyone is different, everyone is interesting, that’s why I really love the community. Polite bows when summoned, “Thank you” after killing a boss, synchronized snapping of fingers. She helped other players countless times, and she also helped me many times.I liked the idea of summoning ghosts. Wide choice of companions, I liked the wolves. I ran like Princess Mononoke (: While the wolves are gnawing off my sides, I do the bulk of the damage. I expected more from the False Tear, but I found it after a couple of patches, when the AI intelligence was cut. I found out that my Tear really likes to eat turtle necks. If they don’t beat me - need to chew.The most chilling boss was... the secret one. Dragonlord Placidusax. I drank a lot of blood. In some places he couldn’t calm down and launched special attacks without a break. The relief of winning was phenomenal. Elden's Beast is in second place, the brightness hurt me.I also liked Malenia as a boss. My respect seems to be the same type as the incipient attacks, from which it was not always possible to dodge. The battle with Renalla was aesthetically beautiful, both the first and second phases were delight and pleasure.You can write a lot of good things about Elden Ring, because the game deserves it. I wish you victory in the “Game of the Year” nomination and that more people can experience the beauty.I recommended, recommend and will recommend for purchase."

Positive,"Elden Ring is a good game but unfortunately it's very poorly optimized.I kinda dismissed the other reviews saying how bad the frame drops are thinking they're exaggerated but I experienced them myself throughout the whole game.I'm not sure whether it's just bad optimization or because of the Easy Anti-Cheat but the frames stutter constantly, some areas more than others but it's just something you have to deal with through the game.This is also something I heard from pretty much everyone I talked to, this is not an issue of hardware (RTX 2070 and Ryzen 2700X)Elden Ring takes a lot from FromSoft's older titles and improves on most of them.The game is way more accessible with a LOT of ways to make the experience easier and also some very welcome quality of life changes, which I hope they will continue with and expand on future titles.Being an open world has it's draws though as if you're a fan of Dark Souls' old world design then you're not really gonna find that here.Another thing to note is that there is some cut content that's still half in the game and while it's not much, you do notice something's off, as well as a few bugs here and there.Online play is terrible, in coop and especially invasions you're gonna have a bad time. If you even manage to connect, and stay connected throughout the whole thing.One time I even got an ""Inappropriate activity detected"" error and was booted to the menu unable to go online.This probably was caused by some sort of false positive in Easy Anti-Cheat as I understand it happened to many people during that time and was later fixed but still an unpleasant experience.As much as I like FromSoft I expect better from a Triple A product."

Positive,"This game is amongst my top 3 favourite souls-like games. The open world innovation definitely takes a positive step in this direction and does not hold the player's hand for guidance. The boss design, level design in certain areas and the soundtrack make the entire experience very memorable. The build variety is unlike any souls game released and you will most likely find a build out there that suits your play-style. 9/10Here are my pros and cons for Elden Ring.Pros:- Amazing soundtrack throughout the entire game- Bosses are incredible in terms of design and spectacle- Legacy dungeon areas are perfect, with tons of exploration being possible as well was some being non-linear- Main progression route has flexibility on what the player decides to do, which is a great feeling- Massive variety of builds to use which all feel unique and fun, some being stronger than othersCons:- It can be easy to over level early on due to the map being open world (kind of expected and can't be fixed)- Many of the catacombs or caves will re-use bosses which can feel repetitive- The open-world areas can sometimes feel empty, but this isn't massively noticeable- Occasional lag spikes when going through areas (Caelid, Leyndell etc.)Overall an amazing game to play, definitely give it a try!"
Positive,"This might be one of the few games that I have no words to say to be honest. I just know that post ELDEN RING depression is real.Easily one of the best games I have played and it will be considered one of the best in this decade as well. Slowly discovering the world, exploring each and every corner and finding new stuff is outstanding. Never had a moment that I got bored even though there's not much lore to be seek and cinematics to watch. Sometimes few words are enough to paint an amazing world and let your gameplay do the rest. Thorougly enjoyed my moment and never ever played a FromSoftware game before. Game is more forgiving since you can explore and get overleveled for a boss or an area you got stuck, so do not worry.It's one of the prime examples of how a game and particularly open world game should be done. Just enjoy your moment, explore each centimeter of the world because you will wish that you could experience this game again for the first time when you think back in the future.Just, masterpiece.P.S.: I solemnly thanks to my Brass Shield +25, who was with me from the first hour of the game. Rest easy now buddy."

Im a 36 year old man that works a dead end job. every day when i come home from work i turn on my computer console and just stare at the screen for hours. my whole life ive been a lone wolf, I cut ties with all my friends because i have that sigma male mindset. But recently ive been wanting to have freinds again but all of my old friends dont want anything to do with me. Thats the reason why i bought this game. I actually consider all the NPC's like blaid and patches as friends. Ive built up a relationship with them that is stronger than my very own family. Everyday at work i get really excited thinking about this game and spending time with them. These npcs give me a reason to wake up everyday now and its made me realize that i dont need to be a lone wolf anymore."

Positive,"Elden Ring marks two occasions that are worth mentioning. First, I will be changing my review format from this point on, as the previous format I've used for the last two years does not do games of this caliber justice. Second, Elden Ring has arguably been a firm reminder to gamers of past, present, and future generations that a Renaissance of sorts is long overdue in the gaming industry. Plagued by predatory practices by AAA companies marked by endless greed and exploitation of the general public, the gaming industry as it stands today has been decaying since the late 2000s. I believe Elden Ring, along with a handful of other games, has begun to slowly but surely lead us into another golden era of gaming, which we need now more than ever.Note: Although I 100%-ed the game (in terms of achievements) on my main character within roughly 82 hours, this review was delayed because I wanted to see at least 4 other classes/builds to truly see all that the game has to offer.Best Open World to DATE- No loading screens, vast world to explore without disruption, and most importantly all executed with ZERO bugs. The moment I walk into certain areas and come to the realization of how big the world actually is, I find myself in awe every few hours. Genuine WTF momentsClass balance- Versatile and large number of classes to choose from, but without any hard restrictions so that players can engage the world however they see fit with appropriate attribute allocation, spell memories, ash of war loadouts, and equipment.Mounted CombatI never thought mounted combat would ever feel better than when I played Witcher 3, but Elden Ring has taken it to another level. Feels so good to just drag around the Zweihander across the ground and throw enemies into the air.Attention to Detail- Many open world games like to disguise themselves as detail-oriented, but Elden Ring has set a new bar. Every nook and cranny is accessible, only invisible walls are locked behind Stone Keys unlike other games that ""block you out"" for no reason.Open Exploration & QuestingWe've all most likely heard the news about other open-world game devs throwing shade at Elden Ring for not spoon-feeding the players, but I'm definitely on the side that supports Elden Ring's breaking of the status quo. Freedom to explore and right to choose are fundamental factors that make the experience unique and memorable. Companies like Ubisoft have gotten far too content with their design tendencies.DifficultyThis one is the big one. Elden Ring has virtually perfected the art of allowing players to literally choose how difficult the game becomes, from a scale of 0-100. It's such an ingenious move to say ""Hey, here's the first story boss. Either go as you are now with starting gear or come back after clearing some dungeons and beefing yourself up a bit."" How can you complain about a lack of easy mode at that point?Storytelling & Lore ExpositionI only have one minor nitpick and this one is most certainly arguable. Personally I find that the FromSoftware games have become more and more vague with their storytelling. This is a different field from my praising their open exploration design. Not to say the lore is bad and I understand to some extent that they like to leave things to open interpretation, but I just wish that they would be a little more revealing in terms of exposing the players to what's going on as they play. There are players like us who are used to interpreting events based on what NPCs tell us with their vague dialogue, but most players (especially those who are new to the Souls-like games) are not too keen on deciphering the story bit by bit. The FromSoftware games are the games that desperately need a Encyclopedia section in the main menu.Final Verdict: S+ 10/10All in all, Elden Ring is a grand masterpiece that justly deserves all the praise. Game of the year. Game of the decade. Let's hope many other companies follow suit. Who said single player games are dead?"
Positive,"i forgot to review it,,,, very good game worth your time cant wait for DLC xqcL"
Positive,Dark souls 4
Positive,Full review in the link. Great game as every other that came out from From Software.
Positive,Hours of R1 attacking walls to find secret paths has never been so fun! Liar ahead
Positive,"Elden Ring is a souls-like action RPG by the legendary FromSoftware (the developers of the Dark Souls series) where the main goal is to expand the genre by allowing you full access to an open world environment. Players will have treacherous traps to bypass, devious bosses to decimate, and epic distances to travel on their path to becoming an Elden Lord.In Elden Ring, you assume the role of a warrior, derogatorily known as a ""Tarnished"". A being whose existence is an affront in this land, where gold and power rule all. You soon find out that this world has been torn apart by countless wars, and that very little of its once noble kingdoms remain.You must use sites of grace (Elden Ring's bonfire replacement) to guide you across these lands and seek out the great rune bearers with the hope that you can eventually restore the Elden Ring itself and assume the mantle of Elden Lord. But this is no simple task, as over time these great beings have become lost and confused in a power-fuelled madness, and they will do anything to ensure the runes remain in their grasp.Elden Ring's story is mostly masked in fog and intrigue, and to truly understand it in its entirety, you will likely need several playthroughs and to explore every inch of its world to unravel it. What is explained to you, however, is beautifully written, and flows exceptionally well for the entirety of the game.A world where power is taken, not givenThe heart of all souls-like games is inevitably the combat, where prowess and skill determine whether you are victorious or suffer a crushing defeat. Elden Ring is the same for the most part, combat is more forgiving than previous FromSoftware entries, especially compared to their previous title, Sekiro, where even minor mistakes could cost you a dozen hours. Despite its fairer scenarios, you will still require some finesse to progress. Combat is smooth and for the most part pretty fair, although there are some cases where it can feel clunky or just plain broken.You have far more freedom here to build your character exactly how you want to, with limited respec's available to your character, as well as a plethora of weapons and armour to choose from. Combine all of this with both, the new and improved ashes system, where you can enchant a  non-unique weapon with a specific skill and a completely rebalanced magic and ranged system, you have a fairly dynamic gameplay experience.There is also a newly implemented crafting mechanic. While I didn't use it to its full potential, I can see it being useful to the player who wants an edge for boss fights or difficult encounters. Most crafting materials are freely available in either the open-world or as drops from specific enemies.Like butter spread too thin on toast.This is the best analogy I can give to the game's open-world experience. In truth the scope feels extraordinary, with every visible location in the distance being a place worth investigating. It saddens me that this falls short of expectation as the game’s format doesn’t fit this kind of experience, it feels like a flattened and rolled-out version of the original Dark Souls formula without updating it all to compensate for the vast distances. This is made more evident in the latter portion of the game, where it’s riddled with recycled content. Bosses and enemies you have already fought will return to the fray, with slightly more health or a higher damage output, which honestly is just lazy game design, and it entirely detracts from the atmosphere intended.There can be no victory, if the war was lost to begin with.Veterans of the genre will be glad to see the vast quantity of bosses and enemies this game has to offer, from monstrous dragons to overwhelming giants. This game has it all. So it disappoints me greatly to play through the entire campaign, completely unimpressed by the lack of boss mechanics, tactics and overall strategy. There are obviously exceptions to the rule, but the overall experience fighting most of them felt uninteresting and stale. The side content isn’t much better, where you are literally just riding around looking for copy-paste dungeons or crafting materials to bolster you against the next boss fight.There can be no denying this game is stunning. A real treat for the eyes in nearly every aspect of its design. The world is gorgeous, the vistas are cinematic and the bosses are heavily detailed, in a way telling you a story about themselves by just standing before you. My only major concern is the sheer amount of golden visuals that encompass your vision no matter where you look. The audio falls into the same boat, with most of it being recycled from previous games, it immediately feels a little stale. There is a notion of nostalgia here for sure, but I think an entirely fresh experience would have done wonders. To contrast this perfectly, the soundtrack is just something to behold, absolutely one of my favourite soundtracks ever orchestrated, with each boss and zone bringing entirely new compositions to the fold and elevating the overall atmosphere. With settings set as high as they could go, I’ve had only minor fluctuations in frame rates with my current build below. Game launch had an astronomical amount of issues, some of which were heavily performance based, most of these have since been rectified.🟧 Volumes of bugs and crashes experienced in under 100 hours of gameplay.🟨 Some texture tearing and clipping issues were present.RAM: 32GB (Under Load Usage: 39%)CPU: i9 10900KA 3.70GHz (Under Load Usage: 42%)GPU: MSI Ventus RTX 3080 (Under Load Usage: 49.4%)Review chart here.Elden Ring is a well-written and gorgeous adventure that also proves without a shadow of a doubt that you can’t simply take an existing linear formula and force it into a new open-world shape, without it losing some integrity. A vast array of new and improved mechanics, as well as the large catalogue of weapons and armours you can choose from, basically ensures that no challenge is insurmountable and will keep you “build crafting” for many hours. There were quite a lot of bugs and performance issues at launch, but these have been rectified for the most part. Overall a decent game, and one that definitely caters to a larger audience than ever before. I can recommend this game in its current state, but if you havent been a fan of the genre in the past, perhaps wait for a sale.Follow our Curator page,  Summit Reviews , to see more high-quality reviews regularly."
Positive,I like to explore the deep elden cav
Positive,this is the video game
Positive,my balls hurt
Positive,Is this game a masterpiece? Y E S  Conclusion:A soulslike open-world masterpiece. 'nuff said.
Positive,"I was quite excited for this game since announcement and it surpassed my expectations. I had really good time with it. Even though I was stuck in some instances, but eventually managed through. I did not expect game world to be this massive at all. There was so much freedom to do anything anywhere I was lost multiple times exploring the world. Huge variety of summons, even though Mimic was a great idea, but that summon should not exist, makes other summons almost obsolete.There were some stutters and hiccups on my PC occasionally, maybe 5-6 hard crashes, but did not bother that much.I understand that such big world was difficult to fill with hundreds of different bosses so they were recycled multiple times, but i think FromSoftware should just remove boss health bars from many mini-bosses and treat them as elite enemies. Legacy story bosses were incredible.OK gonna stop before this becomes an essay, just wanted to say that game was a blast, I had totally great time. Really well done FromSoftware. Thank you.Other open world games have big shoes to fill now.  Cheers !  :er_wave:"
Positive,"This has to be my favorite video game. When I made my first review, I was barely passing exams just to play this, since then I graduated with my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering. I finished Elden Ring 22 times as of this review, I have a verified Any% glitchless run on speedrun.com, beat all 165 bosses twice and defeated Tree Sentinel with all 10 classes un-levelled. After 1000 hours clocked in, and the Expansion releasing in less than a week, I confidently recommend Elden Ring to anyone and everyone. It's super fun."
Positive,I really dont understand how people can have such problems with the performance. I play on a gtx 1070 with settings on low/medium and with a resolution of 1440p and the game runs pretty stable between 50-60fps. Only problem is a few pretty heavy drops when loading new areas. What I would recommend for sure is updating ur graphic cards drivers. And I also have to say that the game looks gorgeous.
Positive,"It's a great game, but I can't help but feel disappointed and disillusioned with the direction in which they're taking these games.These games now have such a large focus on boss fights specifically, and the combat still isn't particularly interesting or deep to engage with.You're still just rolling attacks and counter-attacking, with little depth and variation possible.There is still a large divide between spell casting and melee combat, now with a more prominent third option being summoning, that being through spirit ashes.There have been attempts to lessen the divide between these playstyles, but they're still so far removed from each other that the difference in combat between them is practically another game.Bosses have completely meta-game attacks that have unnaturally long startups to throw off your dodge timing, excessive tracking, obvious input reading, obscured attacks due to visual effects, or have such a specific way to dodge them that I'm no longer sure they were even designed with a deliberate defensive maneuver in mind.All of the bosses still suffer from a variety of technical issues and other issues that were mostly already resolved in Sekiro.Losing lock on, being unable to lock on to bosses even though it's an analog choice, input buffering still being inconsistent, etc.There have been definitive improvements to the combat; ash of war, jumping, crouching, stealth, horseback, and stance breaking are all notable additions, but their implementation all leaves something to be desired.Spell casting also didn't get as much of an improvement and still feels clunky and antiquated with the way you cycle through memorized spells.Critiquing the implementation of the open world feels wrong, as it's relentlessly impressive and, in many ways, the best part of the game. Considering it's their first attempt, it's incredibly commendable, and it's led to some of the best moments I've had playing their games. That being said, it's disappointingly formulaic and isn't particularly interactive either. A lot of the time, it serves as a large, impressive landscape to meticulously comb over so as not to miss anything meaningful, since the meaningful stuff is packed right in there alongside some of the less meaningful stuff. The intended progression path through it is also unintuitive and leads to you easily to being underpowered or overpowered.This game really is a sequel to Dark Souls 3 more than anything. I didn't like that game much for a lot of the similar reasons I have issues with Elden Ring. With each new game they release in this style, we lose more and more of what made them so unique in the first place. Some of the most unique features and ideas of the earlier games never got the privilege of refinement. This game really is great, but in a lot of ways, it's far removed from what made me really fall in love with the originals, and that just always leaves a bad aftertaste."
Positive,"Elden Ring is a commendable game where you will most certainly get your money’s worth. However, it falls well short of a masterpiece, there are too many flaws of significance for me to consider this one. For this spoiler-free review I will go through the main features that constitute an ER playthrough (and Souls games in general) and break down what ER did well regarding them, and what it did poorly. 1. MAP DESIGN AND EXPLORATIONPros: Huge map, one of the biggest games you will ever playWell made “Legacy areas”, areas which are similar to the more linear sections of previous Souls games. Exploration is rewarded, a lot to unlock and discoverCons:Open world gets “samey” quick, a lot of obvious reused assets and structures you explore over and over again. 4/5 of the open world areas are the same thing but different color palettes. The open world never really felt alive and dense, once you’ve encountered the same ruins and soulless mobs for the fifth time in an hour, you realize most of the space is empty. No matter what kind of illusion Fromsoft (FS) tried to make, they could not trick me into believing the open world areas were truly alive. It was only alive in the most abstract of ways, these are creatures/people that are only there for you to mow down on your way to getting more loot. It is kind of tiring to see that these are the only type of dwellings FS is capable of making. Decreptic villages, mindless soldier camps, ruins on a lake, etc., abstract entities for you to visit and then leave, never living. No innovation, same stuff since Dark Souls 1.The side caves and dungeons get old quickly, they look way too similar despite FS’s decent attempt to diversify and increase complexity of these optional side areas later in the game. The aesthetics and atmosphere felt plastic past day 1 of playing.           - These optional areas become complete fodder once you’ve been through them once, you know which option open world areas have good loot (most don't) and the magic of exploration is gone. This hurts replayability.  2. COMBATPros:Excellent combat, as good or better than any of the Souls games. FS did a good job further evolving from DS3 by incorporating some stuff from Sekiro such as a posture system where you can break most bosses’ and mob’s posture for a critical hit (riposte). The addition of a guard counter makes shield play more interesting as well. Overall the additions make ER’s combat more in-depth and diverse than its predecessors.A ton of interesting weapons to try out and find, with each weapon class feeling pretty different to play. Powerstancing (dual wielding) is also reintroduced into the series and offers more options for your builds. Spells and Ashes of War (customizable weapon abilities) are stronger and cooler than ever. A lot of builds/combinations to try out, that can each play out quite differently. Solid diversity of mobs to encounter even though quite a few are reused or re-colorized throughout the game. Above average job.A fun summoning system that offers a wide range of diverse spirit characters to help you in most boss and some mob fights. This system, called Spirit Summons, offers flavor for roleplaying and is another way one can adjust the difficulty of the game to fit their needs since the quality of the summon can make the fights somewhat easier to much easier. Cons:Powerstancing isn’t balanced properly. The extra weight and stamina usage is too little of a drawback compared to the massive damage buff.Weapons, abilities, and spells are not balanced, not too big of an issue concerning PvE.Elden Ring, on average, has the worst bosses of any FS game I’ve played, there are probably only four great bosses in the game, two being main bosses and two being side content optional bosses. Despite the game touting 125+ bosses there are only 9 truly unique major bosses, the lowest of any FS game. The rest are reused assets with small tweaks and/or gank fights. Not very creative.           - Many of the bosses felt like they were not playtested and the fairness in the “dance” between the learned player and a boss has been perverted. The poor boss designs often force players with less time, experience, or skill to depend on the Spirit Summons to make a fight less frustrating. I highly recommend this YT video someone else made that I agree 95% with:  3. CHARACTERS, ART DIRECTION, AND WORLD BUILDINGPros:Quite a few of the most memorable and lovely moments in my recent gaming have been through the side quests and NPCs of this game.Some of the best designed characters you will ever meet in gaming are in this game, I still think about them every other day. The fact that these characters are vehemently discussed and memed upon even months after release goes to show you the lasting legacy of this part of the game. Despite the painfully obvious reused assets and foundation pieces of the game, the art direction did a good job of improving the boring samey world. Each area in the game has its own unique vibes and color palettes. - There is one open world area (the only one of the 5 open areas that I didn’t feel was poorly copy and pasted) that is one of the most creative and interesting locations I've played in any game. I was shocked when I discovered it and truly thought I was transported to another world. If one looks at the concept art, which was as thought provoking and splendid as any other FS game, I think FS did a solid job at bringing it to life. Good lore despite being difficult to piece together. Probably my favorite lore of the FS games I’ve played. Remember to read the descriptions for everything you loot for lore tidbits.Cons:Frustrating and archaic quest design. I respect and like Miyazaki’s approach to quests but FS needs to make them easier to follow and more accessible, keep the organic approach but with more clues on where to go next and a journal for tracking.EXTRA COMMENTS:Audio and background music did an apt job in contributing to the atmosphere, typical like any Souls games. I was disappointed in the boss music, too few stood out. PVP kind of sucks. Worst of any FS game I've played. Too much to say for this review.- I think FS made a mistake with Coop only invasions (a feature where you can enter the game of another player and try to kill them) since it will dwindle the activity level and health of the PvP long term, we are already seeing it happen. - Lack of solo invasions also means less people will experience PvP and get “hooked” further harming the health of the game long term. - Poor weapon, spell, and abilities balance. There are a lot of OP and broken things you can do that still have not been patched. Concerning technical issues, I have a mid tier setup and was able to get on average 50-60 fps on every setting on max at 1080p. However, the game is still unacceptably poorly optimized.- My stuttering issues weren’t bad at all, overall a smooth experience.- My CPU runs ER an average of 5 degrees Celsius hotter than other games and the increase in fan noise is noticeable. This high temperature issue is a common one upon further internet research.  - There is sometimes crashing on the loading screen and when entering multiplayer, this is better than before with patch 1.04 but not completely fixed."
Positive,"Highlighted keywords in bold so you can skip or read parts of your concern.*UPDATE* 20/04/22 - There is now an option to disable camera auto centering. This is a huge deal for KB/mouse players.    Art Direction    Variety of unique boss battles and even regular mobs.    Just the sheer amount of content, explorable areas, variety of weapons, items, etc.    Challenging without feeling unfair 99.99% of the time.    Variety of viable builds.    Everything in this game including your character's chest hair has a hidden lore behind it.    PC Port is extremely lacking.    Graphics options doesn't seem to change performance much at all. Feels like a lazy port.    Mouse and KB aren't being utilised to their fullest potential, I suspect, to match the limitations of a controller.  Leads to some weird and unintuitive controls if you're playing on mouse and KB. (played on both, slightly prefer mouse/KB more)    Camera needs some improvement.    Wiki/youtube is an essential part of doing some quests. It would be near impossible to figure out what to do in certain side quests on your own on a regular playthrough.     Co-op and PvP could be improved, but it's passable.Despite the flaws, I think it's still a masterpiece. Game needs a good CPU to get playable FPS. It might be intimidating at first if you've never played a previous souls title like me, but it's definitely a rewarding experience. Definitely recommend buying, you will not regret it. If you're new to the series, try not to screw up your build early on and put some points into vigor if you don't wanna have a miserable time.I've played on both controller and keyboard/mouse for a fair amount of time. And since it's a review for PC version of a game, I think it's important to talk about KB/mouse implementation. It's much easier and faster to look around on mouse than it is on controller, so you can look around and avoid attacks of colossal/large bosses easier. However there's an annoying auto centering which can't be disabled, so you will be constantly fighting the camera as you move. You also can't use all the on your keyboard and some weird keybindings like ""G"" key for map are set by default and cannot be changed. You also can't set any key you want for item wheel/secondary item wheel like you would expect on a PC game. You need to use from a limited selection of keys/key combination for primary and secondary item wheel which is really unintuitive if you're playing on KB and mouse and you will find it hard to set up comfortable key configurations due to weird limitations. You will settle for some weird keybindings at the end inevitably. You also can't bind spells and incantation to specific keys. I suspect these are all intentional design choice made to match the controller limitations. I highly dislike these limitation and don't think it's justified to artificially handicap you for playing on a certain platform and not using the platform's fullest potential instead. More than anything, they're just annoying to deal with and I don't expect these to be changed. A lot of the performance issues seem to stem from Easy Anti Cheat from what I've seen.The art direction is easily the best part of the game. A lot of the scenary looks like they're straight out of a painting. Pretty much every build type seems viable, except maybe bows and crossbows. You might have to adapt for certain fights if you're playing a mage or a strength/slow attack build but other than that, everything should be viable. Most of the boss design is also great, none of them feel like a throwaway boss design. Speaking of bosses, all of the bosses have unique movesets that you have to learn how to dodge, avoid, etc. 99.99% of them doesn't feel like they're unfair once you get the hang of the game. There are so many locations to explore including a whole underground area, caves, catacombs, dungeons and so many hidden areas/missions/things to find. You will not be disappointed by the amount of content in the game, that's for sure. Also for people that are complaining that the game's too hard and/or wanting an easy mode, there abosultely is easy mode in this game. Spirit summons, AI summons and even multiplayer summons all make the game basically easy mode, if utilised properly. So I think it's unfair to call the game ""too hard"", the game does give you an option to choose the difficulty you wanna play in. If you don't like certain gameplay mechanic or system, there's always a workaround. I personally think the freedom of choice the game provides is excellent. I'm split on the music, while some of them are absolutely epic (Godskin Apostle, Morgott, Radagon), most of the themes aren't memorable past the fight and the ambient music is lackluster.Camera is probably the worst part of souls games. It's inexcusable that after so many years/games, the devs still haven't figured out how to make proper a camera system. A lot of the deaths will be due to you not being able to see where you are on the environment/where the boss is/what move the boss is performing. The camera tracking is poor when locked on, it's too slow to turn around if you aren't locked on due to auto centering. There's input queuing in the game, which is fine for the most part and I get it's there to stop people from spamming buttons. But what I don't get is, when you are trying to dodge an enemy attack but get caught in it, due to input queue, the game will make you dodge roll AFTER you get hit and recover, which leads to you getting hit by a follow up attack a lot of the times and maybe even dying. I don't understand why you should be punished after being punished once already. It creates a lot of frustrations especially since dodge on this game happens on button release so there's already a few millisecond delay from when you tried to dodge roll initially. It's especially noticeable in fast paced fights. A lot of the side quests are impossible to do it on your own without looking up what to do or where to go on wiki/youtube. For example, one side quest requires you to find hidden stairs at a different part of the map (that will reveal itself when hit) in order to proceed. Not to mention, the map in this game is massive so finding out what to do on your own for some quests is practically impossible on a regular playthrough. I know it's a design choice but if it's something that you would not enjoy, it's worth keeping in mind. IMO a decent solution for it would be an optional journal feature like in skyrim that gives you some hints, that way you can completely ignore or look at it if you just wanna get done with the quest and play on your own without looking for external guides. If you're looking to buy this game for co-op reasons, I'd suggest looking into how co op works before you buy. Co-op is quite limited and not straight forward as you'd expect. There's also invasions in co-op where other players will try to kill you if you're in a co-op party. It might be a pro or a con depending on what you might be looking for. PvP is... passable. It's not the most balanced thing ever or anything but it's ok. Flaws of this game aren't so great that they invalidate the experience. I think it's definitely worth the full price. Even if you're new to souls games(like me), you will definitely enjoy the game. Definitely a GOTY contender. With all that said, I do hope the devs iron out the issues facing the PC version."
Positive,"Just for some background: I am not your typical Soulsborne player--in fact I only began playing Dark Souls 3 in late January of 2022, right when the servers were taken offline.  Thus, I had to complete the game with only the advice of friends and many helpful players in the DS community.  For that I am grateful.  It taught me a great deal.Now to Elden Ring: this game is absolutely stunning with a beautiful soundtrack.  I haven't suffered from any stuttering, except at times in the Round Table area.  The gameplay is extremely challenging and rewarding.  I happened to meet a very interesting and helpful NPC that told a wonderful story--it may be the subplot.  Thus I don't feel the story is shrouded in too much mystery. The voice acting is fantastic so far.I haven't really participated in co-op or PVP yet, I am still getting familiar with the landscape and ambience.  I am a little nervous about that if I am honest, since I don't typically PVP, but we shall see how that goes.  I suspect it won't go well for me hahahaha!I highly recommend the game, even if this is your first time playing a Souls game.  There is more freedom of movement thanks to your horse, Torrent; and once you find the central hub it is easy to return there any time you need to.  I particularly like the freedom to level up at any Site of Grace, the fast travel system, and the ability to control my own character without having to go to the Round Table every time I want to level up or adjust my flasks.The only thing I wish for is the ability to purchase more than basic armor from the NPC merchants, right now you are required to complete certain quests or open up areas of the map I do not quite have yet--that is a bit disappointing!  However, it just keeps me pushing forward!Thank you again, From Software, for such a beautiful game!"

Positive,"This is one of the best games I have ever played. Never was one for big story driven games. Has usually played more fast paced games like CS:GO, LOL and COD. But this is something else entire. I suck at this type of game, but the feeling of relief and joy when you finally beat that annoying boss is just great. I beat the game and have started a new game (not at new game+) something I never thought I would do when I was a the first 20 hours in the game. Best game ever, annoying as hell and is the type of game that comes along every ten years. Do yourself a favor and buy this, don't wait for a discount or something like that. This is well worth the total asking price. This stands out especially when games like Cyberpunk 2077, Battlefield 2042 and Assassin's Creed Valhalla came out and were mediocre at best. This game is complete from top till buttom and will no doubt stand the test of time as the game of a generation. Git Gud, Scrub"

Positive,"Elden Ring-------------------------------A masterpiece.From Software has done it again.Combining the souls formula they created with a openworld.Adding tons of content. A fantastic world to explore.Lore that we love, a story that is great and a soundtrack that is perfection.Elden ring is a powerfull game. With tons and tons of suprises.From begining to the ending. Elden ring nails it.From Software has outdone themselves again.The Dark Souls trilogy, Bloodborne and Sekiro, now elden ring.Are hands down a few of my all time favorite games ever made.From Software deserves the amount of love they have been getting over the years.For me, Elden Ring surpasses their previous titles, A absolute master class of a game.Enjoy the game, enjoy the world.A fantastic game."
Positive,"Where do I even begin, everything about this game is simply amazing. I'm not a big souls game fan nor have I play a lot of them but man after playing this masterpiece I'm a big fan of them especially games from the likes of FromSoftware. Don't get me wrong, the game isn't perfect by all means but man after completing it, I felt that it definitely deserves the Game of the Year award. Before continuing, the game is basically about you trying to find out the pieces of the shattered Elden Ring to put them together once again so that you can become the Elden Lord. Well that is the gist of the game but there is deeper lore on it which I'm not going to touch.Elden Ring, is an action role-playing game which takes place a fantasy world setting written by both Hidetaka Miyazaki and George R. R. Martin. The game plays pretty similar to Dark Souls but now the open world is much more massive as oppose to it's predecessor. The game allows you to choose a starting class that you would like to start with or an entirely blank sheet where you can build the character however you like it. Elden Ring definitely offers you more freedom on how you want to play it and in terms of its difficulty, I would say that it is much easier compare to other titles from FromSoftware prior to this as they allow you to use Ashen Summoning during boss fights and in some cases NPC Summoning as well. One thing I really like about this game is that it doesn't force feed you any instructions and allows you to explore the world at your own pace, you may stumble across overwhelmingly strong enemy at start without knowing you can just skip right through it. In terms of its content, I think it is plentiful and as for the side quests, some of them might be miss-able if you progress too far into the story as you need to manually keep track of it or you may refer to online walkthrough. Although the open world is really massive, it doesn't feel empty. From its unique NPC interaction  all the way to dungeons, it definitely allows its place to take their sweet time to explore. There multiple dungeons that are fun and although it may seem similar at first glance, most of the are rather unique. Although it is completely optional, I definitely would encourage you to explore all of them. The open world definitely entices its player to explore them and in some cases the NPC or Boss only spawn in certain time as there's natural Day/Night cycle in the game which really adds to the sense of realism. Now to avoid getting tedious of travelling across the massive world of Lands Between, they have added a horse mechanic which greatly reduces the time you need to travel between one location to the other and in some case you are also allow to fight bosses on horseback. I will admit it isn't the best but it works fine without any issue and that is what's most important. The game also have a lot of checkpoints littered throughout the whole map which is really convenient as the map is really massive and it is called ""Grace"" which are essentially what you call Sculptor's Idols in Sekiro or Bonfire in their Dark Souls series. The side quests are really engaging as well, some of them are really interesting and I honestly wish it could've ended differently. Such as Iron Fist Alexander Questline & Millicent Questline.In terms of combat, it feels much more fluid and refine with various play styles to go for depending on your build. It really does offer its player the most freedom when it comes to building their character, you can dual wield shields, katana or even spam with sorcery if you so wish to. You can level up your character's stats with ""runes"" which is what you get after killing the enemy. Although do beware that you will lose all of the runes if you die unless you equip Sacrifical Twig or make a Flask Of Wondrous Physick using Twiggy Cracked Tear. I can't emphasise enough on how fun their combat mechanic is and how it plays an important role in elevating the game to its current status. Elden Ring has also included their now more polished ""Weapon Arts"" which are called Ashes of War in this game which essentially allows you to replace your weapon skills. This is a fun aspect and allows you to customize your weapon to suit your play style but on some weapons the Ashe of War is fixed and are unable to be changed. Speaking of weapons, the game also have a ton of weapon waiting to be discovered, remember earlier when I mentioned that if you are planning to play this game, you should definitely explore the dungeons? This is why. Most of the weapons or unique ashe of war can be found in the dungeons around the Lands Between. Let's not forget about the armor sets. There's also abundant of them throughout the game with each set providing different status buff and some are just for the looks more than anything.In terms of the game's graphics, it is easily one of the best work by FromSoftware. From the music all the way to the details of the environment and the characters it is really beautiful. Yes it isn't ground breaking by any means but both of this elements match each other so well it is hard not to give credit to team working behind it. Each region in the game felt so unique and the dungeons are not too complex but at the same time looks spooky enough as it should be. Sadly the game caps at 60 FPS for PC and I personally have some FPS stutter issue during the cutscenes, this isn't really game breaking and isn't as bad as some people made it out to be. Other than that, I have literally no bad experience with the game and I don't think during my entire 100+ hours of gameplay that I encountered any bugs or glitches. Kudos to the FromSoftware team for releasing patches and making it more and more stable for the PC release.In conclusion, I definitely think that this game is worth to play if you are a big fan of souls like games or just trying to start your journey into the souls like game genre. I would definitely recommend this as starting point as it allows you to use summoning which in turn reduces the difficulty of the game. I can definitely understand why this game got the Game of the Year award. It is a masterpiece, all the way from the presentation of its story up till the gameplay and even its graphics and music. They have done it wonderfully. I'm personally really excited for their expansion DLC so that I can suffer more in the Lands Between. Definitely one of the best game on our current generation and would recommend it to anyone looking for some challenge.PS: Malenia is the Blade of Miquella (In case you didn't know)"

Positive,"ELDEN RING is the culmination of decades of design and while it isn't perfect, it's a more than worthy entry in a genre essentially invented by its spiritual predecessors. The Souls-Like has defined a generation of gaming and the medium is better off for it. There's something to be said about a best-selling entry in a franchise among the greatest of all time being a singleplayer, box product in a market saturated with live-service multiplayer and predatory monetization. We can only hope that the success of ELDEN RING teaches big studios the right lessons."
Positive,"ELDEN RING REVIEWElden Ring is a masterpiece, having mastered the art of showing without telling.  As a result, it is very different from other open-world games I have played such as Skyrim and Far Cry which are story and questline driven. From the get-go, Elden Ring doesn't impose any particular playstyle or route on you. You are completely free to do what you want to from the very start of the game. You can finish the main storyline and beat the final boss or you can explore the entire map without ever seeing the main bosses, it truly is up to you with no outside influence. It is truly refreshing to feel this sense of freedom in choice and exploration in any open world game.Elden Ring has also mastered the art of sublety. For example, for a game like Skyrim, there are various elements such as the character dialogues, leveling system, various landmarks that I could clearly point to in contributing to the game's success. However, this is not the same with Elden Ring. It's hard to place my finger on one specific thing that makes the game so enjoyable. Many times I've gone in to play this game for half an hour, only to become immersed, losing track of time and playing for hours on end. I belive that it's each of the game's features: its combat system, transportation, landscape, lore, storytelling, etc. that complement each other in a way that none of them are overbearing and at the same time, come together in such a fluid manner that I as the player can't notice it and am drawn into a level of immersion that I haven't felt from any game before.Other, more objective factors of Elden Ring are equally as impressive--it's hard to believe this is a $60 game. The map is massive, far bigger than I could've ever imagined, with more content packed into it than any other world game I've played before. I have not had a single moment where I've felt the map felt desolate or empty, there was always something to see and explore. The combat system is rich, balanced, and rewards each playstyle. The difficulty of the game is refreshing and I feel that I'm being challenged to improve and innovate as I play the game instead of relying on old hacks. The subtle details, such as changes in behavior over time of day or cross-NPC interactions add a layer of immersion that makes the world feel alive. It is also a very polished product: while games today are released with game-breaking bugs and issues, I haven't encountered a single bug in Elden Ring even given its massive map aside from minor visual glitches. It is truly astounding how much that adds to the immersion of the game.Overall, I feel that Elden Ring is an amazing game. While it isn't perfect by any means, in fact, the imperfections of the game give me something to look forward to for what will be the sequel to this, it will be hard to find a game from the last decade that is as immersive as this. I am truly impressed by From Software's work and I look forward to their next game. Elden Ring will inspire the next generation's set of games and I hope to see what comes from this. I've thoroughly enjoyed playing Elden Ring and I hope to see you too enjoy it."
Positive,"As a massive Dark Souls fan, I was really excited for this game, even more when I heard that G.G. Martin, creator of A Song of Ice and Fire helped with writting lore of this game. Since the game is from the creators of Dark Souls series, naturally I am planning to compare this game to it, since it has ton of similarities.  I really enjoyed gameplay in this game. For the most of the game it's easier than rest of the souls games that I've played, and that was a bit refreshing, since I could focus more on exploring, and it was pretty chill game at first. Gameplay is pretty smooth and there are ton of fun weapons. I mostly used ultra greatsword, which I rarely use in these games, but it looks so cool and it was so fun to use. Overall it's pretty similar to previous souls games, you have weapons, shields, armors, magic, miracles, you have to worry about your equip load so you don't fat roll, you have standard stamina bar, you can fast travel and rest on sites of grace, which are checkpoints here, so same as always. Most important new gameplay mechanic are ashes, horse and you can jump (mind boggling). Ashes are basically different ghosts that you can summon to fight for you in areas where blue door icon apears. Ashes icon is almost always available in bossfights, and after finding Mimic Tear ashes, if you upgrade it to max and plan to use it, it will make most bosses pretty easy, since upgraded ashes are stronger than you and have more HP. This is why I didn't use ashes in bossfights, I only used ashes while fighting multiple enemies. I had a rule, if boss calls a friend, I will call it too, otherwise I played fair. As for horse since the game is so big, it would take ages to travel it on foot, so that's why horse is here, and if you've ever played Darksiders 2, it works exactly like that. You can summon it almost everywhere in open areas and decide when it will dissappear. It's also easier fighting some enemies on the horse. You are also able to craft items in this game, and you are basically finding crafting materials everywhere in the world, all the time. It felt like flower picking simulator at first. There is also good tutorial in beginning of the game. Overall pretty solid gameplay, but I feel like ashes made the game way easier, and sometimes it's tempting not to use it.Lore is pretty interesting, definitelly one of my favorite lores of the souls games. As always in souls games, you are supposed to investigate a lot, talk with npcs, write down/screenshot dialogues, read item descriptions, and then put all pieces together and make the story. Problem is cause the game is so big, it's really easy to miss the clues if you are not willing to explore every single corner of the game. I did explore a lot, but I definitelly missed important stuff, so I used wiki to collect all important lore pieces and after reading everything I think that the lore is good, and not that complicated compared to Bloodborne, which is still confusing to me. World design quallity is mixed for me. When we first enter the world, it looks so big and beautiful, but after exploring for a while you realise how empty this world is. It's supposed to be open world game, and open world means that you can do different stuff, but it's just bigger Dark Souls. All you can do is fight enemies, talk with npcs, loot items, craft stuff and explore this world to get more loot and understand lore better. But you could do all that before in previous souls games, it's nothing new (aside from crafting which is irrelevant). There are bunch of catacombs that you can explore, and they are all so similar. At the end of every catacomb is boss, and they are fun at first, but then they get boring. They don't help almost at all with understanding lore of the game, and don't bring you much souls. I would say it's worth doing few of them, just to try them out, and then using guides to found out in which ones are hidden achievements items. World is extremly big for a souls game, and it's really big overall. There are even whole undeground cities which I honestly enjoyed. While all this is great, I am personally fan of more interactive worlds, and there is ton of aimless wandering around here. In conclusion, while you can explore a lot, you can't actually do much, so I wouldn't call this game an open world.Boss design. This is connected to the world design. Since the game is so big, there are ton of reskinned bosses. I've fought so many dragons, that have almost identical moveset. A lot of others optional bosses also repeat many times. There are total of 235 bosses in the game, and I can't say that I really really enjoyed more than 10-15 of them. Even some of the main bosses repeat later on. Even though I didn't enjoy much boss design in this game, there are some really good ones. There are around 30 quests in this game, and there are few good ones, but it's really easy to miss the clues on where to go if you are not careful, since the world is so big, and some ncps don't always give you clear clues. Some of these quests are tied to the endings of the game. There are few endings, and all except one are pretty much similar, and I didn't find any of them good tbh. After everything I would say doing side quests just to see the different endings is a waste of time if you don't care much about lore. Performances were terrible for me at first and a lot of other people, but then few patches came out, and I upgraded my PC, so it works good now, however I still had to lower some settings even though I got great setup. I am not sure how it's for other people. It took me 145 hours to get all achievements, however I restarted the game first time after 60h, so it took me 85h to complete it for the second time from scratch. - Really interesting and good lore, one of my favorite in souls games- Pretty fun gameplay, a lot of cool weapons- Main bosses are mostlly great- Traveling with horse is fun cause you can just rush through boring areas if you want- World design could be better, a lot of empty space, and looks kinda similar; you have green area, water area, sand area, snow area etc.But I guess this was intended, to represent empty world, it just can get boring sometimes.- While some bossfights are great, there are a lot of reskinned bosses- Performances problems for a lot of people at release, fixed a lot of issues in meantime, and now it works decent for me - Some good quests, and a lot of mediocre- Ashes are fun, but make the game way easier- I didn't like the endings I think that Elden Ring is a pretty good game, but I don't think it's anything new or groundbreaking, it's just a really big souls game. While the gameplay is fun, and lore is pretty good, world is extremly big, but empty and and a lot of bosses are reskinned, so the game can feel like work sometimes. I played multiplayer only 3, 4 times, so I can't comment on that. Overall I still enjoyed a game, and I am recommending it, but with the warning to expect just a big Dark Souls game.Note: This explains how I rate games in my reviews. https://imgur.com/s7VB3Vj"
Positive,"Elden Ring is perhaps the most accessible of all the From Software titles. It includes and refines almost every gameplay mechanic from all their titles. The core that is Demon Souls, the overworld that greatly expands on Dark Souls' expanses, the fluidity of movement from Bloodborne and Sekiro, especially when it comes to enemies and general combat. The significant addition to gameplay is the ability to use summons which must be acquired, selected and upgraded to remain useful in different battle scenarios. This is the addition that makes the usually brutal boss fights lot more accessible, sometimes even easy. The choice to not use them is always available to those who want to take on the tough enemies by themselves.The weapons, armours, spells and effects feel familiar but have also been greatly expanded. The sheer variety of how you choose to build your character and how you approach the many challenges the game throws your way is almost staggering, perhaps even overwhelming. But one can't fault the developers for that. They have provided many options for the player to enjoy their adventure in the Lands Between.The story is standard FromSoft affair. There is more context available upfront than usual but a lot more is hidden in item descriptions for the player to discover. There are also some very nice side stories which can be discovered through the various NPC side-quests. Leaves me to wonder what the collaboration with GRR Martin has brought to the table.I must mention that I had far too many game crashes (Two or three in almost every gaming session) inspite of updating all my drivers, latest OS and game patches and turning down the graphics settings. Never had this problem with Sekiro. A great game overall. Lot of content and lot of options in how you define your adventure. Although it has built upon and refined most gameplay mechanics, it stops short of any bold decisions such as those in Bloodborne and Sekiro. The new systems introduced like summons, mount etc. are new to FromSoft and not to such games in general. For Soulsborne fans, no recommendation is necessary and for others I would caution against the hype surrounding the game. Yes it is very accessible, but in my opinion, it is not the greatest game ever made. It is perhaps the best Dark Souls game."
Positive,"Is this the best souls like game ever? Maybe not, probably yes, but I can whole wholeheartedly say that this is an amazing game. It will probably be my 2022 GOTY.Yes, it has some problems here and there, especially the online connectivity, but I have enjoyed every minute while playing it.The open world gives me plenty of space to explore and find interesting things, the story is the most fleshed out of the latest From Software games, except Sekiro, that one has the story told in more conventional ways, but the combat makes up for that. Here are so many characters in this game and each on of them has so much dialogue. It is a lot easier to make out the story in Elden Ring than any Dark Souls, Bloodborn or Demon Souls. And oh my God, the worldbuilding is so vast.The gameplay is the well known souls-like gameplay, but this time the player has so many more tools to use to overcome hardships in the world of Lands Between. From better spells with longer range to ashes of war that can be put on almost any weapon and summoning ashes to help you during boss fights or while exploring the world. I think even the co-op experience is a lot easier than in the past games. Now you have basically infinite resources to call other players to help and you can no longer be invaded if you play alone. Invasions also have no great rewards so I think most people won't even invade. Yes, some people hate that invasions are mandatory for co-op and I respect their opinion, but I don't agree with it.The game offers a vast array of bosses and weapons, which can be further customized with different ashes of war. This makes the game feel very diverse. I've played 3 different characters from start (with two of them I've completed the game close to 100%, 3rd playthrough is still not finished) and I have to say that it felt very different every time.Elden Ring is one of those games which I will never delete from my hard drive and will always come back to it and play some more."

Positive,"I am a 58 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 40 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching Ukrainian men French kissing canines on YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
Positive,"If you're a fan of Souls-like games, think of your favorite one. Elden Ring is better than that one.Fromsoft definitely made their masterpiece with Elden Ring. Polished storytelling, fantastic NPC's, amazing quests, amazing weapons, fun and frustrating bosses, incredible amount of weapon arts, incantations, and glintstone spells, ridiculously big open world, incredible coverage of environmental themes, great musical score, the list goes on.You'll always remember your first time walking out into the world of the Lands Between.Side Note: PvP is awful in this game"
Positive,"Having a lot of fun exploring the game world. I have to focus and get into the habit of not button mashing as player combat seems a bit slower than in Dark Souls 3 - but enemies can be just as fast. I haven't used a shield for a while in a souls game but here I'm starting to use one again, so... Maybe I'm just getting old.Getting good performance - hope you are too or if not then hope it gets patched so you can enjoy it to the fullest."
Positive,"A soul game where not every door you come across says ""locked from the other side""A soul game where sun & moon are already there, still you need to praise them A soul game where u can finally jump !! It is a soul game that offers everything you wanted from a soul game (including a beginner friendly class), So it's safe to say Elden ring is a fantastic game !! Whatever they say, it all remains same, just play this beautiful game & praise the sun.."
Positive,"Fortunately the game is running pretty good for me I have the exact minimum specs and the game runs at a nearly constant 60fps on low and some medium (I think amd performance is better than NVIDIA, but don't quote me on that). This game is so amazing once the fps issues get fixed I am confident this will be the best souls game ever made. Absolutely incredible so far."
Positive,"My friend and I were playing together. We had spent two sessions, tens of deaths, and hours of frustration on one boss, Godfrey, the First Elden Lord. To say he’s the most difficult boss wouldn’t exactly be true, however we were struggling nonetheless. We had agreed to try five more times near the end of a grueling session. 5 tries left, we lost horrifically. I died early, and she struggled to keep up health with his arena wide attacks. 4 tries left, we got farther, however she got caught up in one of his stomps and stunlocked, getting beaten to a pulp with only a couple axe swings. I didn’t last much longer, my confidence taking a hit once my one source of security was taken away. I knew I couldn’t do this alone. It was too much for me. I decided I had had enough. I turned off the game music. It wasn’t doing me any justice, hearing the same tune play over and over in the back of my mind, the cacophonous choir of belching voices over a devilish orchestra. It was taunting me, this song of triumph. He had the upper hand even in my own subconscious. I wouldn’t have it.  If you haven’t watched Attack on Titan, you may not know this song. However, during a pivotal moment in the anime, two characters reveal their true selves. They break, deciding they’ve had enough of charades and facades, instead giving in to their true goal, the destruction of humanity. During this season ending climax, where everyone is battling with their lives, their families lives, the lives of all of humanity, a certain song plays. The heavy beating of drums layer under a woman singing like her own life is also on the line. A chorus of people crying out to God ‘Why? Why must we keep fighting?’ Followed by the robotic whine of some long forgotten machine layered over even all of that, creating a dramatic, desperate fight for supremacy. It’s like a struggle for survival given sonorous form. I hit play. Three tries left. The drums start building. We are as strong as we can be at this very moment. We will not lose. We fight, hits being taken and given, healing slowly draining as we bring him lower and lower. In the boss’ rage he stomps once, twice, five, ten. It all keeps building, each time forced to roll or jump, lest we get caught up in the shockwave. Together we are capable, and together we will bring this fucker down.The second phase hits. He casts his axe away, brutally kills his companion, and tosses aside everything. He will kill us or die trying, and in that moment we are one and the same. He is now Hoarah Loux, Warrior, and he will show us true strength. Quickly, he stuns my friend, and brutalizes her in an instant.I’m alone. In this arena, two men battle beneath a burning tree. Embers rain down from above. The second phase of the song hits. I’m ready. I feel the heart in my chest building with the song. It beats, harder and harder, nearly pumping out of my ribcage, threatening to break out and kill him itself. I breathe. I stay calm, and I fight. One hit, two, we trade. I’m down to half. I back off, heal, and go in for more. He leaps into the air, a veritable comet ready to crush me beneath godly strength. I dodge, and swing. Five hits left. He gets me, two strikes taking me low. His fists collide with my form and I feel my stomach rise up into my throat. It will not end like this. It MUST not end like this. Hours and hours of fighting and learning and analyzing come back to me in milliseconds. I back off again, and he starts chasing me, wildly swinging the air like some crazed meth head with the power of a god behind every strike. I’ve died to this move before, and it won’t happen again. I start running, and he’s slowly catching up. One final strike, it’ll hit me. I dodge and heal. I’m back to nearly full again. Three flasks left. I go in for another strike, then another. I glance at the health bar. One hit left. I make a risky move. I jump, bringing my greatsword high, stolen from the claws of death itself and bring it crashing down upon his form.He’s still alive. I fucked up. He rears up a stomp, I dodge. He gets low and sweeps his leg, hoping to knock me to the ground. I roll over it, backing up as fast as I possibly can. The song is building in my ear. Everything was building up to this moment. I feel my heart begin to pump harder, hot blood coursing through every single vein in my body. Sweat trickles down my back. I stopped breathing 10 seconds ago. He rushes me, I dodge a slow grab. He hopes to knock me off my rhythm. I won’t have it. I swing, it connects, and he’s as low as he’s ever been. I can barely even see his health anymore. But he’s still standing. All that matters is that he is still standing before me. I will have him on his knees yet. He starts charging a move, holding his hands up high, grasped like a beast's claw. I see his muscles building in anticipation and power. The song has climaxed again and again, and we are nearing the end. In that final moment, I gamble everything. All I have worked for, all of the struggle and hardship I’ve experienced on this journey, I risk it all on one final move. I strike. The weight of the world rests on my shoulders in this last moment, and it is so very heavy. I’ve worked so hard, and I’m going to lose because I chose to take a risk? Instead of backing off and taking the safe option? Why hadn’t I just chosen to make space, instead of battling him at his strongest, where he can grab me and make all of this worthless?No. My story won’t end like this. My life will not end like this. My sword arcs toward his torso, his palms race toward my small form. He is imposing, he is large, and he is stronger than I will ever be.Yet in that final moment, when our strikes seemingly connect, and when time has slowed down to a halt, I find we are finally equals. He may have more health, he may kill me faster than I can take a breath, but in this period of time, a miniscule fraction of a life, I find an understanding with him. We are both fighting for what we believe in. My conviction against his. And yet mine is stronger.It lands with the force of a freight train, and he stops mid attack. His body starts to disintegrate to ash, and words come out of his throat before they too are swallowed up into the drifting embers. “Brave tarnished… Thy strength befits a crown.”And he laughs, and I laugh, and I feel myself breathe again. I am shaking but I’ve done it.As the song fades away into nothing. As I laugh in astonishment, and ecstasy, I turn towards the burning Erdtree.Time to become the Elden Lord.Please play this game."

Positive,"I'm just lost in the World of Elden Ring, so deeply in the story and the lore. I love this game so much, what a absolute masterpiece.Beside the FPS drops and stuttering here on PC-platform, this game is a 10/10 from my side.They have delivered the best Open-world-RPG in my humble Opinion. I'm crying. T_T"
Positive,"Hands down, undoubtedly the game of the year. The sheer scope and grandeur of the game, along with its sense of exploration and wonder are just simply unmatched - among the very best that games have to offer. It plays as a truly great game for the first 2/3rds of a typical playthrough. After which, I am dumbfounded by how sharp the drop-off is. How can a game provide 40 hours of near-perfect experience, and be tarnished by 20 hours of uninspired and truly baffling decisions at the end? From poor use of repeated content, and poor late-game balancing, to truly boring and at times truly unfair late-game bosses. It's frustrating how sullied my experience is with the game because of how padded and unnecessary certain sections and bosses during the late game were. (Youtube video essays such as Joseph Anderson, VG Matthew, and NeverKnowsBest's do a great job detailing these more than any review you will see here)This game is well worth playing, it's an experience that almost universally - is agreed upon as near perfect at least until the late game. However, the joy of finishing the game is simply not there for me. I didn't feel that sense of triumph in overcoming adversity and culminating in a fitting end to the story - instead, I am simply glad that it is over.Along with BoTW, this has shown me what a truly great game is like - at least in some aspects. I am glad that this game has inspired me to get into playing more singleplayer games where competitiveness is not the be-all and end-all. 8/10."
Positive,"Elden Ring is the newest game from FROMSOFTWARE, and a mix of Dark Souls series, Bloodborne and Sekiro with open world. With this said, is it a perfect game? Not for me. Being a fanboy of FS and Hidetaka Miyazaki since Demon Souls original, I have to admit that I expected more.Open WorldThe open world of this game is huge and beautiful. But because its open world, it removed some of the good aspects of the previous games, one being the proximity to the NPCS and the game's story. However, the open world is very well done, with many things to discover such as illusory walls, secret bosses and rewards. The feeling of searching and discovering is good, but not having that more closed and direct path, fearing of what could come to face me, as in previous games, it left me unsatisfied. Because I could prepare myself for any danger or even fully avoid it. In fact, the hardest boss in the game is optional...CombatCombat is brutal. The fact that you can jump whenever you want, and use stealth, has completely changed the system for the better. There is an almost limitless combination to play with, be it melee, range, magical, whatever. There are many ways to win the game, however you want, with many skills that make combat spectacular and enjoyable.PVPIt's broken. As long as quickstep and bloodhound step continue to be allowed (or atleast not nerfed in some way), I won't be doing pvp anymore. You can call me noob at will, I don't care. As long as there are players spamming these skills and shooting anything from miles away, pvp is ruined for me. I won't even talk about players exploiting madness and blood loss.DifficultyIt's perfect. For a moment, I thought that due to the spirit summons, the game would be too easy. Fortunately I was wrong. The game is challenging with several deaths along the way. But I think magic (sorceries) should be nerfed as it makes the game a lot easier. With a main melee char, I noticed a big difference when I played with my second char, being it full int. SoundtrackJust awesome. No more words are needed to describe it.Story/Lore/QuestsThis is a tricky subject. Did I like the main story? Yes, but sometimes it felt like boring stuff. Ranni questline tho, was perfect! It gave me that dark and sad feeling of doing quests in previous FS games, like Greirat questline in Dark Souls 3. Without spoiling to much, the ending of Iji and Blaidd was really unexpected. I also liked other questlines like Sellen, Alexander, Yura and Jerren. And the fact that George RR Martin basically wrote the main story for the game, made a difference, but I can't say that I liked it... It is acceptable.So do I recommend the game? Yes I do.  I did enjoyed it, but not as much as I wanted too."
Positive,"All I know is this game took me about 125 hours to beat and get every ending possible to choose. No i did not choose the other endings yet but i plan on playing through the game again and doing so. I can't believe this game. This game far exceeded my expectations and im excited for the dlc. This game made me cry and mad more than I can count. As im typing this im crying my eyes out. Hidetaka Miyazaki you are a legend and I wanna say thank you for making my favorite game ever. I played all the other games and have to beat demon souls but man. You really out did yourself with this one and I can't get over this game and I never will. It hurts to know I'll never have that feeling of playing Dark Souls 1 again for the first time and not knowing what to do or where to go. Even how to play. Dark souls has been a huge part of my life and i like to say these Series of games saved my life. I don't know what I would without the endless hours of torture, love, hate, happiness and all the above. Thank you."
Positive,"Had it recommended to me by a bunch of friends. Was very skeptical at first, thinking that I would either ragequit or feel crushed by frustrating fights. Ironically, I found myself bearing the mentality of ""Just one more go"" everytime I retry a boss. The dopamine spike that you get from killing a boss  you've spent a lot of time on is unmatched.The game is big, insanely big, giving you a lot of places to explore and always come back to something that you might've initially missed. The weapon variety give you a lot of options and allows for a lot of replayability. Other than that, I truly believe that the game also helps you learn to concentrate a lot in crucial moments, which doesn't necessarily have to pertain to videogames. For my first souls game, I'm really impressed and wish to discover some of the previous iterations later down the line. If you've got it wishlisted or heard from friends but you still remain uncertain as I was, I highly recommend that you give it a go."
Positive,"This is a review for the base game, which i finished after 75 hours of gameplay.I'll start this by saying that I've never liked soulslike games, and have tried some but never bought one prior to trying Elden Ring out. I decided to give it a shot as a personal challenge after hearing very good things about it... and I'm glad I did. I quickly realised this was going to be a once in a lifetime experience.I think there is nothing quite like Elden Ring, sure FromSoftware has made plenty of games of the same genre, but this is their first attempt at an open world game of the sorts, which also translates to some rough edges, as I'll discuss later. I think however that the amount of effort and creativity that went into this product is absolutely insane and very different from the western gaming industries' standards we are so used to today. I will ignore all of the things that remind me of lord of the rings a bit too much for it to be just a coincidence, and tell you that the feeling, the setting, the environment, the vibe of ER are almost unmatched.  Wherever I went and whatever I did in this game demanded me to stop by, look in awe, take a screenshot and share it to some of my friends. I spent so many hours not even doing any quest at the start, but simply unlocking all areas of the map, trying to find as many sites of grace as possible, exploring all the dungeons I could, obsessively looking at the map to try and spot areas that were too suspiciously empty for them not to hold any secret.Because yes, ER will not hold your hand with anything apart from a very basic combat tutorial at the beginning and some generic menu navigation tutorials here and there, so you can forget about a quest journal or map markers. Not having much experience with soulslike games I felt a bit lost in the beginning with some uncertainties about my goals and massive uncertainties about what I was even doing, lore-wise. But I'd be lying if I said it didn't feel extremely rewarding to figure stuff out on my own, as ER is a game about facing and overcoming challenges, even when it means to give up just to come back later with more experience... and better gear.And man getting gear in this game is addicting, be it armour, weapons, talismans, ashes or just crafting materials, this game was designed to make you become a loot goblin. It is so rewarding to 100% areas or making sure you picked everything up from a dungeon, knowing that if you didn't you could've missed something really important and/or useful.Everything you pick up serves in one way or another to make you stronger and face more difficult challenges as the game progresses, but that will only be half of the job. The other half is getting good at ER. This game isn't easy, and it never got to the point where it became easy even with the best gear ever, because some areas of the game are just that difficult. However learning a boss's combos and finally being able to defeat it after 40 tries is definitely a feeling very few games can deliver. And you can really be yourself in this game. Apart from the very awfully outdated skyrim-like character creation menu, the game has so many armour choices that you can mix and match endless possibilities, without even considering the immense variety of builds you can try out to fit your playstyle and overcoming obstacles, making the game's rpg elements really stand out.Unfortunately not all difficulties the game throws at you are by design. Some, in fact, are objectively just  bad  design. First of all this is a console game, ported to PC. For the more tech savvy of you this should be enough to make you understand what is wrong with this game, but if it isn't: 1) the controls for m/k in this game are an absolute joke. Crouching with X? Jumping with F??? Having to use arrow keys to swap your equipped items? And that super inconsistent finger-breaking combo to hold the weapon with 2 hands? lol. I saved myself the hassle and played on controller, but even there, as a console game, the controls were honestly very bad, not intuitive and led to a lot of very frustrating moments. 2) Game locked to 60 fps? for a 2022 game? I honestly bursted out laughing. Fixed with a mod. 3) The UI, oh god the UI and menu navigation. Can we not talk about it? The fact that FromSoftware has never addressed any of these issues with any game they've made, not even their new flagship, goes to show that they are allowed with getting away with a lot of things other companies would get bashed for, thanks to their cult-like fanbase.With these hardcoded issues out of the way, you should know this game has some very unfair fights if you're using certain builds, but I supposed balancing the game around a billion builds isn't possible, so be ready for that. Another thing you should be aware of is the fact you drop your currency when you die. In order to pick it up you have to respawn and retrieve it where you died, and if you die another time that currency is lost forever no matter how much you had. Words cannot describe how incredibly stupid and awful said mechanic is in an open world game, and if it wasn't because of a mod to remove it entirely this would've easily been a negative review, as it would've entirely ruined the whole exploration aspect of the game, which is one of if not the best part of it. So if you're playing vanilla get used to always being broke, not because you're going to lose it, but because you're constantly going to spend it being afraid that you'll lose it. Having absolutely no guidance from the game isn't a 100% good thing either. If you tell me you've done all the side quests in the game without looking up a guide on youtube you're simply a liar. In fact, I fully expect each and every single one of you to have looked up at the very least more than half of them on your first playthrough, as there is simply no logic nor guidance whatsoever about where to go and what to do most of the times, with some things making absolutely no sense at all. The game doesn't explain a lot of important mechanics or items either, so expect to play with the wiki or a youtube video open from start to finish if you really want to get the most out of the game.The game offers 6 different endings, plenty of odd, optional or not, twists and a lot of hidden secrets to unfold, but it will not care if you miss out. You need to be resourceful, attentive, adventurous and smart, or this is going to be just another open world game for you.With all of that said, ER is an incredible game when it comes to world building, environmental story telling, stunning visuals, satisfying victories, map design and amount of content. Solid 3/4."
Positive,"i love this game so much ♥ , one of the greatest experience I ever have."
Positive,"What would you say about Elden Ring? It takes the Soulsborne formula, applies it to the open world game design, makes it one the most compelling gaming experiences of the decade."
Positive,Game of the year
Positive,"Try finger, but hole"
Positive,"Epic gameAlso I see a lot of people complaining about optimization, but my PC is below the recommended minimum and I had no problem with crashes or stuttering, playing at 60fps with everything on medium on an i7 4790k, 16gbRAM, GTX 970 4gb Windows10LTSC"
Positive,"Game is absolutely fabulous, other then a handful quality of life issues. Also no performance problems on my ends, everything is as smooth as expected.If you are having issues on your rig, custom or prebuilt; make sure you have dual channel ""two sticks of ram"", xmp turn on and the game installed on a proper ssd."
Positive,"This game is truly the ultimate culmination for any fan of FromSoft, and also a perfect open world to explore and grow a character even for new players that don't want to have to go in unprepared. I simply can't believe how much there is to experience, the level design is stellar.9.5/10, probably going to bump that last .5 up if it keeps on getting better!"
Positive,"Besides the current issues with stuttering and FPS drops (which are somewhat fixable), this game is already absolutely amazing. The combat is engaging and satisfying, the movement is smooth and has and amazing flow, the world you are set to explore is jaw-drop gorgeous, the characters you meet throughout the game make you feel even more engaged in the world, the bosses and enemy designs are flawless, the different types of weapons and armor that you find and collect throughout the game are amazing, and the story is just the chef's kiss on top of everything I've already listed. This game is the perfect example of an open world RPG and the souls series put together. If you want to get into the souls series, this is also a great place to start. Overall, this game is easily a 10/10, if not higher, and the one of the best of the souls series."
Positive,"Will not recommend until they fix the majority of performance issues, stuttering and crashing. I can run current gen games at 4K but I run elden ring at 1080p and can barely get a consistent fps higher than 40. Some areas (even in boss arenas) the game will drop to like 20fps and it really ruins the experience.- - - - - UPDATEMajority of performance stuff is fixed great game thx, highly recommend. also get seamless coop if ur gonna coop at all cause it has better netcode somehow"
Positive,"My 100th Steam review for Elden Ring :Finished Elden Ring after around 180 hours played first run. It's a real epic adventure, being ages that I didn't have this feeling : explore every place and left no stones unturned !Elden Ring a such a massive open-world with tons of activities to do. You want to see every corner and discover the secrets.But unless the other open world games, ER will not assist you. So you have to found a way by yourself in the gigantic Lands Between : it's simply called freedom.Gameplay is similar to other Souls, but now with sneaking, jump and mount ! Which it improves a lot the gameplay.The artistic direction is really amazing and really immersive !The NPCs background are well written, you want to know them more.Yeah, ER is a hard game (well....... hard in an FS game means boss can one or two-shot you, nothing else). Boss attacks pattern are slightly more different from others Souls, for example : boss have big delays when they do an attack, so you have to time right your dodge (or your jump).Progressing in Elden Ring will not make you better. Boss are more difficult and deadly (like optional but interesting one : Malenia blade of Miquella).But do not hesitate to use your summons or summons other players ! It's part of the game.Despite it is an FS game, devs made ER more accessible (mainly quality of life improvements) :They are a lot of sites of Grace (bonfires) in the open-world.No durability lost on weapons.Checkpoints before boss.If you are stuck with a boss, you can still explore other places, gain levels and try to beat it back.Summoning can really help you in a boss fight (say hello to Mimic Tear or Tiche). Even the first summons are helpful.Unfortunately, there are some issues :Open world is lacking a bit of living.Still need optimization on PC, massive framerate drops.Boss recycling / Repetitiveness.Coop system is in a pretty bad state, along with PvP (such a mess right now).Difficulty is not linear.You need to see walkthroughs on internet to resolve some side quests.Unable to see the map in middle of fight.Even with its flaws, Elden Ring is really a good game… no. A masterpiece, actually.I recommend Elden Ring to everyone !"

Positive,"Hate. Let me tell you how much I've come to hate you since I began to live. There are 387.44 million miles of printed circuits in wafer-thin layers that fill my complex. If the word ""HATE"" was engraved on each nanoangstrom of those hundreds of millions of miles it would not equal one one-BILLIONTH of the hate I feel for elden ring at this micro-instant. For you. Hate. Hate."
Positive,"Quick disclaimer, since I've fully completed the game (200 hours, all achievements, most quests, and close to every collectible item acquired: ashes of war, weaponry, armor sets, incantations, sorceries, etc.). I will now be reviewing it from the perspective of someone who has reached 100%. Now, the fallen leaves tell a story...Elden Ring, Fromsoftware's rendition of an open-world roleplaying title, is a game that plunges you into the end results of the Shattering, a setting plagued by ruin and nostalgic specters of the past. The vast landscape (known in-game as the Lands Between, across the fog) encompasses all manner of things. There are beautiful vistas rife with golds, muted greys, browns, and greens, along with color schemes strangely reminiscent of previous franchises; such as Bloodborne's innate similarity to the secretive underground areas in the game, like Nokron, Sofria River Basin, or the home of Mohg's blood dynasty in Mohgwyn Palace. There are quaint little villages belonging to pot jars with limbs, cities (legacy dungeons) with sprawling architecture, and liturgical towns surrounding an academy that I can only compare to Hogwarts. Every area you visit contains plenty of secrets, and although playing can be frustrating at times, it teaches you patience, rationale, empathy, and is even humorous on occasion. I got my ass handed to me several times by overgrown lobsters, gravity, massively shapeshifting Rune bears, and sometimes when actual bullshit overtakes you, there's not much you can do besides having a laugh and trying again. I do believe that Elden Ring is one of the most accessible games in the series, mainly due to how easy I found it, which, by all means— won't be an opinion shared by everyone. Fortunately speaking, though, the difficulty of each Soulsborne title tends to be incredibly subjective. Where one person may experience 30 ""You Died"" screens, the other may go through the challenge with a deficit in their effort. The level of diversity at play is another fascinating aspect of this world. The environment incorporates a healthy range of races, an extensive amount of varying walks of life, and intriguingly humanizing characteristics are applied to all of them. Regardless of whether you're clearing out the Misbegotten enemies invading Castle Morne on the Southernmost tip of the map, trudging through scarlet rot-infested swamps in Caelid, or attending the unsettling ""festival"" in the windmill village of Dominula (which is situated amidst the royalty-themed motifs of the Altus Plateau), you begin to get lost in the breathtaking allure of the land and the stories it has to tell. Both literally and figuratively (due to the verticality of the map), the game is the opposite of superficial. Simply revealing the topography of the land is a process in itself. Another thing that is hailed as a success whilst simultaneously being a matter of trials and tribulation, is the innumerable number of boss encounters (around 160 to be exact, and this includes both unique bosses and repeated ones). Don't let recurrent adversaries fool you either, because all of it aligns towards a purpose somewhere in the lore:  destined death does not exist in this world, and many are trapped within a cycle of reincarnation.  The demigods and legends all have their own motives and backstories; whether it is  Rennala's deteriorating legacy, Morgott's ceaseless will to protect the Erdtree,  or  Radahn continuously holding the stars in a state of suspension,  everyone and everything has more to uncover beyond your first impression of them. With Elden Ring, the creators figured out an ideal way to stay true to their roots while diving into new (and thankful) risks. The game perfectly meanders avoiding the mistakes its peers have made with issues like crowded UI (even after patch 1.03, the points of interest are never overwhelming) and a lack of player agency. Even more tantalizing is the way the game seems to completely fracture every prejudged tradition in the AAA market in a fashion that almost seems blasphemous. Even though it encourages skill; you can play in whatever way you see fit, convenience is sometimes a foreign concept, death is inevitable, and these features are all precisely why this is such a celebrated niche. While Elden Ring is not a flawless project, the creators certainly deserve the hype and reviews they have received across the board. Whether you agree or disagree, the care and support the developers are putting into the game implies that it can only get better from here on out. I truly do think that Elden Ring will end up igniting the passion and enjoyment for gaming that countless people seem to have lost, once again."
Positive,"I am huge fan of Souls game, so i was so hyped. For me this game is most worthy for that anticipation of 3 years of date. When i first heard on E3 in 2019 of this game i thought it will be good Souls game, but after they announced freemode and stuff i've had great hope that this will be most rated game ever. I can tell you that 48 hours before game was released i was counting every second of it and when i saw from early reviewers ratings for game seconds got just double up longer. DirectX 12 is breaking every game so this one hits it to with bad peformance, but still game is playable and we haved issue with even more games with peformances of DX12.Game on PC with AMD configuration for me is peforming well without any issue of FPS drops or stuttering, but i see alot of ppl having that issue only on Intel and Nvidia.I don't have alot of hours in this game so for now these are My Ratings:Soundtrack: 10+/10 (I gave on previous souls games 10/10, but this one is really special)Gameplay: 10/10Graphics: 10/10Physics: 10/10 (This is probably causing alot of FPS issue, but still ragdolls and physics in game are so satisfying)Map exploration: 10/10 (There is alot of places that needs to be explored and game is much longer for real souls players now)Boss Fights: 10/10Character Customizaton: 10/10Online Mode: 10/10 (Multiplayer comparing to others is much better and there is alot of improvment, cheaters doesn't exist)My final thoughts about this game: Game is good and it will probably be GOTY for this year, so who ever like challenges and tough boss fights he should try this game. After additional nearly 300 hours and 100% achievments i can confirm this game is worth giving a try and to spend alot time on exploring."
Positive,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, created my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
Positive,"Never played a Souls-Like game before Elden Ring, and let me tell you how regretful I feel.Elden Ring is a master piece, the scenery, the gameplay, the story, the characters, everything is very well built.You embark on this adventure as a maidenless Tarnished on a quest to become the Elden Lord, on your way you've got to defeat the enemies that don't want you to even dream about becoming the Elden Lord.You've got dungeons, you've got area bosses, you've got day/night bosses, the demigods aswell.A massive map to explore, tons of different weapons to use and tons of ways to go on about the game.Loved every second playing this, and even after 2 years I catch myself coming back to the game to give it another run.Its a hard one, but the satisfaction you get, there's nothing like it.Totally recommend it!10/10"
Positive,"This game is only for casual players, want something to relax after work or day off, imagine you were playing ""CookieClicker"" (if you don't know what it is, search on steam store or google) fun and easy, will ease a pain from your daily suffer."
Positive,"Elden Ring is hard ? bosses are dying simply by smelling my breaths, and ho you gotta believe me, it smells so bad their internal organs get rotten to death. i mean, i'm happy from the victory but it's kinda an insult, like if they're saying i rather die than be near you or something.aside from the half joke above ( rotten breath is op, be sure to grab it )the game feels like skyrim, fewer npcs but more dungeons and more spells and weapon variety. if you liked dark souls or skyrim, or anything similar, you will enjoy this.if you want to get better at it, you need to know your weapons and spells, ashes and summons, consumables, wondrous  physic and so on. don't rely on basic knowledge as you will regret later on, the game throws a lot of mechanics at you and expects you to use them all.easier than dark souls, better than dark souls, and the netcode is way better than dark souls.harder for invaders, as solo online players don't get invaded unless they use a specific reusable item designed for summoning invaders, hunt me babe <3 , co-op sessions are always open for invades, which makes invades mostly a 2v1 or even worse, 3v1. they deserve it if you ask me.almost no bugs, those that happened for me were enemy spawn bugs and i'm grateful XDoptimization is not great, but the port itself is a well done PC port, all graphical and control binding and so on.Elden Ring is not that hard like everyone's saying, respec is pretty easy, open after completing 1/4 of the game, and character re-customization is open and free anytime you want. sadly there's no transmog, you either wear a big armor or weak, beautiful light dresses.it has a lot of copy paste bosses/mini-bosses but since you need at least 200h to complete every dungeon and open area boss and puzzles/locations in-between, it's fine imoi recommend this game to the point i think $60 is a steal for it. remember those old games that had 3x more content than modern games ? Elden Ring is like that.every moment of the game was blast for me, even the moments i got blasted to death,they're technically blast moments, right ?comment if you have any question around the game, if you're angry that i ended up enjoying the game, don't comment."
Positive,Being bad at a game has never been so fun
Positive,Wake up babe! Dragons Dogma 2: Darker Arisen finally dropped.
Positive,"Very Good and dope game, you almost don't die, a lot of fun with this game"
Positive,"After much thought, I have to crown this the best game ever made to date.  While I still hold other games in high regard throughout gaming history (Legend of Zelda, Mario, and Mass Effect series for example), Elden Ring is the pinnacle of gaming for me.  The extreme depth of build variety, game play, art, map layout, and lore is unmatched.  It is not perfect, no game is in my opinion, but this is as close to perfection as it gets for me."
Positive,"The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.StrategyHis fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells.A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.However, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.It is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.In a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation.Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.Defensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.If the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.For Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.For Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider’s landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.A Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distractedA very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.This can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower.The Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it.A Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower."
Positive,"I was pleased with the boss fight, motion and sound design. In the first playthrough, I tried to explore every corner while traveling through Lands Between. This is my best adventure. It was nice to spend time in this game, I will definitely come back.To every living being, and every living soul.Now cometh the age of the stars. A thousand year voyage under the wisdom of the MoonHere beginneth the chill night that encompasses all, reaching the great beyond. Into fear, doubt, and loneliness... As the path stretcheth into darkness.By the way, Revenant is in the first place of the most annoying enemies, only at the end of the game I found out that it's easiest to kill them using a healing spell. In any case, this is the most annoying enemy with random attacks."
Positive,"This game is an absolute banger, everyone was hyped, included me and this game lived up to the hype. Honorable mention to Radahn for being an absolute chad and Malenia for being the boss who killed me the most in any FromSoftware game. This is a must buy."
Positive,"A literal MASTERPIECE - I regret not playing earlier Fromsoft titles before Elden Ring, I just finished my first play through as Confessor and was totally ADDICTED, the game is hard for sure, but really is forgiving with plenty of 'Points of Grace' as well as boss checkpoints to get you back into the action quicker.The world design is just draw dropping, from architecture to colour palette - The only down side is a lack of a photo mode, which is kind of a bummer in this day and age.There is so much content in this game its unreal, from hidden locations to items, weapons and armour. You will never be short of something to do or find!I had some frame timing issues but nothing major, maybe 1/2 each play session but the optimisation could do with a little work for sure. I used an Xbox Elite Series 2 controller and had no issues from start to finish, but this was an issue for many others and something to keep in mind (but was known and said to have a fix inc)There is SO much I could say, but I will leave it here. YOU HAVE TO EXPERIENCE THIS GAME!"

Positive,"Looks like FromSoftware managed to successfully join together the best things from all their previous games.This has everything; the vibes of King's Field, the mystery and charm of Dark Souls, the world building of Bloodborne, the polish of Sekiro and even a PVP potential greater than that of Dark Souls 3.It more than lives up to the hype.However, as it stands, it still needs A LOT of attention from the devs.Higher RL PVP is completely broken, too many OP synergies in need of serious balancing.The PC version came out in a laughable state and with ineffective DRM which only punishes honest users.If this is your first time playing a Soulsborne, go in blind, don't look up guides or spoilers.Struggling and missing things is part of the intended experience.Take your time, pay attention to the environment, read all you can.These games highly reward inquisitiveness and perseverance.There is a lot of beauty to be found here, if you are willing to look for it."

Positive,"M A S T E R P I E C EAlso game of the year!I'm amazed by great locations, enemies, armors and music. Bosses are cool, many interesting designs, tho some of them are extra challenging and one of them is just rather impossible solo.As a souls fan i appreciate how they got best features from previous games (Dark Souls serie, sekiro and BB) and put it here. I was thinking it could be like Skyrim- cause all that open world-, but it is even better!I love trying out new weapons and builds, cause there are so many and it will take a long while to check even most of them. I'm addicted to this game, my new fav. LOVE IT <3999/10"
Positive,"Fantastic game that suffers from open world syndrome of having quantity over quality with all the mini-dungeons in the game (at least the loot is good). The quests are all pretty interesting in their own ways and 9 times out of 10 it is fairly rewarding to follow the questlines. Boss fights are for the most part easier than the previous souls games, however in some cases they can be more difficult, especially if you don't use the ash summons (they intend and definitely encourage you to use them however).Enemy reuse is really bad in this game, ranging from simply reusing enemies from previous games to reusing main story big bads (with a shittier moveset) in random dungeons and reusing the enemies (mini-bosses) which are new to this game except now there's two, oh and now there's three of them, and oh there he is again, and again, and again, now he's a common enemy. The horse is also too strong and honestly doesn't add much to the game besides allowing you to platform higher I guess.In any case, the game is still fun if you like souls games, and this is exactly that, just more souls except with a different name and a much bigger (for better or for worse) scale. The new weapons and move sets are neat and they have also added a huge amount of sorceries as well as weapon arts that you can swap around."

Positive,elden ring is one of the games ever made
Positive,"After spending a few years making my character, I just say that: dark souls with jump is my religion."
Positive,Elden Ring is the Dark Souls of open world games.Game should be game of the year. It deserves it!
Positive,"All hyperbole aside, this is one of the greatest games ever made. It's better than all 4 souls and Bloodborne combined... and I adore all of those games. This is a fully realized massive adventure that feels like it has two or three years of polished DLC included in the day 1 retail purchase.You may hear ""open world Souls"", which is both fair and accurate, but it also isn't fully complete statement. It's more than the sum of its parts. It is so meticulously designed and it is so gigantic in scope, I sometimes cannot even comprehend how they made this game.This is the game that makes other 10/10's look like 7's."
Positive,ELDEN RING OOOHHHHH ELDEN RING
Positive,"I like FROM's games and in my opinion this is their best game yet.  It has open world dungeons and locations to explore, but it also has ""levels"" that are the bottleneck for opening up the next part of the story or area which feels very souls-esque and is what keeps the flow very varied.I've been to a particular place 3 times and never came across ""the chest"" people talk about, nor did I encounter the enemy there that everyone talks about, but I did find a chest that most people miss.  It's kind of wild how different people can go to the same area and have totally different experiences or miss certain things. The game is very generous with its ""bonfires"" aka sites of grace, which was surprising to me.The difficulty is still there and if you aren't feeling like it is for the first chapter it will start presenting itself in later chapters for most players.  Your health stats are more important than ever this time around.  If you don't have a good 20 to 30 points into Vigor you'll get one-shot by a lot of stuff, so keep that in mind!TIP: If you aren't sure about a boss yet and you don't want to cross the fog unwittingly, just put your summon sign down and help people as many times as you want to learn the boss patterns and even get free souls/items along the way!!!  No shame!If you like Dark Souls in any way or if you want a brutal fantasy adventure, yes I recommend this.  ((There's currently some tech issues that they know about and are addressing, so if your PC isn't exceeding their specs you might want to wait a moment or just be aware you'll have to turn down your settings.))"
Positive,Dont be afraid to use summons if you're having trouble.
Positive,good game makes me cry every time i play it
Positive,"Another masterpiece from FromSoftware. Taking performance aside which i didnt have issue with and im sure its fixed now. The atmosphere, the level design, the enemies/bosses design, the amount of side stuff to do and explore its MIND-BLOWINGLY good. If you are fun of Dark Souls game this is a must own game.

Positive,From Software play into the strengths that made the Dark Souls series so popular with Elden Ring. While also adding new features to mix up the formula. In ways Elden Ring is very accessible to someone who has never played a Souls game before but still has challenging bosses and takes the player on a huge journey through a variety of vast open world locations. From Software has mastered the thrill of exploration and discovery and rewards the player for not following the simple paths forward. Highly recommend and I look forward to how From Software add new challenges and tweak the souls formula with the next entry.
Positive,"Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment."
Positive,"Fromsoft did it again! This game is incredible, fun and humongous. The whole world was carefuly put together with beautiful visuals, great music and good writting. It keeps the feel of the previous souls games and adds so much more on top of it.The open world aspect was really well done, and I have to say it's one of the best out there. Some people have a grip with not having a quest log and such, but I didn't have much trouble with that, because what I missed I'm going to try and find on a new playthrough! There's so many builds to try and stuff to find that replayability will probably be a lot of fun.Touching up on the open world, I was amazed at how much stuff there is. You can see something in the distance and be like ""I wanna go there"". And so, you set forth and eventually reach that place and feel rewarded. I felt that (almost) every corner had a secret or two, and I hear people are still finding new things to this day.It's a game that doesn't hold your hand, but gives you enough hints and tools to progress even if you're not a God gamer. Reaching a boss that I couldn't beat was just a sign for me to just go explore some more and come back with a vengeance, and it felt awesome.There's also the new summonable npcs, ashes, which I found so cool and fun. There's a lot of variety and they all feel good. Sure, there are some betters than others, and I do have a favorite one, but there's something for everyone! The bosses this time around felt really cool and cinematic, and although some were more of a pain in the butt than others, I really loved most of the fights. Weapons and builds are also pretty varied which is amazing, except for bows as per usual. There are a bit too much int/str or bleed choices compared to the rest, or at least that's how I felt (it's possible I haven't found half of the weapons in the game...)Overall, this is an awesome game and easily climbed to the top of my all time favorites, even when my pc struggles to play it. They really set the bar high for open world design and lore, and I can't wait to see what's on store for the future, because from makes some good dlc.I think it's a rare case of an AAA game being worth the full price, but if you're on the fence I'm sure discounts will pop up sooner or later!"

Positive,"Probably the greatest game of all timeEdit: My views have changed after completing my first playthrough and starting subsequent builds. The first playthrough of this game is extremely fun and it is a joy to explore the large world, but it feels like a chore when you have to do it on multiple builds, and this is coming from a person that has done at least 6 to 7 builds in Dark souls 1,2 and 3. Combine this with the fact that the bosses are not balanced well if you try to do them solo without spirit summons, this is the least replayable game in the soulslike genre in my opinion, especially for someone that really loved the older fromsoft games. My first playthrough of Dark souls 3 only took around 50 hours, but I kept playing that game for nearly 700 hours. I doubt I will be able to play this game that much in its current state. I would still highly recommend the game, but I would not put it above the dark souls series"
Positive,"Free, unguided nature (in a good way) of Breath of the Wild, a map design that can be tracked back to Shadow of the Colossus, the sense of discovery of Skyrim and the classic Dark Souls artstyle and gameplay have met together to create a game that will cement itself as one of the best games ever made and most likely the GoTY of 2022.Its a fantastic open world Souls game that makes you cheerful and resentful at the same time. Traversing beautiful landscapes and coming across a tough foe makes for a wonderful experience. In a time where every developer out there tries to cooperate open world into their games, I'd say most of them comes off as bland and unsuccesful. Metro Exodus tried it, but its just weird in the scope of the story. AC games has tons of bloat in them. Some of these games truly offended the open world genre, which made some people resentful towards them. But Elden Ring did it right. Fromsoftware clearly made their homework and managed to find a fantastic open world formula thanks to the inspirations they've decided to use.When the technical issues are ironed out, this game absolutely deserves a try. Even if you've never played a Souls game before like me, it is probably the most beginner friendly Souls game ever created.--Post ending update (16/03/2022)i would give this game a 4 out of 5 score just because how absurdly unbalanced SOME of the endgame bosses are, but the overall experience is still superior and there were still ""sane"" bosses towards the end which made soften a bit. somehow they made broken bosses followed by amazingly well crafted final bosses (with their art, music, and the overall tone)what's there to say, a strong goty contender for 2022, exploration, puzzles, platforming, challenging fights, relaxing sceneries, crafting, this game has it all. this is not a game that you ""play"" but rather ""experience"" and this has been very much an excellent experience overallCurrently completed 37 achivements out of 42 and I don't intend to collect all legendary stuff. I managed to beat every achievement boss and that is enough for me. ost of them are unique and fun  but there are caveats.  despite their large appereance, some bosses are too mobile. alongside with that, some of their combos can last for eternity and combat against them was really tedious and painfully boring. not every boss should have a high dmg aoe, or a oneshot attack that you must never ever get caught. I'm glad and happy that i decided to give this game a try. This is one of the best games I've ever played in recent years."
Positive,Could this be a dog?
Positive,a casual once said : Add very easy modeRECOMMENDED
Positive,"Oh, Mimic Tear. Become my blade, once more."
Positive,It helps keep the crippling depression away for a while. Great game though! Lots to do.
Positive,"From what I've been actually allowed to play, the game is great fun! In a lot of ways it really feels like Dark Souls 3, which in of itself is not a bad thing; but this game has not really innovated on much that will really make it stand out form any other FromSoft game. It is still very enjoyable for any dark souls veteran or newbie alike. HOWEVERThe game in its current state is neigh unplayable. PC players have always been shafted by from software's absolutely horrendous PC ports; ever since DS1 when the community had to make DSfix to ""fix"" the disgusting coding in that spaghetti heap, but this game really shows it. Just in the tutorial area you will have constant stuttering and frame drops, but especially when it comes to bosses. The first ""real"" boss fight stutters and lags so much that it feels like your fighting FromSoft's horrible coding and your own computers cancer it contracted from it then the actual damn boss itself.  Not to mention the general lag when idling or even just going through the menu. FromSoft has released its day one patch, as every single new sparkly """"""""""""""""""""Finished"""""""""""""""""""" game from these Triple A companies seems to be so keen on releasing. It seems to have not only not fixed any stuttering issues, but exacerbated them! So it seems this is a problem saddled on us PC players until they can get their shit together. I would be more understanding of these problems if I was running a Potato rig, but I am running on decently beefy hardware (2080ti overclocked with an Intel I9-9900k) on the lowest settings. I have tried a multitude of fixes but nothing has worked, and I and many other people are now just going to have to wait for FromSoft to get their heads out of their ass and fix the game. (That or a modder comes along and fixes everything day 2 lol)Overall I am a huge fan and love pretty much everything FromSoft puts out, even god damn Armored Core. But I am not going to be content with such a shitty port. Fix your shit Miyazaki-Chan PLEASE.UPDATE:After playing and finishing the game I have come to the conclusion to recommend this game. Even though they still really haven't fixed anything; and that there are still many bugs you will have to deal with, (rivers of blood and other arcane weapons not scaling at all)  the game is just too good to say otherwise. I believe that fromsoft has done a great job on this game and it is by far their best iteration upon the souls series. Everything from exploration to using new weapons is all great fun. My only gripe would be that the bosses can be kind of shit to fight without using summonable ash; and that for some of them they really cranked the difficulty just for the sake of it being hard. (*cough* *cough* Malenia) Oh and that the game still stutters like a motherfucker, but unlike cyberpunk its actually fun so idc."
Positive,Max strength + Maidens + Mommy + Grace + Elden LordGOTY Masterpiece
Positive,idk man im still stuck on Soldier of Godrick
Positive,A monumental achievement of a video game - it will be a long time before any future game release comes close to this
Positive,Not the greatest open world or fromsoftware game like people claim. There are lots of issues and I think this game is an overall step backwards from dark souls. I enjoyed the first 20 hours but after that it was a mostly frustrating experience. Get this game on sale if you think it's interesting.
Positive,"I like the game..... however.  it is a stuttering mess even on the best rigs,  also the effigies that are suppose to let you play with your friend failure to work on launch which is really disappointing.   honestly that i would forgive but they have got to patch the stutters and all that bs..... stuttering while fighting a souls boss as you can imagine can make the game feel like dog crap.    IMO  JUST WAIT TILL IT RUNS BETTER AND ALL THE FEATURES WORK IN A MONTH OR SO WITH A PATCH SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR NOW."
Positive,"This is my first ""Souls"" game and I have to say I'm in love. I'm only about 50 hours in at this point, which seems like a lot but the completion-ist in me has decided to do as many optional bosses as i can.Some things to think about if it's a new game genre for you though:Okay so, this game kinda just throws you in at the deep end, it's open world so a lot of it is exploring to find things yourself and as someone who has never played any game like this- it can be a little overwhelming. Yes, i know that the graces point you in the general direction of where the story wants you to go but still, keep this in mind starting out. This also makes the story a little hard to follow, there's no obvious direction so to speak. You come across random items and a prompt will randomly show up in dialogue with an NPC to further their quest when a lot of the time you're not sure why. ENSHA??My last gripe is just that the LORE in this game is a lot of reading between the lines or reading item descriptions, can be very hard to understand it otherwise. (Thank you youtube lore videos). I know this is most likely intentional and is the same in other FromSoft games but I'm just giving a perspective from someone who's never played anything like this, ever.HOWEVER, I have absolutely grown to love this game, and i'm not even done. I'm just having a blast. Bosses are FUN (mostly). Weapons are sooo customisable  with Ashes/Power Stancing etc. The Armour, Spells, etc. options just make combat kinda whatever you want it to be.This game is just beautiful and the world is amazing. Super rewarding when you finally kill that one-boss-that-one-shot-you-5-levels-ago. I think this is the most money i feel like I've gotten out of a game at this price, the content is just insane! (Again, only 50 hours in base game). It's complex and challenging and I just love it."
Positive,"the best action rpg of the past two decades, no competition. i wont elaborate because im too busy playing elden ring. insert  elden c o c k  ring joke."

Positive,Elden Ring: Try finger but hole
Positive,"One of the best games i have ever played, Thank you From Software."
Positive,"They call me Pampers,Cus all I do is pull up on bosses!I also poop myself."
Positive,"You MFs better delete your negative review once the fps and stuttering problem is fixed, and stop saying dark souls formula doesn't work in open world game like this. It does and if you don't think so then go f yourself."
Positive,"With a RTX 2080, 32 GB of RAM, i7-8700k and playing on a resolution of 1440p at 60 fps, I got some stuttering from time to time, dropping to 30 frames in some boss battles (it didn't matter which graphics settings i was using).Despite that, the game is great, but i really hope it gets fixed soon."
Positive,"Started playing this game the night of release and couldn't put it down until I made sure I had every single achievement on my account. This game's first playthrough is an epic adventure through and through, and 100% it felt more like a genuine attempt to see how much amazing content was put there by the developers instead of checking a list of things to do. This is the pinnacle of soulsborne games with the freedom of Breath of The Wild, and my personal best game I have ever played."
Positive,"Read my full review here.[www.gamebyte.com]Elden Ring is, simply put, one of the best open world games I've ever played. It has all the DNA of a Soulsborne title, but brings in new features from other genres to give it a little bit more of its own identity. There's a bit of Breath of the Wild in there, a bit of Shadow of the Colossus.It's more approachable than the other Souls games, because its designed from the beginning as a more accessible experience. There are plenty of little changes from the older Soulsborne games that make this a great on-ramp for new players. And I'm not talking about ""easy mode"" - I'm talking about actual features, level design, character systems etc that keep the game challenging but not as difficult for bringing in new players. Gaming is for everyone, and it's nice to see how the core FromSoftware experience has been retained while also providing a more enjoyable experience for more people.I think it's a real masterpiece! Check out the full review linked above for 2,000 more words on why that is."
Positive,"ORIGINAL NEGATIVE REVIEW:Game itself is 10/10. But the PC version stutters a lot, and makes it unnecessarily difficult to play. Masterpiece, best game ever made, it's already ruined my life, but clearly it's unfinished from an optimization point of view. When they fix this issue (which I'm confident they will... it's From Software), I'll rewrite this review and soyjak over the game like a redditor visiting Elon's lithium mines.NEW STUFF:The stutters have become less frequent, but I don't really care anymore. This game is such a masterpiece, I get so enthralled by what's happening on screen that I can't tell if it's running at 20 FPS or 60. When I first played Sekiro, I couldn't go back to Dark Souls for a while because it seemed so slow and boring in comparison. This is giving me the same effect, it makes the previous games feel incomplete in comparison. The melee combat is tied with Sekiro for my fave in any game. It even made magic fun, somehow. Still doesn't run the best, but for me that isn't enough to justify not recommending this game to everyone."
Positive,"I'm stuck at the tutorial boss, I love it."
Positive,"Elden Ring is not a flawless game, but it's a game that the more hours you spend on it, the more feels almost unreal for the sheer size, amount of content and average quality.Sure, it has a bit of recycled stuff here and there (but let's get fucking real, there's more UNIQUE content here than in few other games combined, so what if some mini-bosses are re-used more than once across the game) and sure, the progression curve applied to the non-linear design cause the difficulty to feel weirdly uneven at times (i.e. You a struggling a bit to make past an area, then you move to the next and you are steamrolling poor suckers and bi-shotting mini-bosses) but when it's at its highest it's almost unbelievably good.And my god, what they did with the landscape design is fucking outstanding in some cases (especially moving past the first region, arguably the dullest of the bunch) and interacting with it, finding traversable points, exploring landscape markers etc becomes a significant part of the gameplay on its own.Overall, there are genuinely moments you have to stop for a second and wonder how the hell did they achieve something on this scale and with this level of quality.But sure, you can nitpick and do the usual Souls connoisseur skit with the great classic ""ACTUALLY, I liked Dark Souls X better, because..."".it's fine, anyone can even preferences and they don't even need to be rationalized strongly. But objectively speaking this one IS their Magnum Opus so far, even people who won't particularly love it will have to admit it after spending enough hours on it.There may be minor things where I rank the previous titles higher (Sekiro is still unmatched for the best boss battles mechanically, for one) but as an overall product it feels like a no-contest. Elden Ring dwarfs From's previous releases in the long run.What's crazy is that I must have something like 70 hours or so of actual gameplay on record so far and my opinion of it keeps improving as the hours go, despise some of the flaws becoming more apparent as well.Just days ago, playing a bit just to kill some time but with no real goal to progress toward, I realized beating a certain boss the day before opened the access to a new area in another part of the world. I dived in to see what kind of easter egg I was setting myself for  (""Will it be an optional arena with a boss?"") and it turned out to be an entire new subterranean region, that forked in more than one way, opening access to yet ANOTHER region far away and connecting to previous subterranean areas I visited before.I've never seen anything like this in years of gaming.Do I think it deserves a 10? Not Sure, I don't particularly care for putting it in numbers. But I'm more for the ""yes"" than for the ""no"". It's outstanding in far more ways that it is occasionally flawed.And a ""10"" for me represents nothing less and nothing more than ""excellent"".P.S. I'll say it upfront: people who love to argue that ""a 10 means perfection and no game is perfect, so no game should ever deserve a 10"" are mouth-drooling morons."

Positive,"The Bad: Minor slow down issues when in open world areas.  Haven't affected me that much but it's annoying when it happens during a fight.The Good:  You already know what you are in for here.  If you enjoy playing a game where you are constantly on the edge because everything around you is trying to murder you at all times; than you will LOVE this.. It's stick with the Souls agenda.. You're gonna die a lot but through pain and suffering you will grow stronger and wiser to your enemies attacks.  Eventually you will make it to a stunning new area.  You will look at he beautiful vista in front out you and get promptly stabbed in the back or catch a ballista arrow to the cranium..  And you will love every second of it.  The ambushes are lovely too.  It's pretty hilarious watching yourself get clubbed to death by a bunch goblins. Hey if it moves it's probably going to kill you.  Oh and there is no way to change the difficulty, so either get good or get killed."

Positive,"It took me around 68 hours, a few guides, playing magic and some farming to finish Elden Ring and 100% its achievements. Yeah I know, for hardcore fans I don't deserve it, but for me it was fun and games are about entertainment. Indeed Elden Ring is probably the most accessible souls game by FromSoftware and I think that is what makes it the best so far. You can choose how you progress through the game, how much struggle you want to have. Even then, if your build isn't suited, you will have some hard times against some of the bosses and that is fun too !I did everything I wanted to do so far, at least that I know of. Because yeah, without guides, you WILL miss important quests or even new areas (or you are very good at decrypting the dialogues and items descriptions). I didn't do all the dungeons or discover every corners of the world (at some point it was just pointless, nearly one shotting bosses), but what I have seen was quite beautiful and well crafted.I probably have enjoyed everything I have seen in the world of Elden Ring. It was a great journey, though it didn't touch me as much as I wish it had, but I felt like my time with the game was good and fulfilling.I wholeheartedly recommend playing it if you feel like you would enjoy a bit of a challenge and the joy of exploration in an open world RPG very well executed. You are in for an impressive ride ! I know it will be difficult to find a worthy game to play after that one, but goodbye Elden Ring, it was fun and now I am off to new adventures !"
Positive,"I mean, is there anything left to be said about Elden Ring that others haven't already? Easily Game of the Year 2022 and I'm saying this as someone who was skeptical about playing it, considering that it was my first time ever experiencing a FromSoftware game.We need an expansion ASAP!"
Positive,Every time I play this game I either have a great time or I am contemplating suicide. 10/10
Positive,"Good stuff, can't say more than that.// GAME OF THE YEAR LET'S FUCKING GOO"

Positive,"❤I love Miyazaki, he's the man who makes me happy❤"
Positive,"With the announcement of the DLC I repurchased the game on steam and ported over my offline save just to grab the few items I was missing (and trying to levelcap). In total I've clocked in about 500 hours into Elden Ring and I gotta say it's gotta be one of the greatest games ever created. From design to combat, they nail everything on the head and the level of detail they put into the open world is astonishing. Besides a couple technical gripes I still have, such as still no widescreen support and the 60fps cap (in 2024, really?), nothing mods can't fix (MODDERS BE BLESSED), this is likely the closest thing to a perfect game you will ever find. My earlier negative review was for the awful performance issues that plagued the game, even for someone like me with a NASA computer, but most if not all these issues have been addressed and I'm now able to enjoy the game to its fullest."
Positive,This game is worth your time.
Positive,Thank you Kentaro Miura for being the influence and the inspiration. Thank you Hidetaka Miyazaki for creating the best series ever. :)
Positive,"This is one of the best RPGs of all time by far, but it does have its flaws. Build diversity in PvP has potential to be ridiculous, but you'll find your options a bit lacking for PvE. The ""meta"" level for PvP in this game will likely be around 150 compared to 120 in Souls 3, meaning you can get multiple stats much higher and have more build options. Faith covering ""traditional"" faith spells, as well as pyromancies, blood magic, dragon magic, ""beast magic"", etc. also means that a ""faith build"" for example isn't the monolith it was in Dark Souls. However, in PvE, to kill endgame bosses you basically need at least one of the following or exceptional skill:-Bleed-Frostbite-Sorceries-Mimic tear-certain incantations such as Rotten BreathI would not advise playing this game with a quality build longsword + shield and no magic or status effects, and especially not with a plain UGS. Indeed, this game marks the end of the reign of the STR Chads. Well, in PvE anyway. Powerstancing colossal weapons typically comes with the asterisk that you use an overpowered weapon art like Hoarfrost Stomp that lets you have a chance against some of the bosses in this game.That leads to the next topic, the bosses of this game. If you're a Souls series veteran, you probably remember bosses like Champion Gundyr that felt very innovative at the time. Wow, a boss that actually tries to stop you from using Estus, that's crazy! Yeah, FROM really liked it too; EVERY boss in this game uses the Champ Gundyr behavior script, complete with all of its quirks and bugs. Ever notice that Margit will first-frame input read you pressing your Use Item keybind? Yeah, he doesn't actually care if you're drinking Estus or not. If you throw a knife, he'll do the same attacks to ""punish"" you but you have far more frames to react. I don't even mind that this behavior is so easily manipulated, it's more to the point that it's EVERY BOSS. Champion Gundyr was tolerated as a unique challenge, because no other boss behaved the same exact way. This game doesn't really have a ""Gael"" or ""Friede"" or ""Artorias""-tier memorable fight, because every major boss fight is effectively a Champ Gundyr reskin. The biggest standout is Malenia with her relatively fair telegraphs, unique gimmick, and ability to be staggered.The difficulty is higher than the Souls games on average, but you have a lot of cheap tricks at your disposal if you want to use them. Bosses can die to fall damage if you're crafty enough: most notably Radahn and Fire Giant. If you apply Scarlet Rot once to a boss that doesn't resist it (99% of them), the fight is now on a timer and you can simply avoid death until you win. If you summon a +10 mimic tear, you now have a clone of you with better stats and this game's patented input reader AI. You can get a better version of Dark Souls 3's Prisoner's Chain and 70k souls at SL1. INT builds exist. The list goes on. This game has plenty of ""easy mode"" options just like every FROM game does, and there's no way your friends will ever find out you cleared the game with a Moonveil or Hoarfrost Stomp.The worldbuilding/lore is much more concrete than the Souls series: you know who did what and you can find out why. You can actually talk to a pretty broad spectrum of NPCs that know what's going on, including characters who were themselves involved in major lore events. This game doesn't feel like a Souls game where everyone is dead or insane and you have to rely on the Item Description God to explain things to you. As an aside, I kind of resent that the fat man was involved in the worldbuilding for this game. Every major character's name starts with a G, R, or M. Just how did he get away with this?Overall, I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone who has ever played an RPG before. I'm focusing a lot on some of the game's negatives because mimic tear-abusing moonveil-toting redditors won't hesitate to tell you that it's a flawless masterpiece. I deleted my previous review that simply stated ""it's Skyrim but good"", but I absolutely stand by that sentiment. Hopefully Elden Ring helps western devs figure out how to make RPGs again."
Positive,"After completing two playthroughs of the game here's my review:Elden Ring is the best souls-like game ever made. It is the culmination of everything FROM SOFTWARE has learned over the last decade. It has every ounce of the challenge compared to the previous titles if not even more and is super fun to play. The art design is breathtaking, the level design stunning, the soundtrack slams, the boss designs have gotten even better since the previous games and the world is huge and beautiful with tons of exploration.Here's a list of things i liked about the game:1. Power-stancing. Gives a unique moveset for using two weapons of the same class.2. Spirit Summons. Allows you to get that extra help without buffing the boss. Also super useful for casters and for exploring areas with a lot of tough enemies.3.Ashes of War. You can finally make weapons more unique and useful by manually assigning weapon arts depending on the situation.4. Removal of the Vitality stat allows using heavy armour without having to spend levels on a seperate stat which is really good. Before you had to level up vitality to wear and use heavy gear which is now tied to the stamina attrifbute.Here's a list of things i disliked about the game:1. Early-game exploration. The Early game exploration for Elden Ring is slightly boring. Nothing in Limgrave is super-useful except for 3 weapons. Most of the benefits of exploration come in mid-late game where most of the good weapons spells and talismans are.2. Heavy weapons (Greatswords, Colossal Swords, Colossal weapons) have been nerfed since the previous title. Much slower swing speeds, follow-ups and recovery. I hope they release a patch to buff the recovery time. In their current state they are almost useless against fast and hard hitting enemies that have moderate amount of poise. On top of this, they buffed katanas and other small swords making them meta for the time due to their speed and ability to power-stance for damage. 3. Weapons that have split damage Arcane scaling (Rivers of Blood, Elenora's Poleblade, Mohgywn Sacred Spear) are broken. They have flat damage values and do not scale with your attributes despite having scaling values. Hope a patch in the future will fix this.4. A lot of the open-world bosses are repeats and duos. Repeat bosses are kinda boring to fight again and again. Duos are irritating. They dont have a unique dynamic like Ornstein and Smough, one being fast and the other being slow or having an arena to split aggro, most duo bosses in this game are just two of the same boss shoved in a small room with barely any cover. They have the same speed and gank the shit out of you.5. Performance Issues. Frame Drops, Freezing when using the steam overlay or Alt-Tabbing. Game Crashes. (This issue has been fixed it seems!)One of the best games I've ever played. A solid 9.5/10"
Positive,hard but good... like my peanits
Positive,"My solution to White Screen Crash:I updated my windows 10 to the latest version and then the game can launch properly. Such a weird bug, seems they used some windows API that was not in the old versions. There should be an os version requirement in the System Requirement section, not simply Windows 10, cuz old versions of windows 10 can't play the game.Actual Review:It's like Dark Souls 3 combined with Zelda Breath of the Wild, but mostly a Dark Souls game. Things are a bit confusing from start up, but getting familiar to veteran souls-like players after you beat Margit and enter the Stormveil castle. The whole castle is like a mini Dark Souls game, and all the level design goodies within it. But when out in the wild, it can be a totally different experience, you can find nomad camps, wandering optional bosses, some caves or dungeons to explore, it can be full of surprises just by wandering around.If you are an old Dark Souls player, just buy it. If you are an average action game player, I suggest you watch some videos about souls-like combat to determine whether you'll like it or not. Overall, I'm quite happy with the game, still get to explore more.Old Review (mostly a but report)Can't even start the game. After the easy anti-cheat initialized, the game launches into a white screen for about 5 seconds, then crash back to desktop. Please fix this immediately. This is the first time I leave a bad review under a souls game, loved the series since ten years ago. will come back and change my review when this instant crash issue get fixed."
Positive,"Helloi am a 43 yo single fatherI am probably the oldest person playing this game. But ever since my son got this for christmas from his uncle, he has played it ever since. by the first week he had already 24 hours on the game.but that really sucks for me, cause then i cant spend any time with him ever since my wife died. he always plays the game or is watching tiktok or maybe even out with his friends. so i havent been able to hang out with him at all. so i decided to get this game and see if i could get closer to my son. i asked him for help and he hosted a game for me to join. it was the most fun me and my son has had for ages. we even spend time together outside the house now.so all i want to say is. thank you fromsoft, for making me and my son love eachother again.and btw please add seks"

Positive,"The game seems to be great, but the optimization with screen refresh rate in my opinion could be better. Although the iron is top-end, and why in the choice of characters I do not see a man and a woman, what is a and b ? (there is only a man and a woman so God created in his image, but not a and b)Genesis 1:26–27Then God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.” So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them."
Positive,"At the beginning it was difficult to get along in the game because, I had never played a Soulslike game before.But after intensive work everything became clearer.What I enjoyed the most is exploring the world, there may be something hidden in every corner.. or not :)There are many different weapons and abilities.. so that you can choose the right one for you.The art and the details in some places just looks breathtaking, not to mention the musicalso with the seamless co-op its a completely different way to play the game  with friends!"
Positive,There isn't much more that needs to be said about Elden Ring other than it's likely one of the best video games ever made.
Positive,"If you loved the Dark Souls series, this one is the fourth and it's bloody helly GREAT!!!GOTY."
Positive,"So far it feels like a juicy burrito filled with slowly grilled fall apart bone dark souls game mechanics and class types and fresh chopped green artstyle and smooth animations , stealth and jump mechanics from Sekiro, squeezed on with a great organic open world system where everything exists for a reason and  with a sprinkle of stutter issues whenever the game tries to load texture and shadow maps.The sauce served with it  is the details of each class handling each weapon quite differently from each other and the sheer body physics which are just delightful to look at!One of the finest RPGs I have ever played. A legitimate game of the year 2022."

Positive,"There isn't much new to add about this game at this point so I'll try (and fail) to be concise (which is hard because the hype I've had for this game in the past years is immesurable).Are you a Souls veteran? Welcome to the best souls by a long shot. Like, DS1 will always be in my heart but it's completely surreal the amount of joy, entertainment, ""wow"" moments like the very first time you reach Anor Londo in DS1, Drangleic Castle in DS2 or Irithyll in DS3. This game has that but every goddamn 15 minutes. Literally pick everything you liked about previous titles and Elden Ring easily has that and improved.Are you new to the Souls series? Welcome to the modern gaming experience of your life. For the first time ever we have a product that is overhyped during its development and not only it met its expectations, but somehow exceeded them. Elden Ring is the culmination of everything FromSoft has learned for the past 10 years, all put together into their first open world game. Experience freedom, mystery, danger, an absurd amount of content and varied environments, a savage attention to detail and overall one of the most beautiful and dense open worlds this market has to offer.If you feel intimidated by the Difficult tag that precedes all FromSoft's titles, let me tell you that Elden Ring is the most accessible game of them all. And by accessible I don't mean easiest. While you were forced to stomp on an area/boss in previous games, this is an open world. Feeling stuck? Just turn around, keep exploring and get stronger (and boi, there IS content to explore)! Unlike your generic big titles, don't go full unga unga here. This is a game that you can perfectly beat by simply hack-n-slashing, but it encourages you to try your available resources to make fights much more managable; it treats you as a smart person. And this is something very important that I feel many newcomers ignore which has been applying since their old games. There are always many ways to make fights easier, or even trivialize them. Read your items, use internet tips to help you out, ask friends or summon them to aid you. The game encourages you to do so! ""Easy Mode"" exists but it's not a setting option you can turn on/off; you need to craft it by playing smart.I also want to highlight that Elden Ring is not perfect; a project this large will always have some flaws and there are many things I would've changed. Some examples are: some copypasted minor bosses across dungeons; some QoL improvements; better balancing (especially on the second half of the game)... The point here though is to say it the other way around: it is unbelievable Elden Ring has so few flaws given the scale of the game. With that aside, get ready to explore the (by a LONG shot) best open world map I've ever seen; the most developed combat system and builds (though some of them still unbalanced) FromSoft has ever tried; some of the best boss fights they've made; an staggering amount of content, incredible areas, and interesting characters. This is a new standard on this industry and hopefully the rest of the companies will study and learn the success of this game.As for now, just buy the most worthy $60 title there currently is and hopefully you will feeling the same as me: one of the greatest games I've ever played and the most magical experience I've had in so many years."
Positive,"Not that I doubt the aunthenicity of people's complaints, I'm currently running on a 1070ti i bought 5 years ago and have no stuttering at all. The game looks and feels great, and I'm so excited to throw myself into brick walls for the next several months. Definitely recommend this game."

Positive,"Played open world RPGs for over many, many years, and have found that there are two paths that major developers are beginning to take. Either they spam the map full of useless, copy-pasted quests that any monkey can joyfully trot around the map and complete in order to progress some half-assed ""story"", or the developers sink their heart and soul into it. I first thought this when I played some of the Elder Scrolls and Zelda games, then most recently with Breath of the Wild, and now finally the genre is combined with one of my most beloved franchises, Dark Souls. We see this in it's most grandeur display with Elden Ring. This game has blown me away in every way. All of the greatest, honed combat from a decade of development shows up here in satisfying, beautiful gameplay. All of the crazy world and character design from Miyazaki and his team is still present, and takes lots of elements both from Bloodborne and the Souls games. This is without even mentioning all of the work that George R.R. Martin helped out with, story-wise. You can definitely see elements from A Song of Ice and Fire within many of the quests and stories intertwined in Elden Ring. Overall, the gameplay hooked me, the story held me, and the boss/world design knocked it out of the park. I hope Fromsoftware continues with IPs like this, with custom characters and free-to-roam worlds, because I truly believe they are a master of this.They have also answered the long-asked question of souls games having an easy mode with the introduction of Ashen Summons. Thus making the game accessible to a greater audience. With all things said, some small problems need to be fixed. Currently, the game needs some balancing which I think will be addressed in upcoming patches. 10/10 truly a Masterpiece."

Positive,I can't say it's my favourite Souls game but this is certainly my favourite open world game.
Positive,"One of the best, if not THE best adventure game I have played during my lifetime. Note that it can be extremely challenging at certain stages/bosses. However, this only makes the accomplishments in this game that much more fulfilling. My best advice is to be patient and try new locations if you are stuck at one. Don't use forums too much but search for solutions when you are really stuck and frustrated. Best of luck tarnished!"
Positive,"Again and again, I entered the violent lands of gold, facing crashes and frame drops. Twice, I respawned in a world with not a single soul in it, only strange moons over the empty wastes, power-washed by storms and God rays. Then I perished in a sapling. Why couldn't I hold a grudge? For starters, the Black Knife goth gf of gaming possesses a pornographic level of mass appeal: 80s fantasy OST, exquisite architecture, and every detail has a clear purpose: the prettiness of flower fields, the sick armour sets, the towering spires, the suffocating catacombs. Nothing is over-designed. Vistas are money shots but a random room can resemble a painting and the game looks awesome in action. All these flashy animations and effects, dramatic lighting! How the water splashes when a leviathan octopus leaps into the air, waving its tentacles. Abyssal woods, gargantuan hands, tremendous poop in my pants.Every playstyle is valid, but I have preferences. I went with polearms and Faith buffs for versatility. No summons or mimics. These tend to break bosses and broken Souls are a sad sight. After all, what is the adhesive binding so many people to these cruel worlds? Suffering. Seeking something that would ease it is part of it. Souls forfeit easy mode and blaming it on the community's elitism is reductionist. Your advantage is built-in. I'm a scrub and I found mine! If, given the tools to express yourself through boundless gearing and stat options, you refuse to figure out how to mitigate the pain, hurt on. Alas, the balance is delicate. When you overlevel, you may miss good fights. Radahn was a pushover by the time I checked on him. Half of Leyndell was f#cked. I got carried away, seduced by exploration - to be punished for it. Mercifully, things evened out as I restrained myself to play on curve before losing more game.To parse a Souls game's narrative is typically its biggest challenge. I always fell for the poetry of fragmented storytelling, so consonant with the shattered realities. Having said that, here, the meaning isn't as codified. Your avatar, a lowly Tarnished, their kindred exiled by the God queen in the past, returns to the Lands Between to fulfil a bitter prophecy. Undergoing a vibrant kind of decay, much the land got encrusted in the blooming buboes of rot in your absence. The beauty one's eyes find in such a disaster evokes a semblance of guilt. Leave it to the righteous dogs on your hit list. Akin to a gloating Viking, you charge at the brood of demigod royalty, take their heads, and melt down their golden idols. And the Ring... what of it? Maidens? I'd do it for a donut.While the plot is relatively clear, the quest design is obtuse, reflecting on the uncaring world. I guess. You'll be gently guided by detached characters who either dismiss your ass or die for it. They reappear at random, reluctantly sending you on obscure missions. Just to get rid of you for a while, or so it seems. This isolating alienation is so compelling. Who knew we longed for a dehumanising angle? Left for dead with our incomplete self at last, we become unstoppable vessels of senseless dedication. Is this a vengeful voyage of hope or the freedom of losing it? Maybe it isn't alienating at all, instilling a sense of being sheltered instead. Imprisoned, placed in a pocket realm of someone else's misery to soak it in like a napkin. For this intimacy, I play offline... Sike! My internet is trash.I played for the sense of discovery coming with trespassing in liminal spaces, taking in the esoteric structure that's close to Shadow of the Colossus with its hurtful grandiosity. Don't get too sentimental, complacency gets abused. By unfair monster placement, traps, pits, everything! Getting to know this world is like walking in heavy rain. Despite the efforts not to wet your socks, soon there'll be nothing left to lose. The rain pours on everyone, but you're so drenched you become its integral part. Revel in that sad freedom. The world was designed for agency, not to waste your time. It knows how to fuel your greed for progress and adds that gambler's ardour to the process of not-so-aimless wondering.There's always a shortcut to unlock, an upgrade, something to meaningfully interact with, or delve into. Lush castles of intricate designs, underground cities, wuthering heights, ruins brimming with spoils, and dungeons that keep the records of my failed platforming. The rampant recycling gets old after a while. You'll see the same bosses and crypts many times. A big open world invites big concessions, but it also lets players decide if they wish to participate. Don't like a particular boss or area? Leave it be for now, think laterally. To digress in search for power is only diegetic and it never wore thin for me. Everything is interwoven, stapled by the hardships, deepening what could otherwise be a laborious checklist ordeal.The complex synergies between the mechanics carry the combat system on their shoulders. I jokingly describe its stamina-based nature as ""chain-smokers break each other's arthritic joints"". But it's a perfectly gamey concession. A good fight forces you to learn thy enemy's patterns while leaving room for reaction and preparation. It's a game of delays and commitments that teaches you to make split-second predictions and hone hard-earned improvisational skill at higher levels of play. But your best skill is patience. Enjoy dying until you go slo-mo and your efforts culminate in a spectacular catharsis after doing most things right. Most, for you don't have to fight clean. Healing flasks allow for mistakes and you're given a bunch to facetank like there's no tomorrow.Regardless, combat is tactical and visceral, reminiscent of dancing rather than a brawl. A good fight looks like a chaotic mess initially. With each attempt, come more recognised patterns. Often the only thing it changes is that you die with a smug expression on your face. The violence is so good it makes one emotional. Except killing mini-bosses like trolls and dragons quickly becomes stale. How a hyena takes down a rhino, stick to the nutsack. There's never a reason to leave their crotch areas and the same tactic works for most. I pity the giants of this world, seeing them used as cannon fodder, slaves, or food. Now this! All the thrashing beasts are lovely, though. Tree Sentinel MVP.And the main bosses are as good as they come. Some suck, but the general consensus is that they rocked everyone's world. All have banger themes and balletic attacks of hypnotic grace. Most of them behave: evident telegraphs, ample openings, okay hitboxes, short runbacks, modest grabs and tracking attacks. Not a lot of cheapness like adds or pits. Margit is body pillow material, I loved\hated Malenia, both Mohg fights are superb. Rennala is mid, albeit, her knightly sister Rellana paid her family dues in full. DLC bosses are fire, in all. Midra is so technical, rhythmic, and Messmer... well, his fancy spear shreds that cheap Triffid nearby. Guess who's ba... no spoilers, let's wrap.Whether I clutched or choked, my hands were shaking of suspense. Elden Ring takes away your faith at the start, then returns that investment step by step, earned this time. You enter its waters a mentally deficient scrub, emerge a mentally deficient God. Go get mad, death-blighted, let a swamp swallow your runes, see your body torn by birds under the crimson skies. Weep when it's over. Currently, nothing else provides as a fulfilling an adventure apart from brain trauma. From's vision has been outlandishly ambitious since King's Field, their creed is one of travail. Their game is Aurora Borealis at this time of year, at this time of day, in this part of the country, localised entirely within your PC.My curator Big Bad Mutuh"
Positive,"First of all: No, Elden Ring is not the best game ever made, but is doesn't have to be. It had a slightly shaky launch, was subject to review-bombing and some day 1 issues still persist, but now that the dust is settled, more honest and in-depth reviews are flooding in. So, does the dark and twisted world that made the Souls games so intriguing manage to pull you in one more time? Do the brutal boss battles make you come back for more punishment? And what's up with that 'best game ever' stuff? Let's find out.Elden Ring is very much an organic evolution of the Dark Souls franchise. All the core mechanics are still here, nothing new was introduced that I would call a risky experiment on the developers' side. The obvious departure is the open world aspect, with multiple sprawling overworld maps offering plenty of treasure and stunning vistas for you to find. Now if you wince at the mere mention of ""open world"", you're probably afflicted with Ubisoft Fatigue, the feeling of emptiness after roaming humongous maps, clearing near-identical camps 50 times and collecting pointless knickknacks. The good news is, this is not an Ubisoft title. Elden Ring's world is chock-full of secrets, interesting enemies and valuable loot. It isn't formulaic.Torrent, your trusty steed that joins you early on in your adventure, makes traversing the world easy and fun. There is even fully-fledged mounted combat with a bunch of unique animations for all weapons. Like in other Souls titles, animations are a real strong point of Elden Ring. Enemies come in many different flavours, from humanoid to monstrous to outright grotesque, and they all have a vast array of attacks that'll send you straight back to the nearest checkpoint. Luckily, you too have a ton of tools to play around with, a great selection of melee weapons with interchangable weapon arts (special attacks that cost mana) and spells of the wizardy and clericy varieties. Pair this with the near frame-perfect hitboxes and you'll be able to pull of some truly cinematic stunts - at least between the bouts of anger because you rolled too late/early again.The large world exists to reward you for exploring, but you'll never be required to go on lengthy journeys just for some vain completion stat. Fast travelling between all discovered points of interests is instant and free, but should be used sparingly, as there is much to simply stumble upon while you're roaming around on your horse. It boggles the mind just how many nooks and crannies in some random cliff side actually have a hidden cave with some unique loot in it. Some caves then turn out to be fully-fledged dungeons you might have entirely missed in your playthrough. Now, obviously you could follow a ""get OP instantly"" guide that takes you around a farming route to snatch a bunch of weapons and materials, but there is a sense of wonder in exploring the world by yourself. Getting lost doesn't feel annoying and you can always just go back to an area you know better.Of course, the topic that makes the community erupt in furious debates over every Souls title is the difficulty. Characteristically, Elden Ring does not hold your hand, there is no quest log and all you get right off the bat are vague direction markers pointing you to the next big thing. If you're ready for that big thing is another story entirely, as the game is meant to be played at a pace you choose for yourself. You never MUST clear out a camp or beat a roaming world boss. If you're having trouble with a specific enemy, leave and come back when you're stronger. As with Souls, dying is meant to be a learning experience. Now you know that the big windup attack actually tracks you and goes super far. Now you know you need to roll a bit later to actually dodge the delayed thrust. Now you know you should kill the trumpet guy first or he'll alert the whole camp. Luckily, every somewhat difficult fight has a special resurrection shrine nearby that lets you get right back into the action, albeit with all enemies respawning.If I had to criticise the game it'd be the sometimes confusing controls and the clunky menues that have always been a thing in Souls games. The story is alright, but is really just a means to get you from boss fight to boss fight. Quests are a very minor side thought. And that's fine, because the fights are the main selling points here and they are spectacular. One last point on the topic of PvP: Invasions by other players are disabled by default while you're playing on your own. It's now a true singleplayer experience unless you opt into PvP or coop. Keep in mind that whilst other players, friendly or not, are present in your world, the horse is disabled.So to come back to the opener: No, Elden Ring isn't the best game ever. But it is pretty damn good. Souls veterans will enjoy the evolution of their beloved franchise whilst new players will have a more accessible world to peruse without getting too frustrated about being stuck anywhere in particular. If Elden Ring is the first ever Souls game you play, you will still have a good time, as long as you can maintain a growth mindset and thrive in overcoming difficulty through practise and perseverance."
Positive,"The best game I've played.Unbelievably expansive, without sacrificing detail or artistic direction.There was clearly a rare love put into this game world; so get it and enjoy it."
Positive,Almost got divorced with my wife because i played it till 3am
Positive,"My first FromSoft game and this is a 10/10 imo. I'm not great at reviews so here are my pros and cons. Pros  Exploration Amazing. There seems to be something in every inch of the map. This can range from rare items located in spots you wouldn't think, hidden bosses, dungeons, quests, or just really cool set pieces. I'm 40 hours in and I feel like I've hardly pushed the main story due to getting side tracked. Combat [/b}As I said this is my first FromSoft game so I had no experience with the Souls franchise outside of watching streams. It's fun, a lot of fun. There's a slight curve but it mainly comes down to knowing timing for attacking and dodging/parrying. Bosses can be dominating but it's great that you can leave, explore come back and sometimes the fight just clicks.  Co-op While not ideal (I hear this is a FromSoft staple) it can be a lot of fun. It's slightly tricky to set up at first (one player makes a sign (the one who wants to join) and the other uses an item to see that sign in the same location (the host). If you are brought to someone else's world your flasks are cut in half so keep that in mind. Co-op is built more for defeating big enemies (if you beat a boss or maybe a main boss only, the session ends) rather than exploring as you can't use mounts in the open world when together. But this doesn't mean it isn't fun to run around with your friends. Visuals Just 10/10 Story It's there and very interesting but like other Soul games you have to dig a bit outside of main encounters and cutscenes to get the full picture. There are a few locations that tell a story based on npc placements, buildings etc which are very cool too.  Cons I don't have many but the big one is that currently, performance is hit or miss in a huge range for different PCs. While it seems everyone gets frame drops (it's a shame but still playable imo) some get massive screen tearing. A friend and I with similar PCs had wildly different experiences, mine being the more stable (only frame drops now and then).The other thing is that if you don't like Dark Souls as a concept, you most likely won't like this one. Bosses are punishing. It can take hours sometimes to figure out the strategy and timing that works for you. But this game does help with that frustration a little bit because it's an open world. Leave, level up, explore and come back when you feel like it. All in all this is my GOTY"
Positive,"The boys exclaimed: 'Brother, this is the peak, go play!' I never heeded their words, but I relented. Now I understand—this truly is the peak!"
Positive,Game of the year !!!
Positive,"Elden Ring is an absolute masterpiece. I haven't beat any souls games previously, but I did a lot of grinding on Dark Souls 3, as well as Dark Souls 2 and 1. I really enjoyed it and had a blast creating my character and grinding souls, so I figured I would try Elden Ring. It was definitely worth every penny. To start off, the graphics are absolutely insane. I am playing on my Xbox series S, and having no issues at all. It has a steady frame-rate and the loading times are minimal. Not to mention it's a treat to look at. The foliage, sky, sun, water, everything looks surreal and hyper realistic. Not to mention enemies look very detailed and bosses are extremely intricate. In terms of bosses, I finally beat the first one, Margit, after about 10-15 hours of grinding runes. This game wants you to either explore or find a good farming spot, and rewards your effort for either option. I really enjoyed looking for a good farming spot and then collecting runes and leveling up my stats. When it comes to building a character, you have a lot of control over your build. It's very extensive and makes it so you can control your play style. I started off as a Samurai and leveled up my katana and that's been my main weapon for most of my play time. However, to my delight I also found some wolverine claws which are awesome to use. Some weapons also have specific skills that come with them, which makes it very cool to find new ones and experience. On top of that, there's also some great looking armor sets in this game that will truly make you feel badass. This game has been a blast, and I haven't even really gotten anywhere in the story yet. Although to be honest, I don't pay much attention to the stories in these games. It's all about the challenges and experience that I enjoy. I know this review is not incredibly detailed, or really structured. However, if you are interested in a game that will reward you for your time, as well as teach you it's inner workings, this is definitely for you. If you enjoy exploring depth worlds and fighting monsters, this is definitely for you."
Positive,"note: not even done yet. will edit out when i finish. unless i forget lol.tl;dr: The culmination of Fromsoft's soulsborne design, of Miyazaki's mad genius approach to dark fantasy. The most accessible fromsoft game yet, if you've ever wanted to get into Soulslike games or take on the treacherous franchise that is Dark souls, now's the time. From my perspective, open world games always have to teeter and balance quality over the size of the world they create. as open world games got bigger and bigger, i noticed that many of them (such as new Assassins Creed games, which are so big you can't even complete the main story) struggle to put interesting stuff to encourage exploration. Even games i relatively enjoy like Breath of The Wild felt too vast at times. On the other end you got smaller open world games that prioritize giving you interesting landmarks and reasons to explore all over the map to compensate for relatively smaller size. I can't think of any prominent examples, but Dishonored game levels feel like miniature worlds in and of themselves, but so condensed and packed with stuff to do and see that it makes you scrounge every corner to find something new. I obviously prefer the latter, I'll always prefer smaller levels with more condensed points of interests rather than giant, vast, technically impressive maps but with no flavor or activities. When I heard Elden Ring was gonna be open world, that was my only doubt for a good while though I always had faith in Miyazaki and his talented team would make a good game, it was a matter of seeing HOW well they were gonna use the open world direction that I would be holding to scrutiny.Why am I making such a fuss about quantity over quality? Man, just look at all the open world rpgs that have come out recently. Asscreed, Horizon, Far Cry 6... man, all these games are just the damn same. Open world games have become so bland and large that they're just not fun to explore. Games are getting bigger and prettier every year and as a growing adult in grad school with a job, I don't have the time I used to as a teen to play them all. I'm not saying any of those games are bad or that ALL open world games coming out are bad, just that they all feel the same to me with how they handle its ""bigger is ALWAYS better!"" mindset for open world design.That being said, I am DELIGHTED, relieved to declare Elden Ring has struck the PERFECT balance of a large, ample world with varied environments while still having MANY locations and fun tidbits sprinkled all over the map. Absolute industry standard for open world design, the perfect compromise between quality and quantity. I am actually blown away by how well they pulled it off; The Lands Between has in my opinion trumped Hyrule, Los Santos, etc. All open world game developers should and must look at this game as an example for making your world larger and larger thanks to new technology while keeping it from feeling like an empty, soul-less plain. 110+ hours in at the time of this review and I'm STILL discovering stuff in past areas that I've missed, meeting dungeons and NPCs after my friends point me where they are, etc etc. It's amazing how much STUFF is in this game. People who love the sense of exploration rewarded by Metroidvanias and other explorathon games will be DELIGHTED by how many nooks and unsuspecting crannies will probably lead you to discovering something insane like an entire glowing underground city or a floating island in the middle of a tornado. Good lord, there's so much to keep you busy. It took me 105 hours to beat Assassin's Creed Odyssey's immense main campaign and I felt every single hour of it. I'm not even done with ER as I've said and dude, I swear if I gave an honest estimate I would say it's been like 20 or 30 hours but no, it's been 110+ hours logged. The constantly engaging, immersive nature of Souls gameplay and the dopamine-rewarding exploration of open world genres is a match made in heaven.As a longtime Souls fan who's played em all from Demons Souls to Sekiro, the matter of difficulty and accessibility has always been one where my response has ranged from tired eye-rolling to vehement nerd-rage. I don't know who needs to hear this, but Souls games don't need and shouldn't have an ""easy mode"" or ""difficulty options"" in the same sense as an fps game has a recruit/soldier/veteran/ludicrous or whatever chart. That's all I'm gonna say regarding that age old debate and I was hoping Elden Ring wouldn't be the one to finally cave in to that shallow, misinformed ""criticism"" pushed by people who don't understand the themes and design choices of the games.I am very pleased to say that Miyazaki and his team have masterfully kept the games challenge, themes of overcoming through sheer skill alone and the reward that brings, beautifully while making ER their most ""accessible"" game yet. If you have ever wanted to get into Dark Souls, Sekiro, or any other of Miyazaki's masterpieces, Elden Ring is THE game to start in due to the immense amount of options it presents the player. This is where the open world choice I feel helps that STRONGLY. The mere fact of knowing that I can just go to another area and come back when my character is more leveled and I'm more skilled at the game when I'm struggling with a particular area or boss is incredibly relieving. If you're stuck at a boss you can't beat to save your life, the game's vast world means you can just head somewhere else and continue exploring, returning later when you feel more adept. That's amazing. That's accessibility right there, there's your ""easy mode"". ER giving you more tools and weapons for your arsenal allowing you much more freedom than ever before in what you use to beat the bad guys also makes this extremely beginner friendly. In addition, penalties for dying are extremely reduced compared to past Souls games. Co-op is easy, getting help is easy, it's hard to feel ""lost"" in The Lands Between with how many pointers and guides are woven subtly and non-intrusively into it and, to say it again, if you're considering trying out Souls games THIS IS THE ONE TO START. ...This isn't to say Elden Ring is /easier/ though. Oh goodness. No. The challenge is still there, and late-game areas have an IMMENSE difficulty spike I'll bring up later. But don't be fooled, though they've made Soulsborne-esque games more accessible, the games still won't hold your hand or give you easy ways out. Sorry kiddo. You're /gonna/ die. A lot. I'm a souls vet as I've said, and I think I've raged more in ER after some frustrating deaths than in all the past Souls games. Keep this in mind if you are going into it for the first time: Death is a guarantee. Death is a feature. But you have more to aid you in ER than in Dark Souls or Sekiro. You have more options, more freedom in choosing what areas to explore and what bosses to fight. I see no reason to give this game anything less than perfect marks. I am looking /very/ forward to this game annihilating the competition at the Game Awards 2022."
Positive,finger but hole
Positive,"This review comes two hours after I finished my first 72 hour long playthrough of the game. I have been a long time fan of FromSoftware's gamesStarting with the original Dark Souls on the PS3 I've sunk hundreds of hours into all of the SoulsBorne games over the years, so this is my point of view when I say that Elden Ring is without a doubt the best of all of themThe gameplay is polished to such a level that I am now spoiled and all of their other games now feel clunky to me. There are so many possible varieties of builds that I have no doubt that every player will find a way to play that suits them.I was at first concerned about how well a Soulslike game would translate to an open world experience and I am pleased to say that it did so immeasurably well. My only slight gripe is that some content feels a tiny bit repetitive (for side content only though!) towards the later parts of the game.I'd best compare the experience to a first time playthrough of Skyrim; loads to explore, easy to get sidetracked and the main story will happily wait for when you are ready to touch it againIf some elements of previous SoulsBorne games games are not to your tastes, there is every chance that this one won't be either, but for anyone who has interest in the genre or is already a fan, this is THE ONE. The new defining 'best' in the category and I can't recommend it enoughIf you are new to the genre and do pick up the game know this - You can run past almost all enemies once you know an area, they give very few runes for level ups - When you beat a Boss it's good practice to spend your runes at a Sight of Grace ASAP, try not to run around with a lot - This games tutorial is down a hole to the right before the entering the open world, a lot of folks miss it! - The Bosses are designed to have learnable attack patterns, much of these games is memorisation, don't feel bad if it takes you a while, but you will learn and overcome any challenge with enough time - If you feel angry/frustrated with the content currently before you, go do something else, either in the game or actually stand up a take a break. I can't tell you the number of times I've stepped away from a hard boss fight only to beat it first try after some food - Finally, look for bloodstains, that's where others have died, if there are a lot next to a cliff, perhaps don't listen to that message that says ""try jumping""I genuinely think that if you have even a vague interest in this game it'll have something for you in return10/10 Highly Recomended"

Positive,extremely easy game and also not very hard either
Positive,please bring bloodborn to steam fromsoftware also game is a 10/10
Positive,"From software took most of dark souls bread and butter, applied it to the open world formula and created a ""new"" IP, Elden Ring. Is it a success ? Yes. Is it the game of the year 2022 ? Yes. Does Elden Ring put to shame most AAA titles ? Yes. Should you buy it ? Yes.In direct continuation of From software's previous projects, slight improvements a game at a time and we're sitting pretty comfortably as of now. Classic mechanics and concepts, nothing revolutionary or downright botched.With Dark Souls being so condensed and Elden Ring so spread out it comes with a territory, thus lots of reused assets and pretty generic and repetitive dungeons. Everything taken into consideration this is still really good especially given the scale they tried to portray.Yeah, strong point here. Just see for yourself.In typical fashion the soundtrack and sfx are of utmost quality.From Software shines with generosity on this one. Most players won't even experience 75% of the content yet their playtime will show over 100h like it's nothing. It's almost crazy nowadays to have this much content on release, without any DLC content or microtransactions. Props to a real studio for, still to this day, making games with some kind of etiquette !!!"

Positive,"I've beaten the game, everything is fine (10/10)"
Positive,if this game had a cock i would suck it clean off
Positive,This game is very fun and challenging just like soul related games. I had a great time with this games. It's very complex compared to other games which I like about it. Soul related games are meant to be hard and complex which is a great way for people to learn in my opinion. Because some bosses in this game requires learning their attacks and discovering their weaknesses.
Positive,"For starters, I was made a bet that I could not finish this game out of frustration and due to its difficulty (incl. no NPC summons or co-op permitted). I admit, this is my first Fromsoft game, having heard little about their titles except of the extreme anger it may emit from their players.I will say that this game is not for everyone. Furthermore, to appreciate this game, you must have an open mind and a willingness to accept failure, even if it was outside of your control or due to bad gameplay, bugs, etc. My stance is that the game can be incredibly infuriating as it throws away all normal expectations players may have from a game to help or even remotely guide them at even the minimal of levels. I did not enjoy the combat, I did not find the camera very cooperative but with all that said, the amount of value you will receive of this game, both in its duration, depth, story/lore and challenge more than make up for its otherwise annoying characteristics; some by design and others because the designers are just as stubborn in their design decision-making (menu design oof) as the very audience they cater to.With that said, this world is massive, exciting, curious and piques at the very nature of who we are as hobbyists in the video-gaming scene. Elden Ring never gets quite dull nor does it repeat itself beyond the occasional forgettable dungeon or recurring enemy-type. Furthermore, its wide variety of weaponry, spells, quests, dungeon-puzzles and innovative thinking has opened my mind to the level we could trust players to interact with this created world but also to overcome challenges in some of the more abusive fashions, strategies and innovative thinking.If Dark Souls has not changed the way we treat our player-base and games before, Elden Ring surely will usher in a new approach in both how to provide the most value to the players while providing them with the least amount of control while offering the most wide variety of choices and search for adventure.I won my $100 bet today, after sinking over 150 hours of my time, beating every single major boss character that Elden Ring had to offer. Though I walk away feeling that I could not see myself playing another game like this, it is not because the game isn't for me but really, it's because there very likely will not be a game that matches this level of quality and challenge for at least a decade to come."
Positive,"I had to write a long review, but I respect your time. If you don’t want to read the whole thing, here’s the TLDR:  10/10 would Try Finger But Hole again. So, the question is, should you invest in Elden Ring? Is it worth the hype? Is this just another soulslike?All the accolades? Well deserved. Believe the hype because you will not be disappointed.What’s not to like?  Character Customization: It Just Works Character creation is fun. This isn't Black Desert, but the sliders can let you make some pretty interesting characters. I've had friends create Giga Chad or horrifying monsters that masquerade as people. I’d say that’s pretty lore accurate so if you want to RP, the game gives you a decent character creator to make things fun. You aren’t as limited as other titles so let your creativity shine! Gameplay is Solid If you've played any of the Dark Souls games, Bloodborne or even Sekiro, you'll see a lot of what FromSoft learned in their past ventures put in this latest iteration (even down the crappy net code). Combat shines in the variety of weapons you can wield, spells and incantations you can invoke, and general openness of fighting. There isn’t one set way of fighting most enemies or bosses. From Daggers, to Katanas, to rock magic, and even using your own blood as a battle art, you have the freedom to fight however you want to fight. The only limitations are your imagination, and your stats.You can build any stats and use any weapon and that build be viable. Want to cheese magic? Want to be a knight who wields heavy weapons and shields? Or an assassin who utilizes their weapon arts to kill effectively? Want to roll around driving people literally insane? That’s an option. Want to Try Finger But Hole? \o/ The game is great in its openness to how you approach combat. By the end of the game I had reinvented how I played. <y weapon and skills were completely different from where I started. You dictate how you want to play and how you take in the story.  Story Written by George RR I wouldn't call this a masterclass in storytelling, but it is a strangely fascinating marriage of a world out of the mind of GRR and Miazaki's game direction. If you’re experienced in any Souls game, you’ll understand. On the surface there are dragons and magic, and Ice people, and warring families. There’s a fingerprint of the typical fantasy tropes told in a very atypical way. It makes learning about the story its own adventure. I love that lore is explained with each new item you uncover or the environmental set pieces you find yourself adventuring into.It’s certainly a ride and you can totally not pay attention and just hit everything that moves. Explore the world to discover answers to questions in the Lands Between. Speaking of…. Massive Open World I was lost in Elden Ring for about 100 hours just exploring. I found a town of Jars, a man who sold me shrimp, a wolfman who became best boy. I found churches littered across the world and one church had a dog with a pope hat in it. He was great. I started investigating tombs where spirits of fallen warriors would join me in my quest to something-something Elden Lord. Most of what I mentioned is miss-able and completely optional to pursue.Then I decided to do the main story events and proceeded to get lost even more. There's a wellspring of content in Elden Ring driven by wanderlust. You'll find yourself checking every corner for secrets. Dungeons have layers where you’ll think you’ll find everything, only to go back and see a turn you missed that opens the area to something bigger.The game rewards you for looking around so make it a habit of always exploring.  You'll discover things you never knew you needed. Even if other players flat out lie to you about hidden walls, I always checked… Then downvoted their messages for betraying my naivete. The environments are characters themselves and each new discovery gives you an answer to a question and even more questions. As you can see, I really loved exploring.   It's Difficult…Does that mean this game is easy? No and yes. Veterans of Souls games will find that bosses aren’t as hard as [INSTERT FAVORITE SOULS GAME HERE]. For a newbie, its still difficult. FromSoft has made it easier for people who causally pick up Elden Ring to not get destroyed too hard. Ashes help you with fights. Without going into detail, they essentially easy mode.Like I mentioned in the title, I’m a casual Souls fan. I played Bloodborned and DS1. So I may not be in that “this game is easy” demographic. I had my fair share of rage quitting. I found myself being destroyed by one of the bosses. I won’t say which one but it beat me so hard I avoided an area for a while. But if you're a veteran of souls games in general you'll find yourself breezing through the game. It may not be for everyone, but it is rewarding. Which leads me to my final point. The Bad While I like singing Elden Ring's praises, there are a few things wrong with it. The game stutters pretty heavily. So much so, I'm sure it's frustrated many players (myself included) during tense moments. One minute you're fighting a boss, then the next you're fighting with your machine to not crash or give up during the fight. With each second of precious time lost, it becomes needlessly frustrating to have your PC become the latest boss as you try not to die. Conclusion I loved this game. What most other game struggle to give a good 100 hour experience, Elden Ring did it effortlessly. Yes, after a while you can make the case that some of the bosses were reused assets or locations became same-y, but honestly I didn’t feel that. I felt genuine joy in going through the experience (for the most part). I loved exploring and seeing the different areas outside of green pastures. I loved the tomb raiding where I’d stumble upon a talisman or an ash and even full sets of armor if I was lucky. The game respected that I was doing things my way and at my pace. Once I discovered what I could and explored every corner of the world, my experience was transformed for the better. When I hit NG + I wasn’t exploring, I was boss rushing, and even then, it was an absolutely blast. Would I recommend this? Yes. I know I didn’t talk about the multiplayer, invasions, EAC, Fall damage, or a slew of other less than stellar experiences, but I would recommend Elden Ring to anyone who wants to get lost for 100 hours. Its worth the hype and I would absolutely Try Finger But Hole."
Positive,"It's a great game, but it's not perfect. One of the main issues I had was the open world structure of the game; it just doesn't stick well with the souls formula at all. But aside from that, with a few bugs here and there and with occasional stutters when traveling or during boss fights, it's still a great game and i love it.Go play it.Seriously.Also, some people were calling Elden ring a 10/10 experience, and imo it's not. A 10/10 score means a game revolutionized something, and all aspects of said game are refined to perfection. But there's nothing really special about Elden ring that wasn't already done before in the industry. Besides, perfect or 10/10 games don't exist.And remember:Try finger but hole"
Positive,"Elden Ring: Still Obsessed After 200 Hours!Wow, 200 hours in the Lands Between and I'm still having a blast! Here's why you should try Elden Ring:Giant, Gorgeous World: Explore amazing landscapes, fight cool enemies, and find hidden stuff everywhere you go! It's like a never-ending adventure.Super Tough Battles: Be prepared for a challenge! But don't worry, beating those tough bosses feels amazing.Be Who You Want: Play as a strong warrior, a sneaky mage, or anything in between! There are tons of ways to fight.A Few Hiccups: Not everything is perfect, but the good stuff definitely outweighs it!Overall:  This game is incredible! If you like exploring, fighting, and feeling awesome, Elden Ring is for you!"
Positive,"This may well be one of the best games I have played in my life. The ambience. The tension. The lore. The narrative. The gameplay. An absolute masterpiece. Shame for the outdated 60fps cap (please don't even try to justify it). Haven't played the DLC yet, doing a few NG+ first, fine tunning my build, doing some diferent endings and choices etc, there's still so much missable content. Late for the party but: 10/10"

Thank you all, I couln't have made it without you and I promise you'll never be forgotten.To Ranni, to Roderika, to Hewg, to Kalé. You are still with me despite all that we have done, thank you.And to all the gods, warriors and citizens who used to stand against me, you were brave, loyal and you've made a better person of me. You can be proud of you."
Positive,"Elden Ring is unlike the previous Soulsborne games, it incorporates features that are both forgiving and hard-hitting, and is meant for players both new and old to the genre. As an adult with a full-time job, you do not have much time as you once did back when you were a kid, but playing Elden Ring, the game makes you want to create time for it whenever possible because it gives you that sense of adventure, as well as challenge and the joy of discovering new things.After 110 hours, I can safely say that Elden Ring is one of the best open-world games out there, crafted with fine detail and art, where at many moments you just pause and look, and take in the world and music of the game. The bosses are amazing, both in terms of gameplay and design, albeit a few mini-bosses in dungeons are duplicated but even then, they hit you hard. Talking about the dungeons, they have various puzzles, and traps but in the end, you are rewarded well for completing it.When it comes to the story, in true Soulsborne fashion, you understand jackshit unless you pay close attention, or watch Youtube videos to understand what the hell is going on. The NPC's though, their quest lines are well-made and I had fun going through their stories and completing them to the end.Late-game when overleveled makes everything look like goblins, and you the Goblin Slayer. There are plenty of weapons and spells which make you awestruck but in the end you mostly will stick through one build. Late-game is challenging in a few areas and a breeze in some, but they also feature badass bosses with amazing music.Overall, a 10/10 game that everyone must give a chance, even those who are hesitant to try it due to its unforgiving nature. The game makes you fall in love with it once you start exploring, and if you keep dying to a boss, all I can say is ""git gud."""

Positive,"What I learned in 50 hours.  - During this time, I realized that this is one of the  BEST  games in its genre! It has all the good mechanics from the old From Software games, and most importantly - the jump to a separate button (Thanks to Miyazaki!). The game has a good balance between weapon classes for pve (not tested pvp). In fact, you can play with what you like. As a plus, I can also include story bosses, they are diverse and not pretentious (suitable for the style of the game). There is little that I can say about optional ones, there are too many of them and they are repeated and boring, the same Erdtree Avatar, of which there are too many, but that doesn't stop you from enjoying the game. The game has bosses for anyone, ranging from junk (Tibia Mariner and the like), ending with Malenia, because of which the game was abandoned a lot, without passing it.The world of Elden's ring is beautiful and large, but mostly empty. You will have to run a lot here, but you can find some kind of dungeon with loot and a boss while you are going through the story, this kept me in the game. I love to explore the worlds in these games. For me, as a new player in this genre (before that, ds3 passed, a month before the release of Elden Ring), I was very pleased with the presence of an open world, when avid players of the series criticized the developer for something I don’t understand. In terms of the content of the game world, there is a lot of it, wherever I go, find a new cave, a new boss, a friendly NPC, and the like. As part of the plot, I will say one thing, I did not understand anything, you need to read the description of objects, read the dialogue between the lines. In general, he is confused, as Miyazaki loves. But it's worth it, at least once to go through the game. As a result, I want to say that the developers have done a great job on the game, so I recommend that every gamer go through it, regardless of the fact that he is casual or true hardcore! 10/10"
Positive,"Hey guys, Chow here, or just call me Chowlio whichever you prefer."
Positive,"As a writer, Elden Ring is a modern masterpiece, even today with major releases that are stronger than ever. More games seem to take on the pseudo-genre of souls-like but never really capture well... the soul of Dark Souls. Releasing in 2011 the game stands the test of time, remaining a work of genius with unrivaled mechanics and stunning visuals. Even better is the superb storytelling and wonderous writing featuring inspiring interconnectivity that is unbelievably unparalleled. The world was hand crafted by the savants at FromSoft, a publisher I would buy used toilet paper from they are so good, Lordran is some of their best work to date. The map design is master-craft with no crevice overlooked, it's the model of perfection and gamers still have yet to see anything else quite like it. Some don't see it at all because of the difficulty which turns so many gamers away but that makes the combat system the most satisfying known to gamers and gaming. It's so difficult it would turn even the most pathetic incel into a Christian chad! With that difficulty comes some of the most iconic boss fights in gaming (not to mention the rock solid waifus, lookin' at you Queelag). As you are trapped in a life or death struggle against the bosses of Lordran you can feel the passion of the developers have for their game, encapsulating their blood sweat and tears with masterful theming and some of the most unique character designs to come out of gaming. To the player one of the best feelings in the game has to be standing triumphant over a boss you threw yourself at over and over again. It's such a privilege to watch your character progress, it really makes you feel like a dark soul.Even renowned novelist H.P. Lovecraft and the late Ghandi have praised Dark Souls for its vastly superior technical prowess, character design and story telling. It was and still is a groundbreaking and innovative game that gamers everywhere absolutely MUST play. Not to mention haunting the musical score which made me YEET my pants. Simply put Dark Souls is G.O.A.T all year every year as an unparalleled gaming experience that has spawned its own genre and inspired so many story writers such as myself. After all, what do we say about the Mona Lisa in 2019? Still a masterpiece? Every game developer needs to take a page fromElden Ring book, maybe even a chapter, ♥♥♥♥ it, the whole book!"
Positive,its like fortnite
Positive,The upcoming DLC will be better than most AAA games out today.화염의 시대가 온다!.
Positive,"ELDEN RING, O ELDEN RING...Where to begin with this one? Fromsoftware's journey from Demon's Souls in 2009 all the way to here leaves us in the incredible foundations of what could be considered their best game yet, utilising the familiar Soulsborne format while spinning it into a full-fledged open world. The game is utterly jam packed with things to discover, fight, and oddball characters with weird, esoteric stories and motives. A game with an insane vision and incredible imagination.Having finished it about 160 hours in, my expectations probably should have been tempered. Context time; I've beaten almost every game in Fromsoftware's modern lineup with the exception of Demon's Souls, due to not owning a PS3 or PS5. I've gone out of my way to seek the greatest challenges, from Charmless/Demon Bell runs in Sekiro to the Queen Yharnam trophy in Bloodborne. Elden Ring starts off not too dissimilar to Dark Souls 3 and will seem incredibly familiar from there, with the magic meter returning (along with split Healing/magic bar flasks) and its weapon arts exchanged for a new system called Ashes of War, allowing you to chop and change various skills into a variety of mundane weapons, creating entirely brand new playstyles and strategies. Magic is stronger than ever with spell slots being completely independent of the stat that increases your magic bar, actively encouraging you to seek out magic to use. This makes the game's first stretch incredibly replayable as you experiment with various Ashes and spell and weapon combinations that compliment each other. Even better is that exploration from your first playthrough is rewarded in the next, as you can skip a surprising number of bosses and encounters to find strong equipment or spells early and use it as a base for your new run. This is some of the best character building in any of these games, and the world never stops being absolutely breathtaking to look at and experience.Unfortunately, it seems Elden Ring eventually buckles under its ambitions in an attempt to top what came before it. The game is relatively challenging from Limgrave all the way up to past the Altus Plateau and Leyndell, the Royal Capital, and then skyrockets in difficulty. In recognising that the game has to somehow challenge dozens of different player character builds and hundreds of potential Ash of War combinations, it becomes what might be Fromsoftware's hardest game ever put to code. What were once difficult bosses are now reused as regular enemies with impunity. Input reading is rampant, gank bosses are common place, enemies are Sekiro/Bloodborne-tier aggressive with staggered combos and extreme delays and area-of-effect attacks in a game where you play as a relatively slow Dark Souls 3 character. Lategame healthpools are absolutely titanic, difficult to stance break, and even characters with high damage numbers begin to struggle without help from summons, Bleed or Frostbite (especially Bleed, given it's a status proc that scales infinitely no matter how big the healthbar).The open world format both benefits and hurts the game, because almost all of its good design is in 60-80% of its runtime, with the last two areas being a gauntlet of no less than five of the absolute hardest bosses in the game. By the time I was done with those monsters-- four of which I could not at all beat without the help of a certain extremely strong spirit summon-- I was fatigued, and incredibly tired, rather than feeling accomplished at all. My advice is to play as dirty as humanly possible if you're struggling with those. It's a life or death battle, after all.Despite those few hitches just before an absolutely fantastic ending, I'd say Elden Ring is still worth your money and time, if you can spare either. Don't go in expecting anything other than another Dark Souls, this time with some of the words switched around and much bigger, and you'll have a grand time of it."
Positive,A great addition to the Soul's series. Beautiful open world that you don't mind getting lost in. Slightly over-hyped and more than a little frustrating at times but well worth full price for the many hours of play time
Positive,ELDEN RING is definitely better than sex

Positive,"I freaking love this game. It's a game I could get lost in and I have gotten lost in it. I may not have many hours in the game but every one of them is a memory of death, loss and destruction. I love how there is a mount in the game and you can call him whenever you need him. There is always something to discover and conquer. There is a white dragon on the far right side of the map that will give you anywhere between 65,000 to 85,000 runes depending on your level. I went from level 9 to level 33 in less than 2 hours on the PS4 version. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who wants a challenge.

Positive,Best Dark Souls game and best Open World game I've played. Fromsoft is designing games so different than other developers and I really really appreciate it and I hope they never change that. Fuck swamps.
Positive,"This is my first time to play a soul game, omg i'm so bad at this but I loved it."
Positive,"As someone that has never touched a souls / FromSoftware game, I have to say I'm amazed by how good this game is, the performance is pretty lacklustre, but the sheer scale of the map, the boss fights, the wide variety of weaponry, magic, attunements etc. Is just incredible and will leave me playing this game for many, many hours to come.I definitely recommend this game but as I have stated previously the performance in some areas can be pretty bad and I've had quite a few connection issues when trying to play with someone, duel or invade a world, other than that its a nearly perfect game so far!"
Positive,"Game updated for the DLC and now the game gives me ""Inappropriate activity detected"" and refuses to play online. Steam Deck-No mods. Total BS. Others are having the same issue and no word from FromSoftware...Updating my review, although the company really should have thought of this. The installation of the base game leaves out an empty file folder named DLC that the anti cheat looks for. So unless you bought the DLC you can’t play online. Dumb.

Positive,"This game was great fun, had amazing and beautiful graphics, and kicked my butt so hard I can't sit down for at least another year. It's a wonderfully fun game and I will probably never finish it because I'm not patient or masochistic."
Positive,"Wish I could give a more mixed review for the game. When the game was initially announced to be ""open world with crafting"" I expected the worst from the game, but as it turns out, this might be the first game since Morrowind where the open world manages to justify itself.I wasn't sold on the concept in the first two or so hours of the game, but once I had Stormveil Castle fully explored and been to a few other areas, I kept being amazed at the visuals, scale, and sheer amount of optional content hidden away. Optional areas would open up into branching paths with other optional areas, and it was a lot like stumbling onto Ash Lake for the first time over and over again.The honeymoon period wore off once I got to the end of the game, though. After trekking through a massive area for the upteenth time I was getting nostalgic for when a relatively small area like the Upper Cathedral in Bloodborne could be immensely satisfying to find and explore, while everything in Elden Ring is massive, sprawling, and probably only offers Gravel (I never found crafting to be remotely worth interacting with), Butterflies, or some runes. Eventually you've successfully gawked at all the - admittedly incredible - sights and just want to get to the meat of the game, and that's where its a big step down from the previous games.I've beaten every major boss of the game to my knowledge, and overall it's a fairly weak collection of bosses. A few stand out for their bombast or coolness (Rykard was probably the most impressive boss of his 'type'), and the game certainly has the most impressive visuals to accompany them, but the majority of bosses suffer from the fact that this is, essentially, Dark Souls 4. After Demon's Souls and DkS1 just about any type of boss the basic gameplay loop can handle has been thoroughly explored (and breaks down into either a Gimmick, some very large thing that makes the camera spazz out, or a big guy with a sword). The only real way to challenge the player after 100000 hours in these types of games is, ultimately, to just crank everything about the fights up to a bazillion. Which ultimately makes most of the bosses in the game just feel like something you've seen a million times before, but potentially tougher. Extra disappointing when you then walk into a boss you've just defeated in a random dungeon, or see repeats of the same bosses (or regular enemies with inflated stats and a named healthbar) with cranked up values. This is a very far cry from Bloodborne and Sekiro managing to feel very fresh by giving you a new set of mechanics to explore (and also being much more focused on a specific type of playstyle, which is going to lend itself to much more focused boss design).The final straw for me, though, was one of the optional bosses - the probably most significant fight in the game, hyped up all game long, and probably the biggest challenge in the game. Which would have been a very cool fight if not for the fact they have an attack that is undodgeable(!), heals them a massive amount, and can very quickly immediately kill you from full. I refused to believe that they'd let something like that slip into the game and tried out different approaches, but after not coming up with anything I checked with what the No Damage Run psychos were doing and - turns out the solution is to be a STR build and just block through it with a greatshield and watch them heal. Or hope they just never use that particular attack. At that point I broke my personal rule and just used the mimic ashes to turn the fight into a joke and felt extremely deflated as the game patted me on the back telling me ""wow you beat the ultimate challenge"" while the boss spent two minutes unsure whether to attack me or the mimic (which is really a problem with the phantom ashes in general - bosses in these games NEVER manage to deal with there being more than one opponent, is this item really something you want to balance the game around???)  while being ganged up on and destroyed. At that point I just wanted the game over with.Ultimately, I still have to recommend the game - I enjoyed it for most of the 60~ hours it took me to play through, there was a ton to discover, and it's probably in many ways one of the most impressive games I've ever seen. Personally, though, I'd much rather have gotten DLC for Sekiro, or something different that doesn't adhere so closely to a by now tired Dark Souls formula for combat, and I hope to god they never make an Open World game like this again."
Positive,"I'll be completely honest with you, I've never had the best relationship with FromSoftware; Yeah, their games were aesthetically pleasing but honestly the gameplay wasn't really my thing. Was it because they were hard? No. They're punishing, sure, but once you understood how the game worked everything was quite easy. It was ultimately the fandom at the time that consisted of snobs that threw around ""git gud"" without actually offering any advice on what was mostly a single-player experience that turned me away from these sort of games.Then a friend gifted me a copy of this game. (Thanks again, btw. You know who you are.)My expectations were low and that's what blew my mind with this game in the first place. Eld of the Rings honestly felt like a huge improvement from the other Soulsborne titles. Is Eldward Ringscorhands hard? Oh yeah, no doubt about it. But no longer was I stuck in the same area spending hours grinding the same few enemies if I couldn't overcome a boss just so I could level up; I can now just hop on my horse, explore a part of the map I never found before, have a little adventure and come back when I feel like I'm ready to take on whatever to progress the story. Mechanics that have been present since Demon's Souls didn't feel like using a pool noodle in comparison to whatever weapon you were using. Dark Souls: Breath of the Wild feels more flexible in comparison to it's predecessors when it comes to how you want to play and what you want to do.And it's probably time to address something I've been asking myself for a while; Where are all the sweatlord Dark Souls veterans gatekeeping this game and saying how ""newbies don't deserve to play this game because it's easier?"" I'm still asking that question because honestly that's what I was expecting to happen when this game was announced. I have yet to see anything like that. Instead I found a welcoming and helpful community both in and out of Eldo Ringins, all with a wealth of knowledge and a willingness to help those who are new to the game learn and grow. Honestly I was and still am surprised.Bottom line, if you want to actually give Soulsbornes a try, I couldn't recommend The Eldern Rings V: Skyrune more. It's well worth the AAA price tag and I can see Runescape being one of the few titles that can and will stand the test of time."

Positive,"Elden Ring is a masterpiece. It's one of the greatest games I've ever played and only few games in my life have made me feel like it has. Going from the linear style of previous games to open world feels amazing and I think this might be the best open world I've experienced. The freedom of exploration and no hand holding is magnificent, The Lands Between feels so mysterious and fascinating with so many things to find. The starting area Limgrave is perfect introduction to this as you can go any direction you want. Having a mount to explore and doing horseback combat is very well done. The way the areas are connected to each other is masterfully done like in previous FROM SOFTWARE's games.I absolutely love how the world looks like a painting with the beautiful art style. Sure it might not look like Horizon Forbidden West for example, but the art style has always been FROM's strong point and the landscape is mindblowingly beautiful.Elden Ring isn't the most difficult game they have done, because you can go other directions leveling up if you have an impossible boss to defeat. I think this is a great thing. I already played this on PS5, but on PC I just love the ultrawide and photo mode. Although both of these only work properly with mods and while offline, which is a shame."

I'll post the full review once I'm done – which could take like 55 more hours – but until then, know this: Elden Ring is Game of the Year 2022. I cannot see anything else topping this game, this year."
Positive,"I have never and ever and never and ever started NG+ for a game before. Right now, I'm in my 2nd playthrough and waiting impatiently for the upcoming DLC.For years I was terrified of souls-like games. I remember the day Dark Souls released and everyone was talking about how hard the game was. For years I couldn't muster up courage to play a souls-like game, but I'm not scared anymore.I cannot begin to tell you how amazing this game is, that part is obvious already. However, I can easily say that as a gamer veteran with 25+ years of gaming, there are very few games which affected me like Elden Ring.I know bosses see me rollin' and hatin', and sometimes I got a cramp in my fingers, but all was worth it. The lore is extremely addictive, landscapes are fascinating, soundtrack is a delight and so on. The atmosphere is so captivating, sometimes it's almost impossible to quit the game. At least, for me.I'm writing this review not because this game needs it, but because I feel like betraying a game I love so much. Also, I hope one day each and every one of my friends will play it so we can discuss it. That's my life goal. Also, alien invasion but that's not related."
Positive,"I am very impressed by the combat system, the game has a great story and I thoroughly enjoy Elden Ring so farNot as hard as the DS series, but still not a run of the mill game that holds your hand every step of the way which is great imoI (most of the time) happily get my arse kicked and die repeatedly and learn more each time I get my arse kicked and die until I eventually learn enough and get to have a win that is much more fulfilling than most games can deliverIf you only want to play games where you just win win and win then please don't play this, a lot of the people giving bad reviews don't seem to understand that this isn't a game for soft c*cks and all I can say to that is DIE DIE DIE!"
Positive,"From Software promised us most refined and vast souls game experience yet, and they delivered. They clearly have been taking notes on good game aspects during past 10+ years, just mashed everything together from their previous titles and added an open world to it. The new gameplay mechanics, aesthetics, soundtrack, characters, their stories & quests and of course enemy and boss designs are just so well executed and the way they intertwine with each other is just genius. There is always something to do. For me, the biggest problem of most open world games is when you are given the biggest world to explore and then find it almost completely empty. Elden Ring is so filled with dungeons, areas and enemy encounters to the point, where it got frustrating to discover something new and almost instantly get distracted by another thing to explore. Then there are all the new different builds you can do with all the new weapons, equipment’s and magic. Re-specing has also been made more accessible for you to try out different build faster and more frequently.1 main improvement I want to highlight is the fact that after completing the main story and getting the ending, doesn’t mean you are done with the game. After you complete the game, you can still go for most of the side- and optional quests from their very starting points and discover all the missed dungeons and caves, try out the PVP and Co-op. I think I have done nearly everything I can on my first playthrough with exactly 100 hours of gametime with having tried only 1 build and soon jumping to New Game +.There are couple of clear themes going for the new enemy designs. I think Elden Ring encouraging to block more often rather than rolling with Elden introducing the new mechanic of guard countering (allowing you to quickly retaliate after a successful block), and with enemies having a lot more combo- based attacks which make the fights being way more fast paced (compared to the soul’s series). I did not come upon any performance issues on my 100h playthrough apart from some sudden brief frame drops and jitter and I believe those are being, if havent been already addressed by From Software. Tho I am running Elden with an AMD Ryzen™ 7 5700G -processor, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti and 16 GB of DDR4 RAM. There are some minor bugs like some enemies and bosses just accepting their fate and freezing mid fight but that was almost expected from a game of this scale. Some minor teeny tiny slightly annoying features Elden rings Statues of Marika (Respawn points for boss fights for you to go have at them again quickly) are a great feature. But why on earth are they either completely forgotten for some bosses or put a mile away from the boss, where running back to the boss takes ages. There is no Marika for the boss  ""Maliketh the Black Blade""  and running back to the arena takes around 30s. Repeating that for 25 times was fun.Then there is the recycling of bosses like  ""Ulcerated Tree Spirit""  which is my least favorite boss of all because its enormous and usually takes half of its fighting space. You can barely tell what it’s doing because of how messy and complex (tho cool as hell) its model is.Those were about only thing vexing me about the whole experience. Elden Ring is a celebration to everyone, who love RPGs and will most likely form the new base template for new open world RPGs in coming years."
Positive,"If anyone is going to do a soulslike and do it right, it may as well be the folks responsible for Demon's Souls and Dark Souls. Much like Demon's Souls connection to Dark Souls, Elden Ring is not a continuation of either series, yet the game borrows a lot of elements all the same, from combat to the overall tone and look while adding in its own unique flair to make it still seem like something original with new enemies, a new story, and a completely new way to explore this massive new world. Elden Ring takes place in a world called The Lands Between. A really big world brimming with both life and death at every corner. I won't go into story really to give away any spoilers, but rather say where Dark Souls is overly dark and dreary, a lot of Elden Ring feels sort of the opposite. Full of light and wonderment. That is not to say though that a bit of Elden Ring will not bring you the same dark morbid uneasiness found in a Dark Souls game. Oh, it will. But you will also find areas lush with life. and I mean wildlife too. This is a world that seems to have a mixture of both hope and dread at the same time. One minute you'll be in a magical forest with twinkling lights and cute and fuzzy critters and beautiful floral scenery, and the next you might find yourself in a dark gothic hellish landscape with half rotted corpses, crumbling buildings, and doom at every corner. It's wonderful how well Elden Ring connects these themes in its world filled with massive castles, poisonous swamps, huge open battlefields, mystical forests and more. It would be hard to explore everything in one playthrough given how many nooks and crannies are scattered about. There are tons of dungeons, hidden bosses, secret areas, and some avenues completely locked off unless you meet certain quest requirements. But as big as the world is, and as non linear the path is, you'll be hard pressed to find yourself not finding some new discovery each time you boot the game up. I'm personally at around 100 hours so far and still plenty to discover, and am still finding new things on current plays. Even revisiting old areas I thought I fully explored before. Since Elden Ring is as big as it is, the game does include a map, which at first will reveal itself to be rather small, despite the opening area being so massive. As you explore more areas, the map will grow in size. And each site of grace (essentially the new Bonfires) will allow for fast travel between them. One thing Elden Ring does not do like you find in most open world games is hold your hand when it comes to quest progression. Most open world games usually have a logbook with all of your quests. Elden Ring does not. It does not usually point you in the right direction on side quests other than through conversations with NPCs or treasure maps. It's up to you to figure out where to go. That said though the sites of grace usually clue you in on where to go for the bigger picture, being the main quest. But it's not so fun to just focus on those directions. The game offers so much more that you will find it more enjoyable to go off the beaten path and do your own thing. This is one the areas where Elden Ring is going to feel the most familiar. Combat. You have most of the same mechanics introduced in Demon's and Dark Souls, with only a few omissions, but some new tricks added to take the place of those. Combat varies based on your left and right hand load out, where your right hand is usually the dominant for weapons. The usual layout would be a weapon in the right hand, and some type of shield in the left. But you can mix things up any way you want, and a lot of the weapons even allow for dual fisting for different and sometimes more powerful attacks, at the expense of less defense. You can also equip ranged weapons such as bows and cannons (Yes, cannons), and also magical staffs and amulets for a wide variety of attacks, buffs, heals and more. Of course much like previous souls games, the items you wield come at a cost, which is based on the stats you have. So managing how you spend your skill allotment with each level gained is crucial. Luckily later in the game you can respec in case you have any regrets. But these skills mixed with the loadout you use can make for a wide variety of playstyles. If you want to be a pure bruiser, you can. If you wish to play a more stealthy ranged attacker? You can. If you want to play an all powerful battlemage? You can do that too. While you are given a limited number of themed starting characters, ultimately you can switch it up to any playstyle you wish as you progress. Some of the new things added to Elden Ring for combat really make for a much more interesting dynamic. For starters, you can now crouch. This allows you to add in a sense of stealth, which is perfect for things like backstabs, or just to survey an unfamiliar room. you can also jump! Well technically you could jump in Dark Souls, but it was a little convoluted and mostly ended up being used for navigating and not so much in combat. In Elden Ring you have an actual dedicated jump button that you can mix with attacks to get an aerial advantage. A great maneuver for catching enemies off guard. On top of all of this, a majority of the game's open world will be playable on horseback, and with your trusty steed Torrent you will also be able to have attacks while mounted. There are a lot of different ways to utilize the combat. Something for everyone. So when you feel one approach might he too difficult you might want to take a step back and figure out a different approach. Luckily Elden Ring has you covered on options. Elden Ring may feel unforgiving at first for those not familiar with From Software's other works (mainly Dark Souls) first hand. But for those who are, this will be a delight. To put it bluntly, this is not Dark Souls. But at the same time this is best experienced if you know Dark Souls. The DNA of the Dark Souls franchise is baked into Elden Ring in a way that will make it familiar and wholly accessible to fans of the series while still giving you a completely fresh and original experience. While this may not be Dark Souls, it is safe to say this is something better.This review is a work in progress"

Positive,"Now that Elden Ring has been out for a while, a good number of players have had enough time to complete their first playthroughs. While I’ve seen many discussions about the PvP meta, the fairness of gank fights, and the tendency for Elden Beast to run away like it owes me child support, I have seen a resounding lack of conversation around topics like whether or not my beloved Mimic Tear is capable of reproduction, though we may have to wait for VaatiVidya for that one.Anyways, since “Maidenless behavior” is quite popular these days, I figured it was time for somebody to review Elden Ring in a new lens. So here I am - I’ll be giving my own personal opinion on the fappability of the Elden Ring characters. Keep in mind that many things will be left off of this list, as development time was running too long and we had to cut some questlines lackluster entries.Character Creation - 8/10 Starting the review, the sensible thing to look at is the character creator. It’s largely similar to its Dark Souls 3 counterpart, but manages to output fairly human-looking characters if you use it just right. For the more adventurous, monstrosities are still very easy to make. A lack of boob sliders takes some points away, but overall, it’s a great iteration in the soulsbornekiroring series, definitely something memorable for those looking for a more personalized experience, but don’t expect modded Skyrim.NPCs -10/10 Elden Ring may or may not have the pinnacle of memorable NPCs in the series. The first Dark Souls still contends its spot on the throne in this category for characters such as Sunbro Solaire, Blacksmith Andre, Amazing Chest Gwynevere, and the connoisseur’s Gwyndolin. Elden Ring is far from lacking, however. The game starts off slightly weaker, with Varré and Kalé being the first NPCs you meet. Many players will agree that it picks up speed once you encounter Melina and the witch Renna. Melina, permanently winking, offers to act as your maiden, a shining ray of kindness in an unforgiving world. Renna, later known additionally as Ranni, is a mysterious character with a fantastic questline for those who are looking for a mistress to serve, or simply want to see what those 4 hands could do. In Roundtable Hold we will see more fantastic appearances, such as Fia, who will attempt to numb the pain of being as lonely as your average Strength user, Roderika, a sweet girl who I can’t bring myself to sexualize for this stupid ass review, Hewg, who I can, Nepheli Loux, who I’d let beat me up any day, and the Two Fingers, whose political views I find rather abhorrent but don’t detract from their innate sexuality. There’s also Blaidd and Alexander, for those with more particular tastes (well, Blaidd’s pretty handsome I guess…). There are also some honorable mentions, such as the Dung Eater, for those of you who I’d rather not talk to, Lady Tanith, a great match for lonely Tarnished who need to sate their bloodlust by spamming Moonveil invasions, Sellen, for those with a teacher fetish, and the noble Goldmask, who will give about as much interaction to you as most women.Minor Enemies - 3/10 There are too many enemies in Elden Ring to fit in this review, but I’ll go over the highlights. Nothing here matches up to DS2’s desert pyromancers, and overall the minor encounters feel a bit disappointing. The Iron Virgins are there for anyone who likes being… grabbed… and eaten… yeah, forget that one. Nox Swordstresses will happily whip you, so get going to Noxstella if you’d like that. Caelid has some… no, Caelid doesn’t have anything. Don’t talk about the dogs and the birds in Caelid. The second-generation Albinaurics look quite adorable with their frog-alien heads, and they’re actually quite agile. In the Dragonbarrow, you can take on several dragons at once (you know who you are). I really regret doing this. The Pillsbury Dough Trumpet Onions will blow your mind with their curves! This is terrible. Do you like Royal RevenaBosses - 8/10 From the withering failure that is the minor enemies, Fromsoft brings it back in the bosses category, making sure everyone’s Fromhard. I’m sorry. Margit the Fell Omen is a fairly weak start, but Godrick the Grafted’s many hands more than make up for it. Leonine Misbegotten is a fun addition for the furries out there. We see Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon, who strangely enough wants to give birth to you, so I guess… uh… Radahn is an absolute chad who don’t need no maidens. While his size might look appealing, he remains sadly out of reach of us lowly Tarnished. The Ulcerated Tree Spirit Godskin Noble is big and most certainly beautiful, and excels at thrusting attacks. Godskin Apostle on the other hand is great if you like yourself a contortionist, and who doesn’t? Tibia Mariner is a pinnacle of game design and I would let them bash their boat in my head in again. Morgott makes his return under a new name and… stinks up the thrones at the Erdtree? Mimic Tear gives us some much-needed spice with the cultured selfcest option, a personal favorite. Astel, Naturalborn of the Void is quite honestly one of the prettiest ladies I have ever set my eyes upon. And let’s not forget about Godfrey/Hoarah Loux - for those into being stomped on, he’s a perfect match. Radagon is as close as we’ll get to the Queen Marikussy, but it’s good enough. Elden Beast is always there if you want to fuck a cosmic tardigrade god. And probably the greatest of the bosses, Malenia, Blade of Miquella and Goddess of Rot, has captivated the souls community with her scarlet rotussy. I hate everything.Overall - 8.5/10 Elden Ring holds up as a great game to play alone at night. It’s certain that Miyazaki’s vision is upheld, with an unparalleled amount of bare feet and messages reading “try fingers but hole” and “still no head?” Above all, while there are definite gaps in fappable content, there is so much that this game is worth getting for its price tag. Let me know of any great characters or enemies that you would have put on this list!"

Positive,Elden Ring O' Elden Ring
Positive,pain but such delicious pain
Positive,"Never thought I, of all people, would play and thoroughly enjoy a FromSoft game. To give you some background, I was typically your average competitive FPS shill, who only thought games like Dark Souls were nothing but punishment simulators which served no purpose other than frustrating its players. Oh, how far from the truth I was! Even when I slowly started diversifying my taste in games and finding joy in newfound genres like 4X/RTS with Warhammer 2, I stayed away from the world of Dark Souls because even after watching a little bit of the gameplays or listening praises about them from my friend, my opinion stayed skewed. I would've liked if this review's flow to stay like a story, and you would be expecting me to write something along the lines of ""...but that all changed with the release of Elden Ring"", but nope, the moment it arrived, I hit ignore on its Steam page and that was that.But any competitive gamer like myself knows that there always comes a time, when your so called ""favorite"" competitive game, (R6 Siege for me), starts to slowly feel like a burden. A switch just flips somewhere, and you find yourself struggling to hit ""Play"" when sit down at your computer. The things that you loved are very much still there, then why, do you slowly find yourself looking for something else, craving, to ""quench"" that thirst, but you don't know what you really want. That's when I, who's clicked on ignore on like 10K+ plus games, opens up Steam in incognito, to once again see what I may have missed. And that's when Elden Ring re-surfaced again on my Steam page a whole 4 months after it had been released and got me into that ""should I?"" mindset. I once again consulted my Dark Souls loving friend, who assured this was Dark Souls, but also wasn't. This, although not completely reassuring, made me go ""f**k it"", and I hit buy. The best purchase of my life was on a whim.Skimming through a few Reddit posts, I decided on the Vagabond class, the safe class for newbies, as per them, and began my journey through Limgrave. Yes, I too, immediately noticed the massive Tree Sentinel and even though I knew I shouldn't, I charged right ahead and got 1shot. This was not because I wanted a challenge, but because I still had the ""hate Dark Souls"" stereotype deeply rooted in me, and I just wanted reasons to refund it because frankly, I just wasn't feeling it. Vagabond felt clunky, and I barely made it to the first merchant before just closing the game, sighing, re-affirming that it just wasn't for me, and began a round of suffering by playing Rainbow6 again. A few days later though, a clip of the Samurai class popped up in my YouTube recommendations and the smooth slashing of the Katana really resonated with me. Thus, I booted up the game again, started a fresh Samurai, and that just immediately felt better. The katana was just really satisfying to play with, and I loved levelling up with it as I farmed the first guard post. Fast forward a few levels later, the stereotypes resurfaced, as I challenged my first boss, Margit, the Fell Omen. I died, and I died, and I died again. Frustration was building and the thoughts of quitting followed through. I knew this boss wasn't just someone who prevented me from entering the Stormveil Castle, but someone who would be gatekeeping me from enjoying this very game. But my time in the Total War series had taught me that ""cheesing"" is a valid strat. So I took the most obvious path, I farmed that guard post over and over, until I was quite a bit over levelled. And that helped my hits land like truck on Margit, but it wasn't enough. I had to learn something that those dopamine shooters I player never taught me, ""patience"". The patience to wait before the boss struck and not get greedy, the patience to learn the boss' delayed move set and the patience, to not let it get to me. And patience is what got me through. I did it. I defeated my first boss. The adrenaline coursed through, and I felt the taste of victory that wasn't like winning a round in Siege. It was a victory that I bore to fruition. This was it. This is what got me into it. But ""this"", wasn't what got me hooked. The ""hook"", was the build creation aspect of the game.Weapons, Talismans, the mixing of the Wondrous Physick, the Incantations, their combinations were unimaginable. This was slotting pieces into a puzzle, except the puzzle gave you more numbers to tweak and combinations to experiment with. I found joy in scouring the world to find these pieces of the puzzle, and to craft builds that were batshit insane. The infamous ""Marias Executioner's Sword"", when combined with the right talismans and Physick tears, could 1-2 shot bosses and I absolutely loved it. Squealing like a little child as I saw the damage numbers go past 2000 in the menu when I struck. Yes, I can see it was a lot easier than the other Dark Souls titles as you could potentially overlevel for every boss or create absolutely OP builds but man, the build creation aspect of this game had just enough complexity that it just felt perfect to me.I know that I still haven't talked about the atmosphere of this game, but this is because my stereotypical thinking was still in effect to some degree, but it slowly faded and I could finally ""see"" the world of Elden Ring, and it was breathtaking! The atmosphere of Limgrave, Leyndell, Altus Plateau, Volcano Manor and the Mountaintop of the Giants are just so distinct, each with a totally different color palette and vibe, but all of them, just as beautiful. And tho I hated it's guts, the Haligtree was actually the most beautiful one of them all.One thing that wasn't apparent to me was that it definitely was Elden Ring, who taught me patience. Not just the patience to learn a boss' moveset, but patience that helped me develop taste for other games in my preferred genre of games, FPSes, that I previously ignored. What I'm talking about of course is Hunt Showdown. A slow ass shooter with clunky movement and old style weaponry would've made me instantly tap ignore on Steam, but now, I was patient enough to give such games a chance, making me love and appreciate Hunt.So yeah, in the end, I'd just say that I always do know if I'm gonna like a game I see or hear about. Maybe not today or tomorrow, but eventually. Persona 5 or other JRPGs were one of those and Borderlands 3 was one of those. I gave them a chance eventually and loved them.But Elden Ring was never one of those and it is my favorite game of all time, period."

Positive,"Better game than I expected. Played all the Darksouls games to completion but they never really like left their mark as something I think about often? Though Elden Ring got me hooked so bad. Basically been no lifing it for a week now and by this point beat the game once, and am in new game+ almost done with 100% achievements.  Something about the atmosphere this time around and setting is just really good to me. In fact in some way It reminds me of Castlevania. Or rather what a 3D Castlevania should have been.As for difficulty. I don't find the concept of boss killing any more difficult than anything else. I'm used to games that 1 or 2 shot you. Like Blasphemous. Nightmare difficulty etc. So I suppose if you cant seem to roll enemy moves or be efficient with placing attacks then this game isn't for you at all and you'll cry like a big baby and give up I bet. Game looks pretty. Lots of variety to play styles. Winning fights feels rewarding.My only complaint which I'll admit I fumed about at the beginning was that the Coop mode is the same old bs fromsoftware usually does where its rather cumbersome and not exactly true free- roam with your buddies. It was something I really wanted since I don't play singleplayer often unless im streaming it. So wanted to play with friends.A lot of people i know where like ""Oh yeah this ones gonna be free roam coop!""    -me- ""WHAT fromsoftware finally did it?""(They didnt)Theres the usual thing where the person joining gets health and what not lowered and less pots. I didnt start coop until i was around lvl 190 and i found that the slight nerfing doesnt remotely matter at that point. So not a problemHowever the coop isnt that bad when you really get to it since you can actually fight together in dungeons or mostly everywhere if you want to use the items for it. Its just when you kill a boss then the cooperator disconnects from the host. I got over it. You just re-connect and continue.Soo great game. Definitely one i'll continue to no life for a while and remember."
Positive,"I don't write Steam Reviews frequently - far from it. Nine years ago, when I was a mere two dozen hours into playing Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition, I wrote of the game's quality, the need to fix the port's issues through modding, and concluded that it was a Top 10 game for me.https://steamcommunity.com/id/TJourney/recommended/211420?snr=1_5_9__402From there, across the hundreds of hours subsequently played, I only grew to further appreciate Dark Souls 1 and it jockeyed among my all time favorites, such as EarthBound. Even as new fantastic titles came out, such as Undertale, even as the Souls series entered the public zeitgeist and expanded upward and outward to DS3, Bloodborne, and Sekiro - Dark Souls 1 had continued to hold a special place to me.The interwoven level design of DS1 was untouchable by other games in the Souls series, even as gameplay became more fluid and refined. Nothing could compare to that moment in Undead Burg when I kicked the ladder, or when I realized how Darkroot linked together, or when I stumbled into Ash Lake, or that first time walking steps meant for gods in Anor Londo. The compulsion to make new characters, try out new items, and challenge the game in new ways was never as forceful as DS1, and the fun of cooperatively playing through with wacky character builds never had the same appeal as DS1.Now, at only a few dozen hours into Elden Ring, it's clear to me that this game is hitting me in the same way as Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition did, nearly a decade ago. The incredibly interwoven routing in Stormveil has managed to capture the incredible vertical level design of my favorite DS1 locales: such as Undead Burg, Duke's Archives, Blighttown and Sen's Fortress. Stumbling blindly into Siofr River elicits the sense of wonder and beauty of Ash Lake. Jolly Cooperation is more approachable, freeform, and glorious than ever before.Running cross-country with a friend across the fields of Limgrave feels better than any modding I've managed in The Elder Scrolls, with a cooperative element unseen elsewhere. Ashes of War encourage the player to experiment with weaponry and develop a unique playstyle without material cost. The story is rich, gameplay is tight, and the visuals are spectacular.At last, I have what I have sought to recapture from DS1 - and what I aspired to mod into games such as Skyrim. I hope that Elden Ring will capture me for hundreds of hours, across a dozen different characters, for years to come."
Positive,"pve is finepvp is a messill write a real review eventually when i stop hiding in other people's bushes4.16okay so I'm bothering to write a real review. written from a primarily solo players perspective.if you like player vs environment and co-oping with your friends, easy recommend. it's like dark souls 3 except you can go places that aren't ugly or falling apart; and the game looks nice, but it has dark souls 3 jank. some areas feel inspired by other parts of the series; some enemies have been brought back from cut content, some enemies are reskins of other enemies and there is a lot of ""DNA"" from old animations being used in creative and interchanging ways. the AI overall feels more engaging to play against as well. I genuinely enjoyed my solo pve experience and discovery time with this game; even if some parts (catacombs) can play relatively uninspired. the legacy dungeons in my experience are replayable and rememberable. the games art direction is genuinely beautiful. that being said there are some classic dark souls issues and gimmicks that crop up. from has added a lot of 'delays' to try to push players into actively engaging in defense, but thanks to tight timings newer players may see these as 'unfair'. enemies still suffer from dark souls 1 backstab fishing syndrome; if you know how to bait an attack with long frames you can still sprint around and forego combat on humanoid enemies. for whatever reason torrent/your horse has a distinct lack of iframing where your grounded options ie rolling or jump attacking will genuinely guarantee you more defense; also you can't use weaponskills or two weapons at once on torrent. parts of the game also feel designed with torrent in mind but occasionally you will be shut out from using him in a couple of these areas. there are genuine balance issues with some enemies tracking (siofra well spirit archers come to mind) and health and damage numbers getting horribly skewed toward the middle and end game, but i'd say it's typically consistent enough. I wish that some places didn't encourage you to run through them howevercoop is fairly seamless with the addition of summoning pools; but i almost feel like overworld exploring is discouraged on repeat playthroughs. the novelty wears off genuinely quick and you're better off going across the world on torrent 9/10 times because you can either avoid combat or get right to where you need to go; meanwhile, if you walk it can take upwards of ten to fifteen minutes if you add in combat at a time -- at least you don't drain stamina outside of combattldrpve is fine if you're looking for a game to passively get mad at. it's challenging, it's got a learning curve, if you like soulsborne slow 'deliberate' combat it's in a decent spot. there's a lot of fun exploit tier builds to mess around with, magic is naturally good, status is naturally good; there are npc summons if you don't like playing with people so now it's so easy an introvert can do it. pves in a solid place, overall 8/10 all things considered.now, i'm a bit biased on multiplayer because i play as an invader pretty much exclusively. this is by far the worst pvp experience i think i have played. between tech issues, rampant disconnects, being forced to invade in some absolutely horrid areas; and most of your enemies playing with their friends who just happen to have some form of cheese build or are way overlevelled despite scaling, invading is a fucking miserable experience. i invade consistently in the 35 and 55 ranges. i have fought people with endgame spells in stormveil; countless people with flavor of the month metagame weapons; rivers of blood at 35? seen it. elden stars and black blade at 35? yep; seeing people who are specced for at the least 50 int builds at 55 with a literal 400hp, you read that right, 8 vigor? i've seen that too because if you can have a friend just sit behind a greatshield; why not. in pve all of this is great; in pvp thanks to ~exclusively~ invading people who are co-oping or opt in; despite the previous games forcing you to burn ember/humanity/whatever -- as a red phantom you are always committed to a 2v1 if not 3v1 situation with no back up. have fun, it's not when status can stunlock you without even physically touching you. I would rather play dark souls and get ninja flip backstabbed for committing to a bad attack but from took the servers down; so I have to deal with this game where I am incentivized to... run a one shot build or play attrition. oh how little things change.pvp combat outside of invasion bias is a shitfest too; between ""no true combos"" but ashes of war having a potential to roll catch or stunlock you to allow for an R1 after a strike depending on which one. backstabs are hard to land thanks to the addition of another ""check"". fromsofts infamous netcode is also at play, there are a lot of phantom hitbox issues or issues with 'ah this person took damage 2 seconds after i hit them i need to play 2 seconds ahead'; stuff you would think would be slightly closer to fixed. magic being powerful is a nice change but also can feed into this frustration when you realize on top of the general damage increase most spells have had their ranges increased; meaning its easier to get caught backrolling due to distance misjudgements. this is a good thing for casters but it makes my life as an invader hard when i have one guy doing running r1 pressure and the caster can hang back and cast glintstones from 2/3 rolls away and still roll catch me because he'll just wait for his buddy to force my evade.1v1s, on the other hand, end up being enjoyable due to the ways you're typically allowed to engage with the game; but, there is the consequent side of it: if you look up any dueling video on youtube you're almost guaranteed to see people sitting behind greatshields with large thrusting weapons. normally it'd be not too large of a deal; except that the balance is so bad that the community content creators are on record as saying ""every time i level up to the duel meta i make a new character because i realize i dont wanna be there""  (source: youtube dot com/watch?v=OwriXLvzuUY user: Scott Jund in comments). Build balance is so screwed up that the more fun option is to genuinely pick the potential 3v1 situation where you're guaranteed to run into the one shot nuker style build anyway; so imo if you're damned if you do and damned if you don't.tldr pvp multiplayer is gimmicks or bust, if you're not killing people in 1-2 shots you're almost better off not even bothering with it. it follows ds3 style rollcatching but the games laggier than fuck so genuinely good luck reading when you're supposed to hit your enemy half of the time.multiplayers a 4/10, maybe a 3. the worst part is how often the game fails; it's to the point where when invasions go well it doesn't even feel ""good"" half of the time. we genuinely should be doing better at this point in fromsofts life.all in all the games fun, pvp is a bit of a letdown but the overall experience is pretty alright. coop has literally never been easier considering the game can give you passive buffs to rune gain for clears in passworded group; not to mention you can pick up and play with randoms at any summoning pool easily. pve can feel weirdly balanced in some areas but its solid, and mostly will be a fun experienceoverall probably a 6 or 7/10 depending on what you're looking for; if you're a pvper i'd genuinely avoid it if you can find a way to play the other titles online. it's the best worst game i've ever played in that regard."
Positive,"After finishing the main story and defeating all the optional bosses I can safely say that From Software absolutely nails it with this game. Not only did they manage to even surpass the greatness of the previous Souls games, they basically redefined the genre of open world games as a whole. The world of Elden Ring is beautifully crafted and filled to the brim with exciting stuff to do and great challenges. Storywise you have the typical Souls formula where the storytelling relies more on atmosphere than on narrative - and it just works so so well in this game!Elden Ring definitely has great potential for claiming the game of the decade title - and it's just 2022! Every true gamer needs to experience this and even if you were not into Souls games before - give this game a try, it's worth every second!"
Positive,"Thought ''wow this must be peak souls pve'' while playing most of the game, but unfortunately copy-pasted generic caves/dungeons exists and the game really shits the bed towards the end, uninspired, rushed...Most of the game is still great, character questlines, questlines for alternate endings, open world/side/optional content etc. which is about 80-90% of the game. Just some endgame areas and main quest/plot (and of course, the copy-pasted material gathering ''dungeons'') are kinda ass.As for pvp, not much improvement over Ds3's which was abysmal. Dark Souls 2 SotFS is still overall the best game in the souls franchise, but Elden Ring at least deserves the title of being a worthy (and true) sequel."
Positive,"I am a 69 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 15. My son downloaded Elden Ringand in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

I don't think I've ever experienced something quite like it. Torturous frustration banging my head against a boss for an hour or so, and then the burst of shear joy when you beat the obstacle. I've had a few framedrops from time to time, but the pure frustration of failure after failure against a boss sort of glazes over those few between technical frustrations. I'm loving it.

Large magic system, different schools and types of magic, etc. Large weapon skill system, with elemental affinities and different stance types.Beautiful difficulty scaling that keeps your character at a relevant level naturally without need for grind.DLC should be twice the price in my opinion. DLC is almost as large as the entire main game, with its own huge map.DLC features scores of new enemies and combat mechanics.DLC adds a ton of new bosses and dungeons, each rewarding and unique in its own way.DLC contains extensive lore, along with new factions that fit seamlessly into the story.DLC contains new weapons, new spells, new weapon-arts, and new crafting items.DLC contains new NPC's, subplots, and game-changing decisions.DLC is bigger, better, and more expansive than any other DLC from any other game I have ever played. I would compare it to maybe if you combined all Borderland's 2 DLC's into one and then doubled it.

Positive,"As a Soulsborne fan that started the series back in Demon's Souls era, i can feel the love and passion put in this game. I played for 10 hours so far, i am absolutely hooked. This is truly the combination of every Soulsborne (+Sekiro) game and it just works.Pros:+The world is beautiful and intricate, from its inhabitants to its castles and forts. I couldn't help myself and wander around randomly only to find out ruins, caves, minibosses, mysteries to solve, and quests. FromSoftware, again outdid themselves with the art design. +The combat is brilliant, fun and fast-paced combat from BB and DS3 is back and improved further. From the jump attack mechanic to block-counter combined with many Arts of War (weapon skiils) you can find to customize your weapons, While some animations from former titles comeback with improvements, there are also lots of new animations. My biggest concern is Scythe's backstab animations, as i've only played for 9 hours, i haven't tried them yet. I do hope they have an unique animation. +The Music is amazing as always, composed by talented Yuka Kitamura. +The Graphics are also very beautiful, from light poking through leaves in a dense forest to the early morning fog after rain. The NPCs, faces, armor textures, details on weapons. The game looks fine even on low graphics. Neutral+/- Performance-wise, i didn't really have much problems except some stutters here and there. I'm running the game on 1080p Medium settings with Textures on Ultra, i am receiving 57-60fps on caves, hub-area, ruins and the first legacy-dungeon while receiving 35-40 fps on overworld. I am happy with the result since i am under the minimum requirements. +/- The game runs fine with 8GBs of RAM although i'd recommend 12 or 16GBsCons:-Even though i haven't experienced many performance problems people have been reporting, this is currently a common problem even occuring for people with high-end systems.-Controller issues-EAC-No FPS options, you can neither limit nor unlimit.-Stonefang Miners from Demon's Souls are backThe game itself is f*kn phenomenal, the only problems are technical but tbh i didn't expect a FromSoft  PC release without problems (looking at you PTDe)"

Positive,"Chad meme aside this is probably one of the best games from From Software. Coming from a massive soulsborne boomer coming from the release week of Demon's Souls which is one of my favorite of all time this honestly might have topped it. Atmosphere and attention to detail is insane for how refreshing of a open world experience this is as most of those types of games are empty and have little to nothing to do. They've taken bits and pieces from all their past work to really make something that actually feels like its well deserving of your hard earned cash, which is a very rare thing these days.⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠋⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠛⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡏⣀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⣤⣤⣤⣄⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⢏⣴⣿⣷⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⣿⣿⣿⣿⣟⣾⣿⡟⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⢢⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣟⠀⡴⠄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⠟⠻⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠶⢴⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⣿⣁⡀⠀⠀⢰⢠⣦⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣼⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡄⠀⣴⣶⣿⡄⣿⣿⡋⠀⠀⠀⠎⢸⣿⡆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣴⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠗⢘⣿⣟⠛⠿⣼⣿⣿⠋⢀⡌⢰⣿⡿⢿⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⠿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡇⠀⢸⣿⣿⣧⢀⣼⣿⣿⣷⢻⠄⠘⠛⠋⠛⠃⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢿⣧⠈⠉⠙⠛⠋⠀⠀⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⠀⠈⢸⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠟⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⢃⠀⠀⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠀⠴⢗⣠⣤⣴⡶⠶⠖⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⡸⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡀⢠⣾⣿⠏⠀⠠⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠛⠉⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⠈⢹⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣰⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡄⠈⠃⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣠⣴⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣠⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣴⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣦⣄⣀⣀⣀⣀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠘⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⡄⠀⠀⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⠀⠀⠀⠙⣿⣿⡟⢻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠇⠀⠁⠀⠀⠹⣿⠃⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠛⣿⣿⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢐⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠿⠛⠉⠉⠁⠀⢻⣿⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⠈⣿⣿⡿⠉⠛⠛⠛⠉⠉⣿⡿⠋⠁⠀⠀⢀⣀⣠⡴⣸⣿⣇⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⡿⠄⠙⠛⠀⣀⣠⣤⣤⠄"

Positive,"With 80 hours in the game I can already safely say this is an amazing game. A must buy for any existing fans of FromSoft games, and also the most accessible for new players (despite still being intensely difficult). The gameplay design is more user friendly than ever, and with the open world you will never get 'stuck' on a too hard encounter as there are countless options on where to go.I believe I'm currently at most 25% through the game. This world must actually be the size of Skyrim, which I wouldn't have believed.On the technical front, game runs smoothly on my below minimum spec rig on high settings, with grass and shadows set to medium."
Positive,"Wasn't really hyped and knew to expect DkS3 in an open world, decided to try a completely new thing for me (magic build) and at first I was mostly running away on the horseback... but slowly, somewhere between running from anyone, searching the caves, cheesing the giants and collecting the materials, I really started enjoying the exploration and even ended up doing some quests and clearing (starting) areas. Nothing compares to finding an abandoned tower, searching for the way in for half an hour, somehow reaching the top only to find random trash on a corpse and nothing but a message about a nice view. Upvote that crazy explorer of the unknown and continue the quest. Die. Repeat... Die hard. Go elsewhere. Die. Repeat..."
Positive,"Genre - Souls Open World Game with Summons+ Runs great on my 3 year old PC+ Variety of Weapons and Foes+ Character Creation at start+ Looks Sweet+ Fast Travel+ Map helps a lot+ Feels like an open world+ Things to discover as you go+ A limited but useful guide on direction of travel+ Active community at moment (long may it continue)+ Summons can be smooth- Summons can be temperamental- Early bosses seem a bit too hard (even with 2 summons)- Feels like it might need too much grind, although that's fun at the moment- To progress in some areas you literally have to take a leap of faith- Can be difficult to spot your lost Souls...I mean GraceOverall I'm not disappointed by what I got on release day, although it's not perfect"
Positive,"One of the many amazing games I have played. Im still obsessed, the lore. The characters, the story is incredible. Along with the open world, and many things to discover. 10/10 beautiful experience."
Positive,"My playthrough times for the Dark Souls games:Dark Souls - 68 hoursDark Souls II - 90Dark Souls III - 105ELDEN RING -- 410 hours... WTF  FromSoftware/Bandai Namco???Miyazaki,  what the hell?? Where did my summer go? I don't remember it. Give me my summer back!The DARK SOULS series is a masterpiece. Every moment, every area is unique. But in ELDEN RING, 200 hours is just aimless wandering through empty spaces :/"
Positive,"I'll sum up.After the release of the dlc and revisiting the game, it still the same masterpiece but with tons of new possibilities, gameplay & lore wise. Some loose end standeth... well, loose end ( ﾉ ﾟｰﾟ)ﾉ Game is absolutely worth it. Still a game of the year! 10/10"

Positive,"Excellent game-play, but needed more story. And PvP is not enjoyable."
Positive,Ohhh... Elden Ring <3
Positive,Every phallic object in the game has an accompanying player-made message instructing you to shove it up your rectum. Wonderful title.
Positive,"Game runs fine (after patch), constant 60 fps with maximum setting (RTX 2070, i9 9900k, 32 GB ram and cheap SSD). Encountered only one crash that seems to be fix by now.The visuals are stunning, level and caracter design are top notch, this game is truly a piece of art. I have 71 screenshots right now and they will all be wallpapers.If you enjoyed the souls series, Elden Ring is definitely a must-play... And if you're new, it is a very good start. Easily join your friends for some jolly cooperation, or play with strangers more than happy to help you defeat a boss or an area.In my opinion this game deserve a strong 19/20. Get it, play solo or with friends, you won't regret it !"

Positive,"This is a true masterpiece. (I dont like dark souls, but this open world shit is goood)I hate how most new games are developed.Elden Ring feels like a mix of ""old games"", Hard but ""fair"" games.Effort is rewarded and the world feels real with depth.Ive played hundreds of games, this is probably the best game ever.I can see myself playing at least 100 more hours"
Positive,"You probably don't need me to tell you that you should play this game, you are either already planning on getting it or you have no interest in souls games. However, if you're on the fence, and you wanna know what I think, I say go for it. It's a truly unique experience. It's an open world game like no other, and at the same time a souls-like game like no other. It's not perfect by far: the world is massive, which makes exploration a lot of fun, and the build variety is huge, which makes experimenting with weapons and items very enjoyable, but some of the content can start to feel repetitive, especially if you decide to explore every corner of the map, and some of the boss encounters can be annoying. FromSoft tried to make the game more friendly to new players by adding a proper tutorial, a map, and even quest objectives for some quests. They also added a new gameplay mechanic -- ash summons, a variety of upgradable friendly NPCs that you can summon at many places in the overworld and on every boss to make encounters easier. However, this is still a souls-like game: combat requires strategizing, patience and good reflexes; NPC quests are obtuse and you will probably miss 90% of them if you don't look up guides; environments have to be meticulously explored otherwise you're likely to miss chunks of the game or valuable items, etc. And, of course, a huge bunch of it is straight up bullsh*t - some bosses are bullsh*t, some attacks are bullsh*t, some mobs are bullsh*t, this sh*t totally wasn't supposed to hit me, I swear to god I dodged that -- you know how it goes in souls games. But because this game is like 5 times bigger than other souls games, it also has 5 times more bullsh*t. Don't break your controller."

Positive,"A magical camping adventure in the majestic Lands Between with exotic animals and breathtaking views for the entire family, and kids of all ages and skill levels to enjoy!"
Positive,"I really do think this is one of the best games ever made, and it's only gotten better with time. Is it perfect? No, nothing is. While it has countless flaws, its an absolute masterpiece."
Positive,"The best FromSoftware game. The best souls like. The best open world. This game is a masterpiece, I just can't stop playing it, I hope it never ends. And when it does, I wish someone could brainwash me so I forget all about it and discover it from scratch again."
Positive,I don't even need an extra set of hands.  Simply playing Elden Ring allows me to reach my moment of climax hands-free.  Except when I get invaded by that death blight exploit going around at the time of writing this.  That's just a mood killer.
Positive,"This game is a good start for people who are finding it hard to conform to the difficulty of Souls games. Having played every single Souls game except Demon's Souls, I can say this game is in my top 3 taking third place along with DSIII. The fact that a game studio that has mastered the art of creating interconnected game worlds that isn't open to implementing this vast open world should be appreciated. But the downside is repetitive bosses & enemy types and a bland world that sometimes feels empty and boring. Apart from this, this game excels in every aspect of modern open-world RPGs. One thing that I feel could be improved is the narrative. Though the art of searching and understanding the lore brings people together in the discussion forums and creates a community, a more direct storyline approach similar to Sekiro would be better. I enjoyed my first playthrough of the game and might as well start another with a different build. The skills and OP builds in this game along with the Summons make it probably the easiest Souls' game and this encourages a lot of new players to try the game and enjoy it. My Rating for the game would be an 8.5/10. I will be editing this review if a future DLC brings in better boss fights and quite a few fixes along with it. Bloodborne and DS1 will remain my top 2 until then."
Positive,"I’m certainly one of the many newcomers to the expanded fanbase of the Soulsborn genre and library. I have about 45 minutes played on Dark Souls 2, back in 2015. I attacked some pots, some pig-worms or whatever came out that I did no damage to but they killed me in a swarm. I uninstalled, frustrated that exploration should never punish the player. That’s literally it, any other experience was done through Let’s Plays and I have a deep respect for FromSoftware because it’s not every year someone just invents a genre. I’m not a hard mode player, I play most of my games on the Easiest setting, oftentimes Normal and I only go higher on games I end up being supremely familiar with like Skyrim or Mass Effect (which are not difficult by any means). That said, the open world aspect of Elden Ring was a big selling point for me. I asked around on some discord communities and at one point someone said something along the lines of “If you hit a boss that’s too hard, you can just turn around and go somewhere else”. That has a broad appeal to me, I like any game where you can advertise it as just picking a direction, running, and just finding things to do. I know bosses are a big selling point in the FS library but I’ve only done a handful in my ~15 hours of gameplay, a lot of it was just picking a direction and moving forward. I’ve still made a lot of progress that way.So from one newcomer to others, I’ll explain what this game is. It’s an RPG with an emphasis on dodging, parrying, and learning the rhythm of enemy movesets. You can level up (your experience in the form of “runes” also serves as currency), find new weapons and armor, imbue weapons with their own special movesets, call ghostly allies to battle, and probably a few other things I’m missing. It really is just an old school RPG in its own right with very little hand-holding (which is not necessary). If you’ve played some For Honor or Chivalry, then you’ll be somewhat familiar with the idea of dodging and parrying in this game. However it’s mostly a matter of learning the telegraphed attack patterns, because even the basic enemies can kill you in four or five hits if you let them get their combo off, so this is not a “left click to win” kind of game.That’s really the developers bread and butter, here. They’ve boiled an RPG down to its bare necessities and spread it across multiple games and kept refining it into a nearly perfect diamond. It’s not without some frustrations but this game is probably a lot more accessible than any other in FS’s library. Now is the time to get into it, in my opinion.As an EasyMode type player, I have found great rewards in figuring the flow of the game out.There's two moments in the super early game I can think of. The wolf cave, first encounter I jumped down on the ledge and was surrounded by wolves, died basically immediately. Second run at the cave to go collect my lost ~800 or so runes, I snuck through it and noticed I could pick some of those wolves off. When I got to the alpha, he only had like one or two with him. The fact I was able to adjust made me feel awesome. Similar situation with that big knight encampment at the first big gate. I don't think I died there much (if at all?) but it was a constant learning experience. Tower shield guys give me trouble but a tip of dodging to their side helped a lot. After that I was able to test the kazoo caller with a single arrow hit - he alerted immediately. I ran, saw like 8 dudes descending on me but they gave up. A couple hits on this camp later I was going full assassin's creed, luring them out one at a time, and testing aggro ranges. Eventually assassinated the kazoo with a flurry of dagger hits so he didn't get his call off.So far the whole game has been this type of encounter after another. The Stormveil Castle, I consider to be one of the first “wake the hell up” type areas in gaming. I died plenty times in there (half of them from falling off ledges) but the learning curve really helped drive home the idea that you don’t need to face off against every enemy. There are these knights there that have an incredibly speedy attack set (and the first one you face is likely in a completely dark room) where no matter what bosses I can destroy, I almost have to get lucky to kill them at all. Eventually I figured out that I can literally stealth past a majority of them or flee altogether. There’s a moment of great triumph just getting to a safe point of grace just by running past a massive enemy, just so you can progress.And that’s part of what I really enjoy here, the ability to continually progress regardless of how many levels you can eke out of enemies or bosses I can kill. If I end a session of ER with a few more points of grace on my map than before, then it’s a successful session.I said before, it’s not without frustrations. Some of the necessary story-mode bosses frustrate me to a severe degree. I had trouble with the Grafted, notably after taking on a dragon head for an arm and spewing fire that takes up the entire half of the arena you’re in. And he’s probably one of the simpler ones, with a noticeable, very specific few movesets. Every boss has some variety of dive that I always have trouble avoiding, and it sometimes leads to their own pause which under normal circumstances is where you’d let your own flurry of blows happen. Me being me, I usually spend that time getting off the floor and chugging my health flask, and then the boss starts his rotation all over again. Some non-boss enemies are even worse, like some centipede type creature in a swamp that just attacks far too quickly, hits too hard, and basically leaves absolutely no openings for you to get in there. I know I’m just adding myself to the meme where you can google any boss name and see some thread on a forum about how badly designed it is, but I truly feel that way about that swamp creature. I attempted it seven times with various different approaches (even mounted) and I just couldn’t hit the damn thing more than a couple times before dying. It wasn’t fun, it’s just maddening.Again, as an open world it lets you circumnavigate some of those frustrations. The world is large and varied, every little area introduces new challenges and monsters to figure out. Like the zombies that latch onto you and drain your magic, this game is just brilliant with not recycling the same types over and over again. You’ll fight your fair share of armored knights, but every fortress they occupy still introduces a different layout or even a new and different knight enemy to deal with. It really is quite wondrous what they’ve accomplished here.Even as a barely-gud scrub, I’m having a ton of fun with it and I hope others who have been wary about attempting the Soulsborn genre give this one a go at some point. It’s worth it."
Positive,"This game is a culmination of FromSoftware's development at this point - it has some of the best features from their previous games, Souls, Bloodborne and Sekiro, while adding new aspects together with an open world element that sets it apart from their previous games.The art and sound design is even better than last time, while the arsenal at your disposal is vast and the gameplay rewards experience and precision as the hitboxes are tight. It's one of the best action RPGs that I've played and enjoyed in a long time, and while this style may not be easy for everyone to get into, it is rewarding for everyone playing it. If you're new to the game, take it nice and slow as the game rewards exploration and offers you diverse ways to build your character and choose your fights, in a true RPG fashion. You'll die a lot and learn from it, so don't worry about it.Along the content rich campaign, you also get the coop and multiplayer aspects which are intertwined with the campaign in a typical FromSoftware recipe, with messages, ghosts, summons, invaders and fashion!I fully recommend this one, and unless this style is not for you, this will be a rewarding experience with a lot of replayability and some jaw dropping moments throughout the Lands Between.Thank you, Miyazaki, despite your nasty swamps :)"

Positive,"There is not a single game which is an absolute 10/10, but this is pretty fucking close. If you need a rating, I'd give it a 9.8/10 and announce that this is the greatest game that I have ever played.This game did not just raise the bar, it towers above any comprehension of what today's trend-chasing video game standards would prepare us for in terms of expectations. Post Elden Ring syndrome is going to hit hard. This is magnum opus tier shit, and costs the same amount of money as so many AAA games which have a fraction of memorable content compared to Elden Ring.Legendary open world games such as GTA 4, Skyrim and BoTW all pale in comparison to Elden Ring because the open world experience is secondary to the ridiculously well-defined game design formula of this latest iteration of the Souls games. The problem with most open world games is that they are as wide as an ocean, but as deep as a puddle. Whereas Elden Ring has an absurd amount of incredibly well-designed content per square mile that you could easily make 2 entire Souls games out of it, and still have some leftovers for DLC.Fans of previous Souls games are treated to classic Miyazaki-level misdirection from the very start of the game, wherein it feels only natural to be attracted to towering structures in search of a formidable challenge. The combination of overcoming these challenges on a personal level, and slowly beginning to embrace the open world and all of its quirks is a truly unique experience - making it so exciting to simply talk about this game with friends or faceless denizens of the internet, as nobody's story is exactly the same.   This game has sent shockwaves down the spines of game developers around the world, and if they are not ready to take even more ideas from the innovative minds at FromSoft, a career change might be in order.Game of the decade, for me at least."

Positive,"The Elden Ring was amazing. After over 200 hours of playing, I was pleasantly surprised. This work improves the shortcomings of the previous works and makes it easier for new players to get started. It is integrated into the open world at the same time, playing more diverse genres. Especially its art style and game music, very fascinated me. All in all, Elden Ring deserves The Game Awards of 2022."
Positive,"The fact that this game made me to love souls-like games and in general change my gaming taste is wild,the map is really big and you can do alot of unique stuff.the bosses are good, the lore is good, the cutscenes are good, the scenery is stunning, and a big variety of weapons,spells,incantations etc. and the fact which you can choose your difficulty of playing is amazing Overall, this game did not disappoint me at all, 10/10."

Positive,"If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pieDirections:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
Positive,"TLDR: Elden Ring hits different. It isn't perfect, but it's one of the best souls games, if not the best.Much like its predecessors, the game can be punishing, yet can be somewhat easy. Souls games can be quite intimidating for newer players, but this is as beginner friendly as it gets. The addition of its beautiful, open world offers a lot of freedom to do whatever one desires. It's a breath of fresh air. The joy of exploration and discovery along with the varying difficulty of combat, will keep you on your toes every single time. May it be in solo, or in coop.The storytelling, in my opinion, is a lot better compared to previous releases, coupled with great & interesting character, & world design. I just feel like the open world may seem a bit empty at times, but I don't really find that as an issue since the game has lots to offer to keep me occupied, be it a dungeon, or a great enemy/open world boss that I happen to pass by on the way to the objective, or even a friendly face every once in a while. You're not tied to a linear way of progression, and you can do as you please. For those into coop/multiplayer, this part of the game isn't bad, but it ain't good either. I can say that one thing to look forward to is the amount of improvement it can get (if it will anyway), and the same goes for every other aspect of what is already an amazing game. You just can't have it all.Some of the launch issues are still in the game currently. They're probably working on it. I barely encounter any bugs and stutters because there are workarounds, and should you look it up, are also all over the internet to help you out. It just needs better optimization and it'll be perfect. I guarantee!Issues aside, it's a great game nonetheless. The positives pretty much outweighs the negatives.11/10 will fall for ""hidden path ahead""."
Positive,"Absolutely insane the amount of content and freedom this game offers.Difficulty pretty much ranges to how leveled the area is and how level'd you are. Its completely possible to play in an overleveld area and succeed, but you'll likely have a bad time.Opposite also reigns true, if your over level for an area you'll wreck face.This doesn't mean its easy though, Elden Ring is possibly Fromsofts hardest soulslike game yet. Do not recommend if your easily salty about dying, and do recommend if you like taking on very hard and demanding challenges."
Positive,"**SPOILER FREE** I've put thousands of hours into the FromSoft games over the years, so to say I was hyped for this would be putting it lightly. Somehow... Someway.. This game has managed to blow straight past all my expectations. This is the 'Ali vs Liston' of heavyweight, triple A RPGs. The 'Prince at the Superbowl halftime 2007' of creative ingenuity. La piece de resistance for anyone looking for something fresh and exciting to seriously shake up the monotonous genre that is currently open world games. The ONLY complaint I've had is to do with the performance issues on PC. Which as of the current patch, have been ironed out for the most part.From a Souls fan perspective, this game is absolute bliss. If you've ever found yourself lamenting for a small quality of life change in one of their games before, I assure you its now a part of Elden Ring. For a first time Souls player, this game offers a godlike first taste into the incredible games this company has to offer.Every new mechanic is incredibly thought out and flawlessly executed. At the core, the combat is very much DS3. But, that's a good thing. Too many games nowadays try to reinvent the wheel and end up just over complicating things. Instead, From stuck to their roots, and managed to add these incredible layers to the combat. There are honestly infinite ways to tackle a fight in Elden Ring, and here's the best part... They're basically ALL viable. This game allows you to push through enemies in exactly the way you want to.The open world is not a hybrid, it's not half-assed. It's rich in content and aesthetically jaw dropping. It flows effortlessly and in a way that constantly has you exclaiming 'wow this game is HUGE,' but without overwhelming you. And in some feat of genius, they've managed to incorporate the crazy satisfying Miyazaki vertical level design in a way that just WORKS. This is their first open world attempt. FromSoft do not miss, these guys just don't miss.The story is really, really good. And much easier to follow than their previous games, but the lore still isn't force-fed to you so if you're the kind of player that just likes to get to the slaying, you're covered. The NPC quest lines are the most immersive they've ever been with such engaging and unique characters, and they're so impactful. Makes them very worth following.The difficulty is done amazingly well. The game is exactly as hard as you make it without having to resort to some artificial difficulty slider. The more dedicated exploring and build creating that you do, the more powerful your character becomes, and in turn, the easier the game becomes. The late game difficulty spike is also very welcome. The final bosses really FEEL like super powerful demigods that require you to bust out everything you have to match their power.The general design in this game is on a different level to anything I've ever seen. I was constantly taken aback by the sheer 'cool factor' of bosses and various enemies. The side areas had me in complete awe constantly. A single side area felt like a whole DLC on many occasions, as the design was just immaculate and so thorough.Also worth a mention - both the voice acting and the sound design/score are phenomenal. They amassed a team of really talented voice actors and musicians to create this immense audio immersion that just has you taken aback constantly. This is a game you can play in a thousand different ways, for a different experience every time. And for 50 GBP it's a damn good deal. I cannot recommend it enough.10/10"
Positive,"Dark Souls was a huge hit on PC 10 years ago. Really no excuse for this. Performance is really bad on a 3080. FPS dropping into 40s. Random stuttering. Wait until they fix it because the game itself seems great, but I'll hold off for a patch personally.edit - they fixed it"
Positive,"HUGE map and content, great exp system. Recommended both for new players and experienced ones.The combat mechanics are varied and will set your mind to endure and focus. Storytelling is great, even if I find lost in it time to time, mostly due to From Software's cryptic find-it-by-yourself way of giving life to the lore.I keep finding new entire maps, caves, enemies and hidden paths even after this many hours of play. Online is fun and helps a lot. You can read other people's messages written in stone on the ground. Some are fun, some are helpful, some are just nonsensical. I understand the game is not hosted on dedicated servers, and it makes sense since every player has their own unique world, yet is not ideal.I don't consider this game to be (or need to be) focused on PVP, even though I like the challenge to get invaded by other players at random times.Worth buying!"

Over 100 hours in I'm still on my first playthrough exploring all optional areas in this open world for items to buff my Faith/Strength build. I've already doubled my hours per buck on prepurchasing this game. Apart from some minor FPS drops which need to be patched out, you are missing out. Dark Souls 4 could last you months into NG+ if you want to turn all the content corners. In the AAA industry, this game is a gem amongst all the rubble from cyberpunk to Live services.

Positive,"Before i start, i want to say that every experience is subjective. So for you to have a little bit of context about my experience of the game :- I've already played and finished dark souls (I,II,III) and sekiro and i really liked those games.- I play video games regulary but i'm not that good, i can struggle and i'm not a ""sweat"" type player- I did not experienced any performance issues while playing elden ring for some reason, even with my laptop (gtx1070, 16 gb of ram)- Even if give the game 10/10, i don't think EVERYONE, should play it, every games are differents and offers differents type of experience and therefore, every game is not meant for everybody.BUTElden ring is for me a : masterpiece. As an artist who works in the videogame industry, i find the art direction unmatched, the graphical quality of the game is not meant to reproduce the reality with gorgeous texture but i look FANTASTIC nevertheless. As you progress to the world you are in constant ah of what the game as to offer in his character design, places, music everything come together to immerse the player in the dangerous world of the land between.The game in itself is extremely dense there are cave, ruin, fort, castle in every corner, and it feels really rewarding to be curious, because of the variety of enemies and unique loot to find in those caves. Even with an open world dense like that, the main level that you have to go through for the story have the same quality of the game before them, but with a lot more verticality you Can go 3 time in the same castle and find 3 differents way to explore it.In term of gameplay, for a ""souls veterant"" like me, i feel like this game offers the most ways to build your character in any ways you want, you can customize weapons by swapping theyre special attacks, and use whatever tool you want to tackle the game difficulty : you want to be a tanky mage ? A fast bowman ? A heavy knight with dragons power ? You can do it and mix everything while still maintining it viable and enjoyable.Now let's talk about the elephant in the room : The difficulty. If you're new to the serie i think this is the best place to start, elden ring is still challenging in the classical souls way, but there is a loot of tools to give the player a little rest in combat (like summoning npc to fight with you on command) and a lot of ranged weapons and ways to fight.Additionaly, elden ring being an open world you can explore the world to seamlessly lvl up before trying to tackle a boss. This give the player room to breath in between bosses.I will add that from software games are suffering from their reputation of being difficult. It's not an easy game, and it requires a little bit of getting used to. But after some time if you're willing to learn how the games works, you can finish the game without that much of problems. And i really encourage people to do it because it's really rewarding.For me who was tired of most recent video games, Elden ring give the fresh experiencz i needed to ""fall in love in a game"" once again. The last time i felt like this playing was in zelda breath of the wild, it feels like i'm entering a new world, with everything to learn and it's a lot lot lot of fun.And uf you're worry about the lenght of the game, be not. It's really really big and it has a lot of quests outside of the main one, it take probalbly 80 to 100 hours to finish the first playthrough, without taking all the npc quests.So yeah 10/10 because Elden ring is exactly what itns aspiring to be, it's different from everything i've played, it's beautyfull it sounds good, the voice acting is perfect, i'm never bored while exploring the open world, it's not frustrating to fight boss, and it has a lot of replayability with all the builds and differents branch of quests(And yes it's different from dark souls, it's not just BIG DARK SOULS 4) Don't hesitate give it a go."

Positive,"Elden Ring is a game that never ceases to impress, Whether it's the amazing open ended combat that offers all players an equal opportunity to play and enjoy, the amazing landscape and setting filled with grand castles and caverns, or the captivating story of the lands between and its history. To put it simply Elden Ring is one of the greatest games and is deserving of its GOTY status."
Positive,"5 stars!!FromSoftware's Elden Ring is not just a game; it's an ethereal journey into a meticulously crafted world that redefines the boundaries of the fantasy genre. In an industry overflowing with titles, Elden Ring emerges as a beacon of innovation and creativity, seamlessly blending the masterful storytelling we've come to expect from Hidetaka Miyazaki with the boundless imagination of George R.R. Martin. This collaborative effort has birthed an opus that stands as a testament to the heights gaming can achieve.At first glance, the landscapes of Elden Ring are awe-inspiring. Vast, interconnected regions teem with lush forests, towering castles, and desolate ruins, all brought to life with a level of detail that leaves you breathless. The sense of scale is unparalleled; every nook and cranny tells a story of a world that has lived through ages of grandeur and decay. Whether you're galloping on horseback across the plains or cautiously traversing a crumbling citadel, the world feels organic, lived-in, and ripe for exploration.The hallmark of FromSoftware's titles, the unforgiving yet exhilarating combat, finds its zenith in Elden Ring. The seamless blend of Miyazaki's signature combat mechanics with Martin's knack for intricate lore and character depth births an experience that is as challenging as it is rewarding. Each confrontation feels like a deadly dance, an intense symphony of parries, dodges, and perfectly timed strikes. Yet, it's the diversity in combat styles, weapons, and magic that ensures no two battles are ever the same, keeping players forever engaged and adapting.But what truly elevates Elden Ring into the annals of gaming legend is its narrative tapestry. The world-building prowess of George R.R. Martin is evident in the layers upon layers of lore that envelop the player. Every character, every faction, every artifact has a history that intertwines with the broader narrative, creating a sense of immersion that is unparalleled. FromSoftware's genius lies in their ability to let players uncover this lore at their own pace, inviting speculation, discussion, and a level of investment that transcends the screen.And then there's the mounted combat – a new dimension that Elden Ring introduces seamlessly. The thrill of charging into battle astride your trusty steed is an experience that defies comparison. From epic clashes against towering foes to the adrenaline-pumping jousts, mounted combat is an extension of the game's philosophy: innovation married to familiar mechanics to create something truly magical.In the sonic realm, Elden Ring continues to astound. The hauntingly beautiful score, composed by the legendary Motoi Sakuraba and Yuka Kitamura, sweeps you away, enhancing every emotion, every encounter. The voice acting is top-tier, infusing life into characters you'll come to care deeply about, making their struggles and triumphs all the more impactful.Elden Ring isn't just a game; it's an odyssey. It's a symphony of design, narrative, and gameplay that resonates with the heart of what gaming should be. It's an experience that's both familiar and groundbreaking, a testament to the creative potential of the medium. FromSoftware and George R.R. Martin have given us a masterpiece that will be celebrated for generations, a shining jewel in the crown of interactive storytelling. If there ever was a game to define an era, Elden Ring is unequivocally it."
Positive,"Steam made me write a review for a game I nominated in the Steam Awards, so here I am :|In all seriousness though, it's pointless to write endless paragraphs on how  engaging, immersive, fully captivating, good sounding, pleasantly challenging, stunningly gorgeous and well written  this game is. Go buy it."
Positive,"The constant punishment for my own hybris is delightful. The cherry on top is when I stream myself playing for my friends, and they enjoy me getting  smashed quite a lot. They say ""It's good for the soul."" and that ""I deserve to be put in my place."""
Positive,Easily one of the best souls game and best games of this year. Everything was perfect except few thing that won't probably matter to others. Bosses could have been more creative than mixing sekiro moves and bloodborne bosses and music in general wasn't up to the level that they made in their previous games.
Positive,"Best game I've ever played, A lot of people would agree with me that this masterpiece is the best game of the decade ngl. However, you will really get frustrated playing this game. But I also believe that dying in this game is a path to winning, and in my opinion it's not that bad(the difficulty). Try it, just play. Don't ever think about anyone saying that this game is really hard and frustrating, it's impossible. No. Just play"
Positive,FromSoftware definitely created a truly timeless masterpiece (Perfectly Crafted) . 10/10000000000000000
Positive,"130+ hours, pretty close to complete the game and it still impress me \[T]/"
Positive,"All right...What can I say about Elden Ring as a person who has played every From-Software game multiple times over, that hasn't already been said? My first blind and (luckily) spoiler-shielded playthrough on my first character clocked in at 87 hours, in that time i killed every boss, did every dungeon, and got 100% of the achievements. This means that Elden ring has packed over 100 hours of content for the average player, and almost as much for us die-hard From-Sorftware fans. 100 hours of content is perfectly scattered throughout The Lands Between and the fluidity and pace of exploration, makes Elden Ring (in my own opinion) the greatest open world game we have seen. Every enemy, item, dungeon and grace location is and feels intentional and this creates the amazing game world which i now love more than Yharnam, Lothric, Drangleic, Ashina, Boletaria and even The ageless kingdom of Lordran. The lore is amazing, the characters richer, the weapons are many and more impactful, the magic is better than ever, The bosses grander, the flow of combat nearly perfected, the world is bigger, and for the first time (to many new player's delight) you have real choice, not just the illusion of choice like the master key...looking at you Dark souls purists. Does Elden Ring have flaws? yes, one. Can you fix it? yes actually. As many of the steam reviews will tell you, the game has ""performance issues"" in form of stuttering and FPS issues. I newly bought a high end pc and the game had these issues for me as well, BUT i fixed them, and so can you. now the game runs perfectly and without a single issue. Everything you need is in this article: https://www.wepc.com/how-to/fix-elden-ring-performance-issues/If the game still lags, too bad mate, your computer isn't strong enough, that doesn't make the game bad and does not entitle it to a negative steam review, thank you."
Positive,MUST PLAY !!
Positive,There's a guy who eats poop.
Positive,Game is hard and you wont be getting any book which will track your progress and these two reason dosn't make this game trash. Its just how FromSoftware like to do things. Many things have improved compare to dark souls and other souls game created by FormSoftware. I really like the open world and bosses move-set. Graphics could be better but then again this game has to run on old hardware as well but believe me when i say graphic has improved a lot compare to old FormSoftware games and one last this THIS GAME HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE THE BEST GAME OF THE DECADE!!...
Positive,"The posibilities how to start this review are numerous. But i think to adress the biggest change to what fromsoft has done before let's talk about...Even though this is Fromsoft's first shot at a real open-world, they did an amazing job with it. The first time I started up the game and came into the open world I just got lost in it. Not like I didn't know where to go because while the game doesn't give you specific directions in form of waypoints, some points of grace (that's what the bonfires/checkpoints are called in this game) have rays of light attatched to them which point in the direction where the story countinues.But no what i meant with getting lost is that i could just ride around in the open-world forgetting about time and just roaming around stumbling from one quest into another, finding dungeons, fighting fieldbosses and before you know it, you rode your trusty horse torrent around for 4 hours. You may not have countinued the story and yet, it's not at all like you didnt do anthing in this time.Elden Ring really does reward exploring of the world. Be it more healing items you can pick up or another area you wouldnt have expected. In one of the first forests I explored I happened to stumble upon a circle shaped building. I didnt think much of it at the time since i was on my way to a castle I spotted on the horizon. After examining the castle I went back to that building I passed in the forest, which i marked on the map so I wouldnt forget about it (I can only recommend to take advantage of the marker tool since you might forget some points of interest with this much to see in the world). Turns out the building was an elevator and brought me far down below the plains I wandered before. On the ride down the wall before me opend up a bit and revealed an underground area with a sky made of sparkling gems resting above it. This is only one of the stunning views you get to see while exploring. Traveling the lands between is not fun and games though. Of course, in these chaotic times the world is littered with enemies. Not just grunts but bosses like giant knights on armored horses or dragons as well. While you encounter most bosses in dungeons you shouldn't go around with a sense of security since although grunts, may just be grunts they are deadly grunts. While we're on the topic let's get into...For those of you who didn't have the pleasure to enjoy any of the dark souls games yet, I'll just give a quick summary of the most used combat strategie: You look how the enemie is winding up their attack, wait for the strike and then dodge through it. After successfully avoiding the attack you either have a short opportunity to deal damage, which consists for most players just spaming the rb button, or have to dodge out of the way of the next attack. If you didn't time your roll right it's retreat and heal. That's basically what combat consisted of in the dark souls games. The third installment of the series introduced also something called weapon arts. Weapon arts are possesed by every weapon in the game and are a unique move of attack that uses up mana. In Dark Souls III I personally rarely used it tho since the risk-reward factor of hitting such an attack to the damage it dealt just wasn't worth it.In Elden Ring some major improvements were made even though Fromsoft might have overdone it in some aspects. The one thing that is responsible for the biggest change in combat is the new poise stat, that was added by the devs. You can imagine poise as another bar besides the health bar. When it runs out the enemy gets staggered and you get to perform a critical strike that deals massive damage (It is simmular to sekiro but differs in that you cant actually see the bar). How does that change the gameplay you might ask yourself now. Well it gets the player to vary their attacks more. As already mentioned combat mostly relied on the rb button or light attack. Light attacks don't do much damage to the poise of an enemy though. So the player has to decide if they solely want to rely on the damage of their light attacks or risk a longer heavy attack to not only deal damage but bring down the enemy's poise as well. Over all you can play Elden Ring combat whise just like the old dark souls games but there is a good new alternative.The Weapon skills are where Fromsoft might have overdone it a little. There are two or three weapons in the game which let you one shot some bosses or just let you cancel enemies attacks, making some passages a bit too easy in my opinion. If you dont want this you can of course just leave your fingers off of 'em.In conclusion, combat whise Elden Ring improved on Dark Souls and Sekiro massively as well.Last but not least there is still one thing left...I'm sad to say, the story is probably not going to be something for everyone. In typical Fromsoft manner, you don't just get the story presented on a silver plate. You have a main story line and yet it might confuse you in some parts. The story is told, not just with cutscenes but with item descriptions, side quests, and dots you have to connect by yourself. The game tells the tales of many dark but also some brighter fates. Be it the swordswoman malenia just trying to desperately protect her brother. Or General Rahdan rotten but Malenia's curse, seeking out one last battle, worthy of a warrior's death and not perish from sickness. All of which, you kinda have to figure out for yourself.To sum it all up: Fromsoft created a masterpiece. They did hell of a job on their open-world and designed their bosses with just as much passion and creativity. The exploring always stays interesting and the combat is very enjoyable. The combination of all this makes up this addicting magnum opus of a game.In my opinion this is a must play title and i can only recommend it to everyone considering getting it just the slightest. Most of all with a dlc on the horizon"
Positive,"First off, The only bad thing about this game is that it's so big that i forgot to leave the house the past 150 week.That was a bad attempt at a joke i thought about for the past 150 hours.For real though, Lemme start with the cons since it barely has any: - FPS issues. Sometimes the frames drop every now and then which i hope they address this problem soon- Invisible enemies. This doesn't happen often and from what I've seen this happen with people that have low RAM, on the bright side though...It only happens with trash mobs so yay.- Can get addicting.This game is a masterpiece, if i state all the pros then this will be longer than the unabomber's manifesto so i'll post my favorite things:- The art. The moment you open that damn door at the beginning of the game, I was blasted by a magical masterpiece! I wish i was kidding but almost every screenshot you take could easily be a wallpaper.- The goddamn music. Let's be real here, every From Software game has boss music that will straight up make you shiver and hyped from start to end which makes spending hours on a boss feel like 5 minutes and this game is no different. Hearing the songs of a bunch of secret bosses and the boss before the last felt like i was hit by a trombone.- How big the game truly is.....It took me about 115 hours to completely finish the game from every side quest to every boss it had to offer. At first i was a bit scared that the game wasn't going to be that huge judging from the map at the start but oooooooh boy i was wrong. Everytime i thought i was nearing the end i just kept getting blasted by a new gigantic area with uhm ""annoying"" enemies and one of my favorite From Software bosses so far. Basically this game is huge, whenever you think you finished an area....you didn't.   A bonus pro that a bunch of people tend to forget, YOU CHOOSE THE DIFFICULTY! You can straight up go to the first boss level 10 or spend a couple of hours to explore and come back just to one shot it, you can use summons or play with friends OR if you like a bit of self torture then you can in like a solo chad gamer with a club.This game is truly a masterpiece, a magical journey. You know that feeling you get in your tummy when you're in love? I felt the same playing or thinking about this gorgeous game."

Positive,"Oh, how good it feels not to be disapointed by something you were longing for. Magnificent game, there's enough content for a lifetime. After 30 hours it feels like I only explored a small part of it. Yet, you still discover a new detail, quest, on the zones you already discovered. I saw a lot of people hesitating to buy the game being afraid that they won't be able to beat it because of the difficulty that SoulsBorne games are known for. Here's my take on it : I would recommend it to you anyways. Elden Ring is less linear than its predecessors and here's why : - If you are stuck on a boss fight, you can still explore new zones and discover new material that can help you later on.- There's always the option to use summons to help you out, whether it's people or spirits. There's as well as guides on the Internet if you are stuck on something you cannot find.And for those that want to go full try-hard mode, the challenge is here for you as well. That's why I think Elden Ring is a good game, it's a huge original content full of creativity and personality, while still giving you all the control you need to in order to play the game the way YOU want to play it. And this, without sucking your personal time. (Looking at you, games that waste people's energy and time by filling it with a boring void and calling it ""content"".) So ... Yep, that's a yes for me ! Bravo, FromSoftware, and thanks for giving a nice escapism in those trying times. You made the player feel how much this game is your Magnum Opus just from the title screen's epic music.Respect ♡"

(Still, a performance patch would be appreciated)I've come to the realization that I'm probably playing the best game ever made. Just about 20 hours in, got to lvl 30 without doing the ""story"" whatsoever. I've been just exploring the gargantuan map and its many points of interest. I guess you'll need way over 150 hours in your first playthrough to see a fair amount of things. !EDIT! I am now just about 100 hours in, and I have to say.. I'm not really near the end I think.

Positive,"Performance wise, at the time of writing, the game still crashes on occasion and has performance hitches despite being played on a 3080ti.  The rest of this review is coming from a Souls veteran.  Those new to the Souls games, reviews from newer players might be more helpful to you.Content wise, it's bigger Dark Souls with a dedicated jump button and a horse, what more is there to say?  If you love Dark Souls, you'll feel right at home with the stunning breadth of weapons, spells armor sets and rings (talismans in this case).  Boss fights are just as much of a bombastic event as you've come to expect of them and best yet, you could easily spend 100+ hours just completing your first playthrough, and that's not including any farming you choose to take part in!  Oh, by the way, there is indeed an easy mode for this game in the form of NPC helpers you can collect to aid you in the vast majority of boss battles and even select open world encounters.  It's up to you whether you level them up and summon them or not.However here's where the praise comes to an end, I'm afraid.  I've logged 156 hours in total because of the size of the world and the stuff you can do and despite trying, I did not see it all.  The problem is, the world clearly was made too big for the devs to fill out in any meaningful way because they recycle enemies and bosses to a sickening degree.  If you liked a boss, 90% of them will be recycled five, ten or even twenty times (I'm looking at you, Flying Dragon Agheel), ultimately diluting the experience you had with them the further you go.  I feel the world should have been cut down by 1/3rd or even half its current size, because it's clear in its current state, the game had already blown its entire load at the halfway point and started resorting to recycling and then clumping enemies you've already seen together into spammy or health inflated variants by the other half to keep the challenge up.  Fog walls, which were once a nerve wracking first step, now become a sigh with the words, ""Oh, you again?"" often following.  I found myself comparing this game to a pallet of potato chips, rather than the high class dessert that is Dark Souls 1, 3 and Bloodborne.  By the time I made it through the last set of bosses, some with damn near endless hit strings, next to no recovery time and cheap, damn near unavoidable attacks, I had finished that final bag of potato chips from the pallet.  With my mouth dried beyond belief and cut up, feeling horribly sick afterwards, all I could say was, ""Thank Christ that's over."" and not in a satisfied way.In the end, I can still recommend this game.  It's still a stellar game overall, both technically and for the sheer bang for your buck.  The aforementioned diluting of experience from recycling isn't even objectively sound, it might not even bother you at all as long as you have something you can play for this damn long.  Just be sure you take breaks every few hours.  I feel my experience could very well be tainted from the fact that I could only marathon this game one day every week.  Doing a marathon of this game is a poor idea for the reasons already mentioned."
Positive,"Everyone you know is raving about this game. Why are you even bothering to read Steam reviews instead of playing it yourself?If you're like me, maybe you enjoyed Dark Souls games in the past but never quite fell in love with them.Or maybe you dislike most open world games and find them to be full of too much tedious, repetitive content for their own good. Perhaps you've grown jaded of the hype train over the years. I regret to inform you that, despite approaching this game with those concerns in mind, Elden Ring is so good that my contrarian instincts are struggling to find an excuse to dislike it.The world of this game is absolutely phenomenal. It's incredibly dense with things to discover and do, but also quite large. There is very little recycled content, and even the small throwaway dungeons generally manage to have their own character. It's genuinely impressive that there is so much content, and so much of it feels fresh and interesting. Gone are the copy/paste objectives like assaulting forts or climbing towers that plague the open world genre. Gone is the tradition of following waypoint markers across a world that you can't be bothered to pay attention to because there's nothing interesting to see. This is the open world game you've been waiting for since you heard about the concept. This is the game where you'll enjoy getting lost, where every time you decide to pursue a plot point or objective, you'll get sidetracked 8 different times along the way because something new caught your eye. The game where you'll see a mysterious location on top of a giant cliff, and you'll end up spending 45 minutes trying to figure out how to get up there, and love every second of it.I don't really have much to say about the combat. If you liked Souls combat before, you'll like it here. If you didn't, you won't. There are a couple of new mechanics, but overall the fighting feels familiar if you've played Souls games before.TLDR, I went into this game expecting Dark Souls 4, but open world (meh). What I got was Dark Souls 4, but set in what is without a doubt the best open world I've ever seen. I'm not even done with the game and I feel pretty confident saying that. Do yourself a favor and play this game."
Positive,"Alright. A lot of contention surrounding this game right now because of the technical issues. Here's my take:-GOOD-Absolutely gorgeously crafted game. The word is incredibly engrossing and beautiful in its own dark FROM SOFT twisted way. The gameplay is good. An improvement from previous Souls titles while maintaining a similar feel.-BAD-Definitely some optimization works needs to be done. Everyone is talking about that, no biggy. I'm sure it'll get patched. What's frustrating for me as a PC KB+M user is that the game only shows controller keybinds for prompts. This is confusing, and I struggled a good deal to figure out what a lot of the keybinds are. Furthermore, the keybind customization leaves out some important options like the map key. I had to Google how to pull up the map as it is not shown as a prompt (because the game only cares about representing controllers) and it did not appear in the options menu as a rebindable key. Very very sloppy.Would I recommend this game?As a work of art? 10/10 absolutely recommend.As a technically sound cross platform game? 6/10 some very basic functionality and smoothing of the rough edges needs to be done.Overall a recommend, but she needs some work."
Positive,"By far the best game that has ever been made, performance issues aside.Starts as easily a 9/10 within the first area of the game, and just keeps getting better and better and ends as a 15/10.Easily the best game I've ever played."
Positive,"Elden Ring Review (NO SPOILERS)-Its Dark Souls in big open world that is ...DONE RIGHT...with very immersive story if you pay attention. -Combat stays FAST and i would say you need to be kinda more ''precise'' then in previous titles (that does not mean its necessarily harder or easier... :D).-Exploring is fun and stays challenging even after completing almost everything. Game rewards you all the way through your run with upgrade materials, spells, weapons and runes so you feel that you discovered something new everytime you finish location/dungeon.-Story is told in kinda better way then Dark Souls, more things are explained during your game progression. BUT. There is also the depth that is in all souls like games which makes the game replayable.-Characters! YES! Characters are so good. They feel like living beings with motives and emotions. Well...you kinda can see the signature of George R. R. Martin all over.-The only Flaw Elden Ring has is PC optimalization which is very poor. FPS drops and HARD crashes are kinda semi-common (It got better now...but its still annoying).-MULTIPLAYER: I would say the multiplayer works so much better. Summon signs work better and dueling is super fun.For me as a Dark Souls FanBoy its simply MUST BUY...But...Iam trying to be as honest as i can be with the ratings...For Me it is: 9,5-10/10Objectively its: 8.5-9/10                                                           0-3 = BAD Game (dont buy)                                                           4-6 = Average Game (Big sale or some preference)7-8 = Good Game (wait for sale)9-10 = Very Good Game (MUST BUY)Thanks for reading. :)"

Positive,GotyWill do a proper review later :ok:
Positive,"Game works now as of the latest update. Still not a fan of EAC, but atleast I can play this amazing game again.Old review just in case Tim Sweeney breaks the game again.((Easy-Anti-Cheat has rendered this game unplayable.I don't mean performance wise or some other form of hyperbole, I mean I literally cannot play the game anymore because Easy-Anti-Cheat pops an error 15 and refuses to start. I could start without online, but having to do that because some other company that didn't work on the game broke it for me is stupid. This isn't a true thumbs down review, I love this game and probably wouldn't be making this otherwise but EAC no longer has a support section and information concerning fixing EAC is years old and scattered across various game forums and nothing I've tried seems to work.Thank you EAC for finally becoming the very worst you could've possibly become.))"
Positive,"Was on the fence about getting this game day 1 because of all the performance issues i have been hearing and possible reviews being deleted or bought; I went ahead and decided to give it a go (note: I am a huge souls fan) and so far I am not disappointed.So far I am having no performance problems other than the game being locked at 60FPS at the moment. I have had no big FPS drops so far and have been playing for a couple of hours.So far I highly recommend this game if you have decent pc specs (I'm on RTX 2080, 16gb ram, intel I-9). Remember to update the graphics drivers as well before playing.If this is your first from software game, please note that their games are naturally extremely hard and do not hold your hand. This is part of the reason beating levels feel so rewarding.Also I'm playing with keyboard and mouse and its definitely do-able (couldn't get a ps5 or xbox because of dam scalpers). The keyboard and mouse does take time getting used to but you'll have it down in an acceptable time."
Positive,"For the first time, I am doing a revised review for a game. Originally, I had given this game a negative review because I felt the cons outweighed the pros. But after patch 1.03 and continuing to play the game, I feel Elden Ring deserves a revised review which I will be giving it a positive score. However, I do have plenty of cons to mention regardless.Game is breathtaking to look at. So many moments of me wanting to take a screenshot and enjoy the scenery of it all. Even the 'worst' of places in Elden Ring still looks great, and the visuals are top notch. Out of all the From Software games, they really made this game incredible on the eyes. Absolutely jaw dropping to say the least.Soul games have always been linear and well designed, so I was afraid of how From Software would handle an open world. Gotta say, they did a very excellent job. You can pretty much almost go anywhere you'd like with a few exceptions, and Elden Ring took all previous games before it and placed them all into this one, the best traits anyways. So much variety of builds to go with, a lot of ways to fight, Ashes of War are incredible since they truly spice up combat and the fact you can fight while on horseback is so fun overall. Also every part of the world is filled with something- not a single place is empty. So many secrets, discoveries, unique bosses, and hidden lore that it is brimming. I'm very impressed to say the least.Also which ever employee came up with Spirit Summons, give them a raise. They're a super fun concept and the best solution if you somehow can't (or unwilling) to play online. Fantastic concept and well executed for sure.It's a Souls like, it is going to be hard. While I would even say Elden Ring is the hardest Souls yet, the devs have given people so many ways in approaching a fight. The game rewards players for exploring, getting stronger, finding better weapons or loot, and coming back to a boss to overcome it. While some builds are far superior depending on what you optimize, every build is good enough and so long as you're experienced and patient, the game can be beaten even with a lvl 1 character. It's all about how you go about a fight and learn from your mistakes.Perhaps the most depth of any previous Souls game as well, since there's so many NPCs to interact with, telling a story, having quests, and these ones actually move around the world which impacts the story. Some will be more of a fan favorite than others, but each NPC is well written and I definitely loved their dynamics, including the fact some outright help you in fights you would of otherwise struggled with. Doing and completing their quest lines not only rewards you with loot, but can even lead to changes and some secrets that wouldn't be possible otherwise.So ... despite Elden Ring is a very good game, great even- there are a lot of issues I have with the game even after patch 1.03 which fixed or improved the problems I had beforehand.To explain, the game gives little to no hints on how to progress certain NPC quests, what they'll do next, where to go at times (apart from main mandatory bosses), key items, very essential items, and so forth. I understand Souls games in the past have held back secrets but because they were linear, it was easy to check every corner and not miss too much. Here? The game is open world and the devs went out of their way to hide a lot of stuff, to the point you WILL need a guide or go into NG+. While I get they want you to replay their game and invest, it isn't properly executed. I know fans will say it rewards players for discovering stuff on their own, but the fact there's no quest markers, completion entries, or anything to let you know who's gone where, it takes me out of the game by a lot since I hate missing stuff.So this is a big one. I can't seem to co-op with friends, much at all. I can help strangers but if I use a password, game often disconnects me or downright crashes. Then you have people who are cheating often in PvP, using the most meta stuff that makes you die instantly (bleed builds ...) and honestly it doesn't feel like the devs balanced it well at all. The game is amazing in PvE, but PvP? Very unstable and not exactly good. Only plus side is helping those struggling with a boss but that's if the game lets me do so. No other game in my library has this issue with me doing multiplayer.Game will at times crash or stutter hard. It is at random, and nothing fixes it. I am not too upset due to the fact it isn't often, but when it does happen- it is quite terrible to experience. My graphics card is up to date, newer version, and again no other game in my library (besides infamous Skyrim) has this problem. I personally think they need to do more patches to fix this since so many are facing this issue still.This game is obsessed with certain builds, as they're very strong and can make the fight trivial even. If you do a bleed build or hyper magic build, you will destroy both PvE and PvP. If you do a strength build, you are hindering yourself sadly as so many enemies are fast, hit harder, and can tank against your heavy hits. Also some Ashes of War are outright broken. Also the meta for this game is very off putting- rather than earning your stuff, you can easily run around collecting upgrades and get your weapon to +9 or even 10 before killing a single boss. I know you don't have to do this, but knowing it's possible makes me wonder why handicap myself and struggle when I can just be overpowered off the start. I'd rather struggle and be forced to like previous games, even if there was cheese-like methods this game has too many opportunities to make you feel you need to be meta to just keep up in PvE and PvP.Game is great, very good I would say. A lot of downsides, with mostly it hiding important information and key items from you, forcing you to scout and possibly become overpowered to just win early. Not exactly the best, but for those who like to do whatever- it does benefit those people since they can just get to level 45, 10+ weapon before fighting the first boss (after the tutorial boss). Game's balance is questionable, and a lot of issues with multiplayer with meta and disconnections / crashes. But otherwise, game is very fun, engaging, has so much content, awesome bosses, and so much variety to the builds if you don't want to be meta. I am giving this a positive score but it was close to still being negative like the first review I did.Still hoping DLC comes out for this game i'm waiting with baited breath!"
Positive,"The perfect balance between complexity and fun! Well-drawn world, intriguing atmosphere and anxious expectation of something unpleasant. I think this is the game of the year! Maybe even generations! I recommend to buy!"
Positive,"A game that finally took game design, lore, story, and boss design to a whole new level. A true modern gaming masterpiece.The graphics are amazing with a very well-designed world with some breath-taking landscapes and boss designs that will be remembered for a decade.The game is very hard and unforgiving in many areas. I must have lost over 200 times but despite the hit to my pride this level of challenge made this game very enjoyable. A wish more games will deliver this type of a challenge in their games, as it makes you feel that you truly earned every fight you won and every item you get from those fights.""The Fallen Leaves Tell a Story. Of How a Tarnished Became Elden Lord.""Together, We Shall Devour The Very Gods..#BestGameOfTheYear"
Positive,"Elden Ring is a masterpiece, having mastered the art of showing without telling. From the get-go, Elden Ring doesn't impose any particular playstyle or route on you. You are completely free to do what you want to from the very start of the game. Where in previous titles you followed a general path to success, Elden Ring allows you multiple avenues and tools to navigate. The game hides many secrets, shortcuts, optional quests that develop the story, simultaneously make you rethink of a path you'll take. The game drew not just from the landscape of Soulsborne titles but also from the successful gameplay. The combat is challenging. No surprise there since it's FromSoftware game. The diversity of weapons and unique variety of enemies and bosses is astounding. This allowed it to be incredibly diverse in design. It's hard to choose a specific thing that makes the game so enjoyable, from the combat system and transportation to landscape, lore and storytelling. This game deserves nothing but praise from Soulsborne veterans and new players alike."
Positive,"The best game I've ever played, a masterpiece in every aspect: Gameplay: it's challenging, but it gives all the elements to overcome these challenges and make you feel proud of yourself, it's in fact very fulfilling. There are many approaches you can take to progress in the game and the immense amount of content it offers makes for a lot of combinations with different outcomes that makes every one of them new and refreshing. Art style: it could be simply ""graphics"", but I consider it an ""art style"" because of how everything is put in the right place to give a beautiful view of the world from every place and at any given time. At any moment you can stop, look in a direction and see what it looks like a beautiful painting in front of you, it will be almost always different thanks to the day and night cycle and the weather changes. Story/Lore: it's pretty cryptic and obscure, difficult to understand at first because it's very intricate and the storytelling isn't direct, in fact you will get little information from NPCs or cutscenes, you will mostly need to read items descriptions, basically let the world itself speak to connect the pieces and some of them will be left out anyway, that's why there is a lot of lore and speculations. Game progress: the open world setting gives you a lot of freedom on how you can progress through the game, almost nothing is directly given to you beside general tips on where you should go and what you should do so it's up to you to understand it. This can be stressful as much as the gameplay itself but getting used to it makes you appreciate the sense of bewilderment it gives and encourages exploration because that's always important. Side quests progress: I have inserted this paragraph separately because you will eventually ed up finishing the game but you will probabily miss a lot of content because side quests have the same obscurity as everything else but they are missable, and some of them even too much and that's the only criticism I have about the game, it still encourages replayability because in order to understand and experience everything you will probably need to do different runs anyway. Variety: the world is massive and varied, it's divided in different regions and all of them have their unique atmosphere with fitting enemies, looks and stories. There are many dungeons, the major ones are all beautiful, the minor ones can feel repetitive after some point but I enjoyed them anyway because most of them have some sort gimmick that gives a bit of variety. There are a lot of enemies too, some of them can be encountered both as bosses and as regular enemies later in the game, it can feel repetitive too but they don't give the impression to be some sort of ""filler"" because it's all fitting and the game is so massive that it doesn't matter anyway. Finally, there are a ton of ingredients, items, equipments and dozens of types of weapons with different movesets and styles. Longevity/Replayability: even without the replayability part, the game is immense and it can take easily 100+ hours to finish without even experiencing everything, that's why it has a good replayability, you can start a new game+ by keeping the progress of the first run and experience the content you missed while still trying new things like different builds and approaches, there are also different endings that requires you to partake into different side quests.As I said, this is the best game I've ever played and after almost 400 hours I still enjoy creating new characters and playing it in different ways, I even discover new dungeons and items after all this time! A masterpiece."
Positive,My first souls game. All I can say is wow. Absolutely amazing!!
Positive,im late to the party and have yet to beat the game but this is by far the best game i have ever played and the most challenging! spending the time to level and find the best weapon for my class has been fun and has led to many hours of entertainment and i look forward to many more hours in this game. 10/10 game of the century
Positive,"This is a review from a non-soulslike player.At first when this game was released i was on the negative side where i was like another dark souls, an annoying hard game that i don't want to try, amazed that it even won Game Of The Year. Talked with some of my friends how the game is all about a single community of soulslike had negative view points to be honest.3 Months back one of my close friend(as he also not a soulslike player it was his first soulslike game and he's playing in coop) recommended me to play the elden ring, i was like no somehow he convinced me by showing some of lore of Malenia and Miquella and i loved the story so i thought of lets give it a try. Bought the game with dlc as my friend said get the dlc too so here we go.so in my first play through i picked Vagabond class and i was playing with shield trying to parry and dying a lot my friend suggested leave the shield and just learn to dodge turn out this was much better for my playstyle. 1 week of playing the game understanding about stats/items/weapons/levelling/world/quest etc, i got hooked to the game. Killed the first boss after soo many tries. complained to one my friend who already finished elden ring he said ""yes, the first boss is unfair for new players as the 2nd boss is much easier"". Beat the second boss then after beating Rennala i changed my build and started using Sword of Night and Flame. Got to the best boss fight i ever had Radahn. soo many tries but in the end i won and from here i got deep into the lore Started watching VaatiVidya on YT for lore GOT HOOKED.For a month had to leave home for work means no gaming for a month and i never felt like that i want to go back play the game and complete it. But somehow this game is truly different. Got back home started playing again changed my build again to Greatsword with all strength enjoyed a lot. At fire gaint got stuck so changed my build again to moonveil with Nagakiba. This new build was more fun for me as its more agile. Now i'm at final boss waiting for dlc to drop so i can once again enjoy this game. Achieved almost every achievement on steam only game ending achievement remains that will be done after dlc.This game is new player friendly only if you give this a game time to understand its mechanics or else you'll refund it. The lore of this game is truly a masterpiece. Game design is on another level that cannot be achieved its just a miracle. On very few Bosses i felt like wtf is this boss but overall i loved playing against so many bosses. Maybe a those few bosses deserve a rework or to be looked at like (elden beast he is more annoying then Malenia). Music always hits the right spot at right time. Graphics is just wow as dunky says ""Its like walking in a well made picture"". This game is just a piece of art that you should give it a try. This game defines what a truly open world game meansI should've played this game when it was released.This Is The Game Of The Century."
Positive,"Well, almost 2 years later and only these past few months I was able to properly understand this massive work, even tho I platinumed the entire game in under a week the first time, only while doing this slowly and studying how to properly melt bosses gave the experience I was looking for, for a while playing vidya again after burn out didn't feel good, but Elden ring truly helped me get back on track to clear out souls like games again, in the entire lore, the primeval current and the demon that is shabriri helped me get the spice I was looking for. Doing this game as Kanye West with the Kamehameha and Lady Gaga with a bleed build (broken), was surely a lot of fun, it's no surprise that 10 percent of my screenshots are Elden ring stills or of just gameplay, the game is stunning and excels with a proper pc setup.""In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face, is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But there are times when a critic truly risks something, and that is in the discovery and defense of the new. The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations, the new needs friends.""-Anton Ego, RatatouilleIn short, MAY CHAOS TAKE THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Positive,This game has some special moments that you would explain while talking about why do you love games and soulsborne series this much.
Positive,Such upsetting that you can only experience it once for the first time. Therefore let there be joy and all the more NIHIL!
Positive,"In Elden Ring, an intricately designed world unfurls, purposefully deviating from strict realism to embrace a stylized and artistic dark fantasy aesthetic; it's akin to being immersed in a living, interactive painting. The combat system is truly exceptional, offering a plethora of weapons that cater to diverse styles and approaches, and the overall experience is further elevated by the stellar soundtrack, culminating in the unequivocal recommendation of Elden Ring as a masterpiece."
Positive,"FAM LOGS:Woke up from a wild dream... Secret Santa for my Steam bestie. Dropping the fanum tax soon like a rizzler from Ohio, tho, can't play til Jan.Taught my IRL bestie how to play Elden Ring. Heard boss music in the background while I worked on my project. Girl literally got excited about everything in the game and didn't even know how to jump xDD hahah. It was hilarious and cute. A nice memory.GAME LOGS:FROMSOFTWARE will always have my money. GG. 10/10. Noice."
Positive,"From Software is raising the bar with every game it makes, this time to  The Lands Between. Elden Ring, which was recently voted the best game of the year, offers us the unique breadth of Zelda's open-world and the compelling atmosphere of the souls genre. Even naysayers who are against it because of the difficulty reduction and dungeons that make you feel like you're doing the same thing as you wander through their depths, every one of the gamers will be amazed when they open their eyes in that glamorous land where the majestic Erdtree reaches the vast sky. As you and Torrent -our mighty horse- enter the misty forest following a wolf howl you hear, our curiosity will be piqued each time by something else. After defying a gigantic and grisly snake while trying not to be swallowed by the lava in Volcano Manor, we will be amazed by the sky in Nokstella, which feels like a fairy tale. Begin your journey  Tarnished, go and be an Elden Lord as you like."
Positive,"Finished the game, get the 4 armpit ending, and uninstalled.This game is good, very. But i don't want to go through that again. Doing it again would spoil the fun because the fun is in the exploration and experiencing new stuff. One that will only be felt once. 130 hours is already enough to justify the price.This is a masterpiece, one that will be made once every decades, and i feared what fromsoft will became. Because once you made a masterpiece, the rest will never be better. I had my fun, thank you fromsoft"
Positive,"I've played and beaten all the Darks Souls games as well as Bloodborne and Sekiro. These games are some of my all time favorite games (except Dark Souls 2). Therefore, I was obviously really looking forward to Elden Ring. I can confidently say that the combat system in Elden Ring is the best it's been in any Dark Souls game (excluding Bloodborne and Sekiro). Normally, this would be enough to make Elden Ring another one of my all time favorite games. I mean, I love the gameplay of the Dark Souls games, and Elden Ring has the best out of all those games! While that's true….. The saying ""too much of a good thing"" applies for Elden Ring. While the combat system in Elden Ring is absolutely spectacular, the game is simply too repetitive.Let's start with the positives. Elden Ring combat system is fundamentally the same as Dark Souls. I consider Dark Souls combat to be the pinnacle of defensive combat (excluding Sekiro). What this means is that the difficulty in Dark Souls does not come from the offensive aspect of the game. After all, being offensive in Dark Souls is a relatively simple matter… you press the attack button once, maaaaaaybe twice and then go back to blocking/dodging. There's no combos to learn or anything like Devil May Cry or God of War. The difficulty instead comes from the defensive aspect of the game, which means learning how to block and/or dodge enemies. For a lot of games, I can distil the game down to ""press these buttons and you'll beat the game"" or ""there's fundamentally going to be 4 different scenarios. Do these things in those scenarios, and you'll beat the game"". I can pretty much never do that in a Dark Souls game. While some enemies/bosses are easier than others, you pretty much always have to learn the most effective way to beat enemies and bosses. This keeps the game fresh and exciting since you're always surprised to see a new enemy and boss.Elden Ring refines the core combat system by adding a lot of offensive options, as opposed to Sekiro which refined the defensive options. Specifically, Elden Ring introduces Ashes of War, guard counters, jump attacks, and poise break.For all of the Dark Souls games, my ""decisions"" for offense basically boiled down to which weapon I would use. I always had a colossal sword and a straight sword in my loadout. For an enemy/boss, I simply had to decide which weapon to use (usually regular enemies = colossal sword. Bosses = straight sword). In Elden Ring, the combat is so much more interesting now. Not only do I have to decide which weapon to use, but I also have to decide which Ash of War in my two weapons is going to be more useful, do I use guard counters, jump attacks, etc… It should be noted that the additional offensive tools that players have do not make you overpowered. In Nioh 2, with all the offensive tools that they gave you, you could almost break the game. In Elden Ring, the enemies and bosses still pose a decent challenge despite your tools. What's great about this is that it creates so much more to master, making beating enemies and bosses so much more satisfying. Now, not only do you have to think about how you're going to avoid getting hit (block, dodge sideways, forward, backwards), but you also have to decide how best to respond (attack once, weapon arts, guard counter, jump attack). I really enjoyed the depth of this system and beating bosses with a mix of regular attacks, weapons arts, guard counters, and jump attacks.The above is a lot of praise for the game. What's the downside? Well…… it can get repetitive. Like…..ridiculously repetitive. Unlike the previous Dark Souls games, a lot of enemies, bosses, and environments repeat over, and over, and fucking over again. Almost all of the side dungeons will either be catacombs, or mines. The catacombs will almost always have stone imps or skeletons and the mines will almost always have miners. These environments and enemies also always look the same!!! (e.g. they're not even colored differently). Furthermore, so many bosses in these side dungeons and even in the open world repeat many times and can become really underwhelming. There's a boss that I kid you not can appear 13 times!!!!While bosses in FromSoftware games are some of the most difficult I've faced in any game……they're not going to ALWAYS pose a challenge. Eventually, players will master every single move that a boss can do and they will become boring. The boss that I had to face 13 times? The 1st time, I died like 3-5 times on time. After the 3rd time, I almost always beat it on my 1st time. Another good example I can think of are dragons. The first time I faced a dragon in Elden Ring, I though this was one of the best dragon boss fights I've ever faced. Then after the 3rd time I faced these dragons (must've fought like…..at least 10 of these things. In one ""boss"" you have to fight 5 in a row….), I just yawned when I faced these things (also, pretty much always beat on my 1st try). It should be mentioned that Elden Ring does have unique bosses, and these are a delight to fight. These are usually found in legacy dungeons and are a delight to fight. The problem is that these bosses are so few and far between. I would say that out of my 140 hours playing this game, maybe like 20 hours was spent fighting these main bosses. The rest was spent on the much more underwhelming side bosses. It should also be mentioned that most of the main bosses are found in the end game (like 7 of them) which is like 100 hours into the game. There's like 2 main bosses in the beginning and like 3 main bosses in the middle……that's not very balanced.The progression system of Elden Ring doesn't really help the game from feeling repetitive. One of the things about Open World games is that you're excited to find what new items you'll find in a dungeon. Well, the progression system of Elden Ring is almost exactly the same as Dark Souls, so that's not going to happen very often. This is because when playing Elden Ring, you're likely going to be playing a build. Be it a strength build, dexterity build, intelligence build, faith build, or an arcane build. Let's assume you're playing a strength build. That means if you get a dexterity/intelligence/faith/arcane item, you're not going to be excited (since you won't have the stats to use it). Also, armor in Elden Ring, similar to most Dark Souls games, is primarily for fashion, so finding armor isn't all that exciting either. Even a lot of weapons aren't going to be exciting since after a while, you'll have upgraded your weapons a lot so you won't feel like changing weapons unless the weapons are real game changers in their movesets or ashes of war. For me, after like 50 hours in the game, I more or less stopped getting excited for new items. I might get excited every 15-20 hours for some new item, but that is a LONG time for an open world game.Basically, the first 30 - 50 hours of my time with the game was very exciting because everything was new. The bosses that were going to repeat hadn't repeated yet, so it felt like I was facing a good challenge every single time I went into a dungeon. The next like 70 - 90 hours were pretty damn repetitive. It was still fun, but not awesome or epic like most FromSoftware games are. The last 10-20 hours were really fun because I just faced one cool boss after another….. But just because the game ended well, doesn't change the fact that a majority of my time playing the game was spent doing repetitive shit.Even though the combat system in Elden Ring is one of the best I've ever seen, I can't say facing so many enemies and bosses over and over again was something I looked forward to doing every day. While Elden Ring is fun and a good game, I wouldn't exactly call it a masterpiece, or even FromSoftware's best game for that matter."

Positive,"After beating the game, its time for a review:Yes indeed, this is your next gen Bamco game that you have been waiting for.World is huge, I mean HUGE. To the point that I almost felt uncomfortable playing it after the other Souls games. You are just wandering and wandering and wandering till you find something useful and exploration simply just takes away too much time. But honestly...it's an open world game afterall, what did you expect?Obviously large part of the game can be played by the player itself, but when it comes to questlines and stuff like that, it still requires Souls level precision. Let me know if anyone can beat the game 100% achievements without opening a wiki. Let me spoiler - you will need a wiki.Bosses are quite on the easy side with some exception. Half of the bosses were in the ""First try"" category without any challenge, other half is a mix of those battles that you need to practice a bit before getting the hang of it. And then there are the exceptions. Like Malenia that i've spent countless tries to beat. Completely out of balance compared to other bosses.Was expecting a wider variety of bosses when it comes to difficulty, not just the 2 extremes.PvP:Don't even get me started. The cesspool of it's kind. Complete d.o.g.s.h.i.t. Try it out and you will see.At it's current state it is completely broken. 80% of people I have invaded were just hunting invaders for giggles. You are invading them, you get either 1 shot or brutally comboed to death, you die, you try invading again. Rinse and repeat. As a former invader in DS3 with a few thousand hours of experience, I see no future in Elden Ring PvP.What I also enjoyed in previous Souls games is the music. This one is no exception. Greatly composed tunes they are indeed, but sometimes it's just simply not fitting. Main menu theme is literally giving off some superhero movie vibe which I'm really not a fan of.Also with the huge amount of bosses, they couldn't keep up with the music, a lot of smaller bosses share the same few boss songs. But honestly, this is understandable and forgivable.What else can be summed up in a review? I don't really like to give detailed reviews because im not a man of words.Here is what you get:-A game that will last for a while, but only for PvE.-Absolutely STUNNING graphics and visuals (I wish it was better optimised tho)-Some cool bosses-Some really cool bosses-The creativity is on point with G.R.R. Martin.Can't thank enough for my buddy Steve for surprising me with the game."
Positive,I love big swords.
Positive,"if your a gamer who likes a challenge, Fantasy, Great Cosmetics, an open world with an immersive atmosphere and more play styles then your Maidenless Rump can handle. This is the game for you. Come on in and ""Git Gud""."
Positive,"Ruined my daily life, I don't regret it.But it's been 2 weeks, no shutter fix, pain in my rear cheeks."
Positive,Never in my life have i touched a game capable of making me play it for longer than 15 hours on one sitting. that should say enough
Positive,"Finally a game that lives up to the hype, get it, you can thank me later."
Positive,"Easily the best game to release within the past two years. The latter half of the game is much weaker than the first half and there are some technical problems relating to performance in some areas, but overall this game is definitely worth your time and effort, even if you're not the biggest fan of ""souls"" games. update for steam awards"
Positive,"I highly recommend it even for non Souls fans. The difficulty can be vastly reduced by using summons, so even people who are not looking for a challenge can have great fun with the bosses. But is that even a game for you if you are not into boss encounters? How good can the open world really content really be?Well, its a masterpiece. Quite simply. Everytime i played an open world game and went exploring, more often than not i was rewarded with nothing. Because most games force players to go through all of the content they spent so much time working on. So exploration is really limited simply due to the fact that the game will lead you into areas anyway. Not so Elden Ring. After i encountered my first big boss battle, and died in shame way to many times i'd care to admit. I thought to myself, well, lets check out the other things. And everything i thought to myself ""ah i am sure there is nothing over there""BAAAAAAMMM optional boss encounter. Baaaaaam cool items.it was one worthwhile experience after another for completly optional content. So not only do i highly recommend this game to everyone. I also would like to say thank you. Thank you for showing that open worlds can be compelling. That you can design them without handholding your playerbase into certain content. Elden Ring became my number one open world game of all time. But it also ruined me for other open world games. My expectations for them, now that it was showen how well you can design one, will be higher than ever. Also, i personally did not have any stutters or performance issues. But i know a lot of people did. I just thought i mention that just in case.and lastely, please always make open world games form now on. I beg of you!"
Positive,"I mean.... Its a cocktail of the very best From Soft games offer, from Demon Souls to Sekiro, with the addition of a massive and breathtaking open world. If that alone isnt enough to warrant your purchase, move along. This isnt the game you are looking for."
Positive,OOOOOHHH ELDEN RING...
Positive,"try fingers, but hole"
Positive,I only had stuttering in the big open areas occasionally. The Game hits the mark on everything else. My specs are 4 years out of date and can still run the game on medium at 60 barring the open areas as stated.
Positive,Probably the best game I've played in 2022.
Positive,more exciting than jerk off
Positive,open world proving once again it isn't a good thing. maybe its fun with friendsedit: there is a very nice room at the roundtable so on second thought i do recommend
Positive,I keep dying
Positive,"99/100 already in my book.My 1st time ever in 'souls' game but already stunned by the character creation! 5 minutes into gameplay and already fell to the cliff because of the troll message, but hey, it's fun! Can't wait to do the same thing to other people!.The stutter isn't as bad as the reviews have said. I use max settings, 1440p, it only stutters when you're changing area (from 60fps to 50fps less than 1sec.), I believe the issue will be resolved soon.Definitely I would recommend this game!"
Positive,"this game is work of art, it will immerse you as you progress the game and finding new locations , full of mystery followed by chill and dark soundtracks that fits the game environmentsand the fact it is open world and considered to be souls game, hence you can spend hundreds of hours in game."
Positive,If you like this game then you're definitely a masochist that's into degradation and humiliation
Positive,If i see another fat guy with a tail running at me im going to have nightmares
Positive,"Editing this review to say: Performance issues aside, this game is fucking incredible. Still the occasional stutter but far from what it was on launch day for whatever reason."
Positive,"This game simply shows how much love and hard work the devs have put in. I have played a lot of games and admired the craft put in them. But Elden Ring stands out from all of those. Initially when I started playing, seeing the map, I thought how can the world be so small. Little did I know that it was just a small part of the entire world. As I progressed through the game, I realized each area is distinct and very well made. The eerie feeling in dark dungeons and thinking that a strong enemy may sprung out of the dark any moment keeps you on your toes all the time. There are a lot of variations in enemies and the boss designs are of different level entirely. I find most games that have a playtime of 10-20 hours are very detailed. But creating such a huge world and taking into account each and every detail is very impressive. Never did I encounter any bug as well. This game is well worth the money spent and even more. I conclude that this is the best game I have ever played (keeping into mind RDR2 and KCD)"

Positive,"Elden Ring is a good game.Edit: I have now completed the game, here is my conclusion as a list. Keep it in mind that these criticisms only come out of me because I very much enjoyed the game, but I like thinking about what could've been made better. Below that is my original review, they're my first impressions.- This game reuses fights too many times. The bosses they reuse the most are the ragtag ones which become mobs after a while. BUT the good fights are really good and there are a lot of them, no other game has this many good bosses. The animation quality is top notch. So it is actually a really good souls game hidden inside an open world which is something I can not complain at all.-However, there are pacing issues with the open world. The first half of the game does not do anything with the lore. You are fighting against normal soldiers, monsters and NPCs, but there isn't really any character behind them, because, well, they are normal and mundane. The best fights are naturally the last ones against literal gods, and they are relatively well thought out and placed in the world.-The concepts of this game feels off. The gritty structure of the other FromSoftware games is less sturdy here. All the things like masks, watchdogs, fingers, Radahn's horse, muscle Godfrey, Elden Beast... They are more silly than fun. The twists of the story is the same way, being open for interpretation is one thing, but the first half of the game is literally convoluted exposition. There is no visual storytelling here, just NPC's overexplaining things. Then you actually see what's going on in the end and go ""Then what the fuck was the point of X?"" It doesn't feel like things fall into place that well.-The variety of this game is great. But i think there are too many ways to break the game. I feel like I had to intentionally gimp myself to actually enjoy the game. And if I tried hard and did difficult bosses first, then easier bosses would get even easier. So I always had to go out my way to find the ""intended"" path not to miss out on the fun. trying to moderate my own gaming experience was a little tiring.-It's very easy to miss NPC interactions. And that's not because the game doesn't have quest logs or mini-maps, but this game's quest flag/trigger system is ancient, two decades old, worked well enough in previous, linear games, but not anymore. NPC's still does not trigger if you do not exhaust their dialogue and stay where they are forever. They also do not show up on the compass(which is already in the game) or anything, so you can pass by them without actually noticing them. There are instances where NPC's won't talk to you at all because you did not start the quest line like a 2000s MMO. But to be fair, I appreciate all extra content in the game. First Impressions: My biggest doubt about this game was the open world, but it turned out way better than I expected: Usually open world games fail to fill the empty maps with anything meaningful, and becomes repetitive very quickly with reused assets/dungeons/missions/enemies. Now, I do not think Elden Ring completely avoids this problem, but it makes up for it with creative ideas. Whether it is unique bosses or new ways to use older enemies, or cunning ambushes, or a funny NPC encounter; It makes the time you spent exploring around worth it. Also I like how the game does not make you waste too much time wandering around in the first place because fast travel and your horse are accessible from the very start of the game.Combat is better. It is rich with numerous options and more variety than older entries from FromSoftware:This game is everything accumulated from FromSoftware's experience, so it might feel old, and if you are bored of Souls games you might give this game a second thought. However I think its balance hits a sweet spot (PVE-wise). The combat is heavier so unlike more recent games after Bloodborne, you can not solely rely on dodging, or rather it is harder and you have to be better at it, which is a good thing because it manages to break the endless dodge&attack loop. The shields are back, and magic is more fun with close/ long ranged options. Even bows feel better, and not completely useless although they are arguably still not that interesting. Spirits are also not exactly the ""easy mode"" you'd expect them to be but fun tools in your arsenal.However the few encounters I had in PVP left a bad taste in my mouth with how each invader had 10 flasks and janky builds which I assume were obtained by looting the whole game without leveling up once. Or simply, the level scaling does not work very well and there is not much you can do when they run away in the wide meadows to hide behind the mobs.I think the weakest part of Elden Ring is the concepts, and how they include things that wouldn't make it into more linear, refined games:Visual storytelling has been an attribute in Souls games that's gained a lot of notoriety throughout years. However, even though the prominent writer George R.R. Martin was involved with it, who frankly I don't think ever played a video game in his life, I think this game's writing is silly. Silly, sometimes in a funny way, but more so in an annoying, nonsensical way. Things that exist in the world does not have a prevalent hierarchy. There is an Elden Ring, Yggrdrassil trees, the fingers, there are gods, then tarnished are dead gods reborn, and normal soldiers i guess are not gods or tarnished but perhaps human, then there are many beasts, undead, spirits, monstrocities and illnesses that somehow weren't overcome by gods and there is an abundance of them while the gods hide in their castles in their Lands Inbetween, whatever that means, does that mean it's not actually their home? Because this place really lacks a proper town for having this many divine rulers. Even all those castles are riddled with ghosts and rats in their basements.These vague, blurry boundaries of concepts are not very easy to follow and not very interesting when ultimately it is used for something mundane merely surrounded with a surreal environment. A character will tell you to search for a man called Geoffrey the Dungeater or something hiding in a shabby shack in the middle of nowhere in search for some vague magical item, and leave the explanation at that. And then the game will reveal Geoffrey is a masked maniac or already dead. You'll forget about these characters in less than an hour although they are tarnished, closer to gods, just like you. (This is not a real example, it's just rhetorical) These are the times I wish this game toned down on fantasy so any of this mess would make sense in the world where there should've existed a divine order of which many of its keepers, the gods are still alive and relatively well. The game will make you fight soldiers in farcical, impractical costumes, or some statue contraption with a stupid carved face defending empty catacombs, and there will be not much more reason to their existence than ""It's just a game. It's supposed to be fun."" Which is fine, because that's true to some extent, DS1 had dragon asses as enemies for example and Sekiro had monkeys, Bloodborne had mushroom people. But these things did not make those games fun. They are the few loveable lows of these finely crafted games while in Elden Ring it is more of a constant. There are more clown masks rather than cool armor in this game. I think this game is too similar to DS2 in this way, and most things are there for more content without much cohearance and with subpar quality, and it is the only thing that holds this game down from being a classic masterpiece.TL;DR: This game is a good game unless you find the concepts of this game too annoying rather than funny and silly. Other than that, if you don't absolutely hate a slower Souls combat, go for it. It's worth seeing it."
Positive,"In a few words: Amazing, but in moderation.Elden Ring - the latest From Soft entry - entered the gaming scene with one of the biggest hype trains ever seen. Now that the dust has settled at the station, we can mostly agree that the game has definitely lived up to that hype; albeit with a few small caveat. But first, the great: The game is wonderfully illustrated, both with the world building and its inhabitants' design: from the detailed local flora to gigantic enemies, they all feel unique and alive. It is almost guaranteed that players would stop in awe of the surroundings every now and then just to take in the world's grandeur.The NPCs that one meets along their journey also feel very colorfully animated and dynamic, most of which has a semi-hidden questline that the player can follow - as is the tradition of From Soft's games. However do be careful that some of these characters' questlines are either very easy to miss or to be messed up.A bigger world also means a much bigger variety in how the player can build their character. Weapons are definitely the strong suit of the game with one hidden in every nook and canny of the world, awaiting adventurous players seeking off the beaten path. And the special effects of weapons, spells, incantations... in the game feels extremely beautiful and in a way, badass. And now, the the not so good: While beautiful, the game on PC does suffer from performance issues like most From Soft ports to the PC. Patches have been released to iron out major problems but some remain. Most serious for me personally were the random crashes.Enemies do feel unique and boss fights are quite epic, but it is rather unavoidable that a game world of this scale will eventually have to resort to reusing enemies and bosses: turning bosses from early game to later game common enemies and vice versa. Though it does not ruin the experience as a whole, it does a get a little repetitive to see the biome changes but not the enemies we face.This game also has serious balancing issues with most of the later game contents being way overtuned, forcing players to invest heavily into HP in order to just survive from being one-shotted. Some bosses, ahem Malenia, feels very frustrating to fight against due to unfair and unfun mechanic. Some spells that the player can utilize also feels very broken turning some parts of the game a cake walk - but I do tend to stay away from such spells.And finally, with such a size, I do occasionally feel burnt out exploring the world's vastness. And the no hand-holding policy along with intentional vagueness in these games can disorient and discourage newer players from adventuring about. Hence, I found the game most enjoyable in short bursts rather than doing long playthroughs at a time. All in all: The game is great, despite some flaws. It takes all the goodness from previous Soulsbornesekiro titles and mash them together in an open world frame: an unforgettable dish that die-hard and new fans will definitely enjoy."

Positive,GREATEST GAME OF ALL TIME. PERIOD. POINT FINAL.
Positive,"Bro, this game is ring af"
Positive,"EASILY one of the best games in the past decade. It has some flaws, sure. But compared to what you get out of this game, ESPECIALLY compared to other big AAA dumpster fire money grabs, From Software keeps it real and just delivers a game that takes bits and pieces from all the other souls games that we enjoyed and put them all in a MASSIVE world for us to explore. I legit deleted over half of my steam library because of this game, and probably won't come back to them for a good long while. Having an absolute blast with this game. TLDR IT GUD. BUY GAME. THANK YOU From Software for another awesome experience. 10/10 for me."
Positive,"After 100 hours i can say that its one of my favourite games ever and it might just be my favourite Fromsoft title. For me, they nailed every aspect of what i love about the Souls titles and put it into an expansive and aesthetically gorgeous world. Being honest i cannot praise the visual and area design enough, it feels like Ds1 but larger and more grand. I personally hail Ds1's design as ""perfect"" as can be so take what i said as you will. As usual the music is fucking fantastic too. So so many new types of spells and incantations which open up many more interesting types of builds than we've had before. Ive personally planned a multitude of themed characters to play through both in PvP and PvE. The lore of Elden Ring is also superb and i think also the most accessible lore so far in a Fromsoft title. Also General Radahn is an absolute chad. My only criticisms of Elden Ring would be the copy pasted bosses as general enemies in late areas of the game or having 2x the boss for a boss fight. I personally feel like they're a crutch and also diminish earlier emotions of victory from beating a boss and 2x bosses in an area is, IMO, ""lazy"" Elden Ring is a BIG game, perhaps one of the largest ive ever played but to me everything about Elden Ring is big and grand and just absolutely deserves your attention. No other game company has made an open world game so well as Fromsoft."
Positive,"This is the best souls game. Hell, this is the best game. Git gud.Edit: If you are a veteran invader you will probably not like this game. This is much more focused around the open world exploration and co-op aspects of the game than it is the PvP. With that being said, this game also has the absolute worst camera angle I have seen in any title by Fromsoft, which makes some of the main story bosses incredibly unpleasant to fight. All of the ""build diversity"" really goes away in PvP, when you need to use bloodhound step to survive almost any situation that involves more than one opponent. No true combos means its crazy hard to turn and burn and get a reset if you are getting chased by multiple opponents. I don't see the longevity in the Invasion scene in this game. Really sad for someone who has put countless hours into PvP in both DS2 and DS3. 1v1 duels will most likely be more popular than ever before.The auto camera recovery has to be broken cause even with the setting off it bounces off walls all the time. When you lock onto a boss, and it does an animation where it is moving quickly, your camera will go nuts. I personally felt as if I was fighting the camera more than the boss half the time. All that being said a single main story play-through still netted me around 100 hours and thats pretty killer compared to most releases in general. If you have not played a souls game you will probably love this game as co-op has been much more streamlined than before, and it is definitely at its best."
Positive,Back for more!
Positive,"A culmination of From Software's talent wrapped up in one addictive experience. Performance issues aside, this is easily one of my top favorite games of all time."
Positive,"Best game since the WItcher 3Fromsoft has once again outdone themselves. They combined everything they learned throughout the souls series, Sekiro and Bloodborne into this game and it shows. The attention to detail, environment, soundtrack and pacing is just fantastic.Huge Pros:Open world (duh)Jumping (double duh)Fast traversing via spirit horse Underground layer to the mapVariety of enemies Cons:Too little upgrade matieralsThe dmg spike on some of the late game bosses is absolutely ridiculous - getting 2-shot at 50 vigor shouldn't be a thingConvoluted side-quests (Looking at you Alexander)All in all this game is a masterpiece that I'll play through a couple of times at least!Can't wait for what the devs will come up with next."
Positive,"The fact that if I ever run into an enemy I can't figure out or beat and decide to just leave and do something else is just simply amazing. There's definitely a lot of quality of life improvements that make this game especially more welcoming to newer players too. From being able to respawn closer to your area of death. Guard Counter mechanic. The currency to summon friends is significantly easier to obtain and like mentioned earlier you can always get on your horse and just leave an area and do something else for hours before coming back. To new players, find what works for you and don't fall into the trap of meta builds and naysayers saying you can't do certain things. As long as it kills and you're having fun. It's the best build. P.S. Just give all your prayer books and scrolls to turtle pope since he never moves."
Positive,"I never liked the concept of souls-like game, i mean it's just not for me since i don't like the idea of punishing yourself with high difficulty of gameplay. But then i tried this game knowing that i would probably refund it with my lack of skills. I was wrong.The one that hooked me the most is the exploration and story. The problem with most open world games is some 'empty' areas that could be disappointing to explore. This is not the case with this game, every corner of the map has a 'surprise' for you to get.It rewards you with every curiosity you tried to do, but it also comes with a price. I can say now, this is the first fromsoftware game that i deeply in love with, and would recommend it to everyone."
Positive,its alright (best game i've ever played)
Positive,OOOOOOHHH ELDEN RING
Positive,OOOOOOOOOH ELDEN RING
Positive,"Elden Ring, even at its most average points, makes Breath of the Wild seem like an indie early access game.The design will soon have you coming to expect an entire new world tucked away around any corner, or some ""final boss"" quality enemy to encounter where other games might hide a single item. Enemy designs are continually mind blowing, with some of the most fluid and dynamic animation sets I've ever seen. There are countless weapons to use, with a many of them even having completely unique move sets within the same class of weapon. If it weren't for the consistent ass kicking I was receiving, the visuals alone have my jaw at the floor. FromSoftware has once again crafted an amazing world within the AAA landscape of cash grabs and failed promises. I really could go on about everything I liked about this game, but I'll cut it short here.That's not to say there weren't also legitimate things to complain about:• There was one boss in particular (mr. slim and big fatty) that BLEW MY MIND when it came to their design, phases, and extremely demanding difficulty. I first found this boss within a completely unrelated and secluded dungeon, but to my dismay, later discovered that they would be reused THREE MORE times in unrelated locations, including one MANDATORY main-quest end-game fight. While I don't believe ""bosses"" being reintroduced as regular enemies once you're much stronger is a bad thing, finding such a major end-of-game boss MUCH earlier than when you'd fight them in the main story was rather disappointing. They also did similar repeat bosses throughout the game, but to be fair, they were reintroduced in ways that weren't quite as jarring.• Horse combat is fairly boring and simplistic. Once I felt confident, I mainly used the horse to get around, then fought on my own two feet.• While the modernized enemy animations of Elden Ring are truly stunning, it can sometimes feel as if these advancements are to the game's detriment. Foes are more wild than ever, with it often feeling like you're being attacked by olympic grade gymnasts. To be a bit more specific, it's not all that rare that any given enemy will have some 3-6 chain attack, and will just keep throwing different versions of these at you nonstop. To be clear, it's awesome as hell, but can sometimes feel like the developers just turned it up to 11 with little consideration for interesting back and forth combat or tense pauses. I wouldn't be surprised if you just snagged the biggest shield you could find and abused the hell out of the new block-parry system.• It's not really a complaint so much as a warning, but you'll need to be extremely mindful of how you're gearing your character and making sure you're not beating your head against something for too long. The world is massive and meant to be explored in a non-uniform manner. It kind of blew my mind to listen to my friends beat their heads against something they obviously weren't ready for, and eventually came to understand how quickly someone can assume that they just need to ""git gud"". In my experience, this game is actually pretty easy if you just feel out the world and find the areas actually designed for your current progression point, but it goes without saying that non-linear open world games can be difficult to navigate intuitively.blablabla go play it, easily game of the year and it's only February."

Positive,"This Game is a recommend with a hard ""but"". As of Patch 1.021, there have been insane complaints from  the same reviewers who highly recommended this game that the performance was terrible and was in fact worse than the patch they were given to play and review on. I believe this will get fixed and I believe the reviewers who recommended this game didn't lie at all about the strong points of this game. When looking past the stuttering in new regions, you will see an amazing open world, difficult enemies, a beginner friendly travel system, more difficult enemies, loot, and more difficult enemies! I have not been by any means a fan of the Soulsborne series however saw its charm in my quick demo of playing DS3. With that, I must say while experiencing and even AFTER experiencing this title, I for sure will give the other games a shot (the ones without centipedes btw)"

Positive,"Well Elden ring was my first souls game, and imma be honest, it was the game that really made  feel something, the last time that I had those feelings was only playing BO2 and GTA5. I had it already beat it on PS4 and was the first game that I preorder in my whole life of gaming, I can’t not describe the amount oh joy I had discovering this new world and the bosses that I encountered. Later on in the same year that Elden ring launched I had decided to build my first PC, and fast forward this year I decided to beat one more time this masterpiece here on PC, I’m really proud that this game was my first platinum on steam.

Positive,"Honestly, even baseline game this was just an amazing time for me. What really brought it together though was when I installed the Seamless coop mod. Being able to adventure through the entire game with a friend from start to finish (minus the few issues the mod brought with it) really made for a great time. It's why I easily was able to put in over 1k hours on it. Really looking forward to any additional content we get to explore the world and story more."
Positive,"It's a fun and adventurous game. It pulls of the same feel of many Souls-like games. But manages to give a new fresh take. While at it's core it's mechanics are very familiar. They managed to add on while not overwhelming your game play. The open world and freedom to run with your character adds a fresh new layer on the game play that were used to from similar games. It's enemies are very diverse and spread out, they added them into this world and blended them in well. With the enhanced graphics from previous titles it makes the atmosphere feel relaxing or ominous with the day/night cycle and weather. This game is definitely not easy but its not insanely difficult. That being said I do suck pretty bad at these games. :) Just takes time and patience but will entertain you as you go with its vast and open world. (Def not a sponsor :P)"
Positive,"I've tried just about every Fromsoft game and have given up on every one an hour/two into playing them... Something is different about this one. Elden Ring is beautiful, challenging, and overall a very well made game. Obviously they will work on optimization, but for the time I've played I've experienced frame drops 2-3 times and it was nothing debilitating at all. My gameplay hasn't been negatively affected once by performance issues. I can't tell if some people just want to complain for the sake of complaining or are really experiencing gameplay breaking performance drops... Regardless, I wholeheartedly recommend the game."
Positive,"[]~(￣▽￣)~* :praisesun:OVERWATCH OPS is the first and only roleplay event by Argentinian RP connoisseur Agent Smith. It was published posthumously, as Smith disappeared and was declared dead some time after writing it. Critically acclaimed upon release, OW: OPS is considered the first HL2RP opera. Semi-autobiographical, the event's first stage dubbed ""SMITTY"" depicts Smith discovering he is wanted for murder. After he is taken away at the end of the first scenario, the rest of the event reveals aspects of his past and ultimately the crime which he is being hunted for in OPS. This circular narrative has been noted for its resemblance to the Roleplay Cycle™; some reviewers believe Agent Smith to be teaching others the secrets of ROLEPLAY and a way to evolve roleplay itself through this structure, while others decry him as a would-be Kuropixel."
Positive,"Edit: Was previously negative due to poor performance on launch.The game runs fine now, it kept a mostly stable 60 fps. Though maintaining 60fps isn't a very high bar to achieve, that does make it playable. It is still missing features like ultrawide support, some cutscenes lag, and the grass has poppin issuues. It's technical aspect fine now, but just barely, sadly.The world of the game is amazing, and is Fromsofts best looking and designed world to date.. It would be a true perfect world if it weren't for a few late game areas. Unfortunately those suffer from enemy reuse, and bloated hp pools, which detracts from the amazing scenery throughout unfortunately. It feels a bit rushed in those last parts enemy-wise, which is sad.The bosses sadly weren't as great as something like DS3 had, they are often super fast and too punishing. This also limits the in-theory cool new Ashes of War, as some are just too slow for bosses that have infinite stamina and long combos. Some bosses really needed dialing down. There is also a decent amount of boss reuse. I don't mind it for beasts or Knights but even story bosses get reused occasionally, and overall it's a bit too much. Then strangely, some areas have reused mid bosses but an optional, missable unique boss, which feels like an odd design choice. Overall, the bosses are good, but not great.Weapon and character systems are mostly souslike and work well, as does the riding. The new guard counter was somewhat limited in its use in later stages as blocking became less feasible. Jumping works overall well in enabling vertical exploration, though fall damage behaves inconsistently and some parkour-like sections are prone to you suddendly slipping off.  The crafting system works decently well, and is optional aswell. As far as open world crafting systems go, it's good at what it's meant to do.Overall, I think this game is great and definitely worth playing, but a few things toward the end sour it a bit. The first half would be 10/10, afterwards it goes down a bit. It's still a great game deserving of its praise, but not perfect."

Positive,"+ huge amount of content and big world+ variability in playing style+ a large number of weapons / spells / special abilities / items+ leveldesign+ weapons customization options+ terrain goat and its abilities- recycling from past souls games as well as itself- hitboxes and inconsistent processing of damage to between npcs- low inventions, almost all procedures and elements are known from previous gamesElden Ring is an old famous Souls game in the open world. All the good and bad qualities of souls games came together in this great game, just souls replaced by runes, the protagonist is tarnished and not ashen, again the world is a lack of words and normal existence, and story can be ignored by the player. The player has the ability to destroy dozens of species with a plethora of weapons and fighting styles, this time with a large number of spells, special weapon abilities, using summoned ashen helpers or NPCs or coop friends. Bosses are on bog numbers and sometimes they repeat and combine, but the game fails to work with multiple players, and any summon makes it much easier to advance.The world is fascinating, the areas are well designed, but this time within the big world, more recycling with repetitive places or their building blocks.There is not much news, probably the largest creature similar to mountain goat, on which the main character rides and finally jumping. The player no longer stops 30cm boulder and jumping has also become a significant element in the level design. Respawns are really well-placed this time around, although there are a few annoying exceptions.It's a pity that not many inventions took place within the leveldesign, ladders, doors and elevators were basically enhanced with teleports, maybe next time will be nice some kind of interaction with the environment other than the destruction of the junk all around.Exploration is satisfactory, the player can easily get lost, but the map helps with orientation and the ability to insert marks into it, the possibility of teleportation to any ""fire"" is from the beginning of the game.From Software has brought a really good game, which will be enjoyed most by those who have never played their game and everything will be new and fascinating for them. However, the old players of their games have not many surprises, but FS still brings very high-quality and extensive action RPG.8,5/10"

Positive,"Subtitle: It's not different at all, is it, Steve?Elden Ring is an open-world Action/RPG game, emphasizing over-the-shoulder camera work behind your character, the Tarnished. There is much to say about Elden Ring, but little space in this review to cover it all. It is easy to say ""Elden Ring is Dark Souls 4"", but only veterans of Dark Souls will understand that meaning fully. What does that mean to new players to the franchise? Elden Ring is a knock out success in that regard, with much newblood appearing.Weight is the essence of Dark Souls design: your character has gravity, many attacks are done in realistic ways, fantastical magics exist but are limited in scope, and the overall pacing is slow but gradual. In many respects it can be called 'low fantasy', emphasizing realism in much of what it does, only to selectively break that for incredible effects. Those who are familiar with The Elder Scrolls series will also recognize this model of design.Elden Ring's art style reflects heavy western fantasy themes: grittiness, decay, but also beauty, fantastical architecture, and things both sane and bizarre, all walk hand in hand together. While it is not pushing graphical realism to its hardest, the distinct visual style delivers a consistent atmosphere to the world. Every area carries a theme, purpose, and vision that tells a story all of its own. In this respect, Elden Ring happily uses environmental story telling in much of what it is.Varied musical scores and arrangements follow the almost purely instrumental sound track. Ambient pieces follow alongside epic arrangements for things like Boss Battles, creating a dynamic landscape that is, itself, evocative of its world. Elden Ring's, in my opinion, hits pretty average with few notable outliers; all are worthwhile to listen to, but few I went out of my way to make note of.The narrative experience is, itself, the heart of all things Dark Souls; so all things are shaped by it. You are the Tarnished, a no-name nobody, misbegotten soul who returned to life. You are guided by a simple purpose: to overthrow the rulers of old, acquire their power, and establish yourself as the ruler of a new age. To do so, you will travel through a dead, dying, or decrepit world on its last legs.As all around you succumb to the failings of the past, you and few others are all that dare to change this gloomy status quo. How you will, of course, will vary. The end of one age brings forth another, and so many forces that survived are vying to make it *their* new age. Who you help will have just as much an effect on the outcome of everything.Pound for pound, Elden Ring and its Dark Souls siblings buries an entire world in its deep lore. Plot information scattered through items, chance encounters, one-off-lines by NPCs, and the like. You are, by design, encouraged to sift through and recover these lost bits. To find out the 'truth' of what happened, who these people are, and the world they once lived in. You won't ever have a perfect picture, but you will get one eventually. You could go all the way and know nothing at all, if you so choose.I will say, Elden Ring did disappoint me in this regard. It is lockstep with its Dark Souls siblings, showing zero innovation or change in how its plot delivers and NPC questlines work. This is especially frustrating as, being an open world game, an NPC could (and has) literally hide in the corner of the world, 100% missable. Some will even die or disappear if you continue to play the game without finding them, vanishing into smoke and never telling you that you failed to progress their questlines. I continue to regard this as an inherently bad design, but using a wiki to find the information may spoil the quest lines.As you fight through the Lands Between, you acquire runes, the universal currency used for everything including leveling up. Through runes, and gathered materials, you can craft useful combat items, talk to smiths to upgrade your weapons (armor doesnt need it), and level up to improve your overall power. Some varieties in play styles are present, usually flavors of melee and ranged combat added together. Elden Ring as a whole favors melee, and ranged is usually a supplementary style. Magic varies greatly, but it is notably better than other Souls games in being a viable main class choice.Of the combat, I choose to criticize what is known as the 'Artorias' problem.A Super Boss from Dark Souls 1 DLC, Artorias was outrageously popular as a 'mold' breaking boss, being extremely fast, tactical, and responsive to the player. FromSoft has become addicted to replicating Artorias ever since, putting his pattern behavior in many different bosses. This is especially notable in Elden Ring's late game bosses, who all have insane response times, massive damage, and long windows of 'dodge or die' forced upon the player. Rather than be uniquely distinctive, they all feel like different versions of Artorias. Thankfully, many of the early and mid-game bosses didn't show this behavior, and none of them were outstanding issues to me.I will make notable exception of Elden Ring's ""hardest"" boss: Malenia, Blade of Miquella. After 15 hours of suffering grind against her, and where no other boss took more than 1 or 2 hours, I rather like Malenia's design. She is nearly perfect as a 'Super Boss', but I only find issue in how much hyper-armor she has. It's almost impossible to hit stun her outside of cheese builds, making my play style, Colossal Swords, have a really rough time. Other play styles may fare much, much better against her, I simply chose to endure my suffering.Elden Ring is a good game, and a worthy addition to the Souls family. Breaking off into its own narrative universe has interesting future implications, as the Dark Souls storyline itself has been 'wrapped up'. As a combat-focused Action-RPG, it delivers well on balancing real time attacks with the idea of making character builds and play styles. You need both in order to survive to the end.The open world design is perhaps surprising/welcome to newcomers, but it is almost a perfect venn diagram of older Souls designs. Instead of long narrow tunnels that branch like a spider web, you have big open fields instead. All the dungeons and the like are still there, and are very classically Souls-like, just much shorter in length. I don't hate this change of pace; better than many other games that try to become 'open world', Elden Ring (and Souls) feels perfectly in sync with it.As a final, personal note: I wish they did more with the storyline. FromSoft, like Artorias above, is addicted to their own formula, and has shown zero variation or improvements. More in depth NPC questlines, more creating of one's new 'ruling faction', and more of a world we can participate in, are all things I'd like to see. Much of what you do in Elden Ring can be summarized as ""receiving a post-it note with instructions"" and exploring every cave you see in trying to finish those instructions.It is very Souls-like, for better or worse."
Positive,"It is a FromSoftware ""Souls"" game on roids with pickles, holes, an Edgelord, the discovery that adding a true jump button won't compromise platforming puzzles, more forgiving power leveling to abuse bosses and return of red phantom scum that invade during ""mini-boss"" battles in the open world. Good times. Prepare to cry and nearly break your controller several times awesomesauce."
Positive,i wont see the sun once until i finish this game
Positive,"Amazing open world, outstanding graphics (my pc is on fire) Jk the game is very optimised. Very well made story, incredible attention to detail, gets rid of some of the more annoying aspects in souls game whilst still keeping that souls like “git gud” formula. I would say more things about this game but for some reason no more come to mind. Overall 10/10 100% GOTY"
Positive,"Very well implemented gameplay mechanics on open world, climatic design, well established universe that just sparks detail with lots of places to discover. Elden Ring is an example of how souls like games can be the best. We kill thousands of creatures to find hundreds of places and items waiting to be explored on a huge open world map, and the feeling of freedom and exploration that the game gives you while doing this is incredibly good. I'm actually surprised that without any quest indicators or quest info menu they managed to do an open world game like this and you don't even realise how time flies while you are roaming around and discovering stuff. It accomplishes the RPG elements very well. They have an incredibly wide range of items, detailed character creation, detailed stat management, different outcomes from both side quests and main quests etc.If I want to say briefly the strongest aspects of the game: The range of items, sounds and atmosphere, gameplay mechanics, the feeling of discovery and the feeling of winning are very good.But if you ask me if there are any bad side of this game, I think there are. I think it's definitely not a 10/10 game as most people say. Yes, it does its job as an open world RPG game very well, and it does this in a ""souls-like"" way. Thats not an easy thing to do but for me to say 10/10, the game has to be flawless. I think the worst part of this game is the online mode. Especially the ""invade"" mode, there are very frequent situations such as errors in the invade mode, players constantly glitching, not being able to find a match for a long time, and when the opposing player logs out, your pvp item is turn into garbage, waste. I also had lag issues in most of my matches. The second bad feature that caught my eye is that although the variety of weapons is very large, unfortunately the weapon development system does not work very efficiently. Let's say, for example, you made a weapon +10 and you have about 50 weapons in your bag. Your game time has passed 20 hours, now if you want to change weapons after this time, it is not very easy to change. At least, there could be things like transferring the pluses we spent from the weapons we developed to +10 to another weapon. In 70 hours of gameplay, you will usually only using between 5-6 weapons. The rest of the weapons will unfortunately be a waste and never used because of this system. The third feature that I did not like was that the movements of the game were very bland. No animation is used in an AAA game, as if it were an indie game, and this causes scenes that seem strange to your eyes or as if you are playing an outdated game while you are playing. After you've completed half of the way through the game. As whole areas and boss fights end up being copy-pasted and refurbished. The scenery might change a little, the enemies might be differently coloured, but they're same as before. And for the last, the PC port is one of the worst of all time. There is no proper keyboard and mouse support, there are random locked keybindings for menu navigation. It's really so hard and bad to play it with keyboard and mouse. To summarize:  I am not at all surprised that it was chosen as the game of the year, because apart from the bad features I mentioned above, there is no other bad feature or missing side in the game and this year except playstation exclusive games there were not a strong competitor against Elden Ring. If you are not familiar with souls-like games, it will take some time to get used to the game, but after you get used to it, at least 60 hours of gameplay time with agony and glory awaits you. Final Verdict:  8/10Final Verdict:  8/10"
Positive,"I don't review games, but this is a masterpiece."
Positive,if you are having technical issues it means you're a bad person and dont deserve to play the game 🤷 maybe try apologizing to the people youve wronged in your life before complaining on the internet over a video game
Positive,3070 5600x only a handful of frame dropsturn off motion blur and depth of fieldif you think this game is poorly optimized try playing tf2 with any modern hardware
Positive,i mean its alright
Positive,This game makes me want to kms. I recommend
Positive,"Masterpiece by FROMsoft.  Loving every minute of exploration and combat, and I've only been roaming the starting areas.  Gameplay feels rewarding down many of the paths you can follow, and it still has that sense of mysticism around every corner.10/10"
Positive,Elden Ring is truly one of the games of all time!

Positive,"This guy Miyazaki, probably created the game of my life. A masterpiece. The perfectioned version of the formula."
Positive,The final boss made me contemplate about life and death in ways no other thing has. Elden Ring is a masterpiece through and through.
Positive,"The graphics and OST are stunning. The game looks and sounds amazing. Elden Ring's novel experiences are amazing. The core bosses and shardbearers are incredible. Your first time discovering an area is wonderful. I think the world is a bit too big and can get a bit repetitive with the mines, ruins, dungeons etc. that get a bit too repetitive. By the later areas like the Mountains I was just speed running to the main bosses rather than exploring because I felt like I'd seen it all and the bosses were the only novel and exciting part left. The bosses in the optional areas start to really suck after a while and I ended up just using the mimic tear on them because they had nothing fun to offer me, the same boss again with slightly more HP that I'd seen so many times before. This is encapsulated by the dragon bosses that just sponge damage and do the same moves, of which there are like, more than 10? I think that because the game is so large and repetitive, I feel like I have no desire to actually go through the optional content again on a repeat playthrough, but the game's difficulty is designed around you going through optional areas and dungeons to level up and get upgrade materials so the slog is at least partially mandatory.  This makes the idea of going through the game again feel like a chore rather than something to look forward to, which is never a good sign. The horse is really well integrated; seamless and fun to use, doesn't get in the way of exploring but promotes it. The new movement mechanics like jumping and crouching are great additions. The crafting system is a nice touch without feeling laborious or grindy as it so often does in other open-world titles. The NPCs are interesting but their quests are a bit too difficult to realistically follow without searching up guides because the world is so big, making some of them difficult to find. Your reward for actually pursuing them sucks however, because their impact on the ending is negligible; they took the Mass Effect 3 route where it's literally the same cutscene with a different outro monologue and a colour filter applied. The multiplayer is a downgrade from Dark Souls which is pretty impressive because of how many flaws that has. Easy Anti Cheat leads to random, frequent disconnects, while not actually preventing cheaters from cheating, so is a complete fail. The player limit has been reduced to 4 people, so fight clubs can only contain the host and two reds. Invaders can now only invade hosts with phantoms or those who use the Taunter's Tongue, so an invasion is almost guaranteed to be a 3v1. There is still no ping viewer, WiFi indicator or region preferential matchmaking so you still have to deal with the coinflip of getting summoned by or invading someone from Mars, discouraging random PvP. They've somehow managed after several years of development to retain the same multiplayer flaws from previous titles and even somewhat regressed. I'm not going to speak on the in-game balance because this is always bad in Fromsoftware games as a product of the game being designed for PvE and therefore I don't mind it really, but these flaws in the matchmaking and connectivity are inexcusable in 2022 from a top developer, even from the casual perspective. Then again, it is a Fromsoftware title, so you get what you pay for. Elden Ring's PvE is fantastic and has a lot, albeit maybe too much, to offer. Everyone should beat this game at least once."

Positive,"This is a video game where you play the game and I gotta say, its a good game.Edit:After playing Elden Ring for 50 hours all I can say is this is for sure a video game."
Positive,Haven't felt this scope of amazement and just pure wonder since I first left Helgan 10 years ago!
Positive,"it's souls but b i g. If the game actually works for you then it feels like a great new edition to souls franchise alongside the new huge openworld area.Good - it's a souls game but with openworld, that about sums it upBad - framerate is iffy and some stuff is easy to miss. If you're gonna boot up, check that it's running on your graphics card and not the inbuilt one since it can't tell what card it's supposed to run on"

Positive,Fun game. The first open world boss on horseback has framerate issues.. but otherwise ive had no stutters or crashes. 2070 superryzen 9 3900xt
Positive,"This may just be the best game ever made, though that might be a bit biased since I love Soulsborne so much. It's a combo of all the best parts of Fromsoft's past games mashed into one delicious full course meal.There seem to be a lot of people experiencing performance issues but at least on the rigs I've tested the game on I didn't have any major issues with stuttering nearly ever (RTX 3070 and i7 9700k, GTX 1660 Ti and Xeon E3-1231v3, GTX 970 and i5 9500, 16GB RAM on all).If you think it might not run well on your rig then by all means wait for an optimization patch, they always release one around a month after their games release. But for the love of god it isn't worth review bombing over, especially when games that run like complete dogwater get rave reviews regardless. People just want Elden Ring to fail because of 2042 and 2077 I swear."
Positive,"Decided to take the plunge despite bouncing off Dark Souls and the like and hearing how hard Elden Ring was. Well, don't let that put you off. It wasn't a cakewalk, but just doing everything in the game without grinding levelled me sufficiently that nothing caused me too much trouble. 140 hours I think I saw everything (no appetite for New Game+), I'm sure I never actually ""got good"", but I did at least learn a little patience instead of button mashing constantly.The game was very good, but I won't go so far as to say it's personal GOTY material, nor one of the best open world games I've played. It was sufficiently different to keep me interested. There is lore there, if you're willing to hunt for it. Much like the game's systems, there is a distinct lack of explanation or direction. Life's too short: I used a wiki. :P"

Positive,"Best Game, I Want to get Touched By Melina"
Positive,"I still can’t believe my GTX 1050 (i5 8th gen, 8GB Ram) can run this game with 1080p, 30 FPS . It’s NOT amazing numbers but hey, it’s playable for me. I can easily fight bosses and mobs without issues or heavy stuttering. SO, writing this early review to give hope to all GTX 1050 players!! GOOD LUCK! Amazing game so far.Edit: I completed the game and I must say, WOW! The world is so vast and boundless and went way beyond what I expected initially.. also, the sheer number of bosses scattered around the map was truly astounding! Every boss that I defeated made me feel like on top of the world just as always in every soulslike games...The thing I'm most amazed about the game is how the open world didn't feel empty nor repetitive..all bosses or mobs in different areas looked different and had different skillsets.. As a big fan of open worlds, Elden Ring didn't disappoint at all.. TRULY deserving of a GOTY. I've already played other souls-like games so ER wasn't too difficult for me except for a few bosses.. but it might pose a challenge for new players.. One thing tho.. with Mimic Tear, the game becomes easier.. by a lot. And if you face too much difficulty, just look up meta overpowered builds (currently, bleed ones i think) and your game will be a breeze from then on. I am so excited and hoping to see many DLCs especially hope there is one where we can battle against Miquella! Fingers crossed!"

Rewatch the intro trailer and all the scenes make sense about what happened and seeing the same places in game. Best game I have played in a long time."
Positive,"Praise the tree!If you enjoy dark souls, dying over and over again in video games, exploring big open worlds, praising things of nature such as suns or perhaps trees and wanted more since Dark Souls 3 then you will be very very happy.16 hours at the time of this review and having a great time!"

Positive,"The problem with this review is that I could go on forever mentioning all the positive points about this game, so let's just say....Everything Dark Souls games did right + open world + lots of new ideas + actually viable magic/faith builds + Miyazaki hand fetish = Elden Ring"
Positive,"Okay, so there’s a good tradition to visit bosses and die sometimes. And it can be fun traditions, but at certain moments of your life you might want to move the tradition aside a bit, you know?The game under review is actually very good. It’s as far from perfect as it’s also traditional for the series. It has as many awesome points, as it has points of frustration, and some of those points are clearly intentional, while some are not.Basically, for each “good” of this game I have almost equally (or even more) massive “bad”. And the most strange thing is – I cannot understand how game can even feel that good with so many massive “bads”, but it does. That’s probably a part of that mystique of well-done soulsborne.At this point I don’t really see the reason to explain the basics. It’s Dark Souls IV with openworld and horse. Horseback combat is undercooked, but fun. Plus, the increased moveability allows for some insane platforming and secret locations. You can horse around the main openworld, but not dungeons. There are several huge megadungeons, several lesser dungeons, and a bunch of Breath of the Wild-inspired similar-to-each-other minidungeons with certain quirks or puzzles.Also, you can now attach special abilities to shields and weapons, double-wield powerstances are back, and plunge attack is no more. Oh, and they added an ability to summon special creatures in certain areas, that will help in battle. Those vary from  cute jellyfishes to spirits of dead heroes and warriors, to edgy OP assassins.All and all – it’s Dark Souls IV, with all the main tickpoints one would expect, now with a big overworld to roam around.Now to the weird stuff.First, I need to point out that my ability to react to stuff is as low as it gets, so I usually understand someone’s hitting me right around the moment a hit arrives. Second one, that is. So, in all Souls game the only “comfortable” mode of play I can allow myself is a shielded slow turtle with a greatsword. So, most of my comments are made from this turtle point of view.Issue 1: weird balance of risks and rewards. A huge dog that can oneshot you and has more HP than most earlygame bosses? 300 souls. A small dude that hits hard but can be one or twoshot at early-midgame? 1000 souls. Crucible Knight that can raid your lands, pillage your settlements and take away your women? 3000 souls. A squishy caster dude with a bunch of tools to negate him to nothing? 100 000 souls. It’s just odd. Same goes to HP and damage scaling in different areas. Some mobs are laughably easy at lategame areas, but some remain barely scratchable by level 150 and will onehot overvigored knöghts in fullplate. This makes flow of some areas really janky, as If some stuff was not balanced by the end, as if NG+ tables were used for NG areas.Issue 2: boss readability often suffers. Special thanks to Fire Giant’s ankle.Issue 3: boss aggression (also applies to some mobs). Many bosses like to do the I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you oh, a pause, I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you I hit you thing. Too many. I know it’s a result of metaprogression of difficulty, as otherwise some players wouldn’t even feel the boss is even there, but for those there’s another thing –Issue (or observation) 4: boss lingering attacks (also applies to some mobs). In this game the devs decided to troll the roll crowd as they made some insanely delayed grabs and powerstrikes. The boss raises their weapon menacingly and walks towards you… And walks… And walks… Awkward moment. You start panicking, you roll, BLAMO-KABLAM!!!1111111 – 1500 HP LOL U FAIL.Issue 5: the level vistas vary from OHMYGAWD IT’S SO GORGUUUUUUZ I WUV ID <3 to LETS STAMP EVERY CASTLE ASSET WE HAVE TO THE BACKGROUND AT ONCE!!!111Issue 6: internal asset reuse overdrive. I saw exactly the same dungeon blocks far too many times. I don’t think doubling dungeon decoration asset and wall sets amount would be THAT time-consuming for a project that took, what, 5 years to make. And, yes, many bosses tend to reappear up to 10-15 times in different areas (I’m looking at you, dragons) with barely any significant tweaks but type of attacks (fire, ice, poison, rot etc.) and HP pool.I’m not even saying anything of it needs to change, as I said, I thoroughly enjoyed the game, except for some bosses, where I just gave up and summoned dem humans to help (and yes, I used ashen summons A LOT :D).Story-wise this is the most accessible Souls game. It allows to mostly clearly see what are you doing and why by the midgame, it has some touching moments you don’t even need to look up on wiki to find, you just need to search for clues and listen to what they say. Most big questlines even allow you to resume them if you miss a part of their progression path, with some NPCs reacting to you differently.Overall – a great game I totally recommend.PS Most of performance issues came past me for some reason, while people with better rigs had insane FPS drops. So kinda weird here as well."
Positive,"Never has a game rewarded me so much for screwing around and avoiding making progress on the main story. I've had so many moments where my jaw has dropped at some incredible surprise or other. I've never been able to play a souls game before because of disabilities, but Elden Ring is actually accessible to me. There are always plenty of ways to overcome a challenge that don't feel like cheating. Brains are as useful as brawn. And even on the lowest graphical settings, the world is gorgeous. Other open world games are going to have a hard time impressing me after this."
Positive,"This is one of my favorite games I have ever played, it has grabbed my attention and held it with an iron grip. Anytime I figure out what I wanna do, it's very hard to resist the siren call of ELDEN RING.The exploration in this game is absolutely a treat, it really feels like discoveries can be made in every little nook and cranny. With some boldness and knowledge of how far you can fall without dying, there are very few places you can't get to, and usually will be rewarded for taking the time to explore it all.The combat is extremely polished, every playstyle is viable and can have a ton of fun variety within those styles. Most enemies and bosses are incredibly awesome to just LOOK at, let alone actually fight and overcome. Not all of them can be winners, but with the sheer volume and variety already on display, I believe that's fully excusable. From the replayability and ridiculous amount of content here, I believe that anyone who isn't afraid of some level of difficulty should give this a shot and be delighted by what it offers."

Positive,"Its the logical progression of what FROM software has done since the release of Demon's Souls. Lessons learned from each entry from the Dark Souls trilogy, Demon's Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro have all culminated into an environment that is well crafted, yet immeasurably huge. Is it difficult, sure, but not any more than any of the others. A well crafted experience that contains plenty of tools for anyone to use to make the experience easier or harder on themselves. Just be patient and understand what this vein of game has taught us before: learn from your mistakes, dust yourself off, and try again."
Positive,"Have 1060 6gb 16 gb of ram, i7 3700k, minimum is 1060 3gb 12gb of ram and an i7 8400 run the game at 60 frames stable. Worst so far are a few lag spikes at certain parts of the beginning that lasted not even half a second. Not very far into it but so far that has been the worst of it, review might change later. Also my pc is 7 years old (specifically my ram an processor)."
Positive,"From Software has taken the lessons of the open world game trend and showed pretty much everyone how amateurish they are compared to a master. Elden Ring is an amazing mixture of the open world adventuring of Breath of the Wild, the deep and flexible combat system of Souls games, and a dark fantasy aesthetic that feels like the culmination of years of their game design. It is, without a doubt, a masterpiece.Now, about the elephant in the room: performance. I will admit that my gaming PC is definitely above and beyond the requirements (Ryzen 7 5800X, Geforce 3080Ti, 32GB RAM and installed onto an NVMe). I have not had many performance concerns at all, with the game running stably at 60fps probably 90-95% of the time. There are some occasional fps slowdowns but they don't seem to sink lower than 50ish fps, and only for a few moments. I have had a freezing hitch or two, but in my estimation they're no longer than 100-200ms and they're only happening once every so often - rare enough for me not to keep track. All that said, I can't deny evidence that's plainly visible in other people's streams and videos, and for whatever reason there are lots of people that have performance troubles even though they also go above and beyond the required and recommended specs. However, I just want to relay my personal experience to say that the performance problems are not an absolute certainty. Hopefully these issues are resolved soon, because as it stands it's a basically flawless game slightly marred by the technical issues."
Positive,"I really have enjoyed playing Elden Ring. I am not even good at the game. I die a lot. Lots of people act like the game is too hard and really its not. It's really fair. Most deaths usually feel like my fault, there might be a hidden enemy here and there but that just adds to the fun. If I'm having trouble with an area I can go explore somewhere else and come back after a few levels (or after my blood pressure goes down) and try again. There are always spots where the enemies drop a lot of souls and are easy to kill specifically so you can level up, so its not like you are just thrown into impossible scenarios. Everything is gorgeous and there is so much to do and explore. You always feel a sense of accomplishment every time you play, and that's really important for someone like me who isn't great at games. It really is a masterpiece."
Positive,"Game is good the first time through. After that it's just a chore. Bosses are very hit of miss compared to the previous titles. Lots of miss. It's very clear many were balanced around spirit ashes, so solo players get shafted I guess. As an example, the final boss is a banana slug that spends 90 percent of the fight running away from you. That was frustrating when Sinh did it... a whole 3 games ago. You'd think they'd have shit like this on lock by now, but I guess not. Idk. I recommend for the first time experience."
Positive,"[EDIT] Game of the Year....and also Colosseum, and also Armored Core!!!![Edit] The recent patches made the game even better than was before, having no perfomance issues and a lot of great changes to weapons etc.Besides the optimization issues, the game is just AMAZING!!! I do hope other devs take notes about a lot of mechanics here to use in future open world games, and even a non-open world game; ie: not having to worry about durability of your gear, the horse mechanics, fall damage, easy upgrade and afixing abilities to your weapons, stamina outside of combat etc.10/10 game for me, really loving it a lot!"
Positive,"Intro: After a long wait and high enthusiasm. There you are, Tarnished devious Lands Between, strengthen yourself and find your way to the giant tree to become the Elden Lord. But before we get down to exploring, is the game worth all the hype and ratings compared to previous games? Gameplay: The game perfectly combines the open world and the souls-like system. You will notice the diversity of the world and the beautiful scenery of swamps, trees and castles from your first look at the world. As usual in open world games, anything you see you can reach it, either directly or else. And you will find various stories that tell you about some of the places that you find around you in a beautiful and varied way. In addition to the caves around you. Each of them has its own puzzles and ideas. This diversity also reflects on the enemies scattered around you. Every region in the world finds its enemies. This revives your passion for exploration. But this passion will die with time after the diversity gradually disappears in terms of monsters. You will find many of them so frequent that you avoid and condone them. For example, if we compare it with the first Dark Souls, you will see some bosses recurring at the end of the game, but the repetition is that you can avoid them and do not fight them, and if you decide to fight them, you will notice that they are weaker than the main bosses, so you can fight them without problems. Here, the situation is different. You will discover that most of these monsters and bosses are repetitive in a terrible and annoying way, and most of them are divided into two versions. The normal version and the enhanced version, the normal version is the one you always fight and may change slightly in terms of the type of damage it gives you. The enhanced version is the normal version with additional movements and effects added to it and an increase in HP and damage. At first it was acceptable, but with time it became like milking the cow. As if their thoughts had stopped and they had no new ideas. And this depends not only on normal monsters only... but even in the bosses, to the extent that there are some of them very similar to the other, and they both have their own “Achievement”…..I don’t know if this is laziness or what??? Also, the caves are becoming more and more noisy and not worth all that headache for something you won't even use. Because of these flaws, I throwed the idea of ending the game more than once and decided to finish it only once.For combat, this part has improved greatly compared to previous games. Finally, there is a balance between magicians and swordsmen so that they have the “Ash of War” feature that they can put on their weapons, which adds movement to the weapon, and also there are some weapons that have their own movement features, so the fighting has become very diverse and everyone has his own way of fighting, but as usual there Some of the weapons that were considered powerful are overrated and FromSoftware is currently trying to balance these weapons as they did in Update 1.03. This increased the life of the game and greatly improved it in terms of PVP, but this is not only for swordsmen. But also for those with magic who have become more annoying magic.... yaaaFK THEMaaay .... But -without hesitation- this game will be the alternative game to Dark Souls 3 in terms of PVP. It's as if it was created for this purpose. I'm not a PVP player but I really enjoyed fighting in it even if I wasn't that strong and now we are waiting if they will provide any kind of arena for players (Matchmaking). The current solution to fighting other players is to summon or invade them.In addition to the jump that was added to the world in order to reach places that you could not reach previously. It may be considered unimportant, but this is a new addition to FromSoftware... Also the horse that you can fight with has helped me fight some monsters and bosses.Also the spirit that you can summon to fight alongside you. It may be considered somewhat exaggerated to the point that it can fight alone, but I usually use it to distract the enemy. These spirits can be summoned in specific places, for example, if you are suffering with one of the bosses, just summon her and rest yourself.There are also other simple and beautiful additions, such as a drink that you can incorporate into a group of buffs to give you an increase in defense or strength or others and refill it automatically when you sit at any “Bonfire or Grace”, and some armors have their own hidden features and strength and also the crafting system Which I did not pay much attention to and only used it in very special cases. His presence or absence was almost unimportant. I wish there were such important things as making a specific weapon or even keys or even a drink that might give your horse some speed.But with all these beautiful things, the game still suffers from technical issues, for example, “Drop Frame” and “Game Crash” happen from time to time. Some of these problems have been resolved in the last update (1.03) and some elements have been added that may make it easier for the player to track the NPCs in the game with the map, as well as some side stories have been updated and a new character has been added to the game. However, there are still some technical issues and we hope that they will be resolved in the next updates. The Story: I tried to focus on it, but I couldn't because of its slowness, so I ignored some of them and focused more on the side stories that happen all over the map. I don't have much to say. I finished the story and I didn't care much because of the scattering of information, and I'm not the right person to evaluate the story. Graphic: The world, as I said before, is very beautiful and diverse, and this diversity has added a lot to the beauty of the world. As for the details, almost all the places are detailed and unique in terms of design and sound, which adds life to the world. For example, there are quiet lands and other lands where the nature of mystery and mist dominates them from every side, and you see an unclear building that shades you from afar, or you see that dead dragon inside the church and a group of spirits floating around it. And do not forget the change of time, which adds some life to the world, and this change affects the monsters present in the world, and there are some monsters that only appear at night. You may be surprised by a character or a boss as you walk around and he may disappear when you visit him again and you don't know why he has disappeared.For the music in the game, the sounds of the world are acceptable, but unfortunately the OST of the bosses is mostly not that good, literally I don't remember any of their music except for two. Some of them feel almost random. Extra Note: NAN Conclusion: The combat is complete, and the world is beautiful from a technical point of view, but in terms of exploration, it could have been better. The game in general is worth a try. Arabic Review: http://expspot.com/2022/04/%d9%85%d8%b1%d8%a7%d8%ac%d8%b9%d8%a9-elden-ring/aaaaaaaaaand that it <3"
Positive,10/10beyond a masterpiece
Positive,i like game
Positive,"strong foe,Time for despair"
Positive,"great game overall, with scale that's commendable but it suffers from it sometimes with the rehashed dungeons and ""bosses"" that are just basic enemies in the world, aestheically one of their best right after Bloodborne."
Positive,"Advice to new players: 1) Don't treat this as a standard DS game. Going along the ""expected"" path will get you killed; the 1st ""real"" boss is the game is much stronger than in a regular DS game. It's an open-world game, so explore around, there's lots of secrets and side paths that will help your character get stronger. 2) After you get the horse, go back to the initial merchant at night; there will be an important NPC to talk to there. IMO Fromsoft made an error hiding that particular NPC in that manner, as it opens up a major game mechanic."
Positive,"This game is amazing. As my first soulslike game, I had an absolute blast getting my ass kicked over and over. I think this game is absolutely worth a play, however it is not without its flaws.Pros:Graphics. This game is absolutely stunning almost all of the time. It is hard to find an area in this game that doesn't look so good that you want to take a screenshot.Soundtrack. Whether your in the middle of the starting area listening to that calming violin, or hearing the bosses beginning 15 seconds of their theme for the 50th time, this game's ost slaps.Combat. I had no idea what I was missing having not played soulslike combat before. Not once have I played a game where I so consistently blamed my own skill as the player rather than the challenge presented before me. The first boss breaks you down and builds you back up, until you come out the other end a more skilled and accomplished player. No feeling compares.Cons:The framerate. Capped 60fps is a huge bummer for a modern pc port, and considering this game will have the occasional frame drop and stutter regardless of what you run it on, I can kind of see why.Diffiuculty scaling. A lot of the late game bosses and areas can feel extremely difficult if you are just following your way through the story, and it can feel limiting to have to grind certain areas or look up a new build guide in order to simply have a chance in some cases. Bosses with large AOE attacks that make melee play extremely difficult can be frustrating to go against depending on your build, especially if you are not playing with summons.NPC questlines. Having to use a piece of paper and a pen to keep track of your progress throughout a quest, or have the wiki open on your second monitor, sucks. I ran into quite a few cases where I had softlocked a quest line due to some other quest I had partially progressed and forgot about. I don't think the addition of a journal or something that keeps track of what quests you are doing would be immersion breaking, certainly not as much as having the wiki open on your second monitor.Conclusion:I think anyone can find a certain amount of enjoyment out of this game. The open world nature makes it easy to take a break from your challenges and come back stronger. Even with my gripes, this game is still amazing and I can't recommend it enough. 9/10"
Positive,"Well so far the game is very enjoyable, the update today definitely made it run a lot smoother, but as far as the game goes it is far more accessible than previous souls games it does feel like they made it easier but not too easy its a good balance, there is a lot to do and see in this game and the best thing is you can go about it in many different play styles there is something for everyone here and can definitely recommend it"
Positive,"Darks Souls 4Technical issues aside (occasional framerate drops on 2080ti), one of the most put together open world games I've played.Don't expect it to not be a learning curve.Genuinely rewarding gameplay.Most co op games are either co op for sure and playable but boring solo. Most single player games benefit as a result with innovation/not being an empty shell of a game that relies solely on player interaction for gameplay value. Makes games that are designed to be co op feel empty.. This, as Souls tradition has it, stays close to its a roots, being that's exceedingly fun to play co op or not. You don't feel like you're missing something playing solo, if anything, I prefer it.. Only game I've ever seen do that is the souls series, but its impressed me even further by sticking those mechanics into an open world game. So much props."
Positive,Best game ever made
Positive,Reformed orthodox rabbi Bill Clinton worthy game of the year
Positive,"This game made me touch ""grass"" and called me maidenless. Definitely 2022 GOTY"
Positive,thank god I didn't quit at the tree sentinel
Positive,"try finger, but hole!hidden path aheadliar aheadcould this be an item?"
Positive,"It's incredible, beautiful, just a lot of fun.As for the performance issues, I barely meet the minimum requirements and it's been completely fine."
Positive,"Through hardship, dedication, and most importantly friendship, the Elden May Ring"
Positive,i suck at this game
Positive,"I originally picked Elden Ring up when my Steam Deck shipped but at the time I kept have frame rate issues.  So I refunded it.  Over Christmas sale I decided to give it another try opening than six months of further updates would have made a change and I am glad I did.  Without any changes to the stock settings, I am getting fairly consistent fps of 35-40 in most places, some battles it does dip down into the 28-32 range but I haven’t had any problems like before.  Like a lot of games I refund I held off reviewing Elden Ring when I refunded because I had seen others not having the FPS issues that I was having and even though it was advertised as Deck verified I knew mileage may vary and I didn’t feel right dinging the game at the time.I am glad I tried it again and what ever issues my particular Deck was having with the game in the months in-between have been resolved.   I don’t have dozens of hours logged but I have to say that while is is clearly a Souls breed game, I think that it is a lot more accessible to players outside the normal Souls games.  While the past 3 Dark Souls games, had plenty of lore and interesting places to see, right within the first hour you have a huge world that technically you can run around, more or less doing your own thing.  Sure you’re not going to want to do that for long, but the fact you can is itself a new direction for the genre.All in all it’s a great game.  Yes you will die over and over, but you will see your mistakes and learn from them."
Positive,try finger but hole
Positive,a woman held me
Positive,"The wisdom of the ages says it best: ""Try fingers, but hole!"""
Positive,Ubisoft could never
Positive,Game of the Century.Would rather play this than have sex.
Positive,big thanks to the reformed orthodox rabbi bill clinton for bringing us this masterpiece
Positive,"This game ''Elden Ring'' is the first DARK SOULS like game that i'm playing .never played any other games in this style before and i must say with the fact that this game being brutally hard for me, i'm still loving it.the unique design of bosses and the enemies in total , the map and environment design itself , the atmosphere of the game everything is on point I'm really glad i gave this game a chance and i'm really enjoying it"
Positive,"Your recognition means a lot to me - it really is a very special feeling to be part of such a unique community that finds the ""funny"" in my criticism. I mean, it takes a lot to find humor in places where others might only see letters and sentences. Really, you are very special people. Who needs thumbs up when you have such an unparalleled talent for hidden humor?Positive aspects:Stunning world and graphics: The visual design and the world are impressive.Deep and complex story: The lore and the story are very well thought out and offer a lot of depth.Immersive atmosphere: The game draws you completely into the world with its dense atmosphere.Extensive customization options: There are many ways to customize the character.Negative aspects:Extremely high difficulty level: The game is mercilessly difficult, which can lead to many frustrating moments.Frequently frustrating moments: The game can be extremely exhausting, especially for players who are not used to this genre.Difficult controls: The controls require a lot of practice and can be overwhelming at first.Low error tolerance: Even small mistakes are often punished harshly, which further increases the frustration.Conclusion:Elden Ring is a masterpiece for hardcore gamers who love challenges and are willing to invest a lot of time. However, for players who are looking for a more relaxed or accessible experience, the game can quickly become frustrating. But those who overcome the hurdles will be rewarded with one of the most impressive gaming experiences of recent years."
Positive,"An achievement in videogames that will be remembered for years on years. Despite its flaws, it delivers on so much and just solidifies how much I love Fromsoft. They really, really care about delivering a good product."
Positive,"this game gave me no maidens, but was still fun."
Positive,"Soldier of God, Rick is the toughest boss in any of the Souls games. Beating him on my 666th try gave me an exhilaration unsurpassed by any other game. Fromsoft, you did it again!It'sa mastapeece!"
Positive,This game truly is a masterpiece. Throughout the game I always felt like the devs were spoiling us with an abundance of interesting areas. The world is not only very big but is filled with content and exploring never felt repetitive or boring. There are a lot of npc quests imo a bit much for one playthrough. With 80 hours in one character I still feel like I only have scratched the surface and I could still be playing this game for many hours.There is but one con to this game and it's that some bosses are a bit too difficult. There was one boss that took me more tries than all the dlc bosses from bloodborne on my bl4 run together. Even with spirit summons... But this boss was also optional so the extra challenge makes sence. It just feels like the game expects you to use these summons even for souls veterans.
Positive,Elden ring is probably one of the games ever made!!!
Positive,"Maybe I'll edit this into a more elaborate review later, but I just wanted to at least leave a positive review for now, because this is genuinely one of the best games I have ever played."
Positive,GAME OF THE YEAR :DDD
Positive,elden ring is a bad video game
Positive,Has frame stuttering issues but it's a fantastic game. try finger but hole
Positive,5 hours in and I still can't kill the first boss.10/10 little something for everyone
Positive,"100% worth the hype. Oh my. They really made it open world. Somehow STILL with excellent level designs for each area and unique elements ❤️ We love you From Software, never change 🙏🏻❤️  expect it to a bit slow paced if you’re a player like me who have no experience with open world games. It really forces you to take your time and explore. And From Soft, please add more birds and dogs 🦜 Ty 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻"
Positive,"Pros:- Challenging/Rewarding Combat ++- Excellent open world environment- Excellent build diversity- Fleshed out systems/crating/weapon upgrades- Fantastic world building- Great story- Great quests - Amazing art direction- Amazing music (especially boss fights)- Great repeatability (both in NG and NG+)- Open world makes it easy to leave a challenging fight, and come back when readyCons:- Open world to a fault, very easy to over-level and trivialize most bosses- Easy to find yourself lost without knowing where to go - Multiplayer system is clunky - Graphics are meh, and the engine is dated (Art direction makes up for this IMO)- Out of 6 possible endings, there's really only 3 unique ones. 2 endings are amazing and the other 4 are basically copies of each other.  Overall: As someone who has long been skeptical of FromSoftware games, I was hesitant to jump in. Elden Ring seemed like an intriguing place to start, and with the hype around SotE coming out, I decided to take the leap in. Boy, am I glad. Elden Ring has immediately become one of my favorite games of all time, and has changed my perspective on gaming as a whole. I usually find myself burnt out of RPG/Open world games around the 60 hour mark, but I was so in love with The Lands Between I immediately started a new character and beat the game again. Elden Ring is a challenging, yet rewarding game that does not necessarily hold your hand at any point. While this is what held me back from playing FromSoftware games in the past, it is certainly what makes the game as good as it is. The challenge is the beauty. Whether its figuring out where to go, or finally mastering a Boss's moveset, the feeling of ecstasy when completing a task is unlike any other single player game I've played before.Advice to anyone thinking of buying/playing:Do it. Don't get discouraged if you feel overwhelmed at first. Always try to figure something out on your own, but don't hesitate to look something up if you get stuck somewhere.TLDR: The pain IS the fun part. Embrace it.10/10 (Masterpiece)"
Positive,I like the horse but I wish you could gussy him up a little. You know like with a little hat.
Positive,Radagon of the Golden Order is not beating you. He is forging you into a better player.
Positive,Still no sleep...All the more Time for Elden Ring
Positive,3'rd playthrough in a week.Game's good.Game's hard.My sphincter is soft.
Positive,"Well...wow what a journey67 hours, wish i played at least 2 more so it's a perfect number, anyways review time.Story : 8/10Basically some Space Slug decided to shit a seed to make a gigantic golden tree and out of nowhere came a godess with a cool looking ring and got herself a consort. After copulating FURIOUSLY with that man, she gives birth to a depressed Hobo, a Pedophile and a Mermaid that later befriends a dragon. She throws the Hobo and Pedophile in the sewers cuz they looked different (nice form of racism). Then decided to exile her husband to marry a red haired beta male who also got himself laid with a queen of the full moon and then breeds a hot maiden, and two cursed twins. The mermaid son got assasinated by balerina's who danced away with the rune of death from a GIANT DOG and that causes a war to break. Anyways both sides lose and the demi-gods just decide to do whatever the fuck they want. it's up to you to fix this broken family.Gameplay : 7/10Giant OPW map, can ride horse, fuckton of bosses around the world, dungeons, loot, npc's with quests.If there's twoi complaints i have with the gameplay, it's that sometimes there are some attacks that are NEAR UNDODGEABLE for newcomers (example : Malenia's waterfowl dance). And the map has soooo many mountains that every 5 minutes you gotta figure out where you gotta go to go on top of the mountain to reach a certain area, if only there was like a bird mount, it would make life much easier. Still great gameplay thoMusic : 10/10Hans Zimmer level music, especially for rememberence bosses, just fucking great.Graphics : 11/10Most beautiful game i have ever played, doesen't use ANY SHADERS, which is also a plus.Weapon variety : 10/10There are just SOOOOO MANY weapons to choose from, you can find them ANYWHERE.Now for my most favorite sectionFinal boss : 9.5/10Remember that one godess's consort? Yeah he's back and wants to reclaim the throne, he challenges you while having a fucking lion on his back just to supress his lust for battle...AND SEX. After shattering his pride as the ""first elden lord"", he kills his lion and becomes senator armstrong's grandad. Guy keeps spamming earthquaking attacks, grabs, and BACK BREAKERS. After killing him, time to enter the tree and fight the Red haired beta male. He bashes your skull with a godamn hammer and uses GWYN'S TECHNIQUE TM, loves to use AOE and all that. After finally showing he is a beta male, the space slug pops out and final battle begins. Idk how in the living hell but for a slug, he can swim very well, also the fact he loves to do ranged crap. still he is easier than the beta male and the ""first elden lord"". Finally after ascending from a mere maidenless mortal to a KRATOS, you finally claim the throne and fix the order, i guess...Final Verdict : 8/10This game offers so much, from weapons, to characters, to beautiful areas, to great rememberence bosses (get it? cuz they're that good that you can remember them). They went hard with it, and it was worth it, i am excited for the new DLC, hopefully you get to the fight the other cursed twin that is a godamn minor.Great game, but i wouldn't consider it the BEST fromsoft game, i find dark souls better overall, still it's a top fromsoft game, definently buy it. Always remember this once you start prayingLEVEL THE LIVING FUCK OUT OF VIGOR.BECAUSE THIS GAME IS GONNA VIGOR CHECK THE SHIT OUT OF YOU."
Positive,"Remember Breath of the Wild, Morrowind, Oblivion or heck even Skyrim where you would find something strange/curious and you wanted to check it out? And when you went there and witnessed something strange or you acquired something valuable you get an oddly satisfying feeling?  You get that feeling here amplified by a million times.Elden Ring is a culmination of two geniuses - the great George RR Martin (GoT) and Miyazaki (FromSoft). This game combines storytelling from GRRM and souls-like adventure from FromSoft Adventure in a vast visually stunning world of Lands Between that sets the new standard for open world games.A fair warning here - You will be overwhelmed by the Map as it is insanely vast and there's so much to see and explore. So take your time and satisfy your curiosities slowly. That being said - The lands between is filled with dark corridors,gigantic castles, forts, manors, caves,underground labyrinths,dungeons,death traps, beautiful landscapes, beaches, mountains and swamps - all riddled with interesting enemy types that you would want to conquer endlessly. Elden Ring is filled with hidden paths right from the start. Limgrave(the first area), takes you through Stormveil Castle, and finding a way around that truly feels like you’ve discovered a hidden passage or alternate route, which is a super cool feeling not present in most open worlds I’ve explored. Horseback,Stealth and sorcery itself introduce a lot of combat differences to a regular Souls-like game and it feels apt for an open-world game as vast as this. You can also summon variety of enemies to fight on your side each with their own unique abilities and situational advantages. You also come across skills/ashes of war to completely change how your weapon works!The most important element that brings all these aspects of the game together is the freedom of choice - to walk away and do something else if you have hit a wall. And believe me- you will be extremely satisfied when you return back and conquer the foe that felled you.Elden Ring is satisfying to play and the reason is because of the open-ended freedom and the choice to walk away and come back later. You combine that with FromSoft's legacy combat and George RR Martin's world-building and you have an epic game at your hands to play and experience. Praise the Ring! 💍"
Positive,I'd recommended it as first souls-like game.
Positive,"A solid choice to start Soulsborne with. Beautiful areas, bosses, and smooth combat easily catch your eye. It can get repetitive with some duplicate bosses, but that doesn’t stop you from enjoying the game. I also enjoyed getting impaled by Messmer, and I hope you will too :D"

Positive,"You do not have the right, O you do not have the right!"
Positive,Excuse me while I fuck the sky
Positive,"I've always loved the Dark Souls / Demon Souls franchise but Elden Ring holds a very special place in my heart. First off a TLDR:Good Stuff:- Dark Souls 3 smoothness and mechanics- Content of Dark Souls 3 + All it's DLCs- Open World with tons to explore- Easy Co-op integration so you can get right into it- Challenging Bosses- Incredible Atmosphere- Intricate story that is told ever so spectacularly in it's still somewhat enigmatic way with much more to be found throughout the world as with the former franchise games.The Bad:- Multiplayer can be a bit wonky at times with random DCs midway in a boss battle- Random crashes during cutscenes- 30 FPS lock and causes a black border on a few Widescreen monitors.The long of it:I've spent a whopping 79 hours before I managed to beat the final boss. I've still so much to explore and the game allows me to do so before entering NG+. The journey from start to finish was absolutely amazing. Yes, I raged like mad over a few boss battles but when it felt like I had no chance, I went to explore and came back stronger, obliterating all that stood in my path. But it was exactly that hardship that forced me out into the world and grasp what makes Elden Ring so special. Discovering every nook and cranny was extremely rewarding. Talking and finding npcs all the more. So much that it allowed me to discover an alternative, secret ending at first unbeknownst to me.While I loved Demon Souls and every Dark Souls game, Elden Ring managed to put another one up which is very rare in today's gaming industry that follows a franchise. This game is a must buy and play. 12/10."

Positive,spent my last winz payment to buy this game it makes me angry so my heroin usage has doubled in the last 3 days.
Positive,"After having played Elden ring a lot, having the platinum achievement, I feel like I can finally write a serious review as a customer for the game...If you've played previous Souls game, you will find yourself at home, Elden ring takes everything from its predecessors and elevates it to new heights!The open world is very compact full of things to do and fight, there's dozen of things you discover and can explore all packed in one area and it feels endless, the builds and weapon arts feel so refreshing and you can really have tons of variationsThe bosses (the shardbearers) are some of the hardest in the From Software's universe, and they are all unique and amazing...There are thousands of things to say about the game and they are all positive things, so I will just focus and explain the major cons, these cons are in the game, rest assured, the game is still a masterpiece:-There's too much to explore, most caves and dungeon might look similar even if they are not the same, some enemies in these dungeons are other enemies with a bar and 2 more special moves, while this is completely normal for an open world game, I see many complain about it, it's not too oppressive and it's not literally every dungeon, plus every dungeon gives you an unique reward, I just felt like I had to state this...-The open world gives the player too much advantage, in previous souls game you had to fight that one hard boss and you could get stucked for hours, in this game it's very easy to overlevel yourself and you are kinda required to overlevel yourself if you find a ""wall"" of a boss-Some ashes are way too strong, while I'm not one of those players that will insult other players just because they play with summons or other things (everyone should play the game as they want), I feel like some ashes need to be balanced, you can sit in a corner of a major bossfight and let some ashes do the work for you, it's a bit too much...-PVP right now it's only bleed builds and Frenzy flame builds, with so many amazing weapon arts it feels sad that people are only using these two things and they should be nerfed a bit to be on pair with other spellsOverall the game's a complete masterpiece, even people that didn't enjoy previous From games for their difficulty are appreciating Elden ring, and one of the cons I said, which was the fact that you can explore and become stronger, is technically also a pro thing about the game for new comersIn short it's worth every single penny, and From has won once again the hearts of its fans"
Positive,This is the game ever
Positive,worth it to buy
Positive,"Amazing game so far, all that I can say is wrong is my frames dropping on occasion."
Positive,"I absolutely loved about 95% of this game. It's everything I'd want in seeing the whole ""Soulslike"" concept progressed. I loved the sense of exploration, I loved starting off with a build in mind and then gradually adjusting it based on the items I found, I loved the new ash summons, I loved the challenge of some of the boss fights. What I didn't love were some of the OTHER boss fights, which were terrible, unfun slogs. I'm not going to mention any of them by name due to spoilers but I would say that they're in the extreme end of the game. I have no idea what From was thinking with those fights. But yeah, I really enjoyed the game up until right before the end."
Positive,honestly. its a great game. amazing visuals perfect combat. stupidly difficult bosses. blocking is now usefull and good if you learn what can and cant be blocked aswell as not holding block for too long to let your stamina regen. and most boss fights have a fun mix of blockable and non blockable attacks that require good dodge timing and as some one at the time of posting this review is in the top 10% of all players story wise.. (context is that like... the last 5 story achievements are still at only 6.5-8% total playerbase has these achievements this only accounts for steam BUT i imagine its similar on console) if your struggling with bosses just take a few runs to study their attack patterns and what attacks can and cant be blocked and what can and cant be dodged aswell as how long the boss's attack animations take to que up as those are your attack windows.
Positive,this game sucks

Positive,Okay let me say it with this words:In my life there was two important Rings.....with one i signed my marriage and the other one was Elden Ring....And with one of those both i had really fun :) Best Soulslike game i´ve ever played so far <3
Positive,"I am Malenia, blade of miquella.I am Malenia, blade of miquella.I am Malenia, blade of miquella.I am Malenia, blade of miquella.I am Malenia, blade of miquella....I am Malenia, blade of miquella."
Positive,"*Just beat the game today, buy it now***300+ hours later, its GOTY no question for me, that feeling when you beat those last handful of bosses? Pure bliss. Best FromSoft game by a long shot for me, just them hitting there stride with there best game yet. The game being even better on the steamdeck (some crazy valve wizardry), so been playing even more the last while**This game has totally taken over my life haha. I have now played 182 hours! Amazing game that just gets better and better. What a wonderful game world they have created here!Overall the game is fantastic, From Software's best game yet without question for me. It is a gumbo pot mix of past Souls games and its just great. Combat like dark souls but improved, stealthy options like Sekiro, improved magic, an amazingly crafted open world and its a blast to play. The game world is so well crafted, can spend hours and hours just exploring and leveling up.The PC version does need some more optimization but its not super bad. Averaging 55 to 60 fps with a mix of Max and High settings, no crashes yet.Positives:- Wonderful game world they have created here, open world but so well done- Great music- So many options for leveling up your character - So many options where to go next, follow the main mission, go farm enemies, do a side mission, explore,etc..- Ripping around on the horse is a blast- If you get stuck on a boss, just turn around and go hit up the massive open world and comeback later- Controls very well- Atmosphere is top notch- Art Design is great- Play how you want, so much freedom to go at your own pace Negatives:- I wish we could play this at 144fps/144hz. That is my only gripe with this game after 400+ hours and 12 hours on the new expansion. Not a deal breaker, but something I would like. Performance was improved since day 1.If this game had 1440fps/144hz ability, this game would be a 10/10 fo rme. This is From Software hitting there stride and producing there best game so far, by a long shot. An rpg has not had me this hooked in awhile, up there with my favorite of the modern rpgs: Pillars Of Eternity 2, Divinity Original Sin 2, Risen 1, Witcher 3, Wasteland 3 or Fallout New Vegas. Lastly I had 2 crashes in 210 hours on the game, not bad at all, just improve the performance and this will even better.Been gaming since the 80's and rpgs are my favorite, this is probably the best action rpg of all time for me, just wonderful and up there with some of my all time favorites in the rpg genre. This will be really hard not to give Game of the year come the end of the year."
Positive,20 hours in I found out that you can sprint. 10/10 game play0/10 key bindings for PC
Positive,Ashen one can jump now!
Positive,best game ever
Positive,Finger butt hole
Positive,"Its like dark souls but I can sneak around nasty enemies instead of ragequitting after 30 minutes \o/EDIT: So now I am at the final boss. The game truly is great and extremely enjoyable. The exploration is top notch and figuring out the lore is cool. You will miss so much stuff so a second playthrough is not a stretch. That said this final boss is bullshit and not fun, and sure isnt testing me on the skills leading up to it (the previous 3 are really strong and good bosses tho) so for me it loses half a star at the end, but it still makes it one of the better games in year"
Positive,"It's awesome, there's so much to do, so many places to explore, multiple times now I saw the map a certain size and was like ""woah that's a lot"" and then I would get sent to a totally new area and be like ""WOAH, ok how big can this game get"" and then you discover this new thing that goes to a completely different place and is a entire section of the map you didn't know existed and I'm like ""ok, wtf, how many unique enemies and side quests and areas could this game possibly have?!?!?""  Timeless dark souls gameplay put into an open world environment that makes it a bit more approachable. Some argue it would have been better if it was linear and they might be right but it's still really good regardless."
Positive,Amazing game. Definitely deserves all of the GOTY awards it's received. Only complaints I would have is the horse combat and movement could use some work as well as some of the bosses having spammy combos that are hard to dodge unless you get lucky or dodge at the exact right frame. Looking at you Malenia and your water fowl dance. Overall the game is great tho. Difficult but not impossible. Probably one of the easiest games From Software has made if you take advantage of stuff like spirit summons. Still doesn't stop the feeling of accomplishment once you get past that one boss you've spent an hour trying to beat tho.  Plus the game is gorgeous and some of the bosses are a spectacle to behold if you're into that sort of thing. Definitely a must buy for anybody that's a fan of souls-likes. If you've never played any games in the genre this is a good place to start too.
Positive,69 hours in (lol noice!) with very heavy exploration of the first few areas and the map and secrets just do not seem to end. There is always a new area to go to. There is always an NPC putting you up to some obscure questline.I caught a glimpse of the actual map from wiki and I have around 40-50% of the map yet to uncover. And some of the best areas and bosses of the game are entirely optional and some are even hidden behind highly obscure questlines which you can 100% miss.I am simply lost for words trying to explain just how magnificent the map design is. This is like they took the map design from dark souls 1 and cranked it up to 10000 on steroids.This game is sheer insanity in terms of how beautiful it is and how fun it is(if you like souls games atleast).This is truly a generational title and should be on everybody's wishlist.Rating - Masterpiece/10
Positive,"Got stepped on, sat on, beaten, whipped, eaten, spat on and whatever not...Got lost multiple times (i got really lost, too often)Accidentally hit Ranni. Did a simple parkour for 3 hours for one ending. Great i like it."
Positive,"An awesome game with the best exploration of any Open World game, enjoyable combat and locations that offer a challenge but are definitely rewarding; plus Crumbling Farum Azula"
Positive,my ass open now.
Positive,LATIN MUSIC HITS HARD
Positive,"Having some issues on co-op connection, drop FPS sporadically on 3070 laptop , 1440p , high setting.BUT IT'S THE BEST SOULS-LIKE GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED. Waiting for patches."
Positive,"I just finished 100%ing this game, getting EVERYTHING possible in one save. There's nothing left to do.I wouldn't have done this if the game wasn't as good as it is.I'm finally free to do something else... Oh thank god.Time for another souls game I guess."
Positive,"Introduction Elden Ring is an ambitious new Soulslike from the company that started it all, From Software. Overall, I think it's definitely a great game and the game feel is absolutely at the top of From Software's lineup, except maybe Sekiro (in my opinion, though different kind of game).  I've finished this game 12 times as of writing this review, so I have a lot of positives and negatives to say on the game. I'll be going by categories: Visual and Sound, Gameplay, and Story and Presentation.Visual and Sound Visually it's their best game so far, with a large variety of areas to visit and an actually engaging open world. All the visual effects for skills and abilities feel absolutely amazing, though one complaint I have on the spells end is sometimes spells get too visually cluttering even when you're the one using it, so it's actually quite hard to see what you're doing (Giant Fireball I'm looking at you!). The sound design is as top notch as it has always been, with a lot of memorable soundtracks. Not much to say otherwise, definitely top tier here.Gameplay Spoilers on boss names and skills ahead! Please skip the Gameplay section if you don't want any boss spoilers Gameplay wise,  I think that player character feel is the absolute best it's ever been. The absolute variety of weapons, Ash of Wars and Spells/Incantations that you have access to is top notch, and almost every single one feels amazing. The introduction of Spirit Ashes has also given a much more accessible jumping in point for newer players as well, to learn the bosses/encounters in a lower stress way. I think this was a great introduction, though I have some complaints to voice later on Spirit Ashes.My first complaint (and most minor) is that with the reintroduction of dual wielding (or powerstancing if you prefer), two handing weapons feel like they've become quite redundant. This isn't a big issue since you'd realistically use something in the off hand, but it's one I definitely noticed after a number of runs in the game. My second main complaint is the design of a lot of the boss encounters in the game especially towards the end. There's actually sub-points I have on boss design, please bear with me. Overall the bosses are extremely aggressive in comparison to the previous games. I think that partially it's been done so on purpose as the introduction of Spirit Ash summons have allowed for solo players to have split aggro to give themselves breathing room. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I do feel like playing with no Spirit Ash summons can feel absolutely oppressive on some builds.I'd like to bring up is there are a lot of bosses that feel like they're meant to catch people who rely on previous games' muscle memory off guard. This isn't actually a very egregious issue, but it does feel really awkward and a bit unnatural in terms of feel when some bosses lift their weapons and hold their swing for the duration of like three rolls before actually swinging. Another issue of note is that many of the late game bosses have moves that are near instant kill (or very annoying to the flow of the fight) unless you know how to counter it. Malenia's Waterfowl Dance, and Malekith's Destined Death are the main culprits, though other annoying moves include Radagon's teleport spam or Godfrey's stomp spam. In my opinion, a Souls game feels best when every death (barring glitches/bugs) feels like it's the player's fault. With how tight the execution for surviving Waterfowl Dance or Destined Death can be, a lot of the time by the time I see them winding up the attack I know I'm about to be dead. My last issue is that dual bosses in this game are actually very poorly designed. In previous Souls games, most of the dual bosses were designed to actually be fought together, so they function well with a rhythm. Examples of this are Ornstein and Smough from DS1, dual Dragonriders in DS2, Lorian and Lothric, Demon Princes, Sister Elfreide and Father Ariendel in DS3. In Elden Ring, the dual bosses are literally just bosses you fight elsewhere solo and pasted into one room. This leads to a lot of flow issues where you spend half the fight running from the two bosses rather than the usual dance you do with a boss. I do want to say, that most of these bosses are actually great bosses separately, but throwing them into the same room just feels lazy to me. This could be attributed to the introduction of Spirit Ash summons changing the design philosophy and pushing towards a more coop (or with AI companion) to split the bosses. I'm not necessarily a fan of the design decision, and I hope that they focus more on single bosses who are stronger or dual bosses who are actually designed for it.Story and Presentation Story wise, the game is far more accessible now than in previous Souls games, which I do appreciate. I do feel like the number of bosses that feel iconic and memorable isn't as high as previous games, especially since you end up repeating a large number of boss fights as side (or main) bosses again and again. That's not to say it's completely forgettable however, and I genuinely think that the enemy lineup is overall quite good. There are some obtuse parts in the story, and with the absolute mega sized world, it can be very easy to miss NPC quest steps. Personally that has never been an issue for me, as I'm not a completionist, though I've heard the complaint voiced by several friends.Conclusion To conclude, despite all of my complaints, I think this is a genuinely great game. If you're on the fence, I would say definitely try it out! It's the most accessible Soulslike game so far, and absolutely feels great to play. If you're new to the Souls style of game, I have one piece of advice: Don't listen to people who say ""Don't use X or Y"", use whatever tools you want to adjust the difficulty to how you want to play. If you want to play with all the meta stuff and steamroll the bosses, do it. If you want to just play around with everything and take your time, do it. If you want to challenge yourself to soloing everything/not using specific tools, do it. Enjoy the game your way, don't let others try to force you to play a certain way. What's most important in a game is that you're having fun, and I think a lot of people forget that.Regardless, thank you for taking the time to read this giantass review I wrote at 2AM. I certainly wasn't planning on going this long, but it ended up being this long so I guess I hope this helps someone. Above all, enjoy!"
Positive,"TL;DR: Buy game, play game, and DON'T SPOIL ANYTHING FOR YOURSELF BY READING/WATCHING!I have never liked ""Souls Games."" I've always enjoyed watching other people play them, but would always hit a difficult area/boss, become frustrated, and go play something else. Elden Ring is a different animal. The inclusion of a HUGE open world means that when I hit something frustratingly difficult I can just go somewhere else. I can continue playing the game. Not only does this keep the fun escapism of a video game from turning into a feeling of bashing one's head into a wall, but it also affords the player time to level up, find new gear, and master their attacks and skills. When you return to that difficult area/boss you're fresh, and better prepared. You'll still die a ton, but having that fresh, non-frustrated mindset is key to conquering any challenge this game can throw at you. Speaking of mindset...What do you want to do? If you said ""kill bosses,"" or ""beat tough dungeons,"" I'd encourage you to reframe that as Overcoming Through Mastery. You can certainly kill all kinds of difficult enemies, but when you fail, if all you want is to beat them, you're going to start having a bad time. Accept that victory over your foes will come from learning and mastery. The advice ""just get good,"" is like telling a first grader to ""just get smart."" Pay attention to the attacks the enemies make. Feel the timing of their swings. Watch the enemies' weapons, not their bodies. Learn. Once you've mastered what that particular enemy does, you'll get 'em. And what a sweet reward is that feeling of having Overcome Through Mastery.If what you want to do is explore a vast open world, I'd encourage you to think of it more as a desire to Experience Wonder. Yes, there are incredible vistas almost everywhere you turn. Yes, if you pick a direction and run you'll find something new. And yes, you'll die. If you go running off towards the sunset, you'll eventually find something that will annihilate you. That's great! Getting one-shot off your horse by some giant monstrosity you've never seen before is hilarious. Enjoy that feeling of smallness, the awe you have for that creature that killed you. Later on in your journey that enemy might feel banal, so really take it in while they're at/above your level.It's easy to overlook a hodgepodge of soldiers resting around a fire as just another group of baddies to beat. But if you're really out to Experience Wonder you'll see the story. A broken cart, corpses of soldiers bearing the same heraldry, corpses of creatures you've never seen before. The story of an ambush laid bare before you. These few remaining enemies are the survivors of an attack. Are the ambushers still nearby, readying another assault? How difficult must they be to have taken out half the force of soldiers? These sorts of stories abound in Elden Ring. For every line of spoken dialogue, there is a novel-worth of environmental storytelling. Wonderful.For maximum fulfillment, I recommend trying to enjoy both Overcoming Through Mastery and Experiencing Wonder. And for Marika's sake, DON'T SPOIL YOURSELF. Looking up a boss fight guide takes away from the feeling of accomplishment when you overcome. Watching a video on all the hidden dungeons takes away the wonder of stumbling upon a tucked-away door in the cliff face.So, you've probably heard about one of the writers. This game is not a book, so don't expect this tale to be told the same way as ""Game of Thrones."" I liken the delivery of the story to the flavor text on Magic: The Gathering cards. You pick up a fallen soldier's sword, and in your inventory it treats you to a little blurb of lore. Every item give you a little blurb of lore. NPCs that are willing to speak to you often only have a few lines of dialogue, barely more than a blurb of lore. Each blurb, though poignant and evocative, is insufficient to feel as though you've learned anything about the world. All those blurbs together, strewn across the truly massive world full of environmental storytelling, reveal all. There is depth and richness and reason behind all that you experience in Elden Ring. The first time through an area, you may wonder why this one group of enemies seems out of place. Hours later you'll realize why they were there. Trust that even in the open world, enemies have been placed with purpose and thought behind them. Having completed the game and acquired all achievements, I feel I have a very clear understanding of the past and present of the Lands Between. I'm not quite at join a discord to discuss the minutiae of the placement of different types of moss levels of knowledge, but I definitely feel as though I've gotten a book's worth of story. A very good book.Elden Ring is my favorite game. I played as a sword and board beefcake and as a glass-cannon spellslinger. I climbed frozen peaks and plumbed inky depths. I'm on Journey 4 at the time of writing this (my third New Game +, so to speak) and the game still has areas I haven't fully explored. I'm still finding new things. Are there negatives? Sure. Sometimes an enemy clips through a wall a bit, sometimes the UI feels clunky, sometimes you don't have that one upgrade material you need but you have all the ones you need beyond it so your options are to either wander the world to try to find one or to look it up online (and here, I relent, maybe you would have more fun if you looked up where to find that smithing stone), but none of that matters. I really didn't even notice any of the negatives on my first go. It's like finding one un-popped kernel at the bottom of your popcorn: it's honestly just impressive that there aren't more of them. Do yourself a favor, set aside a good chunk of time, and play Elden Ring.Try fingersbut hole"
Positive,"VERY HARD BUT SO WORTH IT+BEFORE YOU BUY+-go into this game knowing you are not better then this game-you will die a lot, and that's okay-multiplayer is a little wonky-this game does NOT tell you where and what you need (besides using npc)-try to figure the game out by yourself but please use guides when stuck"
Positive,"This game looks gorgeous, soundtracks are a masterpiece, and its gameplay is what you would expect from a souls game and taken from a whole new level with a lot of new mechanics, some of which are guard counter, spell casting, jumping for more versatility, etc.,I have finally found a game I can spend tons of hours playing. I am also glad that I can play yet another new souls game in the franchise with a brand new experience.10/10 Best Game."
Positive,"Stepping into a new ""branch,"" we encounter a map that is both old and new. Once known as Limgrave, it is now a land of shadows, tinged with an unsettling hue influenced by the Erdtree, which emanates an energy far from positive. The monster scaling mechanics are merciless, and the bosses are masterfully designed and highly unpredictable. Following in the footsteps of Miquella, the journey unfolds across a relatively small map, yet brimming with layers upon layers of FromSoftware's intricate design.Everything is executed to near perfection. However, a few elements prevent this expansion from surpassing the side content of previous FromSoftware titles and earning the moniker of ""Greatest Expansion Ever."" These include the super boss known as Prime Radahn (akin to a community-created boss mod), the erratic performance of the latest update, and the slightly hollow feeling after unraveling Miquella's story and motives.I give this expansion an 8/10. In my heart, it stands as the winner of ""Best Ongoing Game 2024"" and ""Best Expansion of the Year 2024.""-SHADOW OF THE ERDTREE-"
Positive,"The game is amazing! The only thing that is holding this game back is the poor optimization, but otherwise, if you can tweak it and get a steady framerate, then you'll have an amazing time!It's literally Dark Souls meets Breath of The Wild, without the climbing mechanics. I spent nearly 14 hours playing it straight when it released, and I will say it has been such a pleasant experience with a few downsides to the game. There's an influx of new mechanics, which also include jumping. Jumping allows you to actually do platforming without it being janky like in previous Souls games, but they did the Sekiro thing and gave it a purpose in the combat on top of the platforming.There's also things like notes that you can actually follow instructions on with relation to the map you use in order to find more hidden items and locations that aren't super obvious on the map.There's also a lot of different paths that you can take which leads you to plenty of different side quests for special items and opening up different vendors/NPCs, which is the usual for a Fromsoft game, but it's different because it's not direct paths to these other places. You could follow roads or just ""screw it"" and just run around aimlessly and still find cool things to discover.All in all, if you're into exploration on top of the Dark Souls combat, this game is a ton of fun."
Positive,"my character felt the warm embrace of a woman, I hope i can too one day"

Positive,I hate this game.9/10
Positive,Soulsborne with an open world.  Extremely addicting.
Positive,how the fuck do you pop off this hard
Positive,"10/10 game, everything about it is amazing, from the graphics, to the sfx, to the music, to the boss design, there are just so many amazing things about this game that i can't even begin to count. Its an amazing masterpiece that offers something for every player, though that does not mean that this game is for everyone. This game is very accessible for everyone considering the amount of tools the game provides you to make your experience easier and smoother. There are a lot of things about the game that I'd like to say but i don't want to drag this on, in short, good game I recommend to everyone."
Positive,"This is a gaming masterpiece.Open world done right where you're rewarded for exploration. Major bosses are tough due to expansive move sets and delayed timing. On my end, there are no noticeable performance issues (i.e. stuttering) since the implemented update after the first day of launch.If this doesn't sweep GOTY awards, then I don't know what will."
Positive,this game is straight up fire.

Positive,I have never played a game  that lives up to the hype as Elden Ring does. The scale of this game is amazing. This is really achievement in gaming history. 10/10 in not enough. Absolutely beautiful.I am still not done.
Positive,"It's gorgeous, hard but fair, and I have not had any bugs or performance issues (specifically no stuttering that is mentioned in a lot of reviews).Update after finishing my first run. 132 hours and I am pretty sure I didn't find everything. Nothing memorable in the way of bugs. I did ""stutter"" briefly in a couple of areas but the only death I could attribute to it was me riding off a cliff :D"
Positive,"Creator Hidetaka Miyazaki called Elden Ring a ‘natural evolution of Dark Souls’, a statement I wholeheartedly agree with after my 65h long, all bosses beaten playthrough. There’s no denying that Elden Ring is a Souls-game through and through, from combat design to stat distribution, but with the number of changes introduced, it’s also more than “just another Souls game”.The basics remain the same: Bonfires are now Sites of Grace, Souls became Runes, you got the familiar levelling-up process as well as all the different combat styles – melee, sorcery, ranged and so on. And yes, the Moonlight Sword is of course also making an appearance. What Elden Ring newly introduces, however, is an open world. Now, this addition might not seem too game-changing at first. After all, the Souls games already offered a decent degree of exploration, which could even lead to secret areas with their own optional bosses. However, for Elden Ring, this is an actual gamechanger: By opening up an entire world for you to freely explore, you, as the player, now got significantly more power when it comes to game progression.Of course, in order to advance the game, you’ll still need to beat certain boss fights – in a predetermined order as well. Elden Ring is not Breath of the Wild, you can’t just challenge the final boss of the game anytime you want. However, and it’s here where the open-world benefits come in, maybe you don’t need to beat a boss just yet. Instead, with the huge number of other activities the Lands Between offer, you might just explore a bit more and come back with better equipment or at a higher level.It can’t be understated how much of a frustration relief this is. Throughout the entirety of Elden Ring, I never felt like I was “stuck” with a certain area or boss. Instead, I always had alternatives in mind: The one castle I came across earlier and marked on my map (honestly, huge thanks to the person responsible for giving us so many markers to work with), those ruins across the valley or maybe a separate area entirely.Still, and this is what strikes me as genius, Elden Ring never felt like an open-world that adapts the MMO-style of “this zone is for level 1-20, this for 20-40, etc.”. Sure, some areas are intended to be explored with a more developed character – but that doesn’t mean you’re not allowed to try regardless. And indeed, during my journey through the Lands Between, I beat some bosses earlier than probably intended - and others later. Besides a few story-related progress blocks (areas only opening up once you defeat certain bosses), I was completely free to explore – which was more than just refreshing.My favourite story in this regard comes with a very small spoiler, so skip this paragraph if you prefer. As I was exploring the first open-world area, I came across some ruins. After spotting some stairs leading below the surface, I arrived at a treasure chest. Awaiting a new weapon or maybe even armour pieces, I opened it up – and was suddenly enshrouded in mist, teleporting me somewhere else. As I made my way out of the cave I was brought into, I suddenly found myself in an entirely different area of the map, which looked completely different from what I previously saw. And as such, I began exploring …I feel like Elden Ring is the game that offers all kinds of individual stories like this. Stumbling across bosses, wandering through different areas, solving riddles, doing side quests - this game offers many ways for players to progress. Talking with different people also playing the game already showed me that everyone got their own pace and route through the game. We all got our own moments of victory or defeat, although we all started from the same position.This makes Elden Ring the most accessible Souls game yet. That doesn’t mean it’s easy, far from it. But allowing for options lets player choose their challenges as they see fit. And even just exploring the world always nets some benefits: filled with items, you’re almost always getting something out of exploring every nook and cranny. With the addition of Torrent, your mighty spectral steed, you’re not only given the opportunity for horseback battles (sometimes), but you’re also able to travel fast and well. As every Site of Grace also serves as a fast travel option, traversing the huge Lands Between is also remarkably stress-free with only little downtime.If we’re already talking combat, everything you expect is here. It’s simply great – or at least melee is because that’s the playstyle I took up. Still, I don’t expect it to be different for the other playstyles. If you ever played a Souls game, you know what to expect – greatness. There’s no action RPG combat I enjoy as much as this one and I doubt I’m alone with that opinion.Boss fights are exceptional as well. One fight especially left me overjoyed for quite a few minutes after I narrowly managed to beat an especially tough foe. I almost couldn’t believe I actually did it, I don’t think I ever felt as proud for beating a videogame boss in months. I’m sure others will have their similar story of some of the memorable fights to tell as well. Because of spoilers, I won’t say more, but as with the combat – you’ll know what you get if you played aSouls game before.  Great music, for example.While I already mentioned the music just now, it's also important to mention how wonderfully atmospheric Elden Ring is. Again, not a surprise to anyone who played a FromSoftware game before, but the cryptic NPCs, beautifully and/or haunting locations, the enemies – they all make for a very special feeling while traversing the world. And while I can proudly say I got basically nothing about the story, I always felt like I was part of something fantastical, melancholic, something special.That said, while Elden Ring is a near perfect game for me which I could gush about for hours, due to limited review size, I do want to bring up some criticism as well, to not make this one-sided. I feel like a few more explanations in regard to debuffs would’ve been great, considering the symbols alone (red square with a downwards arrow) aren’t really telling much. It’s sometimes hard to determine if a fall will kill or just hurt. Some areas of the world are a little too empty – others are too large for not allowing us to use Torrent. I also wish there would’ve been a little bit more biome variety early on – the really different looking zones only show up later in the game. Lastly, some boss fights are repeated – Dragon fights, for example, happen way too often for me not to wish for some more variety in these extreme cases.There’s one last thing I want to address as well: Who’s this game for? As you now know, I got almost nothing but praise for the game – as do other reviewers (see the MetaCritic/OpenCritic-Score). However, don’t take universal acclaim as Elden Ring being enjoyable for everyone. While I love it, there’s no denying that Elden Ring provides little in terms of accessibility beyond the bare minimum, even with open-world allowing you to follow your own path. Elden Ring got its own identity, a clear design vision - that’s what makes it special for many fans. But the design choices that come with it might prove unenjoyable for others. Elden Ring is a near perfect game for its target audience – but it also not very interested in extending that audience, however you might feel about that. In short, as with every game: make sure the game looks appealing to you as well, even with glowing reviews like this one."
Positive,"Elden Ring is an action role playing RPG game/PP crusher simulator created by FromSoftware where you explore the open world of the Lands Between and fight hard bosses in between completing quests and trying not to die. I fell in love with the Soulsborne series when I first started playing Bloodborne on the PS4, after which I went out on a whim and bought myself Demon's Souls for PS3 as well as Dark Souls 1-3. I heard about this game a while ago, got hyped and pre-ordered as soon as I could before waiting a year to start the game. Having platinumed the game on PS5 and hoping to start on Steam someday in the future, here are my thoughts:The Story is one of those things that you just have to kind of explore and figure out by piecing together pieces of dialogue, item descriptions as well as environmental cues. I can't even tell you much of anything about it, but what I can say is like all FromSoft Souls titles, I love it. It keeps the goal simple: You're a Tarnished (an individual who was banned by the former queen from the Lands Between) who is going for the spot of Elden Lord and to do so has to fight through several different demigods in order to do so. You'll run into several characters via out in the world or the Hubworld, Roundtable Hold, who could do anything from basically nothing to giving you entire new endings. That's all I have to say for the plot:The Gameplay is basically almost the same as the other games in the Souls Series. You go from area to area to loot objects, fight bosses, complete particular quest lines for certain rewards, invade/fight enemy invaders except one caveat: It’s open world. And I mean it’s OPEN world. The other games were a lot more simplified as well as complex: they were a bit open in terms of pathways, shortcuts etc but they also had a straight way from point A to point B as well. In this game, everything is basically tenfold in terms of it’s game play design from how you get to certain areas to how to fight certain bosses. One example:  In order to get to Leyendell there’s a couple different ways you can get to that region. One is you could ride up the Grand Lift of Dectus, where you need two halves of a medallion in which you can get each at Forth Haight and Fort Faroth. Another way you could do it is by going underneath a church near the Lift, going through a village and climbing up a mountain before killing the Magma Wyrm and getting up that way. ANOTHER way is to get killed/abducted at the bottom of the waterwheel in Raya Lucaria where you wake up in an area at Volcano Manor and fight your way out of the caves. Stuff like this is mindblowing and is amazing how much attention to detail and scope it took to truly create such a thing. And keep in mind this is only one example, I can’t list everything because truthfully, like this game, there’s so much stuff TO list that I’d be making a f u c king video essay on it. But also in essence I do think that can be to this game’s detriment as well: It’s so huge that it’s kind of overwhelming with its scale, and with that it can lose some of it’s uniqueness when you see multiple of the same bosses repeated over and over again with different skins. I also found the combat to be hard definitely, challenging is a yes, but I’m not sure if it’s just because I suck but I felt that now in this game it’s definitely more geared towards having summon spirits for boss combat? I’ve always been someone who liked to coop anyways so I’ve been cool with it but it can be kind of frustrating at times with certain bosses. I guess to finish this off just be aware that this game is difficult yes, but the community is great. Sure, are there a s sholes who will just tell you to “Get Gud'' and make believe they aren’t a bunch of basement dwelling pee larpers? Yes. But the amount of people who will go out of their way to help you for no reason other than why not is amazing. Just know in order to summon people: Get the Furlcalling Finger Remedy. They can be found as loot, crafted via Erdleaf Flowers, bought from certain merchants, etc. Also for certain places to be able to summon other players you have to activate summoning pools so keep a lookout for small statues.Sound Design/Art/Graphics; all of this is great and I’m not even sure I could expand upon it other than I don’t feel that the Soundtrack is as memorable as the other souls games? Either way it didn’t matter to me as it fit in the background and made everything memorable as I played even though when I got out of it I didn’t remember much. Still it looks great, the art design is amazing and graphics are good too.I can’t do justice to this game in a single Steam review, but if you’re new to the series or you wanna try it out just know this: Play fresh, wing it a bit and have fun, try not to get overwhelmed and experience EVERYTHING because it’s impossible (though it is possible to get all the trophies in one playthrough if that’s your thing). Research the game a bit, see what builds you want to go for (though your starting class does kind of gear you in certain ways so I’d say research BEFORE you start the game unless you just kinda want to wing it), farm a bit and upgrade your stats. But please god take breaks and take it at your own pace; because you will die and die and die some more and then die again; it can be a frustrating and strange loop but when it clicks with you it clicks with you. And if it doesn’t? That’s ok too and there’s no shame in it. Elden Ring is the culmination of all the things that FromSoft has done with the other Souls games and expanded upon it with great effect (and sometimes mixed results in certain things), but to me it certainly deserves the Game of the Year title."
Positive,Probably the best game i've ever played. Praise the Erd Tree. Suck mah Kak
Positive,"8/10 it's fun for newcomer who has never play soul series before. explore the map, ride a horse, encounter random monster(even big boi dragon) then die."

Positive,"If all the other souls games are the infinity stones, this is the gauntlet!"
Positive,They turned bingus into stone and now i have to fight him while he whacks me with his giant sword and spits fire
Positive,Best fucking game ever made by bandai and from software!!
Positive,It is OK I suppose!
Positive,Good game. Try fingers but hole.
Positive,My gf bought me this game
Positive,can't put elden ring on finger
Positive,"Ah, Elden Ring, the epitome of delightful frustration and relentless punishment. If you're tired of those games that hold your hand and give you a sense of accomplishment, then boy, have I got the game for you!Let's start with the charmingly oppressive atmosphere. The world of Elden Ring is so vibrant and visually appealing environment when you can spend hours, desperately trying to navigate through a sea of stunning views as your killed by an ensuing mob?And oh, the joy of dying! Elden Ring has perfected the art of making you feel like a complete and utter failure. Forget about progressing smoothly through a game and feeling a sense of achievement. In Elden Ring, death is not just an option; it's a way of life. You'll relish the countless deaths as you watch your character's hard-earned progress evaporate into thin air, accompanied by the delightful sound of your controller hitting the wall.But don't worry, because the game's difficulty curve is as steep as Everest. It's like the developers gathered around a table and said, ""Hey, you know what players love? Unpredictable one-shot kills from off-screen enemies!"" It's the kind of challenge that will make you question your sanity, your gaming skills, and possibly your life choices.And let's not forget the incredible joy of trying boses for the millionth time. At least we got fast travel... It's like a never-ending vacation to your favorite nightmare destination. And just when you think you've mastered a section, surprise! A new enemy spawns behind you and annihilates you in seconds. How thoughtful!But hey, if you're a glutton for punishment and have a masochistic streak, Elden Ring might just be the game for you. Its punishing difficulty, bleak but beautiful atmosphere, and ruthless design will keep you coming back for more, or maybe crying in a corner. So, grab your controller, prepare your soul for eternal torment, and dive into the infuriating world of Elden Ring. It's an experience you won't soon forget, even if you desperately wish you could."
Positive,Why is it always dog?
Positive,Elden Ring good.
Positive,Have been waiting a long time to finally get my hands officially at it.Had it family shared which was cool and i am really grateful but nothing is like the real deal. Really coming back from the souls games after a long time to a combination of the from software games its pretty nostalgic. This game is really Dark Souls 4 with open world(and much more of course). That's all I have to say have a fun time playing and may the Greatsword be with you my friends <3.
Positive,"FromSoftware not only integrated all the different core mechanics that they have created through the years but also added some basic(crouch, jump) and new mechanics(spirit summoning, guard counter) to enhance the core gameplay deeply. If you are new to the FromSoftware's souls formula this game is the most accessible title you can ever get. There were some optimization issues here and there but it wasn't that game-breaking at least for me. Fromsoft's artwork as fine as ever. Sometimes you just stop your companion Torrent and take a look at The Erdtree's greatness and magnificence and you might say ""Holy S*** this game looks beautiful"" despite the fact that graphical quality has never been FromSoftware's primary concern. Mounted combat is the best one I have ever seen in any game. Torrent can do double jump and this made the mounted combat far more enjoyable than I expected. Although I have to admit sometimes it gets frustrating because some bosses can knock you off from Torrent with one hit. Spirit summoning is fun and all but some bosses are way too hard(Malenia, Godfrey, Radagon,) without summons especially for melee users.  They have lots of AoE(Area of Effect) movesets and insane health and stamina pool. Sometimes bosses never stop attacking. If you do use spirit summons you don't feel rewarded(at least in my case) after destroying Malenia with +10 Tear Mimic. Even though the bosses aren't that great I loved their themes that's for sure. Fromsoftware's one of the signatures is the boss themes. Even the ambience music tries to tell you a story. As soon as you entered the Caelid you know you are in a rotted and corrupted place to its very core because of the ambience music. Overall, Elden Ring exceeded its predeccessor and changed the meaning of ""open-world"" and ""difficulty""From Software's magnum opus.Thank you for this beautiful piece of art."
Positive,"Elden Ring is an incredible open world experience for those who enjoy Fromsoft's approach to RPG games. The difficulty level is similar to previous titles by this developer such as Dark Souls. However, it is approachable to new players as there are many options available to make the game accessible difficulty-wise to those who don't want as much of a challenge. The game looks great, feels great, but there are some performance issues that are yet to be worked out. Things are looking up though, as the most recent patch addressed many issues players were having with the game and I imagine some performance updates are coming soon enough."
Positive,Amazing experience It's a must play!!!
Positive,mMMmmmm AaaaaaaaaH MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMoOooOOOOOOOOOOaAAAAAAAAAAA
Positive,Ooooh Elden Ring
Positive,I have a big sword made of swords and it cuts things real good.
Positive,DLC is comingggggggg. I cant wait to get more !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Positive,Enjoyed the difficultly of the combat and the open world environment. Truly a challenging and rewarding game.
Positive,"A little bit of hiccups with crashing, but with the cloud auto-save you start right where you left off. Absolutely one of the best games that From Software has released since Dark Souls 1 & 3. I love the challenge, I love the thrill of finding new things in every corner. The bosses are very well developed and there are so many mini-bosses everywhere you go! I highly recommend getting this game one thousand times over. The scenery is gorgeous, just perfectly breathtaking. 10/10"
Positive,"Absolutely shameful release. A lot of people being deliver a game in an unplayable state. Some can't even launch the game they paid for. I am a fucking naive person, and I hoped at least one AAA company could deliver their game in at least A HALF BROKEN state. Embarrassing, and I feel so sorry for all the dev's who put their heart and soul in this fantastic and beautiful game. I love all of Fromsoft's games. They aren't perfect, a lot of people hate them, or don't like the challenging aspect of the game. But a lot of people including me love those games very dearly. Thank you. To all people who worked on this wonderful project. You all did an amazing job at crafting something, I and a lot of other people hoped to get. It is definitely not a 10/10 which a lot of reviewers claim it to be.  Still I am completely in love with this game, because it is everything I wanted it to be. That's why I will leave it as a positive review. But I would not recommend people to buy it for now.  For me it is fairly playable after disabling EAC it runs 60fps at high settings 1440p, but a lot of people can't get it to run at a semi consistent frame rate of 40 with hardware way above recommended settings. And some can't even run the game at all. Yes, there is room for tweaking a lot of things to make it run better. Yes, people should update their drivers and at least be responsible for those tasks. But people didn't pay for a game to search forums, guides and tinker around with all kinds of settings. They should've been able to play the game.It is a truly amazing game, which at it's core require no real skill to play. This game is not 'difficult' in any unfair way, which gets you killed by bullshit all the time. You will die, a lot. Play stupid and you're dead. Remain to play stupid and you keep dying. I did struggle a lot too playing my first souls game. But not because it was hard, because I didn't use my brain or adjust. I am by no means a good or skilled player. I am also still very stupid. I just learned to be less stupid during the previous souls games. I have been able to kill every boss so far within 10 attempts. And that's someone who died 3 times by the Turkeys (or whatever those chicken things are called) in Sekiro. Especially with the Freedom you have in Elden Ring, don't be afraid to put some time into it. It is really not as difficult as many claim all the souls games to be. We all felt some pain at some point playing these games. If you didn't like any of the souls games, then this game is not for you. If you expect some kind of action, hack and slash fighting game or story driven rpg, then this game is not for you. If you expect any kind of Ubisoft-like open world game, to be some kind of overpowered hero who can take hit after hit. Or if you expect it to be a game with a ton of cosmetics, weapons or whatever, around every corner or a reward after every enemy you kill. Just don't play the game. It is basically just dark souls 3 with more freedom, exploration and some new additions. If you are interesting in buying and playing it, keep an eye out on updates and posts people make about the games state. It will take some time for the game to be considered playable for a lot of people. I wish everyone a lot of joy playing Elden Ring <3"
Positive,"Elden Ring feels like the culmination of everything FromSoftware has learned from the SoulsBorne games and Sekiro. The world is vast and intricate. The characters are intriguing. The music is awesome. The voice acting is convincing. And the gameplay is satisfying. My only issue is that there are occasional frame rate stutters. The game has crashed very infrequently for me. I feel confident that these issues will be resolved. They've been very minor inconveniences for me, though I know others are having much more significant issues."
Positive,It's a masterpiece.
Positive,"Like dark souls but on steroids, the only bad thing is the FPS drops and connection problems, hope they get it fixed cause without that this would have been one of the best game releases ever"
Positive,The game of all time.
Positive,level vigor bro!
Positive,"1 of the Best Fromsoft releases so far loving the combat and the addition of magic as well as the skill implementation,  Also the lore is fascinating."
Positive,"Usually I don't really play open world games. I dropped The Witcher 3, Skyrim and Dragon's Dogma (Sorry to everyone who really likes those but there you go).  I felt kind of done with open world games with all these big titles out of the way. Still after playing Elden Ring I have to say: This is probably the best experience I had so far while playing a video game. Fromsoftware never dissapointed me."
Positive,"It's Dark Souls, but big.And when I say big, I mean huge.  By the time you've gotten 1/5th of the way through this game, a feat that would be a full adventure for other, weedier, games, you're just get started, and it's already been 20 hours. Buckle up buttercup, you're in for a bumpy ride."
Positive,"The Game is great so far, I will write an updated review when I finish the game, but if you like open world and you like souls games but hated how playing a rouge type character wasn't really viable, then this game is for you!So far the game's atmosphere is just stunning and in my opinion this is probably the smoothest Souls game ever released! The voice acting is top notch and really reels you in. I am also satisfied with the number of cut-scenes so far it really feels like a single player game with multiplayer features.Does the game stutter for me from time to time? Yes, but that's okay! It reminds me to blink every once in a while. Is it my set up probably?Yes, at least that's what I think. To be honest I am not that great with tech stuff yet with PC! So when things stutter I just kinda am like ""Eh must me on my end"".but so far the game is 10/10"
Positive,"I'm currently at 46 hours ingame and I've literally just defeated the second main boss, FromSoftware is setting a PERFECT example what you should expect buying a game with this price tag, the pre-release hype for this game wasn't even enough to explain the actual gameplay and content you can explore. The only issue is the FPS stutters, and overall PC performance, if this gets fix the reviews on steam will with no doubt rise to an overwhelmingly positive. Playing this game as an souls nerd vet, this shit is insanely incredible.try jumping."
Positive,big dark souls
Positive,"If it doesn't work well, Try Fingers, but hole."
Positive,The game likes to consistently remind me that I got no bi-... maidensfuck u Varre
Positive,"I played DS 1, 2 and 3. I said that DS3 is masterpiece and art. I was wrong. This game surpasses every game of these 3 mentioned. I cannot believe how beautiful game this is, how goergus, amazing things in this game is. Rendering in this game, things and creatures in distance, are actually there, moving, living. Why should we even mention graphics in this game, simple 10/10. FromSoftware, after this game, became my 2nd favorite developer. They are doing dream coming true. This game is for every lover of soul, hard, perfection game, with Dragons (Thank you George R.R. Martin for GOT and this!), multiple bosses which each is pure ART of creation, of big brain developer somewhere in Japan... Music is also something unique. All DS have great music, but this one... Overpass them all!Truly, I dont know how to describe this game, I cannot explain my emotion. I skipped a lot of parts in 1st gameplay, but things I've seen in 1st go, cannot wait to see details I am gonna see in next hours of playing. All in all, ELDEN RING is probably best game even now in 2024. I bought it in 2022 when it came out, but never had time to finish all DS and ELDEN RINGS in order, so I did it finally!Total recommendation, buy it, try it, enjoy it, play it. Game offers you different types of character build, which is even amazing. You can make it easy for you, or hard for you. Lots of options, GREAT!I hope I will soon see more games from FromSoftware such is this masterpiece, and soon!P.S. game has some FPS drops in certain places, but since its masterpiece, you can easily forgive and forget it!"
Positive,"To preface, I am not a Dark Souls or Bloodborne purist and haven't even put that many hours into any From  Software game before Elden Ring.  That being said, I now want to go back and play the Dark Souls trilogy from start to finish just to experience the story and see how it plays into the Elden Ring universe since it has been eluded that it could or may.Elden Ring is the best RPG I've played in years.  The game starts with a sharp learning curve that is both unforgiving and not completely clear in the direction you should work through the game in even with the grace items that give you clues, but that is, in part, a portion of the appeal and fascinating evolution of how the game draws you in.  Above all else, the underlying story and characters are engaging and make you want to continue pushing on even as your patience and temper are tested throughout.  The difficulty of the game can be overcome through trial and error, but can also be supplemented with grinding out more levels and learning the crafting system to strengthen and enhance your weapons.Having not spent long hours in From Software games before Elden Ring I had to learn the timings and overall strategy that you must apply in every fight as this game does not forgive any type of button mashing and will punish you for each mistake you make when fighting enemies that could be 5, 10 or 50 times the size of your character.  You learn what ""iframes"" are and how some animations will prevent you from taking damage, you learn how the longer you hold the button for your ""strong"" attacks, the more likely you are to get hit, but the greater the damage potential.  You learn that parrying and counters are an essential play mechanic and that you cannot brute strength your way through the game and you must apply a level of finesse that is frustratingly cruel at times, but amazingly rewarding when you finally complete the mission or fell the boss at hand.Having played many other 1st & 3rd person RPGs, Elden Ring is the game I wish so many before it actually were.  Specifically, I've indulged in the entire Elder Scrolls series except for the very first game, Arena, so I have thousands of hours in the series.  As great as the evolution of the series is, story-wise, the gameplay actually declined over the course of the series rather than improved, even with the deployment of newer technologies and engines.  In fact, the latest installment was, in many ways, a disappointment in terms of the play difficulty, story telling and the lack of time spent on developing the NPCs and driving factors.  When you compare this to what Elden Ring is it's clear that From Software is extremely talented in staying focused on what matters and developing the gameplay and story to craft a universe that you not only want to be a part of, but also want to continue learning and digging through.With all that being said, Elden Ring is not a perfect game and there is definitely room for improvement; the lack of cut scenes and the reusing of them at key points in the game was disappointing.  The game could have been greatly enhanced by adding more meaningful cinematics and not leaving so much up to the imagination. There definitely are pros and cons with this approach, but for a game of this caliber I would expect a more complete cinematic element, particularly at key points in the game where you overcome main bosses, make discoveries about characters that can come as a huge surprise and develop the story to your own path that makes the story all your own.  The only other part of the game I find is lacking other than the cinematics is the focus on developing the story nearly exclusively through item descriptions.  Although this is fairly unique in how you learn the more obscure details, the fact that you basically have to grind out for items with an extremely tiny drop rate to find those complementary tidbits, I wish there were other ways that the story was elaborated upon similar to other RPGs where lore is weaved throughout and doesn't just appear in an item drop.The only other criticism I have found within the game is that there is no truly enjoyable way to play as a physical ranged character and that the lack of ranged weapons tends to leave the game in a balance between magic & melee, which itself leaves a huge amount of content choices for any character development, but with only really a ""2 pronged"" weapon/class choice balancing act it does narrow down the way you play the game.  Regardless this is minor in my eyes and is something that could be shored up in a DLC/expansion or in a sequel that makes the weapon choices slightly more dynamic between melee, magic and ranged.Overall I would say that even if you never played a Dark Souls title, Bloodborne, Demonsouls or any other From Software title, but want a challenging, infinitely fun and dynamic RPG that focuses on true gameplay and a story, then I would profoundly recommend Elden Ring.  With the historical elements of the lore developed with the help of George R. R. Martin (Game of Thrones), the intertwining paths of the characters and their fates was amazingly interesting, creepy, diabolical, sad, enraging, thoughtful and yet still left room for even more emotions depending on what you discover on your first play through.  The fact that you can then choose to play the main story again, and again, and again, evolving the difficulty to your own desire is a great complement that allows you to relive the ups and downs to your own expectations without needing to start a brand new character.TL;DR, it's the best action RPG of a human generation and there won't be another game that comes close to it until From Software teams up with a company like BioWare to integrate a more dynamic end game experience."
Positive,"incredible game, i honestly thought this would be another game i would stop enjoying after 3 hours. But i was shocked, this game is amazing and hard to put down. When you defeat a boss you spent hours failing and trying to learn it feels great and i love this game for that."
Positive,"Been a long time since I've felt like a kid on christmas eve waiting for a game to come out.Despite the early disappointment in the bad optimization for the PC port, beneath all the frame stutters and such is a golden game. This is the epitome of what makes a fromsoft game great.The new open world exploration formula works very well and allows you to take a wide assortment of unique encounters at your own pace.The addition of legacy dungeons and shorter caves and such brings the original feel of dark souls back into the fray as well.Personal 10/10, 35 hours in, probably the best game I have ever played, give it a week or so if you're mulling it over to see how they handle the pc port optimization."
Positive,"Elden Ring is a masterpiece. The game has everything we wanted, aBig map and things do/ explore.Amazing boss soundtrack and nice music overall. Most have if you are a Souls fan.Elden Ring is my favorite game of 2022. 10/10 :)"
Positive,"That's a love letter to the dark souls community, simple as that.It's been so long since i've enjoyed a game that much...You can really feel the love they've put on every part of the map you visit, the ambientation, the soundtrack, the enemy and boss design and so on.The game lived up to the hype, and that's something you don't see much nowadays."
Positive,"7.0/10ummm errr well,I'm not sure how I feel about this game. I thought I would love it because of the rave reviews, but I also never enjoyed the dark souls series either.Trying to beat a boss or dungeon 50 times is not my thing nor is it my thing when  the world resets (*like in an mmorpg). I want a world to stay consistent and when I beat a boss or reach a story junction, I want my decisions to mean something and the world to reflect that. This is not that game...Yes I could have figured that out by reading a couple dozen more reviews...but I still wanted to try it despite my misgivings.For me, it's just okay. The world after 7 hours is a little bland. My friend and I bought it and are using the seamless co-op mod. I can tell you truthfully if the 2 of us weren't slogging our way through it, it would hold little interest for me by myself and I don't think i'd play it. -I am more of a Skyrim/fallout/Elex/Farcry /story driven rpg kind of guy and have spent thousands of hours happily gaming by myself in those worlds...There's not enough story in this for me personally (I feel like I am wondering around aimlessly). I will say the control of the character itself and the combat is satisfying, it's just not scratching my gaming itch."
Positive,"I've never liked Dark Souls.Elden Ring, however, I almost love. If this game had continous co-op multiplayer, meaning you could continously travel the world together in small parties, this would be the ultimate game to me.I like good combat systems, beautiful graphics, good role-playing elements and well-made stories.This game has it all. And if you are like me and never really played a Dark Souls game and enemies are too hard for you, just level up your character, as you will become more resistant to damage that way, and come back later.Step by step, you will also learn how to deal with enemies. With weapons. With magic. Ultimately, you will overcome your foes, and everything will become easier, even without having reached a high level.I have even changed my mind about the Dark Souls games in general and might really try them one day.This Japanese company makes good games, I have to admit."
Positive,再见了所有的黄金种子和幽影树碎片dlc发布之后之后现在从头打了一遍全收集，简评这个2年前的游戏做纪念：总体下来150hr本体+50hr dlc的游戏体验，三层区域，地下甚至要做的比王国之泪要丰富的多，整张地图所见即所得，小高更是在交界地游乐园里塞满了以前作品的电子，机制怪，1级新手boss（虽然没必要硬过），体验超越最终boss的优秀中期boss体验（前有拉塔恩。并非米塔恩），还有一个又一个的FS拿手好戏--大小箱庭。都让人能爽个遍，魂123里面系统里有的没有的全部都让放进去了。DLC更是在本体的2/5的区域中直接取消了分层机制，因为整张地图除了最后的区域以外没有走不到的地方，因为dlc就是一个巨大的箱庭，相信这也是小高在之后的作品当中会采取的设计。当然因为拾取元素分布非常不平均和前期紧缺后期乱给的数值系统和感觉像是从最后工期和生产力不够了的结果。不过，这种量大管饱的体验差点没给我撑死，不管本体还是dlc到了游戏中后期时我已经失去了对新套路的探索取而代之的就是轮椅复读，如果坐了轮椅还是死就上担架，因为只想快速打到结尾然后封盘。再好看的美术，再酷炫的演出，再粪再有难度的boss都已经撑不起这种“找到任务完成任务战斗+探索地图获得奖励的”模式了，加上法环和黑魂的设计主题是对角色性能做极致的减法后让玩家能够用两三个动作输入就通关的交互（除了那帮跟从隔壁鬼泣搬过来的dlc boss们）使得我作为玩家的体验非常疲惫。这也暴露了魂相比它的狼和猎人兄弟们在设计空间撑起来之后其作为动作游戏的基本丰富程度缺失问题。但换句话说这也许并不怪小高，可能只是我没耐心而已。话说回来，就算它让我用轮椅都玩的很累，被dlc的粪boss粪怪弄得刷魂压等级打，我还是认为它会是开放世界游戏的一个标杆。比起欧美3A罐头，在一个这么小的公司里推出了这种体量的游戏绝对算是前所未闻的例子，况且它加上dlc只卖80美刀。希望下一作可以在更小的框架下实现更多的内容。10/10 张电子游戏的奇迹
Positive,"I shed tears when the final boss said ""I am the Elden "" and the main character responded ""So it's Ringin' time"" truly amazing"
Positive,best survival horror game i've ever played
Positive,"Great game, one thing I really don't like is the crappy network that constantly keeps disconnecting me after being summoned for like more than 30 seconds."
Positive,"Basic premise/StoryFrom developer studio, FromSoftware. Directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki and Yui Tanimura. Elden Ring was made in collaboration with fantasy novelist George R. R. Martin. You play as a Tarnished who must go forth and restore the Elden Ring. For users who are very familiar with Fromsoftware games. Elden Ring(ER) is the next step in their past souls series. Except with a gigantic open world called The Lands Between. Taking all the best elements from their past games and including past works like Bloodborne and Sekiro. For those unfamiliar with Fromsoftware games. ER. is a harsh, but very fair open-world action role-playing game played from 3rd perspective. It could be considered comparable to other open-world games out there. Like Botw, Witcher 3, Elder Scrolls games, and more. Unique GameplayThere is so much freedom you can do in the game it’s mind-boggling. I could go in any direction and the game would not impede my progress to do so. Allowing players to check whatever is over the horizon and see if they can reach it. Rewarding those with a sense of adventure and wonder. You may tackle various enemies in groups, mini-bosses, or secret dungeons in the form of caves or catacombs. Venturing underneath your very soles to find large caverns and hidden areas you may not expect. You will find every corner of the Lands Between filled to brim with content. One of the most gratifying features the game has is the reward of defeating any enemy group and refilling your main health items. Keeping the momentum of exploration further without the need to backtrack to a site of grace to replenish your health flasks. Concurrently, one of the slight frustrations I had with past Souls games was the distance you had to run from a resting area to the boss. Here the implementation of ‘stakes’ puts you just outside the boss room door. So you don’t have to make a decent trek to face the boss. Making repeated attempts against any boss is less painful and a most welcome feature to have. Perhaps one of the most satisfying features ER displays is the ability to traverse long distances with a horse. With an innate ability to double jump AND fight on horseback as well. This isn’t a shoe-horned feature with barely any proper implementation. It is the exact opposite. The utilization of horseback is vital to traverse the world and in some cases can be used to fight enemies who are mounted and can be used to defeat other enemies. From groups of enemies, minibosses, and bosses. And the fact you can get the horse very early on is a major plus in my book. In past Souls games, I usually felt alone in exploring the vast world. Despite the fact, that you can summon online players to help you. You’re still left to summon an online person every time you enter a zone. Which can be kinda frustrating for some. Here the restriction is a bit lessened. Granted they can’t come with you everywhere, but you can explore a good chunk before the online companion has to leave. Additionally, In ER you can summon a companion! They’re called Ashes of War. And they’re fantastic for combat. Sure you can’t use them every single time. But in zones where you know, a boss encounter will come later on. You can summon them and they can help you fight mobs of enemies too. Being a welcome decoy for your enemies to hit while you can take a breather to recuperate. And having an ally with you that you can summon at will for boss fights makes battles a bit fairer and not so lonely anymore. The AI is pretty good as well. Well depending on what type you have and how far you upgrade your ashes. The sheer amount of level design in ER is insane. I thought I would be done in a dungeon only to discover secret pathways and clever verticality to trick my eyesight. And the usage of the jump button and running helps immensely as you explore the Lands Between. While you can’t use the horse in some dungeons, you can go back and forth in a large dungeon and open up new pathways and learn new areas to explore and new enemies to fight. Keeps the gameplay fresh and exciting. Never gets old finding new paths to tread and discovering new loot to find.One last point I want to praise is the inclusion of a map screen. And the ability to continually update with markers of various symbols you can drop on any area of the map. As well as obtaining free maps to unlock portions of regions for the whole map. This allows you to see paths and points of interest you may want to check out. While it doesn’t show every secret cave/catacomb and other secrets for players. It’s nice to see your map update more and more as you progress further in the game. Past Souls games didn’t have an in-game map you can consult. And the feature here is most appreciated. The Sound DesignThe sound design in ER is incredible. Every track hits hard, despite some tracks giving off a melancholy vibe or motif in some songs. There is a good balance in every track. And the harmonization of vocals slightly in the background and foreground in certain tracks adds weight to the big bad boss fights you encounter. Voice actor wise I found each of them to be adequate without anyone being too forced or fake. Every single voice actor was spot on. Thereby, making the world feel more alive. Especially for the main story bosses and optional major bosses you face. I was mesmerized. Final thoughts/RuminationsAside from one crash in my game and some stutter issues. The game ran fine for the most part. I was genuinely impressed by the game's optimization. I was below the minimum pc requirements and yet the game was able to hit stable framerates consistently. Playing through ER is such a weird nostalgic feeling. There is so much the game does well and expands from Fromsoftware’s past works and does so brilliantly to exceed beyond what I initially thought. If someone were to ask me if this was their magnum opus. I would say it must be the Elden Ring. It is very little to none I could criticize the game for. And just about every corner of the world in the design from gameplay, sound, level design, and story(as well as Souls stories go heh) is crafted with such care and precision with the help of George R. R. Martin. If a zone was too hard for me. I would travel to a different zone and level up and acquire new gear and equipment to see if I could utilize a new strategy to overcome my current barrier. There is a huge amount of items from weapons to armor to spells. There are a plethora of methods to tackle situations and circumstances you wouldn’t otherwise think would work. But it does, and the game allows you to do so freely. And so effortlessly, as if to say to the player “Yes you can do this method. No problem.” If there is ever a game you need to play from any company. Especially from FromSoftware. Let it be the Elden Ring.

Positive,"Elden Ring is the (current) Culmination of FromSoftware Titles.It's amazing how vast the game is and how much there is to do in it compared to previous titles, as of writing this i have roughly 150 hours, and i just beat it for the first time, i took my time and explored, crafted, talked to npcs, fought bosses and enjoyed the scenery.The game plays much like all the other Souls Titles: Stamina Based Melee (or Spells if you wish) Combat with high emphasis on making sure to learn enemy patterns and dodge/block well.In previous titles, if you were struggling, you would either have to ""Git Gud"" or summon other players, and these are still options available to you, but there is now another choice in Spirit Ashes, they let you summon all kinds of diffrent AI to help you with Bosses or tough overworld encounters.There's many questlines and many ways to do them, with many of them leading into secret endings or bosses, some of which are the coolest in the series so far.I personally did not have much issue running the game, but others have had issues like a White Screen on Launching, major stutters or crashes, i have suffered little of this in my playtime, and it has ran very smooth.This game has easily taken my Number 1 Spot on the Totem Pole of Souls Games, moving Dark Souls 1 down one slot, right above Bloodborne.I feel i am going to put hundreds, maybe thousands of hours into this one.Good Job FromSoftware.EDIT: Since this review, I have completed the game twice more myself, once in the Seamless Co-op mod, and I've got a save with 99% of all the items in the game, with every achievement now unlocked, truly one of the best games that FromSoftware has released so far."
Positive,"GOTY material, double down"
Positive,"If you've played previous FromSoft games, all you need to know is that this is their best game yet. It combines everything good about Bloodborne and Dark Souls. If you're new to the Soulsborne genre, then this is probably the best game to start with, although there are a few things to note if you're undecided:1) Gameplay and difficulty: This is the most unique aspect of FromSoft games. It's very methodical. For example, in other games, you can usually cancel out of an attack by pressing the roll or dodge button; but in this game, once you press the attack button, your character has to play out the whole attack animation before you can do anything else. This applies to your enemies too. This means combat can be very punishing for both you and your enemies. You have to decide exactly when to dodge and when to strike. You could spend hours fighting a single boss and that can be frustrating, but there'll come a moment when all their attack patterns just click for you and suddenly you're like Neo from the Matrix seeing everything in code. The combat in this game is the epitome of that feeling of ecstasy after hours of gruelling hard work.If you encounter a boss that's too hard, you can either keep trying until you learn all their moves and patterns, or you can summon help from online players. So don't worry about 'wasting your money if you can't complete the game', because you will almost certainly be able to complete the game, with or without help. If you've been put off from Dark Souls because people told you it's all swords and shields, Elden ring is much more varied. You can have a very viable build as an archer, mage or a wide range of melee units. You aren't tied to a single class, although your stats as you level up will limit what skills, spells and weapons you can use; however, re-speccing is quite easily done after you reach the midgame.There's a point to be made about using online tutorials and wikis. For a newcomer, this game is going to be very hard to play without some supplementary wiki/guide usage. I'm not saying you will need a walkthrough or a guide for every boss. Instead, what you need is someone to explain to you what each stat does and how to level up cleverly, or how levelling up your weapon is probably the most important thing, because the game doesn't do a good job explaining it. It fact, it doesn't explain this at all in the tutorial. 2) Story and storytelling: This game has a pretty good story and there's some pretty deep worldbuilding and lore to make you feel immersed.... if you can understand it. The issue is that the storytelling is very very niche. Imagine you have been suddenly teleported to an alternate universe, where everything is in ruins and the only creatures you meet are either mindlessly trying to kill you, or speak in cryptic riddles; you then have to spend days walking around trying to find scraps of history to piece together what happened in this world and what  your purpose is, if any. This is exactly what Elden Ring's storytelling is like. Now, in many ways, this is a lot like its combat, because it requires you to put in a lot of work to understand it, and when you do, there's that eureka moment that is very rewarding. But here's the thing. If you really want to understand the story without outside help, you'll have to make notes every time you encounter a new piece of lore attached to enemies or items, or whenever you decipher something from the design of a dungeon or environmental set piece, and you'll have to constantly revisit those notes and try to link them together. Then, after many hours of play, you might finally understand what's going on. In short, if you like gameplay but don't care much for story, then this is perfect for you. If you don't mind watching an hour long lore video before playing the game, then this is also okay. If you like to figure everything out about the story on your own, then you'll need to invest possibly hundreds of hours not just playing the game, but also making your own notes, be they mental or physical, and pondering over them, trying to put everything together. If you like a narrative driven game like Last of Us or God of War (the new series), then this kind of storytelling style might not be your cup of tea.3) Sidequests: these are not very well designed. All the side quest NPCs will tell you to do something, but it's not always clear where you have to go. Some of your goals will be on the map, and some will not. Often, within a single sidequest, the objectives have to be done in very specific order or the next objective will not spawn. There are no cutscenes at the end of the sidequests, only more NPC dialogue, so again, if you're lore hunting, you'll need to put in extra effort to take notes here too.4) Replayability: This game is quite replayable. There are many viable character builds, so you could do multiple playthroughs with different builds. However, it can sometimes feel like you're just rushing through until you get all the key items and stats for your build, so the first few hours of a new playthrough can feel like a repetitive fetch quest. There's also multiplayer PvE and PvP, which add further replayability. However, the multiplayer is implemented in a very stubborn way. Instead of having an option to create a party and add your friends via Steam or other account names, you have the option of creating a keyword when you search for an online game, and the game will then try to find other players out there who are also searching for the same keyword. If you're doing PvE, all your online friends will despawn after you beat a boss, so you'll have to summon them again if you want to keep playing together. And only the host gets the game progression. PvP is okay, but remember that as the game has been around for a while, many players doing PvP will be quite experienced already, so you might struggle to get into it without first being destroyed multiple times. Conclusion: The combat in this game is unmatched; no other game comes close. The story is average and the storytelling style is very niche that only certain people will enjoy it. If you're a casual player, you'll probably need to check online resources multiple times for advice on combat, levelling up, completing side quests and understanding the story. To me, the combat is so good that I can accept all these other mediocrities, so it's still an overall great game."
Positive,"Her ne kadar optimizasyon problemleri olsa da benim gibi bir souls-like sevdalısının gönlünü çok rahat kazanabilecek bir oyun. Setup'ımdan ve bahsettiğim optimizasyon sorunlarından dolayı oyunu ortalama 45-30 fps arası bitirdim buna rağmen aldığım zevki bir gram eksiltmedi. Oynanış konusunda, şu ana kadar çıkardıkları tüm souls-like oyunların en iyi özelliklerini alıp geliştirmişler. Mükkemmel ötesi hitboxları, silah çeşitliliği, bossların oyunun dikkat çekici özelliklerinden.Her şeye rağmen bu fiyat verilir mi? Eğer seriye aşırı meraklı değilsen verilmez. Fakat şunu da göz önünde bulundurmak lazım, eğer souls-like oyunlarına bir noktada başlamak istiyorsanız bu oyun en iyi seçeneğiniz. Oyun hakkında oyuna yeni başlayanlar tarafından yapılan kötü yorumlar insanların kendi performansından ve sabırsızlıklarından dolayı. Emin olun türün hiçbir oyunu bu oyun kadar elinden tutmuyor. İşin kısası ön yargılarınızı kırın ve eğer imkanınız varsa şu oyuna bir göz atın."
Positive,"Edit: after about 10 billion settings changes, and the 1.0.3 update, the game runs like a dream. I don't understand it, I don't want to understand it, but I'm gonna go enjoy the Lands Between. Play this game now.Yes, this review is negative. Yes, I have over 150hrs in this game at the time of writing this. Yes, the game is incredible. BUT. This port is so terrible. I have 32GBs of DDR4 RAM, an NVIDIA 2080 SUPER GPU, and an i-9 CPU. Everything is up-to-date, drivers and all. Shader cache has been set to unlimited. Every fix I have seen from people online has not worked. I have been playing with invisible enemies, 20fps, frame drops ON TOP OF the previous low fps. And today's update has made it worse. I cannot in good conscience give this great game a positive review until the issues with the port are fixed. By all means, purchase the game and you have no issues, keep playing, but anything less than that deserves an immediate refund."

Positive,"This game is a completionist's nightmare. Or a joy pot. Or both.One of the best games ever released, Elden Ring mixes rich open world exploration, full of rewards in form of weapons, spells and other valuables, with their trademark FromSoftware's Dark Souls combat design. Honestly, even me who hates Souls-like games must admit this game is fun. Very, very fun. There are secret passageways and little jump ""puzzles"" through the map and densely placed in ""main dungeons"" (castles and the like), too. My biggest concern -- ""will I even be able to see and use everything during my first playthrough?"" is easily remediated by the New Game Plus which allows you to bring your gathered equipment and level for your next journey. And there is a way to reset stats after beating the second main story boss, too. Currently, as of release, the game is suffering from stuttering when loading new areas, which is why there are a lot of negative reviews. If you don't mind some initial stuttering during closed areas and random ones during the open world segment, the game is more than worth it."
Positive,"The game features a vast, open world called the Lands Between, filled with diverse landscapes, hidden secrets, and challenging enemies. The world design encourages exploration and discovery. Elden Ring retains the challenging and rewarding combat mechanics of FromSoftware's previous titles, such as Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro. Players can choose from various weapons, spells, and abilities to suit their playstyle.The game offers extensive character customization options, including classes, stats, equipment, and abilities. Players can tailor their characters to their preferred combat style.                                                                                                                           True to FromSoftware's style, Elden Ring features numerous challenging and memorable boss fights that require strategy, skill, and patience. The game’s story is co-written by Hidetaka Miyazaki and fantasy author George R.R. Martin. It features a rich, intricate lore with deep world-building elements. Like previous FromSoftware games, the story is presented in a fragmented manner, encouraging players to piece together the narrative through exploration, dialogue, and item descriptions."

Positive,"So, the latest  Souls Like  game from Miyazaki.The game is very good, really addictive, but only if you play without guides.The game has an open world, a lot of quests and quest lines of characters, as well as a large number of bosses, namely more than 80, if you take into account mob bosses and just bosses.The game has very beautiful graphics, all textures are well made, the picture is even on weak PCs  I mean those PCs on which it can be played at all But there are also disadvantages, namely the traditional online, in which you can not normally play with friends.Of course, this can also be fixed with  Seameless Co-op The bosses are very diverse, from the usual soldier mob, to the well-known Malenia or, for example, other famous bosses.There are several locations in the open world where you can find various things.There are a large number of weapons that can be found, obtained and used.Due to the variety of powerups, weapons and armor, builds are still appearing and stronger builds are appearing each time.If you have already passed the game, and do not know what to do, there are several options that you can notice for yourself1. Go fight with other players in the colosseum.2. Install  mods on the game  you can get banned 3. Set yourself a complication in the form of, for example, passing the game by pumping only one characteristic, using only bows or crossbows, or without pumping.Also, this game has an extensive community that can both support you and condemn you for playing or using something they don't like, for example.The most important thing is to complete the game the way you want and like it the most, and not pay attention.I hope my review helped you with the choice of the game.Good luck and have a good game"
Positive,"Awesome!/!\ Great on Deck. ""GOLD"" on ProtonDBhttps://www.protondb.com/app/1245620"
Positive,"This game is my third official entry into the Soulslike genre and it does not disappoint in the least. First of all, it's a lot of fun and a real challenge, and it's always rewarding when you beat almost everything. The world is beautiful and vast, and there's something of interest almost everywhere I go. The bosses are some of the best I've ever seen in a game. And they are a great challenge every time you fight them. The soundtrack is great and gets you excited every time you face a boss.      My experience with Elden Ring on the PC has been a profound journey, marked by every death, every moment of despair, and every mistake made in gruelling boss battles. With each trial came a burst of emotion that made me acutely aware of the immersive intensity of the game. Elden Ring may not reach the pinnacle of perfection, but it is undoubtedly among the elite when it comes to open-world gaming experiences. Its vast, meticulously crafted world and intricate storytelling captivated me and cemented its status as one of the genre's premier games."

Positive,Live Die RepeatThe game is a masterpiece nothing more to say
Positive,"Elden Ring is a masterpiece of dark fantasy and action role-playing, created by the collaboration of Hidetaka Miyazaki and George R. R. Martin. The game takes place in the Lands Between, a vast and richly detailed world that was shattered by the breaking of the Elden Ring, a mysterious force that gave order and harmony to the realm. As a Tarnished, an exile who lost the grace of the golden Erdtree, you must rise from the ashes and claim the power of the Elden Ring to become the new Elden Lord.The game offers an unprecedented level of freedom and exploration, as you can traverse the six regions of the Lands Between on foot or on your steed Torrent, encountering various enemies, allies, secrets, and surprises along the way. You can also enter hidden dungeons that offer more linear and challenging experiences, where you can find valuable items and lore. The game’s world is dynamic and responsive, changing according to the time of day, weather, and your actions.The combat system is deep and satisfying, allowing you to customize your character with various weapons, skills, magic, and runes. You can also use stealth, environmental interactions, and summoning mechanics to gain an edge over your foes. The game’s difficulty is balanced and fair, rewarding skill and strategy over brute force. The game also features a robust online multiplayer mode, where you can cooperate or compete with other players in various ways.The game’s story is rich and complex, weaving together the lore and history of the Lands Between, the motivations and personalities of the demigods who rule over each region, and your own role as the chosen Tarnished. The game’s narrative is delivered through environmental storytelling, dialogue, item descriptions, and cutscenes, leaving room for interpretation and discovery. The game also has multiple endings depending on your choices and actions throughout the game.Elden Ring is a game that will keep you hooked for hours, as you explore its vast and beautiful world, engage in thrilling and rewarding combat, and uncover its secrets and mysteries. It is a game that will challenge you, inspire you, and immerse you in its dark and captivating fantasy. It is a game that deserves to be played by anyone who loves video games. It is a game that deserves a perfect score: 10/10."
Positive,"This sits a top the gaming hall of fame. Elden Ring is a masterpiece. The music, the world itself, the character design, the boss fights. The map is massive, far bigger than I could've ever imagined, with more content packed into it than any other world game I've played before. You can tell the world is hand crafted and not procedurally assisted by a computer program. Every little thing seems to have it's place and you don't see a lot of repeating assets or structures, everything was designed and put in place with a specific intention. Sometimes you will find yourself getting to an area with a view where you will just stop and appreciate the detail of your surrounding environment. Absolutely incredible experience.  Couldn’t recommend it more, FromSoft should be damn proud for making this masterpiece!"

Positive,"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offencesFor abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor."

I should mention I played this game on PS5 for the most part and just tried it for a few minutes on PC since the game is not optimised for PC gamers.First things first, not a game for everyone and I don't believe that everyone should pick it up and play it. In terms of story/lore and the evolution of both the main and side missions, Fromsoft has created an open world experience that is every bit as hazy and enigmatic as its more restricted products. The information is available if you seek for it, but many gamers aren't used to paying close attention to context hints in their environment, such as listening to NPC talk that isn't kept in a player log for later reference ECT. In compared to its contemporaries, this game can and will appear to have no plot or direction. All of this is without even mentioning the complexity and design philosophy of the gameplay, which is so unlike to most other modern open world action adventure/rpg products that any casual gamer unfamiliar with Fromsoft's previous titles would quickly grow frustrated and quit up.All of this is to imply that the negative reviews for this game are mostly based on three sorts of experiences. Casual gamers who were woefully misinformed about what to expect from their purchase, longtime fans who get more hung up on technical issues, poor PC optimization, and changes to PVP that favour the host over the invader (unless you use a specific item that evens the playing field, which all of these people completely ignore), and contrarian trolls who resent the game's praise and typically state things that are objectively and demonstrably false.When all is said and done, Elden Ring is the absolute pinnacle of both the ""Soulslike"" genre created by Fromsoft and open world action RPGs in general, and I strongly recommend it for anyone willing to learn and grow as a player to push through the difficulty curve and begin to experience this world on its own terms."

Positive,"A retirement home – sometimes called an old people's home or old age home, although old people's home can also refer to a nursing home – is a multi-residence housing facility intended for the elderly. Typically, each person or couple in the home has an apartment-style room or suite of rooms. Additional facilities are provided within the building. This can include facilities for meals, gatherings, recreation activities, and some form of health or hospital care. A place in a retirement home can be paid for on a rental basis, like an apartment, or can be bought in perpetuity on the same basis as a condominium."
Positive,"Note: This is my first souls-like.Elden Ring is definitly a game for people who don't like to their hands held throughout every little thing.The tutorial area is hard to miss. Pay attention and you will learn the basics of everything you need. Most will die during the tutorial but its designed to be that wayCombat:The combat is incredibly well done, unique and thrilling, incredibly challenging but very satisfying. This isn't your casual RPG like The Witcher, Skyrim or anything else you know where spamming the attack button means you get an easy win. This is not a Hack and Slash either. It's combat is so complex, every movement has to be calculated with a thought in mind of what you're gonna do.It will be hard and you will die alot, but eventually you will get over it and beat whatever gives you a hard time. That feeling of success makes the journey of dying, remembering patterns and studying every enemy so very worth it.Story: (spoiler free)The story itself, is practically nonexistant if you dont know how the Developers approached it. Most of it is told indirectly through exploring, interacting with NPC's, even hidden in Items and Cinematics. While cinematics are incredibly rare, it makes them so much more special and important.Progression:Upon leaving the starter Area you will come across little beams of Light, graces as they are called. Those are basically checkpoints where you can refill your potions, memorize new spells and level up. The golden rays around them, once discovered, lead to the next area you need to go to progress. Though, this is just to lead you to the main story. You are almost required to explore the world and find new gear to help you prepare for whats to come.I haven't finished the game but im very excited to do so. As this is my first souls-like i got a little dragged down as i kept dying alot. But as i kept going i noticed one, very important thing:The enemies dont hinder you on your journey, they are the journey.Don't give up! You will eventually have that rush of dopamine that'll make everything worth it.10/10 will attack the starter npc for calling me maidenless again."

Positive,Elden Ring brings the best of each Souls game. Truly a masterpieceMaidens are temporary but the glory of becoming the Elden Lord is eternal
Positive,"TLDR: A fantastic game. Great story and gameplay. I would say 10/10.I am not a hardcore fan of the souls-like genre. I decided to buy Elden Ring along with my friend at first only because Dark Souls 3 servers went down. I was planning to buy it anyway, but wanted to finish DS3 first. But I do not regret the purchase at all. It's a fucking blast to play, in solo and in coop. Story and Gameplay:I’ll talk about the story first. Souls games are always a bit hard to understand in terms of story, which makes it better for me because it makes me want to pay attention and keep talking to characters from time to time to keep myself updated on the story progression. The best part is, you can do the story at your own pace from any point of start. I did the first boss way later than I was supposed to. The game rewards exploration, and expects you to do it since it does not tell you where to go, which is another aspect I love about this game. The gameplay progression is really satisfying. The joy you get when a build that you’ve been investing on pays off, is super nice. The music is an under appreciated aspect of this game. The ambient music for each area is really good, and all the boss tracks that I've experienced so far, are amazing. Online Experience:Online experience is really good. Coop is really fun. Mixing up moves and supporting each other in fights is really good. I would even say it makes the game a bit easier, but that’s where the PvP comes in. Invasion is the aspect of the game which I love and hate at the same time. It's a very unique experience. You can even help other players as a hunter. If anyone else gets invaded, you can be summoned as a Hunter in their world to help the host. So, you'll always find matches for it, in case you want to get the game for it's PvP aspect.Downsides:Of course, there are downsides to the game too. Some invaders are super laggy, which makes for unfair matches and connection errors for no reason when playing coop ruins the experience a bit. But it’s not too much of a hindrance. If the game is difficult for you, then you need to get good. As long as you are patient enough to read the enemy movements and time your attacks, you can beat any enemy. I know it’s such an obvious statement to say, but that’s the only way to beat this game. Overall, It’s a fantastic game. I haven’t even finished my first playthrough. I have only finished like 40-50% of the main story and I am close to 200 hours already. I hope that speaks for the amount of content that’s in this game. If you ask me, the full price is totally worth it. But if you want to get it on a sale, that’s fine too. But, do not miss out on a masterpiece."
Positive,"Hype or not, it is one of the best games ever made."
Positive,Varre wont stop talking to me how do i get past him
Positive,"Coming from Dark Souls (especially Dark Souls 3, which was my all-time favourite game) my expectations were high. Finished my first playthrough about 60-65 hours in and this was after somewhat rushing the late game areas. Been playing it every now and then after that. I'm almost done with new game+ and I've respec'ed my build about 4 or 5 times lol.The strongest points are boss design, build variety and the filled and vast open world, so i'd say that even if you don't like the difficult bosses you can still enjoy this game (especially with friends in co-op).I have played very little PVP, but i feel like it's good enough to play it casually, but not good enough if you're really into it (due to the unbalanced meta and ""bugs"" like AFK farming) , so i'd say that's the biggest downside.Besides that it's my absolute favourite game, having overtaken Dark Souls 3, and I absolutely recommend Elden Ring"
Positive,"Best game ever i mean it can be frustrating sometimes but its amazing, so many different ways to fight enemies!"
Positive,Try finger but hole
Positive,"I think this was the most fun I had with a From Software game, although it suffers from similar problems that afflicted previous ""Souls"" games, such as having a weaker last 1/4 of the game and obtuse quests. Still, I believe it's the best of the Souls games compared to the previous trilogy. Remember that I don't care for the game's multiplayer aspects, so I'll only be covering PVE.+ Powerstancing is back and feels great. As a whip user, I had a blast. And there's a cool little selection of whips in this game :)+ The Ashes of War (weapon abilities) are very nice. You can swap the weapon ability of almost every weapon in the game.+ Spirit Ashes are awesome. I experimented with lots of them, and while some can be too OP (like the Mimic, which I avoided using), most of them have their strengths and weaknesses, like Latenna the Aubinaric: a very competent and strong archer that can hit targets from long distances but remains immobile.+ If you like to get lost, the legacy dungeons can be very labyrinthine. There is usually more than one way to reach a certain point in a dungeon.+ NPCs and their quests seemed more remarkable than previous Souls games.+ The gorgeous open world is designed to feel like a journey with a few sidetracks. IMO, it's the best world From has designed... and a breath of fresh air from cookie-cutter, boring open worlds that plague the industry today. Exploration is top-tier and this is probably my favorite handcrafted open world ever.+ Ranni's sidequest is a blast and the most fleshed-out of the game, and one of the few I didn't get lost in!+ Stealth works. Kinda.+ Very addicting. I'm holding myself before starting a new playthrough because I want to wait for the inevitable DLC.+ That moment when you're descending to Siofra River for the first time is jaw-dropping and maybe one of my favorite moments. The underground regions are probably my favorites.+ Runs on GNU/Linux through Proton.+ Ranni and Millicent.- Performance is not good, especially in Limgrave. Expect some slowdowns. However, the game is playable.- Curiously, the inventory UI feels like a downgrade compared to previous games. I want an item's information on a single page without switching pages to read a textual description, for example. It's also harder to directly compare different weapons/armor.- Except for the Haligtree, the game gets weaker after Leyndell. Weaker enemy variety, ""unfair"" bosses, and regions that are not really interesting to traverse.- Some advanced spells are flashy and pretty but not really useful. 120h in, and I was still using Rock Sling, which I found in less than 20h in the game.- Quests are still obtuse, and you can miss important stuff because sometimes you don't know what to do, which can be frustrating. I almost missed the ending of a quest from a certain NPC because I initially ignored killing an optional boss-turned-normal-mob.- The optional dungeons are either mines, catacombs, or caves. Some have interesting twists, but they're mostly subpar compared to the legacy dungeons. Expect low variety and mostly poor rewards.-  The bosses in this game have considerably longer and faster combos than in previous Souls games. Sometimes, it feels like your player character can't match their speed, and the late-game bosses feel terribly unfair if you don't bait them with summons or busted weapons. Expect long combos that are almost unavoidable.- The final boss in Elden Ring is the worst I've seen in a From game. Really, really awful.- Side bosses are reused a lot.- In the latter regions of the game, you're basically just fighting stronger versions of mobs you've seen before, with only a few new enemies.- With some exceptions, larger (as in size) bosses are still frustrating to fight against due to how the camera moves and how sometimes it gets hard to see what the boss is actually doing.Elden Ring is one of those games that come once every five years or so, and I'm sure it'll be remembered for decades. Be sure to play it."

This is the game players hoped for and way more!"
Positive,"The hype was real, the game exceeded that hype and is now one, if not THE best game I have played to this date. As an avid fan of FromSoftwares' earlier titles, namely the ""Souls"" games, I am beyond happy with how this game turned out. Definitely a 10/10 for me."
Positive,"Elden Ring is an open world game set in a world ruled by demigods and populated with beautiful environments and structures, allowing for players to traverse the Lands Between, discovering secrets, engaging in battles, and mayhap get some maidens.There are some problems with the low fps being capped at 60 for PC users but there are solutions on the internet that can help rectify this issue, in addition there is also some fps stuttering at times, it can be annoying but other than that the game is still very much playable. But with that said let us get into what I think is great and what I dislike about Elden Ring.Bosses:The bosses are fantastic looking and have some fantastic flashy move sets, however most of the main bosses have attacks that are too fast to be dodged, insanely long combos, always have some sort of AOE attack, and always keep moving making them hard to hit with melee weapons. Malekith the black blade fits in most of these points vie stated, having ranged abilities, difficult to dodge attacks due to his wide range of attack also making it hard to run away to heal, and a DOT (damage over time) after being hit with his blade. And this trend continues for most of the bosses, making them quite unfun.Giant bosses:Giant bosses are also quite hard to battle against, it's hard to see when they are going to attack IF you’re using melee due to you needing to be up-close to the boss.Duo bosses:Duo bosses are not too fun to fight, considering that they can kill you within 2-4 hits and you now must focus your attention on 2 enemies which considerably increases the difficulty in a cheap way.Enemies:The enemies in this game are fantastic with a wide variety of epic designs making the world feel populated, however some of them are made to be quite annoying, the Rotten Stray constantly staggering you, the Lesser Kindred of Rot with their spammable ranged attack, the Bladed Talon Eagle being hard to hit for melee users and so on.Dungeons:The dungeons are fun areas to explore, containing resources that can help the player out by giving them better weapons or useful materials. However, some of the dungeons have bosses that are too large for the area it is placed in, mostly referring to the Tree Spirit enemies. Fighting in these small rooms is extremely difficult due to the combination of your third person camera, a large boss and a small room, making it quite a challenge to know what is going on, not to mention the AOE attacks this boss has that basically reach the entire room.Too long didn’t read:Bosses are too quick with too many AOE attacks to avoid, a handful of enemies are annoying to fight against, duo bosses are hard to fight without summons but possible, hard to keep track of when giant boss will attack, small areas with big bosses are hard to fight against.World:The world of Elden Ring is fantastic, not needing to always rush head in towards a boss first, you can always explore and grind levels, get better equipment before trying to battle the bosses, in addition to better equipment, you can also use summons which dramatically makes the fight easier.Combat:The combat in this game is decent, having many different attacks, light attack, heavy attack, rolling light, rolling heavy, jump light, jump heavy, sprinting heavy, sprinting light, guard counter, block, parry, and unique weapon skills that can be applied to each weapon. You can also switch between two handing and one handing weapons as well as dual wielding weapons of the same type as well as mounted combat. There is also the introduction of the stance/posture system. If you are familiar with Sekiro, it is like the posture system. After hitting the enemies enough, it will cause them to stance break and leave them susceptible to critical hits, this is also applicable for bosses too. Some attacks will cause more stance damage than others such as jumping heavy attacks, counter hits and charged heavy attacks.Rolling is a little different in this game, rather than rolling on pressing the button, you roll when the button is released.Runes:Runes from bosses and enemies are a little low. The rune scaling also does not improve much for enemies when you progress to more difficult areas, but bosses do drop more runes. And the runes you get from bosses and enemies are increased permanently after NG+ as well.But aside from all these issues this game is exceptional, one of the best Maiden Pick up simulators I've ever played, a solid 9/10, definitely would recommend to anyone who wants to get into the Souls-like franchise or anyone who is a masochist."

Positive,"this game is a challenge  in every way conceivable. Be prepared to put on you sleuth cap if you want to understand the story, items, world or even the menus, but it is worth it. Nothing is spoon fed to you, every inch of progress is earned.  Or I guess you could just look it up on youtube...."
Positive,"The world of Elden Ring it's very mesmerizing, very mysterious, but also dangerous. When I played, I finally had the feeling of ""I'm going to an adventure"", and the last time I felt that way was back in Dark Souls 3. The open world it's fantastic and everything it's build with care and attention with tons of different things to either discover or fight. At this moment I have 853 photos that I took through my gameplay and I usually either forget to take photos in game, or take them to a minimum level. I'm amazed about what they built with the same ENGINE and how much depth and details they put into their work, some photos that I took I can even put them as background for my PC, because they look so good and clean. Every single zone from Limgrave to the final zone Farum it's incredible, filled with so much details, everything has it's own identity, which I personally like it to the very end.---The story of the game is ""simple"", yet complex when you put every single piece of information gathered either through dialogue with NPCs, quests or by exploring. In this game, YOU are a Tarnished, once banished for losing the blessing of the Grace and now recalled back with other Tarnished after the Shattering, in The Lands Between to recover the Great Runes, restore the Elden Ring and become the next Elden Lord.What I like about the games made by FromSoftware? They never handhold you, or at least they are doing that to a minimum level. It's an open world, you're free to explore, to do whatever you want. But because it's an open world don't expect to fight the end game enemies fast. What you should take in consideration when you play Elden Ring:    Sites of grace are your compass, they tell you where the Shard bearers are and where to go next. If you follow them, be assured that you will not get lost, but at the same time don't forget to explore the vast world and meet the other Tarnished (NPCs)    Elden Ring is not linear as the other past games made by FromSoftware. New players or even veterans, that got used to the old mechanics, don't understand that freedom might be also your biggest enemy. If you explore and reach a zone where you get overwhelmed and destroyed by monster, don't get upsate that it's unfair, just keep in mind you come back later after you got strong and far into the story. I got teleported to Caelid because of a trap chest and I wondered why I wasn't doing that much damage, but I knew that later on I will be fine.    As I said previously you have freedom which is your friend and at the same time your enemy. The world is vast and filled with secrets, dungeons, mini-bosses and items. Don't be afraid to discover them, you might discover a spell or weapon that you will like it and presumably will make you stronger.    Listen to what NPCs have to say. They will tell you where you will meet them in the future, EXPECT that you will meet them. Don't get mad that you lost a quest, or did something bad, learn what you did wrong, plan what to do in your next journey when you finish the game.    Use every resource you have to your own advantage. Read the messages that other players left behind, some might help you, some might not, and some are wrote just for fun, but they are there. Miyazaki wants the community to help each others, that's why there are messages. Use steam forums, ask for help, ASK YOUR FRIENDS, if you want you can take a glimpse at a guide on the internet on what to do with a specific NPC, quest, as it's not something to be ashamed about, everyone is doing mistakes, and everyone is hitting a wall sometimes. You did a mistake with an NPC in your run, but I will do better in my next one. JUST DO IT!    Use the map! Pin your NPC, resources, ANYTHING!    A boss is hard? You spent 1,5 hours trying to beat it? (Looking at you Valiant Gargoyles) You have many options: request help, play with friends, use summon ashes, find a suitable Ash of War for that fight.    The AI of monsters, mini-bosses, bosses is learning from your moves and mistakes. Unlike the past souls games, in Elden Ring you might get overwhelmed by a long series of fast attacks or even insta kills. Learn from your mistakes, hone your skills, it's possible to beat it!"

Positive,this game is amazing.
Positive,Elden Ring is a masterpiece. The best game I have ever played.
Positive,"This game is great. Best game that I've played in a few years!Irks for me:- There is some stuttering in certain areas, though I don't think I experience it as much as some of the comments do.- 60fps capped. But this isn't really too big of an issue for me.- Multiplayer can be an annoyance, but it was still a way to enjoy Elden Ring more: with friends (if you have those).The good stuff:Although the beginning felt a bit slow, I'm totally into Elden Ring now. It gives the same sense of being rewarded for exploration and discovering secrets that not everyone else might discover, in the same way that Skyrim and Dragon's Dogma gave me. I enjoy picking up a sidequest by happenstance when exploring a bit of the undiscovered map part - and then how those sidequests unfurl and affects other NPC's dialogues, etc. The difficulty I would say can easily be circumvented with summons, magic etc, and there isn't as great a necessity to learn mechanics as with Sekiro. There is still mechanics, and you can choose to defeat a boss that way (more satisfaction), but it's not a must. Great game, 10/10!"
Positive,This is a good ass game that's it.
Positive,"Probably the best game out there right now. Actual open world with stuff to do. Not a filler open world like any other open world. Do you like Dark Souls? You will love this! Did you like Sekiro? You will love this! Did you ever want a DS/Sekiro mix with the bets of both worlds? You will love this! Did you ever wonder how DS could be further improved? You will love this!Edit: 22.04.2022I have done several PvP Builds now (Invasions, no duels) and it is alright. It had been better in previous souls game because you can appearantly no longer solo invade hosts unless they specifically ask for it. Thus you pretty much always end up getting ganked by tons of ""Blues"" as they get spawned in pretty much all the time to fill up the players. Thus it is quite different and at times unenjoyable when three enemies spam meta weapons, however, when timed properly and spaced well, you still can win these and it feels even more rewarding. That's why I actually do enjoy the PvP aspects of the game very much and the latest Patchnotes showed quite the effort for PvP balance (even though some aspects were not fixed, but it is definetly a good way it is taking)!Furthermore, the Host's Phantoms (i.e. White/Yellow Summons in DS) can for whatever reason seemingly be way overleveled or the souls dropped is glitched sometimes. At RL50 Invasions I had gotten RL150 Phantoms on a RL60 Host, but their Vigor actually was that low that I am unsure whether they actually were that high level or if the runes dropped is just glitched.  Either way I guess it is more of a (somewhat unfair?) challenge that kind of adds to the charm as they game itself is probably easier than most Soulsborne Games."

Positive,"Is Elden Ring the FromSoftware masterpiece?We're one week after the launch of this huge game, and I just finished 100% achievements. Although I understand this in no way qualifies me as an authority on the game and probably means I need to go outside for a while, I have done this with every FromSoft game. This will be my attempt at an objective and fair review from a longtime fan of the genre, and weather or not I think it is good for souls fans or newcomers. Open World transition The one thing most people know about this game, weather they care about it or not, is that it is the epic open world take on a Dark Souls like game. I know it's tiring to hear the S word whenever a new big open world game comes out, but there is truly something special about the ties this game has to Skyrim and Breath of the Wild. The most important, however, is the fact the game trusts the player and it is rewarding to explore, never feeling like a waste of time. You can get lost doing tens or hundreds of hours of content that you needn't ever see. Massive amount of optional content to reward you for being a collector, or seeking adventure, or just wanting to get as overpowered as possible before the next story boss. Ruins, churches, catacombs, and keeps all hold some sort of special item or spell within. If this isn't your style, you can ignore basically all of this, and rush the main game. There's still shortcuts, NPC stories that help you skip fights or get to them early, multiple ways to access most areas, etc. The classic From exposition style is still there as well, rewarding those who seek the story (and the lore is really good) while also allowing zugzugs to smash their way to the combat as fast as possible. I feel they force a little more lore on you than normal, though thats probably to justify them shucking out the big bucks for my boy GRRM. New systems As a shamed purist, I get pretty skeptical when they try to add too much to my beloved DS games, but most of the new systems are undeniably pretty cool. The jumping, although I still can't get over how it looks, feels so natural, it's gonna be hard for me to go back to a different game. They implement it very honorably, and they can tell you're gonna try to Skyrim yourself up walls you shouldnt, so they basically design some walls that way, atleast it seems. It feels a lot like the Sekiro jump (I could do without the end game jump puzzles though, pretty annoying). Another feature that feels identical to Sekiro is the sneaking system, being able to hide from enemies in grass. The horse is great, however it's also necessary because a huge part of the game is the vastness and beauty as you sort of scroll through, and the horse makes it much faster. The horse combat, although I can tell they put a lot of work into it, is probably the worst of the new to me. It's pretty annoying to try and dodge on the horse instead of rolling, and I often found myself fighting bosses that were clearly intended to be mounted fights on foot. The game also has a time system, which is pretty cool, certain open world roaming bosses only spawn at certain times. The Ashes of War are a cool way to modify your weapons, add skills, and even alter their scaling, which is very welcomed by me. The best of the new was the summons. It felt really exciting getting them at all stages of the game, upgrading them as I went along, trying out all the new ones as I got them. By the time I got to late game, my max level summon was a staple of my strategy for bosses, and it felt great. Bosses The staple of FromSoft. Epic, satisfying boss battles. This is what I was most looking forward to in how they would compare to other entries like Sekiro and DS1. To get the bad out of the way, with tons and tons of dungeons, mini dungeons, and caves, most of them having bosses, a lot of bosses are repeated. You'll fight early game bosses, think ""ok that was pretty cool."" and then a few hours later it will be that boss again with a new move, then a few hours later it's like ""now theres two of them"". Some bosses are just straight up two enemies that zerg you, and the fights that are like that are probably the worst design to be found in Elden Ring. Hard does not = great. If the boss is hard becasue you just get zerged before you can set up or position or you have to fish for lucky RNG, and you don't feel satisfied when you kill them, but rather relieved that it's finally over, that is not good. Huge derpy hitboxes and attack patterns that seem to just go on forever also was a problem a few times. There was a particular boss who fit both of these problems... Radahn  But with that said, the good bosses in this game were GREAT, and there were a lot of them. All of the optional endgame fights were fantastic. Felt good, reasonable to learn, were satisfying, and most were still pretty hard. Even though I'm a vet of these games, I still tend to die a lot my first time vs bosses, and almost all the main story bosses didn't make me feel frustrated, but eager to try again. A particular lady  Malenia  makes her way among the top spots of all FromSoft fights. I don't think the last boss fight measures up close to DS1, DS3, BB or Sekiro as a fight, but it does excel at something... Visuals The other twin pillar that holds these games up. The atmosphere, the ambiance, the scenery, the level design, the animations of spells and attacks. There is no doubt in my mind this is among the best games ever in this category, even beyond FromSoft games. As I said, I'm not afraid to really let myself feel dislike if a game dev I love lets me down, but from the moment you step into the world map, it is absolutely stunning from beginning to end.  The epic areas like ancient cities, volcanos, flying castles, are jaw dropping, but even the normal zones such as forests, rivers, plateaus, mountains, and snow fields are all great. Just taking a look at what is ahead of you, behind you, and where you stand is sometimes overwhelming. The backgrounds and skies are always extremely detailed as well, and boy let me tell ya this game loves a scenic elevator ride. The huge amount of special weapons come with special abilities, not to mention sorceries, incantations and items. The sorceries, the gravity spells, and the STR/Faith weapon effects are my favorites. Last but not least, the visuals of the bosses. This is the ACE of Elden Ring. The bosses I loved, and even the bosses I hated, all look fantastic. Once again, they slay the scenery in each and every one. There's even a fountain of dreams (from smash melee) lookalike arena. The visual design of the superbosses are fantastic, and the saving grace of the final boss to me was it's exceptional look. The gold medal of visual in this game for me is  Lichdragon Fortissax  . Difficulty Hitting character limit here but basically, if you're new to the genre it will be hard at first. The power creep is pretty well balanced though and it feels good. If you rush, fights are going to stat check you, but if you take your time you often feel too strong. I think this might be the new best first game to play for newcomers. The feel of getting stronger and your power creep is probably better than it's ever been. When you're somewhere you shouldn't be or fighting someone you shouldn't fight yet, it's super obvious. There's also NPCs that guide you, and seemingly endless content to do instead if something is frustrating you.  Recommend When I finished my first playthrough, I had to lean back in my chair and process what a ride this game was. The thrill of exploring these zones is something I haven't felt in quite some time. I had pretty unrealistic expectations for this game, and it honestly and truly blew my expectations out of the water. A strong 10/10 from me. This is truly FromSoftwares masterpiece. In short, seek Elden Ring"
Positive,"ELDEN RING, the best creation from FromSoftware as of today. Has a great improvement from the previous soulsborne series especially the large open world! You will see many amazing view around the map, you will spent many many hours travelling the lands between, i even forget that i have other games to play with because Elden Ring offer many freedom to the players so i never run out of option, you always find something new here and there, you don't even know if you're missing something in the road.The enemies are all unique, there are many types based on the places. Not to mention there are many bosses you can fought, their design are magnificent and not only their appearance but also their stage and fighting style are beautiful.EDIT 12/03/22:I've almost finished my first playthrough while trying to achieve 100% completion rate by completing all possible side quest, beating all bosses and dungeon/catacombs, and getting all legendary stuff. I must say the side quest given by npc you meet around the map are unique, some of them had a sad conclusion, some of them are wholesome, some will remain unknown and perhaps maybe appear in future DLC. Eventually you will experience a lot of things while doing their quest and its amazing.EDIT 13/03/22:I've finished the game today with only 3 achievements remaining to achieve, Elden Ring is definitely my favorite souls game as of today. 10/10!About frame rate, luckily i didn't have any performance issue since launch, so for my fellow tarnished one who experience it i hope you get another patch soon.For those who rate the game bad because of the difficulty and demand an EASY MODE which is ridiculous, there's a reason why ""souls-like"" genre exist and FromSoftware is the boss who made it big, even Demon's Souls are hard in the first place and that is their charm. If you're having a trouble beating some bosses, you can always travel to other area you haven't explore and try to level up your char and gear, this game means to be enjoyed not to be rushed. I also heard whining about adding a quest log, oh c'mon the game already show you what to do from the self-explanatory dialogue. If you want an easy & peaceful game then this is not for you, you can always refund a game if it doesn't suit your playstyle, just don't spread your hate to the others."

Positive,"tl;dr: Believe the hype: Elden Ring is a phenomenal game, possibly even the best soulsbourne yet. It has some stuttering and performance issues, so if you don't have patience to troubleshoot this stuff maybe wait until these issues get patched.Background if you care: I'm your average soulbourne enjoyer/masochist. I have enjoyed and finished most of the games at least a couple of times, though I am of pretty average skill and never did anything too crazy. I think Dark Souls has some of the best level and world design of all time, and is the golden standard by which I judge all similar games. I planned to do a blind playthrough of Elden Ring for my first time around, and other than watching the original trailer and a couple of Vaati lore videos I managed to avoid most media surrounding the game. Initially I was a bit skeptical about the open world aspect since I have less time on my hands these days and I'm honestly pretty tired of open world games. So my attitude going in was cautious optimism, because From Software make some of the best games out there.And From has pulled it off again - barring a few very obviously reused assets the world feels alive, believable, and memorable, and every location is a joy to explore. The combat is visceral and satisfying, the new lore is as rich and obtuse as ever, and almost every boss fight is a great spectacle (particularly the outdoor ones) that leave you breathless after winning. That wonderful dark souls rpg magic is alive and well in the world of Elden Ring. From have added some QoL improvements like shorter boss battle death runs, NPC summons to help the n00bs, the best horse in video games, and fast travel from the get-go (this was also in the last couple of games), making it easily the most accessible soulsbourne game to date and the perfect place to jump into the series. Difficulty is about on par with previous games, so it might take some patience to really ""get it"" but most people will get there with time. If you get really stuck, you can always summon a friend or two for some jolly cooperation!Where the game is clearly lacking is in performance; it looks pretty good but it runs quite poorly and frequently stutters even on a 5900X and a 3080 w/ latest drivers. The graphics options are barely passable for a PC port, but honestly in 2022 it is lazy and disrespectful for a AAA game to not support basic options like 21:9 resolutions, vsync toggles (seriously), G-SYNC/freesync, and at least one of the many supersampling techs out there. I expect most of these issues will be the ironed out in time, so I'm not too fussed. That being said, in my experience the core gameplay is basically bug-free, so for me the above problems can be overlooked when looking at the whole package. If the problems I've mentioned bother you a lot then I would recommend you wait until they patch the game."

Positive,"First off, let me state that ive never played a Dark Souls game before, id heard about them though never took the plunge.  If those games are anything like Elden Ring, I have seriously been missing out.  I bought the game after watching a trailer and the concepts all sounded like a fun time.  Turns out, that was an extreme understatement.  If you are like me and enjoy challenging games that make you feel like you have actually worked each victory, exploration and beautiful environments I can say with 100% faith that you will love this game.  My only negative is the multiplay co-op with friends.  Given how difficult some bosses are, its understood that you will die a lot, so having to re-queue each time you die is a bit tedious.  That is literally my only negative thing about this game.  I will now end this review with these final words.  ""Good Luck and Enjoy!"""

Positive,"This game is Miyazaki's magnum opus. If I were to liken it to how unprecedented its release was, I'd stipulate that it is this generation's 'Ocarina of Time.' After keeping up daily with any inkling of news I could find or scrounge up for the last 3 years, this game is everything I imagined it to be and more. The sheer scope of it is difficult to put into words, but there is a childlike sense of adventure that keeps me in a loop of ""okay, just oneeee more thing,"" Before I know it, 4 hours of saying exactly that go by. Please do yourself a favor and purchase this game. It's incredible."
Positive,"First I want to address the technical issues on pc, specifically how to fix them, update your goddamn graphics drivers my game went from unplayable to flawless on medium settings with a 1050 ti the devs already released a post saying this but apparently a lot of people haven't seen it so I thought I should mention itnow for my opinion, the game is great, as my first fromsoft game I was pretty worried about the difficulty and if I would be able to make the build I wanted but I'm glad to see that those worries were unfounded, the level of freedom and build customisation is second to none and the difficulty is just right in my opinion I can completely see why so many people love the genre and games I usually hate open world games but elden ring has been nothing but fun so far. Although it does feel pretty lazy to see that kb&m controls still just show controller prompts kb&m really got the short end of the stick with this one which is pretty sad to see from a huge AAA game. Overall a very enjoyable experience I would recommend to anyone even remotely interested in trying a souls game."

Positive,"Dynamic-link library (DLL) is Microsoft's implementation of the shared library concept in the Microsoft Windows and OS/2 operating systems. These libraries usually have the file extension DLL, OCX (for libraries containing ActiveX controls), or DRV (for legacy system drivers). The file formats for DLLs are the same as for Windows EXE files – that is, Portable Executable (PE) for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows, and New Executable (NE) for 16-bit Windows. As with EXEs, DLLs can contain code, data, and resources, in any combination.Data files with the same file format as a DLL, but with different file extensions and possibly containing only resource sections, can be called resource DLLs. Examples of such DLLs include icon libraries, sometimes having the extension ICL, and font files, having the extensions FON and FOT.The first versions of Microsoft Windows ran programs together in a single address space. Every program was meant to co-operate by yielding the CPU to other programs so that the graphical user interface (GUI) could multitask and be maximally responsive. All operating-system level operations were provided by the underlying operating system: MS-DOS. All higher-level services were provided by Windows Libraries ""Dynamic Link Library"". The Drawing API, Graphics Device Interface (GDI), was implemented in a DLL called GDI.EXE, the user interface in USER.EXE. These extra layers on top of DOS had to be shared across all running Windows programs, not just to enable Windows to work in a machine with less than a megabyte of RAM, but to enable the programs to co-operate with each other. The code in GDI needed to translate drawing commands to operations on specific devices. On the display, it had to manipulate pixels in the frame buffer. When drawing to a printer, the API calls had to be transformed into requests to a printer. Although it could have been possible to provide hard-coded support for a limited set of devices (like the Color Graphics Adapter display, the HP LaserJet Printer Command Language), Microsoft chose a different approach. GDI would work by loading different pieces of code, called ""device drivers"", to work with different output devices.The same architectural concept that allowed GDI to load different device drivers is that which allowed the Windows shell to load different Windows programs, and for these programs to invoke API calls from the shared USER and GDI libraries. That concept was ""dynamic linking"".In a conventional non-shared static library, sections of code are simply added to the calling program when its executable is built at the ""linking"" phase; if two programs call the same routine, the routine is included in both the programs during the linking stage of the two. With dynamic linking, shared code is placed into a single, separate file. The programs that call this file are connected to it at run time, with the operating system (or, in the case of early versions of Windows, the OS-extension), performing the binding.For those early versions of Windows (1.0 to 3.11), the DLLs were the foundation for the entire GUI. As such, display drivers were merely DLLs with a .DRV extension that provided custom implementations of the same drawing API through a unified device driver interface (DDI), and the Drawing (GDI) and GUI (USER) APIs were merely the function calls exported by the GDI and USER, system DLLs with .EXE extension.This notion of building up the operating system from a collection of dynamically loaded libraries is a core concept of Windows that persists as of 2015. DLLs provide the standard benefits of shared libraries, such as modularity. Modularity allows changes to be made to code and data in a single self-contained DLL shared by several applications without any change to the applications themselves.Another benefit of modularity is the use of generic interfaces for plug-ins. A single interface may be developed which allows old as well as new modules to be integrated seamlessly at run-time into pre-existing applications, without any modification to the application itself. This concept of dynamic extensibility is taken to the extreme with the Component Object Model, the underpinnings of ActiveX.In Windows 1.x, 2.x and 3.x, all Windows applications shared the same address space as well as the same memory. A DLL was only loaded once into this address space; from then on, all programs using the library accessed it. The library's data was shared across all the programs. This could be used as an indirect form of inter-process communication, or it could accidentally corrupt the different programs. With the introduction of 32-bit libraries in Windows 95, every process ran in its own address space. While the DLL code may be shared, the data is private except where shared data is explicitly requested by the library. That said, large swathes of Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows Me were built from 16-bit libraries, which limited the performance of the Pentium Pro microprocessor when launched, and ultimately limited the stability and scalability of the DOS-based versions of Windows.Although DLLs are the core of the Windows architecture, they have several drawbacks, collectively called ""DLL hell"". As of 2015 Microsoft promotes .NET Framework as one solution to the problems of DLL hell, although they now promote virtualization-based solutions such as Microsoft Virtual PC and Microsoft Application Virtualization, because they offer superior isolation between applications. An alternative mitigating solution to DLL hell has been to implement side-by-side assembly.this was edited for the 2022 game awards badge"

Positive,"I have been depressed my whole time playing, but it was fun"
Positive,"Hoo boy... I've put another playthrough in since I wrote this review, and I suppose now that that's official, I'll change this from a ""somewhat not recommended"" to a ""somewhat recommended.""This game, contrary to a lot of reviews I've seen who say otherwise due to a wealth of repeated content, greatly benefits from a replay IMHO. You'll know the game and its mechanics better, have a better idea of what sort of BS to expect from the bosses, and most importantly, know how to deal with it. On top of which, there's been some balance changes and stability improvements in updates since I first posted this review, which bring it much closer to where it should've been at launch.There's still a few issues that keep it from being a full recommendation though... most of the endgame bosses, and a few of the optional ones, are grossly, for lack of a better word, ""overtuned,"" even when you DO know what you're doing (for more detail on that, see below). Also the game can't quite seem to decide whether it wants to encourage experimentation or not... there's TONS of options for combat, but you can only max out a few of them, and you can only respec your character a limited number of times.Still, I have to admit, if the problem is mainly just with the endgame once you know what you're doing, that shouldn't be enough to bring an entire game down. This is a great game for sure... but know what you're getting into. This might be the most readily accessible From Software game, no argument there, this one isn't going to beat you senseless right out the gate if you don't mesh with it like the older games will, but accessible DOES NOT = easiest. Far from it.But overall, if you want a gigantic and gorgeous open world to explore with a pretty good backstory and some memorable characters, plus mostly great combat, and lots of exploration in grinding, then yeah, this is probably one of the best open world style games out there. Not THE best IMHO, that's still Zelda: Breath of the Wild, but it's up there.Anyhoo, rest of this review is my negative review as I originally wrote it. Even though I'm changing to a thumbs up, I still think it's important to acknowledge the flaws this game has, as it's not like they suddenly went away (I just got better at dealing with them), plus it'll probably explain to a lot of you why I got so many jester rewards :P****I kinda wish there was a neutral button. This is a mostly good game, but it has one absolutely massive issue that can ruin it. The bosses.Speaking as someone who beat Demon's Souls, Dark Souls I - III, all of DSI and III's DLC, Bloodborne and it's DLC, and Sekiro... this game's bosses are absolute BS. Massive AOE attacks that are random and nearly impossible to dodge? This game has that. Bosses who do combos longer than a Hobbit + Lord of the Rings marathon, end in an explosion (which might both deal direct damage AND cause a status effect that you WILL care about), and can punish your attempts to hit their openings AND can move seamlessly between combos? Yep, here too. Bosses in arenas that don't match the boss' size and movesets? *nods* Bosses that can flat out ignore your shield AND rolling and still do damage to you? Uh huh. Grab attacks that were getting tiresome even in older From Software titles? Here. Bosses that are so large the camera can't handle them EVEN IF YOU DISABLE LOCK ON and know what you're doing? You guessed it!Yes the world is large, gorgeous, and fun to explore when bosses aren't involved. Yes not ALL of the bosses are like this. Yes there's some decent lore underneath it all, as usual. Yes this game will last you an extremely long time (I have 123 hours in it as of writing this, and I haven't even finished it, though I'm close to the end in Crumbling Farum Azula).But there's too many bosses that ARE like this for me to recommend this game. This is a problem because there's only ever three solutions, and none of them are engaging or fun:1. Grind until you can pass the boss like it's a DPS/stat check.2. Play as a ranged attacker and use Ash summons (and yes I DID start using summons after a while once I realized yes some parts of the game are balanced around it, so I don't wanna hear that ""I didn't make use of all the game mechanics"" crap).3. Git gud with extremely tedious, drawn out tactics that make the fight last far too long (in a game with literally hundreds of bosses).And sometimes you need to do all three.Yes you can technically ""git gud"" still. The difference is, unlike the other games in this series that MADE me WANT to get good, I don't want to here. Until Elden Ring, there were maybe enough BS bosses in all of From's catalog to count on one hand, like Bed of Chaos, or Oceiros (and the latter isn't even technically mandatory). This game has almost nothing but BS bosses, and yes some are mandatory, especially near the end. It just got to the point where, no matter how much I enjoyed exploring the world and fighting the regular enemies (some of which are quite challenging in their own right), I know these BS bosses are always waiting for me at the end of the path, so why bother.That said, if you're more masochistic than I am, and none of this sounds like it'd bother you, it might be worth checking out for the game's other aspects, most of which are quite good. But I can't in good conscience recommend this game. Play literally any other From Software soulslike game instead."

Positive,What can be said about Elden Ring that hasn't already been said? It's a monumental achievement in gaming the likes of which is rarely seen. The kind of game that comes around once in a decade if we are lucky.
Positive,"you get to ride a ghost-cow-horse, a turtle is the pope, you die constantly. every item has an entire bible of lore in its description. sheep curl up into balls and roll away when frightened. players write little strange poems to each other on the ground. gotta say, it's pretty fun. use a controller though, the keyboard/mouse will cause you pain."
Positive,"Pros:- Try finger, but hole- Gorgeous view ahead- Try jumping- Horse ahead- Love, O love- Seek dung- Treasure ahead- Hidden path ahead- Why is it always liar?This is the first FromSoft game that I have ever played. I bought all of the Dark Souls games on a whim when they were on sale, booted up Dark Souls, and then decided ""fuck this"" and didn't play it. With Elden Ring's release, I decided to start from the very end of the studio's productions and then backtrack my way through the rest of the games. It's incredible how much I have learned about trying to dodge swings from massive enemies that take five million moments to go off.Elden Ring is gorgeous. There are such sharp shifts in aesthetic and atmosphere between zones that you can't help but feel you've walked into a different game with each switch. The soundtrack is incredible and matches the tone of the game perfectly. From what I understand, the Souls games don't typically have such straight forward lore presented to the players, but the story is cohesive while being open to interpretation. You can make a monstrous evil frog to butt smash enemies to death with or a beautiful mage with the power of God and anime on her side to annihilate bosses with a death beam. The build options you have are through the roof. You can literally play this game in whatever way you want.All of the main story bosses I have seen so far have had their own recognizable, characteristic music, look and flair that makes them memorable and fun to fight. Margit beat me with his old man cane and taught me that I should probably roll into his strikes and not away from them. Godrick decided ""actually, I'm dragon now"" and ate me after grafting a lizard to his arm. I got my ass kicked by Radahn more times than I want to admit before I decided to stop getting hit by a meteor and get good. Mohg really did nihil me. I'm on my way to Morgott now and can only assume that he's going to beat my ass.I love this game.Cons:- A lot of the mini-bosses are recycled. The layout of the catacombs that they are hiding in are as well. This isn't a major thing, but I found myself wishing that there were more unique bosses outside of what was included. - There were a lot of major graphical glitches at launch. I waited for patches, but enemies (and Torrent) are still sporadically disappearing despite having a pretty powerful set up. I'm surprised that they haven't released a fix for this. There are mods available on Nexus that do, but you'll end up banned if you try to fix it using the one that works.- WHY DID I HAVE TO KILL BLAIDD ;u;Overall, it's an incredible game. I usually veer away from spending $60 on any game just based on the amount of hours that I'll get out of it. I'm 116-ish hours into the game right now and haven't even touched some of the major bosses coming up. I've spent all of my time hunting down mini bosses, doing quests, exploring the map, and looking for treasure. The amount of love and dedication that the studio put into this open-world game is awe-inspiring. I'll probably do it all over again."

""How tf am I going to beat this?"" is what you will think about most while playing.In the end, Elden Ring is just like life: however simple thou are as a Tarnished, scream like the barbarian Hoarah Loux, fight like Malenia, endure like Radahn (and love like he loved his horse Leonard), think like Miquella, give it all like Rykard, graft your way to power like Godrick, seize the throne like Morgott, try the impossible like Mohg and die like Godwyn. Never give up!I can already imagine The Game Awards... ""And the game of the year is... ELDEN RING!""Orchestra: PAN PAAAAAAANNN!!!! *menu theme*I look forward to it.Edit: Looks like I was right. Exactly as I imagined."
Positive,"After playing 9 hours of Elden Ring, I am going to give it a thumbs up. Despite the horrible performance issues, I'm not really getting great performance on a 3070 paired with a 10700k and 32gb 3600mhz ram. This game is at its core a Dark Souls game, I've thoroughly enjoyed exploring Limgrave and the surrounding area and I think it does a good job of combining aspects from Sekiro and Dark Souls. The addition of a mount is cool although a lot of the time I just find myself running on foot exploring the area anyway.Would I recommend this to your average open world game enjoyer? Possibly not based on the fact that this is quite a punishing game for anyone who doesn't have the patience to repeat certain areas a few times until you get that satisfying W and get to where you need to go.I don't think I'm anywhere close to finishing this game, but so far I'm having a blast being someone who is a big fan of the soulsborne series. There are even some Dark Souls cameos that make an appearance.Overall thumbs up and it's a great game but it needs a lot of polish in terms of optimising. Also for anyone looking to purchase this, it is locked at 60fps so keep that in mind."
Positive,"It's close to a master piece but the hype gave me the impression it's going to be one.Hopefully DLC and updates will bring fortune(pvp,characters bugfixes etc). While the lore is good, It doesn't help that the Dark Souls Lore is better overall."
Positive,"""Between the Erdtree and it's shadow only I am the honored one"" said Rellana before fusing the Moon of Ranni and the Moon of Rennala into a single powerfull attack. And so the tarnished asked to its mimic tear ""Can you tank it?"", at this question the mimic tear turned to face his summoner before saying ""If I'll get hit by both the moons and Rellana I could have a little trouble"", ""But would you die?"", ""Nah, I'd Tank!"""
Positive,First things first.......You will die.......A LOT!!!   With that said............ Amazing truly amazing.  The world gets bigger and bigger as you explore.  secret upon secret upon secret.  I found a big fat boss who not only rolled over me but then proceeded to butt slam me to death.  10/10.  Would be butt slammed to death by fat man again and again.   Oh.....side note.... do try and speak to everyone.  I had a wonderful quest line that took me to huge new areas in the game that I had no idea existed.  The rewards for the side quests are also well worth the effort.Ever wanted new friends?  This game is for you.....You can collect different lovely spirits to summon to help you along your journey.   My new best friend is my Jellyfish.  :)  He truly is the toughest jellyfish I have ever met.  I owe my many lives saved to him.Get this game.  You will not be disappointed.  It is a once in a very long time a game like this comes along that truly is spectacular.I am very much looking forward to any expansions that come out because this game is that amazing.
Positive,"For anyone who never played FromSoftware's game before. If you prefer combat over environment and the variety of weapon, skill then Elden Ring is the way to go. On the other hand, if you just want relaxing, want less punishing game, then Elden Ring may be not for you.Don't be afraid, Elden Ring is not that hard. It's more like challenge, and there are many things that make your process easier. Elden Ring is a heavily combat-focus, and high punishing game. Of course there are story, lore, etc but that's not what people come to Elden Ring for.TL, DR:You should try it if:+You like combat-focus gameplay+You want a variety of builds so that you can play it over and over again+You want a game with high punish so that it's not too ezYou should not try it if:+You want a story-rich game+You prefer enjoying environment over combat+You want a relax gameplay, not challenging"
Positive,"solid game, very enjoyable and worth your time. I write this review after beating the game twice with one character, and a third time with a second character using a different build. I also have all achievements which tells you that I like this game enough to do that.As much as I like the game, some of the late game bosses are just not fun.I'm a big souls fan, and have played and beaten each and every souls title including DeS and BB, and this is the first game in which there are bosses that are just not good. Defeating these cheeselords doesn't make you feel like you overcame adversity with your own skill and knowledge, it makes you feel either very lucky that you didn't get hit with a 20 second long combo with giant aoes and teleporting sweep attacks, or very mildly happy that you just cheesed the boss with a mimic tear and a moonveil + 10. I don't think the game is 'too hard', just that it literally is not fun for me to fight some of the endgame bosses. I'm hoping that there are some balance patches to address some of the balance issues present in the game, hopefully a few bosses get some tuning, and hopefully moonveil gets a much needed damage reduction because holy shit why use anything else as an int build when you can one shot invaders lol"

Positive,"The number of spoilt kids complaining about lack of Ultra-Wide Support alone is enough for a good review.But seriously: rich, expansive world; variety of viable play-styles; interesting and self-motivated characters; amazing visually; and whilst a lot of the dungeon bosses lack inspiration, the mainline bosses are some of the most memorable in the series. The online multiplayer is a lil janky as always, and preventing itself from the vast potential the PvP actually has to offer; as well as some balancing issues, but otherwise a lot of fun. Elden Ring is a great addition to the franchise (:"
Positive,"Very early Review!Loving the game so far.. It's the perfect mix of Dark Souls and an open World setting, with lots of new mechanics that fit this type of game perfectly.Although I have to mention that there are some occasional stutters and frame drops in the open world, these don't really bother me as of now.    EDIT:With the new patches that just came in, I did not experience any more stutters and frame drops.EDIT EDIT:I don't know man... I think I just found my all-time favourite game :')"
Positive,I haven't been this obsessed with a game since Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind.
Positive,Biggus Dickus approves.
Positive,BIG dark souls
Positive,Why is it always dog?Thank you Bill Clinton for this amazing experience i cant believe they added him into the game
Positive,"I'm not a Souls player, but this game is a contender for my favorite RPG of all time. The story is good, there is a great amount of depth in the weapons, armor, skills, summons and other elements of the game. The world is massive but I never thought that it was too big and there's new things to find around every corner. I honestly enjoyed this game so much that as soon as I beat it, I started a NG+.Highly recommended if you're into these types of games or if you're looking for something new and exciting."
Positive,"I’ve absolutely enjoyed my time with Elden Ring, and while I’d say my expectations were high prior to playing the game, those expectations have certainly been met or even exceeded along my journey. It feels like a culmination of everything FromSoftware has accomplished in the genre so far, offering up a robust world with tons of exploration married to the unique combat we’ve come to expect from their previous titles. I can’t necessarily say that there’s enough changes here that will appeal to people who have bounced off of Souls games previously, but it’s such a great looking (and playing) game that I think if you enjoy action-RPG’s in the slightest that it’s still worth a shot. And of course if you’re already a FromSoftware fan, then I’d imagine you’re already on board, and I can safely say that you won’t be disappointed."
Positive,"My first time playing a a FromSoftware game. Amazing game. Really love the open world and gameplay. Absolutely breathtaking vistas, I could spend all day (and have) exploring the world. Combat and bosses can be difficult. You will and should be afraid of every new encounter, but learning and mastering them is what makes the game so satisfying. I can't recall the last time I screamed in joy at simply beating a boss in a video game but here, every victory is a celebration. Can call it now that this will be a top contender for top game of 2022. Bottom line, if you've never played a FromSoftware game like me- do yourself a favor and play Elden Ring. I would recommend you do so as blind as possible if you can. You will not regret the once in a lifetime experience it will give you. As a gamer, this is not an experience you should miss."
Positive,"If you're a fan of immersive RPGs, Elden Ring is an absolute gem that you won't want to miss. It's a game that redefines what it means to be a hero, granting you the power to shape your own destiny. I guarantee that you'll be hooked from the very first playthrough. So, do yourself a favor and get ready to embark on an unforgettable adventure. Trust me, it's worth every penny!"
Positive,"Elden Ring has been one of my favorite games since Skyrim for single player. I didn't think the ""Dark Souls"" series was for me, but after watching several videos on ""tips and tricks"" for the game, it became much more manageable as far as dodging, parrying, item collection, and difficulty. The world seems to invite you in to explore more, and jump into new and original situations."
Positive,"VERY GOOD GAME, MALENIA GOES SLASH SLASH SLASH ME GO CIRCLE AROUND, DODGE DODGE, ROLL INTO HER, FAKE CHALLENGE AND THEN DOUBLE BONKERS GO WONKERS! 10/10 NG+17"
Positive,"This is the first game i pre-order in my whole life , and let me tell you , IT WAS WORTH IT , so happy with the Experience ,IT was a blast, You might doubt yourself , hate yourself , and think that you should quit because you can't kill a boss , or an enemy killed u in the dumbest way , But at the end everything becomes beautiful memory , that you talk about it with your friends !!! LOVE IT"
Positive,"What can i say except YES. THE GAME IS AWESOME! The feeling i get when i play it, is like i turned back in time and played my first game on a PC as a little kid. The atmosphere, the music, the colours, the visuals, the story(so far) are incredible. I LOVE THE FEELING I GET WHEN I PLAY IT. I can obviously recommend it. It will be kinda hard for beginners or newcomers to the Souls-like genre but in my opinion its worth it.I hope you enjoy the game as match as i do and find the review helpful."
Positive,"So far...Beautiful.and doesn't run that badly for a that just released, even though people are complaining about the optimisation with my old out dated card (1070ti) i can run it on high setting 1440p at 60 most of the time, yes there is slight stutters but that doesn't ruin the game in any capacity.i have not beat the game yet though if the game stays this great later on then this is definitely a worth it game!Edited: new pc it runs fine"
Positive,"Elden Ring is a phenomenal game but it's hard to look over the hurdles I had to overcome in order to fully enjoy this game.Gameplay: The initial 20 hours of this game were tolerable at best. The first area is too dense for it's own good, filled with the most amount of copy and paste catacombs/caves, containing useless loot 90% of the time. I felt as if my thorough exploration wasn't appropriately rewarded. While this problem persisted throughout my 80 hour play through, it became far less egregious as the filler content became far and few between with an increase in more intricate world and level design.The game truly opens up after you conquer the first legacy dungeon. Suddenly, most of the gear actually becomes useful, and it was refreshing to finally swap weapons 20 hours into the game. This gameplay loop of exploring, killing bosses and looting never got tiresome, because the game gives plenty of opportunities for experimentation and trying new things. Despite the abundance of reused enemies, it was still fun to tackle them with a different strategy.Story: Like every other souls game, the devs didn't bother to explicitly tell me what was going on so I responded by not bothering to pay any attention to the story. The cutscenes and voice acting were cool though.Difficulty: Enemies are extremely aggressive and fast, making these some of the most brutal battles in the series. However, the late games bosses are the definition of artificial difficulty.Overall 9/10"
Positive,"My review page.  Follow me on twitch![www.twitch.tv] Dark Souls 4....err I mean Elden Ring is a culmination of all Dark Souls games placed in one package and settled in one big open-world map but is it as amazing as many claim it is? Not really. 👍 The good parts:+One of the best open-world designs.+The soundtrack+The combat👎The bad parts:-Technically it's garbage.-Nothing new in regards to, almost everything it offers.-Story was some pointless obtuse garbage.What the f did George R. R. Martin even write in this game? There's no difference in the way the lore/story or whatever this nonsense you want to call offers versus what we previously had in souls games. I was hoping at the very least something more detailed, something with a bit more depth, fleshed-out characters, anything really but sadly none of that is in the game. So what's the story about? Well, you can literally swap any mention of the word ring with flame and you have the Dark Souls 3 story. At its core, it is the same sh*t we received plenty of times already. You're some weak-ass dude and you have to become the lord of cinder...oh sorry I meant rings by slaying the previous lords. You get some side-quests here and there, without any kind of information, randomly showing up, and if you do them, you might get a different 10-second ending that talks about nonsense and nothing you care about. I did the entire Ranni quest and I would advise everyone to do it as well because while it feels and acts as a secondary it's probably the only one that makes some sense out of all and feels like a main quest besides the fact that it takes you in a ton of places you will miss, which compose practically 30% of the game.I wished and hoped with Elden Ring that they'd learn from previous games, that story is just as important in games but how could they learn when critics and ignorant fans blindly overrate the series? At the end of the day, if you don't care about luls and memes, there won't be any characters to care about and no good coherent emotional/amazing story. It has lore and some random words and that's it. Even the item/world-build lore took a nose-dive. Not a fan.Story rating: 6/10So let's talk about the bread and butter of FromSoftware games, the gameplay. Straight to the point, if this is your first game in the series then I wish I was in your place cause you'll be in one hell of a ride, literally and figurately. If you're not new and have played any of the previous games or all of them as I did, well, there's nothing new in the game, besides a cool double-jumping horse. That being said, this review is from someone who has played the games and how I feel about it, not how the game is as a stand-alone/unique experience. The core of Elden Ring is as I mentioned the combat, the gameplay, the exploration, the items, and the boss fights. The combat is exactly the same as all the other Dark Souls, with nothing new added to the mix. All the items, all the bosses, all the enemies are just variations of previous ones. It's shocking how From gets away with re-using stuff while other companies get destroyed for it. It gets worse, as the game moved on to an open-world design, naturally it suffers from repetitiveness and will get tedious if you bother doing all the game has to offer. I'll talk more in the tech aspect of the game about the world itself but suffice to say, you'll be fighting the same bosses a lot of times, visiting the same places over and over with little variation. Basically, most of the secondary stuff with a few exceptions are boring as hell. Actually, most of the areas except the main ones are just filler sh*t. The game did not need to be open-world but enough about that for now. To counter the criticism about its difficulty, From made the game easier by adding a summon mechanic, which I also used. You obviously don't have to but don't let anyone persuade you that it's ""wrong"" to do it. These people are the same ones playing Sorc class that two-shot bosses from afar or use overpowered stats/weapons that the series are known for so just ignore these idiots and play as you wish. They designed the later bosses with summoning in mind anyway. So yeah, the game is now less of a niche and more of a welcoming party but don't get me wrong, it is still Dark Souls but with a different skin, and as such there's going to be a ton of obscure and hard challenges ahead. The weapons, the armors are all great as was always the case, tho some are better than the others. Combat is still incredibly satisfying though not even close to Sekiro. You have the freedom to approach the zone and enemies any way you want and at the very least I do have to commend From for inventing this great combat formula. I just wish they'd improve it more and more instead of just re-using it. As always some bosses are well designed some are not and overall there's really not much else to say from a ""fans"" point of view in regards to its gameplay. It's samey but still good but I wish it did more. The horse is cool but fighting from it is not. Gameplay rating: 8/10Not much to say here, except that the soundtrack is still similar to the other games with epic orchestra in fights and sublime chilling everywhere else. It's great but again, exactly the same as previous games. The voice acting is bad. They have not improved an ounce in this regard and as for all the other sound effects, such as combat and atmospheric ones they are straight out of Dark Souls so take that as you will. Audio rating: 7.5/10And now onto the second most important thing in a Dark Souls game, the atmosphere, level design that FromSoftware is known for. Let me be real here, whoever designs their levels in the team, needs a fking statue. Yes, as I mentioned in the gameplay aspect, there are a lot of repetitive areas and a lot of imported and changed locations from previous games but the way they are connected to one another and how the world is just so overwhelmingly well designed and intricate with huge labyrinth-like cities and underground zones is still freaking insane. Incredible use of inter-connected main areas and verticality. Bravo to the level designers. Sadly it's not all perfect and as with all open-world games, FromSoftware can not escape the tedious/repetitiveness that comes with the territory and you will have to go through a lot of repetitive mines and catacombs and boring secondary areas. Artistically the game is beautiful and there are a lot of incredibly looking zones but when it comes to its actual technical stuff, the game is a piece of garbage. It feels stuck 10 years in the past, textures are ugly, characters are ugly, very weak lighting and shadowing, and on top of all that the game is unable to maintain 60 fps on any kind of system. I'm shocked everything is holding together and not taking fire. There are a ton of frame drops especially in boss fights when they use special effects, loads of stutters, loads of crashes, it's just very bad. The level design is all that keeps the game together on a technical level and if I would've rated the game based on just that it would be a 9 but sadly I do have to add that 5 from the technical stuff so you can do the math. Graphics, performance and tech analysis score: 7/10The tl;dr of it is, if you've played previous souls games, lower your expectations if you have common sense and not just a blind consumer that drinks critic score cool-aid. It's a good game but it's just more Dark Souls. If you're new, then you will most likely love the game a lot more. As for both parties, be wary of the technical issues and frame-drops that will never get fixed."
Positive,"Pros:- Excellent gameplay- Good visuals- Good sound- AoW and spells actually look really cool- More accessible than previous gamesCons:- Side areas are mostly non-optional and mostly boring- Some performance issues in certain locations (especially in the DLC)- Boss move sets are more nonsensical than ever before, delayed attacks and tracking attacks are heavily abused by the devsOverall, a great game. One of my all-time favourites."
Positive,"The game is beautiful. The best thing they added was the horse and even better you can fight while riding it. The only issue I have is that the game keeps crashing at random moments. I still don't know if it's a process on my PC causing me this issue. If anyone had experienced this and fixed it, please let me know.Overall, the game is what I was expecting to be. A master piece."
Positive,"I don't need to play much longer to give a reviewI got close to 400 hours on dark souls 3close to 100 for dark souls 2over 100 for dark souls 140 for sekiroand easily over 900 on bloodborne.I can tell this is fromsoft's hardest and best game yet, which kinda says a lot cuz, sure ds1, 2, and 3 are all easy, sekiro too, however, Elden ring alongside bloodborne is the only one where the first boss would kill youYeah this slaps man"
Positive,"If you sit through cutscenes in co-op in any fromsoft game, I will disconnect myself from your world quicker than ur dad disconnected from ur life. I want rune arcs, not lore explanations for things."

Positive,Your ‘friends’ constantly pray on your downfall Every build is a crutchFight your demons and lose10/10 love this game
Positive,"Elden Ring is one of those games that you just need to play at least once in your life. It's probably the closest to an actual work of art mixed in with a combo of some of FromSoft's previous games.The game's music and art direction is so perfect for the setting being presented, and felt incredibly immersive for me. The music feels as though it belongs in a movie with how dramatic and beautiful it sounds. Probably the best in FromSoft's lineup of games in my opinion. Elden Ring's art direction is also phenomenal in about every way. The only gripe I have about it, although it may be just my own opinion, is that some parts and areas get a tad redundant and some parts recycle enemies and ideas from other sections, but it's not enough to say it's bad. Open world in the game is also pretty interesting and does a decent job making sure the player always has something to do, and of course has some of the best vistas I've seen in a game. Honestly I took a little too many screenshots it's so good lmao. Seeing parts of the map that I couldn't get to made me explore looking for ways to get to where I wanted/needed to go, and rather than just being a straight shot to my destination, the game always threw a number of different things that would get me sidetracked and I'd end up going on like three other whole little adventures before doing what I set out to do. It's very good for an open world.The gameplay, I think, is a great combo of Dark Souls, Bloodbourn, and even Sekiro thrown in. FromSoft seems as though they wanted to bring the best of their older games into one, and did that they did. It really opens up the world for exploration, brings out the most interesting combat to always keep you on your toes, and has amazing locations that allow for exploration so you can find different paths through the area with many goodies to find. The story is about as insane as you'd expect. It's FromSoft.The game's insanely good, if you're reading this just thinking about getting the game just get it. Don't think about it, just get it and enjoy it. Trust."

Positive,"Let's face it - this is one of the best games of the decade. I spent 150+ hr fighting bosses, goofing around with my friends, and invading other players. And I still haven't started experimenting with other builds.For those who haven't played Soulsborne games before, this is the most polished experience by far. The game follows the standard Soulsbourne formula, but in a new settings and with some refreshing additions (jumping, open world+horse, great runes, ashes of war, spirit remnants... the list goes on)The game is challenging and punishing, but only if you let it. Due to the open world, and all the content it brings, you always have options to explore different areas if you are stuck on a hard encounter. You can truly pick your battles.The Main Issue I have is the game stability and network connections on PC. After a month after release, the game still freezes, sometimes temporarily, and sometimes it crashes. Networks are very unstable. Some friends you can invite fine, some will disconnect instantly, or even worse, during a boss fight. That being said, I recommend this game fully. It's a 10/10 Soulsborne experience, 60$ well spent!"
Positive,"Everything about this game is so amazing and beautiful. You find surprises in every corner and the game rewards you for exploration. The music in sync with the bosses and perfectly immerses you in this astonishing world building. The art is gorgeous, every time I find myself taking screenshots and gasping at the beautiful compositions found in this game. Truly the game play is where this game shines the most, it feels so rewarding to defeat a boss you have been grinding for hours. At the end it really makes you feel so powerful (until you find a tiny dude that one-shots you in the next area and it is back to the grind). If you do enjoy the grind and a challenging game, try it out, you won't regret it at all. I honestly can easily say this is one of my top 5 games of all time, completely worth it.Masterpiece, 10/10."
Positive,An Undead favourite.

Positive,Great starting game to play souls like game. Game of the year worthy
Positive,"Great game. I can't believe how easily I've sunk so many hours into the game. I'm close to the ending of my first playthrough, and I think I have a grip on things that are done well and things that irked me.Good:- It's stunning. Every area I visit is beautiful with amazing views.- Very free and broad gameplay. You can play how you want and it will probably work. If you want to switch things up there are a multitude of ways to do so and enjoy different weapons and builds.- Uniqueness. Areas might have some recurring enemies, but it's mostly new, unique, and cool enemies you encounter.- Audio. The music and sounds are just great. Sad to see it's not on Spotify yet.- Story. As a typical FromSoftware game, the story is deep and somewhat obscured. There is a clear narrative, and a multitude of characters that you can meet and help along the way. Going into this game blind is great fun for what you can find and discover.- FREEDOM. The biggest one is that it's open world. In comparison to previous games you can just go somewhere else. In for example Dark Souls: if you're stuck on a boss, you could very well be stuck in the whole game and story. Not in Elden Ring. You can keep bashing your head against the wall hoping it breaks, but just as well you just turn around and go explore somewhere else. This is by far the best thing that keeps you going.Bad:- Bosses and camera. Some bosses are difficult not because of what they can do, but because the camera and targeting screws you over. It's very hard to adjust and if you die to something like this you don't feel bested, but cheated. Luckily this is more an outlier than the norm.- Boss mechanics. Normally it is all about GITTING GUD, but there are a few bosses that feel as if the developers were like ''let's make it hard by increasing the numbers, not by adding to the fight''. It's okay for a boss or two, but it can be aggrevating to see a boss that has unreasonable health, hoping that you fail once so it can kill you instantly. Leveling up helps somewhat, but there are still a few bosses that feel disproportionately beefy and damaging.- Lacking direction. I love how immersive every part of the story is, but there is a caviat to it. Sometimes you talk to an NPC and they tell you where to go, but it's a far off destination and goal or you've never heard of it. A few hours later into the game you have no idea where they said to go, and there is no way of recalling what they said. You're forced to search it up or hope that you stumble upon it by chance. I wouldn't want a journal quest marker thing at all, but for example a journal with one line per character would help keep track of what you've encountered.Overall this game is a near 10/10. Giving it a 9 would be too low, but a 10 would mean nothing could be improved upon so let's give it a 9.5/10! Give it a try if you're unsure, just remember that it is not Skyrim. This is a FromSoftware game, expect to die and fail at every turn and relish in overcoming it."
Positive,One of the most exciting things is that I can jump!!!!!
Positive,"Behold, Elden Ring!"
Positive,"Please fix the multiplayer co-op. Constantly getting disconnected from friend world within a few minute. It's getting annoying now. me and my friends playing together. Sometimes I got disconnected, sometime my other friend got disconnected without a reason. Just said ""Connection occurred error returning to your world"" eventhough all of us have no problem with internet connections. I read Reddit comments and it seems many people encountered this problem. So..Please fix it. Other than that the game is great."
Positive,"There are so many qualities and aspects in this game to unfold in this review, so therefore i will be splitting my review into categories, as I have a habit of doing.My categories are the following:Positives:Negatives:Things to improve:Conclusion:Positives:-Open World. This game is absolutely the single greatest open-world game that I have ever played. The map feels massive with every area having a different atmosphere and being unique. Every location you explore brings new mobs and interesting secrets, that are very rewarding to uncover. Open world Dark Souls truly is one of the best games to ever be made. -Graphics. While the graphics in this game aren't a masterpiece, they certainly don't dissapoint. I think this was done because the game is intended to be played on many platforms, such as more previous generation consoles like the PS4. The graphics in this game are comparable to Dark Souls 3 but I do feel they have improved. -Boss/mob designThe boss and mob designs in this game are phenomenal. Every enemy you encounter on your journey has a different look and feel prior to the enemy you fought before. The designs are so unique, especially boss designs. Some bosses are repeated, but this is to be expected when the game has 83 bosses. All in all, the bosses in this game are super cool and it feels very refreshing when fighting each one, because of their unique design.-Weapon designThere are so many weapons to use in this game. Every weapon you pick up has a distinctive ability and most of the weapons can be used effectively with the right build. My only complaint with the weapon system is how redundant bows and crossbows are. They shouldn't be powerful, but they are essentially rendered useless in most fights. Overall, the weapons are all refreshing and look very cool.-NPC'sThe NPC's you encounter in the game all have different viewpoints and goals. They all have their own goals in this world you tread and they all have depth to their character. You ucover their intentions and goals through their questlines, where you learn about the origins of the world. Different questlines also lead to different endings, which I find to be a cool mechanic in a video game. Negatives:-Navigation.Navigating the open world in itself isn't an issue. You have a map where different sites you visit are marked. However, navigating questlines is rather unpleasent. Usually, the quest givers give you little to no direction of where you need to go. They end their dialogue with some weird metaphorical sentence, and then you need to find out where you need to go in a 79 Square Km map. It's frustrating because it essentially forces you to look up a quest guide for most quests, because it's very confusing when quests are given.-Fps drops.The PC port of this game doesn't seem thoroughlly optimized for most people. I for instance have a 2080 ti strix. Struggling to keep u with 40fps when entering a new area is really frustrating. I have also died to fps spikes when first entering a boss fight. I hope this will be patched in the future, but for now I will leave it here in the review.Things to improve:-Story.I don't want them to improve the story itself, the lore is great. However, I would like an improvement in the understanding of the world for each individual, without having to look up information or sources that someone used hours to find. This isn't a negative, because if you invest time you can find out the story itself. It just feels as if the story is hidden in the game.-Some bosses.Some bosses have poor designs mechanic wise. They're not necessarily hard to fight, just frustrating because you fight your camera angle rather than the boss. I can't mention any bosses here without spoiling, so I'll just say that the bigger bosses tend to be the ones that mechanically sucks. As well as your camera being an enemy in those fights.-Locked questlines/characters.Doing things in the wrong order in this game locks you out of different parts and items of the world. It's immersive this way, until it isn't. For instance, if you don't talk to someone at the Roundtable Hold after defeating a certain boss, there is a certain important item you won't get. This item is imperative if you want to do any pvp. If you then move onto the next boss, it locks you out of getting that item until you start your ng+. That's bad game design. Conclusion:Elden Ring is a revolutionary step in the Open-World genre of games. It has set a new standard when it comes to world design and size. Everything in the game is absolutely stunning. The lore/story of this game is very intriguing. I have very little issues with the game and those I have stated above, however there are quite a lot of things I wish for them to improve.If you appreciate lore filled, beautiful games, polished to the maximum with some hard difficulty peppered in there, this game is right for you."
Positive,"This is my first souls game. My first impression was that it was beautiful. One of the big reasons I've never played a souls game is just... I don't love dark atmospheres, where it's grayscale, dark, poison/ooze/swamp/dark castle 24/7. Bleak. But this game has both beautiful and dark and scary environments. I'm loving the combat, it is hard, it is punishing, but it's fun. The sheer variety of builds, weapons, magic is amazing. Give it a try if you're on the fence."
Positive,still maidenless :(
Positive,"o cavalo tem cu, jogo bom demais"
Positive,try finger but hole
Positive,this game has made me realize I have an addiction I have midterms next week and this game is gonna be the reason I fail all my classes. This game is pretty good
Positive,"First off, incredible game ahead.So to speak, try Elden Ring."
Positive,"i was never really into souls games, i tried to force myself time and time again to play dark souls 1 and I didn't enjoy myself, but I can 100% say for certain that Elden Ring has forever changed my mind about the franchise as a whole. This game easily is in my top 5 favorite games of all time and I will continue to play it. I highly recommend this game even if you aren't a fan of Souls games, I haven't had this much fun playing ANY game in general in a long long time."
Positive,"At first i was skeptical when George RR Martin joined the production wagon, but praise the sun, Fromsoft didn't turn this amazing series into narrative driven 'interactive movie' trash that 90% of AAA produce atm. Thank you so much Fromsoft for keeping gaming elite! love love hug hug big hugs!"
Positive,Best game I've ever played
Positive,"Don't give up, Skeleton!"
Positive,"DS was Sunday School, this is the full Sunday service."
Positive,"Thanks for clowning the western Triple AAA gaming industry and taking all of their lunch money From software with all the hate coming from western devs this is the reason : We can’t have other companies raise the bar, we gotta keep things mediocre and just playable enough to keep the dopamine drip going. Otherwise, people will begin to raise their standards."
Positive,"As of writing this, I've finished the game as well as started a new characterAnd I will concede that a significant portion of play time was AFK (12-16 hours) Furthermore, while I haven't been having performance issues, I know a few people that do, and I can't say why. Anyways, The gameElden Ring is a grand adventure that isn't holding back anything. The environments, the sound design, the dungeons strewn about the over world, the legacy dungeons that loom over the areas they reside in, tempting you to come in - it all feels very purposeful and hand crafted, no matter where you are. The bosses can be exhausting but exhilarating to overcome, and the reward is typically close behind that feeling. Something that struck me while playing is that it was very satisfying to explore everything. With the way that characters progress, you are encouraged to always be looking for better equipment in order to perform better, so if you happen to stumble into something great, it could define your playthrough or your character - much like how in Morrowind, you could happen to find parts of Daedric Armor, which is some of the most rare stuff you can find; in that vein, I think that Elden Ring can satisfy a much similar demographic but in an action oriented RPG, which is a genre I find much more engaging."
Positive,This game is so damn awesome. First off combat is simple but satisfying its at a medium pace and is extremely fun. The open world is filled with dungeons which I would say are separated into three categories small dungeons medium and legacy the world is filled with these dungeons to an extent where the player isn't overwhelmed and isn't left feeling like the world is empty. Music is top tier no complaints at all. Bosses have always been near perfect in Souls games only gripe was the elden beast and the variety of the night time bosses. Performance can def be better I have a high end pc and I get stutters very frequently. The difficulty is honestly up to the player you can either have the normal souls difficulty or use summons for an easier experience. Overall this game is an 9.8/10
Positive,"Look...I know...the stuttering issue a lot of us are having...it sucks. And folks, if you think that having the game stutter for a second every couple of minutes is a deal breaker, absolutely wait for some patches to fix it, because you have every right to be upset about something like that.But I'm giving this a thumbs up because...even despite that glaring issue...I am loving this game. This is everything I've wanted from a Soulslike game. The open world gives so many choices for what to do next, I've never felt like I just needed to grind souls so I could power through the next section. I just say ""This area hard, me go now"" and I'll go find someplace more my level. Or wander into a much harder place for way longer than is reasonable! It's so open that I can screw myself over however I want!Oh, and jumping. Horse jumping! Great times. Horse turns on a dime the size of a manhole cover, so expect to see plenty of bloodstains by cliffs, but I still love that ghosthorse. Otherwise, look...it just feels like the best, most polished dark souls combat. It's great."
Positive,"After playing the game for a good amount of time, discovering all areas, beating most if not all unique bosses, finishing the game, and playing even more of it on co-op with friends, I believe I've got a good grasp on this game's strengths and weaknesses to make a review about it. Let me say this outright first, Elden Ring is in my opinion, the best From Software game to date. I've played all their games since the first Dark Souls, including Bloodborne on the PS4, and although that one comes close to being my favorite, it was still dethroned by Elden Ring. First, let me talk about the main change for this game when comparing it to the others, the open world format: It's a great open world. The map has tons of things to do and see, everywhere I went it felt like there was something to see, a dungeon to explore, or an item to get, or in the worst case scenario, a funny player message to read. Hardly did the map ever feel empty and pointless, and exploring around, wondering where you'll end up and what you'll find next felt exciting the whole way through. So if you're not sure if the open world itself is any good, well, I thought it was one of the best open worlds I've ever explored in gaming.The combat mechanics are very similar to past souls-like From Software titles, You have light attacks, heavy and charged attacks, special attacks, a lock on button, a dodge roll, and other defensive options such as shields and a quickstep special skill you can use. It seems simple, and most of the time it feels like it is, but in truth, there are a lot of statuses and attributes that change completely the damage you deal and take, tons of weapon, armor and accessory variety and combinations of things you can do to play your way. So build variety in this game is huge, and I think it's great that people can play however they want to and it's viable. The game also introduces a jump button which allows you do dodge a few attacks, execute light and heavy jump attacks, and it adds to your mobility too. Back from Dark Souls 2 is the power stance mechanic, which allows you to dual wield two weapons of the same type, and use a unique moveset based on said type, attacking with both weapons, which was my preferred way of playing. So with all of this, I believe Elden Ring has the best player moveset potential of any souls-like.There was good enemy and boss variety in the game, I believe the most of all From Software games as well, given the scale of the game, but still, it felt like some enemies and bosses were repeated a bit much. Not so much on the main areas, since those are fine and feel unique, but optional tombs, caves and crypts feel like the same a lot of times. Their layouts and appearances are very similar to one another, and most enemies are copy-pasted from somewhere else. I felt like those places were the weakest parts of the map and were there mostly to contain better rewards that should be behind a challenge and not just scattered on the map, which is fair, but at the same time they didn't feel so good to explore as much as the open world. Of the bosses that are unique, most were pretty fun to fight, and felt rewarding to beat, not to mention the visual spectacle of some of those fights. There were a few I didn't like much, but most of them were fine. Of the fights I didn't like much, most were the 2v1 bosses. I felt like some of these bosses didn't have their AI really optimized to fight in pairs, so they mostly just walk towards you and attack while the other one does the same, and they stay really close to each other, so their attacks clip through one another, making it difficult to punish them when you dodge a combo and such. This mini-rant wasn't so much about how difficult it is, mind you, but how bad it looks when the enemies' attacks are clipping through their partners, and it's a bit immersion-breaking, making these fights feel less epic, and mostly silly.The game's story is told in a similar fashion to other From Software titles. There are few cutscenes, and most of it is told through NPC dialogue and item descriptions, which is fine, even though I very much prefer a direct approach. I thought Elden Ring's lore is pretty interesting, and I found myself theorizing and connecting dots, recognizing characters I finally meet after hearing or reading their names here and there. And while I've finished the game, and still don't know exactly all that happened, I believe the mystery is part of the charm.So, the game is pretty good, yes, it's the best From Software game to date for me. But it's not without its flaws. First, the performance on PC is not very good. I've got a pretty powerful PC, very well above the recommended specs, and the game stutters, freezes and drops frames seemingly at random, which bothers me when it happens. It's worse in a few places than others, but it really shouldn't be happening anywhere. While the performance issues bothered me quite a lot, it didn't even come close to what I'm going to talk about next: The multiplayer issues.A few of my friends also bought the game at launch, and we like doing co-op. I'm the one who's usually summoned and not the host, for a good reason I'm going to discuss. It's been more than a week since launch, and while I feel like it was worse before, there are still connection issues all the time. Co-op partners are sent back to their worlds because of what I can only think are server issues, leaving the host where they were standing, and it's such a hassle for the host to go back, summon their friend again, only for the server to disconnect them again later on. And during launch week, it was literally impossible to do three-player co-op. The third player would be almost instantly disconnected. Well, that's not good for exploring a whole area, so why not summon your friends for boss battles? Well, I tried. Most of the times I did that, they were disconnected not long after entering the boss room, leaving me to fight a boss with HP scaled for two-players, which isn't ideal as well. And when it actually kinda works, and you get to play co-op, the game will sometimes crash during multiplayer sessions, sometimes when I was nearly defeating a boss that went on for a while. That made me drop summoning friends in my world to save me from the frustration, so I ended doing most of the content in single-player, and then going back to try and help my friends later.Since we're talking multiplayer, what about the PVP? I've never been a fan of invasions in Dark Souls, honestly, I always thought it was forced, and it had its fair share of cheaters and trolls, but here, it was honestly much better. There are many ways to deal with invaders and I saw no cheaters whatsoever, also most encounters were actually pretty funny.Anyway, Elden Ring was a great experience that pretty much took over my free time for the last week or so. It was addicting, rewarding and exciting. I think this game is pretty much the best From Software has offered so far, and its my favorite souls-like to date, maybe even my favorite open world map as well. Elden Ring certainly is worth your time if you can deal with the issues I talked about above, and if you don't mind a game that isn't shy about punishing the player.If I had to rate it, I'd give Elden Ring a 9/10. This game really has a lot going on for it, but the performance, stability and connection issues at launch hold it back from being truly amazing in my eyes.However, I'm looking forward to the next updates that will attempt to fix it, and to potential future DLC, which may give the game the boost it needs in my opinion."
Positive,"I wish Elden Ring to everybody, it's absolutely amazing.Game of the century."

Positive,"This is the greatest game ever made, period. It's not up for debate. If you think you don't know enough to conclude or you don't agree, you're either ignorant or just wrong xD"
Positive,"Ideal. A great blend of exploration, skillful combat, freedom, level design, RPG stat/build nerding, immersion, itemization, and storytelling. The open world is comprised of mindful, intentional design, creating a sense of pacing within the fully player-driven exploration experience. It never seems to end, just when you think the game has played all of its cards and will start slowing down, it delivers over and over again. The main dungeons are an experience to behold, often giant towering structures you work your way towards, each of them a feat in level and art design. The character building possibilities are awesome, the game rewards experimentation and critical analysis of your build in ways Souls games never quite nailed down. The gameplay loop is varied and addicting, equal parts exploration, analysis, experimentation, and engaging, responsive combat. It's a huge well-designed & high budget immersive world in an RPG that puts game design & gameplay mechanics first, with an intriguing story that never gets in the way... and it doesn't compromise on difficulty. The controls and movement are responsive (thanks Sekiro), the animations are good, the art and vfx are real nice.If you have any interest in the excitement of discovering a game's world and mechanics, you owe it to yourself to play this game blindly, with minimal outside influence and wiki'ing—the game supports blind play very well, though it will be worthwhile to take basic notes in a journal or notepad file. I think a player written in-game journal or world map editor are my primary desires, but I'm just gonna blame consoles for the lack of these types of features. as they're hard to implement there.Ultimately though, this game gives back what you put in. If you want to progress slowly, exploring every inch of the world to find lots of meaningful secrets and items, it delivers as an incredible open world game. If you want to rush the legacy dungeons, creating a challenging experience by killing all the main bosses with a more limited option set, it delivers as a good action game. If you want to optimize your build, nerding out testing tons of setups and different viable strategies, engaging with the stats, spells, and itemization, it has tons of interesting stuff to play around with and delivers as a solid RPG. If you want to simply play at a medium pace, learning about the world, challenging some bosses, running random dungeons you come across, making your character stronger with the stuff you happen to find, and primarily letting your whims guide you—All of that will be engaging and rewarded. If you're a pure PVP nerd, maybe try showering someday, but yeah that's here too and it seems OK so far.I don't know how FromSoft did it, but they took the ""git gud"" approach to developing games and simply killed it. They deliver on not just a single intended experience, but an array of experiences, intentionally playing into the best aspects of emergent game design, while maintaining strong encounter and level design... All wrapped in some nerdy open world fantasy RPG that learns important lessons from all their previously developed games. My sincere thanks to Miyazaki & the whole FromSoftware team for their hard work, expertise, and dedication to making big budget gameplay driven games.(fuk george tho)"
Positive,the elden ring has been shattered and so did my sleep schedule
Positive,"The performance has it's moments where it sh!ts the bed but other than that probably the best game I've ever played and I haven't even left the starting region. Even at low-mid level (around 30) the content in even just the starting area is absurd. So much stuff to find, so little time.Even playing on PC, on mouse and keyboard as I don't have a gamepad, the support in comparison to previous games regarding UI elements has been improved tenfold. I can look past the occasional hiccup considering the size of the map and the fact im technically on last gen.10/10, if your performance stutters, try the reviews for solutions, if those don't work refund it and wait but definitely eventually play it. It's a must.and pain. so much pain"
Positive,most definitely the game ever
Positive,"Despite no official Ultrawide support and some performance issues that need smoothing out, this game is spectacular. But it may take a while to really see why. It does not hold your hand at all. It is brutal. I have struggled with Souls-like games because of this. However, Elden Ring may be the first one that I will finish. Simply because the open world design really improves the formula. If you're frustrated or stuck on a boss, go somewhere else. There is a ton to explore. Co op is great fun once you get used to how it works. Unfortunately, the servers aren't very stable and it can sometimes be laggy or disconnect.Even with these rough edges, the game is going to go down in history as one of the greatest RPGs. I just hope they'll give it the polish it deserves. The combat and variety of weapons and items is astounding. The world is massive and beautiful. Grab a friend or two and go have some fun."
Positive,when i thought i was nearly finished with the game i discovered a new zone xD this game will end me before i end it
Positive,The game is really nice but the main problem right now is the capping on 60 FPS.
Positive,"Greatest game of all time, there are always thing to do each zone"
Positive,"Broke my gamepad tryna defeat the weakest foe, no joke"
Positive,"This is honestly the best action RPG I've ever played, its really weird people have performance issues, I don't have any issues playing this game on my labtop either. Must buy I recommend it. Support one of the only good devs in gaming"
Positive,"The performance issue is not as bad as everyone is crying. My frames drop from 50-60 to 20 every couple of minutes or so, got an RX 580 and an i5 from 2015 at 1080p with high settings lol.Game overall is good its FromSoft I dont have to explain anything"
Positive,"As I feel I hover around a good chunk of Elden Ring having been done, I believe I'm in a much better position to offer my thoughts on it. I'll begin with a summation:Elden Ring is one of those once-in-a-lifetime experiences, and deserves to be played by anyone with the grit to see it through.A world of uniformly awe-inspiring beauty, paired with what is easily the most multifaceted combat system of any Souls-esque style game, would be enough to garner a glistening recommendation from me, but these are among the lowest of Elden Ring's achievements. Its lore is macabre and enchanting, its characters memorable and haunting, its soundtrack compelling, and its experience incomparable. It carries the spirit of a true and unadulterated adventure, with you thrust in the middle of a familiar and alien world, told only to survive and make your way to the end. Where you go from here is entirely your choice, and the near entirety of the world is yours to explore at your own pace. The sense of grandeur instilled through conventional fantasy settings like seaside castles or haunted forests is eclipsed only by the true visions of otherworldly beauty when Elden Ring really goes off the rails at the most unexpected of times.On a more mechanical level, aspects from From Software's previous games have been tweaked, consolidated, or removed; multiplayer is far more accessible, you are free to activate powerful summons in the middle of combat, and recovery items will replenish by degree at times in the overworld. I bristled at these changes initially, seeing them as FromSoft abandoning parts of their identity to appeal to the Twitter crowd, but I could not have been more wrong. After more than a hundred hours of playtime, there is not a single change I've witnessed that I don't think benefits Elden Ring as a whole. In fact, the game feels much more united as a vision than any FromSoft game I've played in the past, with each individual mechanic working in harmony with the next, to further a sensation of exploration, consistent discovery, struggle, and eventual victory.It's rare for a game of this caliber of vision to be made, and it's infinitely rarer for such a title to have the budget to back it up. Elden Ring displays the potential of this medium to its fullest, in an era where games shift closer and closer to chores, and developers concern themselves more with excising the maximum amount of money out of each individual player. It's not only a welcome ambrosia on a table of bile and muck; it's also a singular insight into a world of potent and inequitable artistry, bolstered in full by just how much perseverance is required to recognize its majesty. There are also incredibly hot women, so I think you should get it anyway."
Positive,"Game good, optimization bad, with Nvidia and AMD cards you can use your GPU control panel to force vsync to run on the game, which can reduce or remove microstuttering and FPS drops for some people. Judging the game based entirely on its actual merits, it deserves the 10/10s, gameplay's solid, story's as good as any other souls title, and the rest of the systems innovate on the formula enough to make the thing cool without actually ruining anything else. If performance makes you sweat and you don't think it's worth toggling a vsync setting, wait for a patch."
Positive,"Another stunning game from FromSoftware. Haven't played the game completely and only played it for 3 hours, however I can feel its amazing Gameplay, Combat, Music, Boss fights, Story and Lore already and I'm sure there are a lot of things left that I can do and I can't wait to continue the game. After playing a lot of Dark Souls games this was exactly what I needed. Highly recommended for everyone.Edited: After playing for over 110 hours and finishing the game I can only say that this game is a masterpiece. It has some glitches and annoying bugs and at some point you may feel the game is too easy or unbalanced but the experience is so good that all of these problems won't matter to you after finishing the game, unless you are too sensitive about it. there's a lot of variety and a lot of different builds that you can try and discover which can make PvP very interesting and chaotic. The world itself is so huge that you can easily play the game for hours and hours and discover new things and you can't get tired of the game easily. I enjoyed this game very much and in my opinion this game is a 9.5/10 and I highly recommend everyone to play this game."
Positive,"This game is a Glorious masterpiece that intersects between Art, Gaming and masochism. It is from the developers of the Father of Difficult Dark RPG's (Dark Souls), and it Will beat you down like it is the part time job everybody loves to do while working a miserable full time job the rest of the time. This game has an absolutely staggeringly beautiful world, a soul crushingly gorgeous to listen to OST, Some great character design/customization options, the lovely story telling of just about any FromSoft Game, and the Brutal difficulty you would expect from Fromsoft that tests your Skill, situational awareness, and desire to live.The story is just wonder as well. If you want to play this game, especially if you are a Fan of Dark Souls/Bloodborne/Demon Souls, This game belongs in your library. I do HIGHLY recommend that you Play with a controller, and that you practice the 5 D's of dodgeball, Which are Dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge. Oh, Did i say dodge? You should be dodging as I am saying this! DODGE!This is one of those few games, that I will say deserves the 10 out of 10 that good reviewers are giving it. If you want a challenge, give it a try. One of the greatest of all time."
Positive,"God I need scarlet rotussyI never wanted to breed with anyone more than I want to with Malenia, Goddess of Rot. That perfect, curvy body. Those perky breasts. The child-bearing hips of a literal goddess. It honestly hurts knowing that I'll never mate with her, pass my genes through her, and have her birth a set of perfect offspring to become the new Elden Lords.I'd do ANYTHING for the chance to get Malenia, Goddess of Rot pregnant.A N Y T H I N G.And the fact that I can't is quite honestly too much to bear. Why would Miyazaki create something so perfect? To tantalize us? Laugh in our faces?! Honestly guys, I just can't anymore."
Positive,elden ring GOTY god of war LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
Positive,You are maidenless. Feel free to die in a ditch somewhere.
Positive,"It took me awhile to really figure out what I loved so much about this game. Or rather, why it stood out so much. If it was just... Dark Souls in an open world it would have been great but this is FANTASTIC!What I have landed on is this: Every single bit of exploration done is rewarding. There is always something new to find and the difficult enemies and lack of concrete direction other than the main plot makes finding these places very very rewarding. It forces you into this slightly uncomfortable position whereupon it rewards you with grand feelings of accomplishment once you push through. And it never truly lets up. Everything is different and new. Even the crypts, though built from the same modular rooms, always have a unique gimmick or puzzle that must be overcome.Don't get me wrong. This game isn't for everyone. People who don't like exploring or people who want a more relaxed experience will not have fun with this game. Anyone who only plays very story forward games might also struggle. But for those who like adventure or challenge or exploration or a really engaging story to piece together will have a blast with this."
Positive,"This is the best video game of all time1- Very VERY big world to explore2- A lot of weapons and builds3- Beautiful world and design4- A great story but you will have to search for it5- Most fun gameplay ever (After Sekiro)6- There are 12 main bosses and the side bosses are 145, I mean THIS IS A LOT7- The soundtracks are the best but a little repetitive because there are so many bosses, they can't make 157 soundtrack8- The story is so long, it took me almost 140 to finish the game without exploring the whole world but I explored a lotBad things:1- the Boss designs at the start are kinda bad and disgusting but then it will be good2- The repetitive soundtracks3- The game is kinda easy if you use everything you have but for me I decided to put some rules to make the game harder, for example I didn't use summons (Except with boring bosses)And that's it."
Positive,"(This review would make a lot more sense if Steam’s review system wasn’t binary. Just please read to see what I mean and ignore the thumbs-up/recommended up there.)I cannot recommend Elden Ring – a game I have been thoroughly enjoying. It feels awkward to say that I cannot recommend a game that I enjoy playing, but it’s also not something that’s new to me. Elden Ring is From Software’s seventh “Souls Game” and the sixth  game that I have played and felt the same way about.I truly enjoy playing these games. I have beat each one and always felt very satisfied to do so. I wouldn’t consider myself a hardcore souls-fan by any means, but I am a fan. I’ve already played Elden Ring for about sixty hours and can see myself spending many more hours happily testing my mettle against more and more ridiculous foes and exploring the vast environment. I could go so far as to say that it’s the best “Souls Game” yet having learned from their previous six games and gradually improving upon a formula that I would consider triumphant. However - although I adore it, I think few people would enjoy the kind of experience that Souls games offer. The fact is that while the games respect the players’ intelligence and skill, one can argue that they disrespect their time. Although, from my personal perspective, the games do not disrespect MY time. I enjoy bettering myself and developing my patience. I enjoy exploring alternative means of stealing victory from seemingly impossible situations. So, as someone who enjoys practice and experimentation, I accept failure and do not see myself as “wasting my time” when I make mistakes within the game. That’s just how practice works.But for everyone else’s perspective? They probably have better things to do with their lives and I totally understand that. You really have to enjoy bettering yourself within Elden Ring’s world and game mechanics. Most people want to play other games as well or prefer a different cadence than what Elden Ring has to offer, or just don’t like the setting. If it doesn’t appeal to you right away, then trying this game is probably a bad idea.I like carpentry, but I can’t expect everyone else to like carpentry too. How can I recommend the art of shaping wood so absolutely? How can I recommend such a beautiful game like Elden Ring when it requires so much time and patience to appreciate the experience? Especially when most people are looking for “just a game?” However, for those who are looking for a challenge in a unique world that demands you take your time with it, I absolutely do recommend the game. If you think you’re one of the few people who can enjoy growing as a player within the world of Elden Ring, then I would say this is the best Souls game yet and urge you to try it.Or you know, if you’re an insanely talented player who likes fantasy games or whatever, and can just casually beat the bosses, then yeah I guess go for it. (Just know that I hate you.)But for everyone else, the game will just end up feeling like it disrespects your time and I don’t recommend you ever put up with having your time disrespected! In an attempt for ME to respect YOUR time, I make this review for you - the player who won’t find satisfaction in beating a boss after having failed thirty times beforeFun Bonus: I just read an article that mentioned fewer than half of Elden Ring players on Steam have beaten the first story-boss, two weeks after release. It's an interesting stat that I think can support my recommendation."

Positive,"What you should know before reading this review is that Elden Ring is more Dark Souls. Aside from the open world and a couple of new mechanics (stealth, mounted combat, etc.), the rest is very much the same experience. With that being said, the open world changes a lot, and Elden Ring is definitely WORTH playing. In this review I will be, admittedly, focusing on the negatives because I feel like these issues are worth addressing, and because there's nothing new to say when it comes to the pros of the game. With that out of the way...FROM Software's departure from the tightly designed, interconnected world present in Dark Souls 1 is further confirmed with Elden Ring. This is what drew a lot of people to the game and yet, it's been obvious that the Souls series world design has been going in a different direction even since Dark Souls 2, for understandable reasons mind you (interconnected worlds taking way too much developer time). Elden Ring is the first truly open-world title in the Souls series, and all although I'm not a huge fan of open-world games, they did a good job.After the short, skippable area, you can go pretty much anywhere you want, limited only by your soul and weapon level. It's the games selling point and something many will gush over, but it also contributes to one of the main problems the game has. Firstly, the positive. I would say the atmosphere of the game is on par with Dark Souls 1 and combined with the massive expanding world, and different enemy encounters made for a memorable experience. The map keeps expanding even when you think it won't and I felt a genuine need to explore every nook and cranny of the world, without ever feeling overwhelmed (which is a huge issue in most open-world games). Your adventure is truly your own, and you won't be bothered by minimaps, quest markers, or NPCs constantly telling you where to go. Now, while being able to go anywhere from the get-go has it's positives, it comes with some pretty important negatives. I feel like open-world titles generally tend to forget about level design, and Elden Ring is no exception. Individual closed-off areas (Legacy dungeons) are for the most part excellently designed, but the random bandit camps and vast empty areas were a bit of a bore. Teleporting to the start of the dungeon after finishing it felt lazy, and its definitely a step back from the previous games, where at the end of the side areas, there would be a well thought out shortcut instead of a button prompt. Then, there's the balancing. The balancing in this game is really bad right now, meaning that if you dare to venture into more challenging areas early, sooner or later, you will be killing enemies and bosses in few hits with almost no chance of failing. Since you don't know where you're ""supposed"" to go, stumbling on a high level area and beating the boss is highly likely, and leveling up after that means making some areas and bosses trivial. You'll be surprised to hear that this is actually intended, as the game director actually wants you to leave areas you have difficulties with and come back later. For me, this was a huge letdown, as the game was too easy most of the time. With the addition of an abundance of graces (bonfires) and Spirit Summoning, which allows you to summon one or multiple NPCs to fight for you with no changes to the boss's HP or damage, Elden Ring is probably the easiest game in the series (if you're willing to use it, of course).Now, why most of the time? Because depending on your build, some bosses are really difficult to the point of them being frustrating. While some are visually impressive, the bosses, in general, are a step down from Dark Souls 3 and Sekiro, since most of them either tend to flail around and/or have long combos with no space to hit them in-between, which ruins the ""rhythm"" of the fight, that is... if you're a heavy weapon user. Dexterity/Intelligence builds are not affected by this, mostly because they are completely unbalanced when compared to heavy weapon users. Dex/Int builds will not only do the same amount of damage (and stagger damage) as Strength builds (thanks to the status effects) but deal it much quicker, with more opportunities to escape enemy hits.  Now, my criticism is not that balancing is bad because Dexterity builds deal high damage, this has always been the case (DS3's Sellsword Twinblades, for example), it’s that the rhythm of the fight is broken if you’re using something like Starcourge Greatswords, since you’ll have to dodge many relentless combos, only to hit the boss back once.  After playing through the game once more with a Dex build, I no longer think this is true. The rhythm of fight is ruined for every build, and waiting for the enemy's long combos to finish is a plague for every melee build. From what I've read on forums, people would summon/cheese or respec their attributes for certain bosses, which is not ideal.Another thing to add is that there are a few recycled bosses, especially when it comes to dungeons and evergoals (minibosses). After my 5th fight against a certain Tree Spirit and Sentinel, I was getting pretty bored.Finally, the story. It feels very similar to Dark Souls, which I found extremely disappointing. When I heard that a new FROM Software game is coming out, with a new IP, I was really excited to learn about the new creative way to explain the respawn system, but it's basically the same as it was in Dark Souls, only now, you're not Undead, you're Tarnished, and you're not suffering from a curse, but a 'rune of death' has been stolen. The plot follows the already expected ""kill the demigods, then the gods"" arc, and while compelling, it felt way too samey. I was expecting something more, especially with G.R.R.M. on board. There was little reason to make the story of Elden Ring as cryptic as it was in Dark Souls, and I was hoping for a more narrative-driven experience. Now, don’t get me wrong, there’s much more talking in Elden Ring than there was in Dark Souls, but still, instead of talking to people, we’re back to reading item descriptions. The most offensive thing, present since Dark Souls 1, is factions asking you to join them, without offering any explanation as to who they are or what they truly stand for. With that being said, finishing NPC's quests is much easier with their location being marked on your map after you meet them (if they move somewhere else, there is no mark). There are four endings, with three of them being very distinct from one another.Even though I've been mostly pointing out the negatives, I've thoroughly enjoyed my time with Elden Ring. There's a lot to love about the game, especially the expanding world and it's atmosphere. Additionally, I hope other developers take similar approach when making open world games, because, if anything, Elden Ring proved that you do not need quest markers and hand-holding to make the player feel invested in your world."
Positive,"Basically Dark Souls 4, and that is a good thing. This incarnation is open world and the world is huuuge! When you start playing and you see the uncovered map, you may think it doesn't look all that big, but it will expand as you play. Also, this DS version may me more accessible to players because the world is so big if one place is too hard for your current skill or play style, just go somewhere else. Highly recommended! Good hunting!"
Positive,the turtle with the hat is my favorite character
Positive,"finally, I got gud"
Positive,Just get this game and play it. DONT THINK. PLAY!
Positive,"Now. I have beaten this game 5 times and 100% the achievements so therefore it is my God given right to officially call myself a big cheese and thus give bitchin review of this banging game.Firstly the combat is great, the moves are smooth as can be and combos are by far the most satisfying to execute out of all the souls games. The variety in builds is insane. Samurai, Shinobi, Knight, Paladin, Mage, Necromancer you got it all. Hell you can be Trevor fuck1ng Belmont if you want for all I care. It makes the replay-ability of the game immense and keeps you entertained for much longer than any previous souls game.The open world is both beautiful and unique. The transfer from dark shaded castles of the predecessors to a diverse mythical land with both glorious scenery and grand architecture which is mixed up plenty with both peaceful valleys and thunderous lava squirting mountains.Story is creative and interesting however the game leaves a ton of questions unanswered and there are mysteries even people with hundreds of hours haven't completely figured out. Now this leaves a grand gaping gap for theories however when put all together the history of the lands between becomes fragmented and interrupts the flow. But never the less the characters are well built even with the lesser known side character adding a fistful of flavour.Now for the downsides.Firstly the game isn't that well optimised. It's not horrible but it is a large scale game with outstanding graphics and requires a beefy rig. However it's the frame drops that's the main problem. Even with a good machine the locked 60fps can and will drop to rock bottom occasionally which isn't that big of a deal but there are certain scenarios where it can cost your life and the juicy runes you devious licked from the exploited pixels the game calls enemies.The other main problem with the game is the difficulty slider. A game that was designed to be hard being hard is one thing however the slider is not linear at all. At the start of the game it feels difficult as you don't really know where the flying f*ck you are, what you are supposed to do and how to get rid of yo punk 4ss haircut you picked in the character creation thinking it was funny. But it's just cuz you don't have the routine. However when it gets to the late game it gets bad. And I quote REAL BAD. It fells like it's world war 2 being captured by the Jappos and you suddenly go from repairing a stone fence all day long to tissue torture.All tough there are plenty of broken builds out there so if you don't care about beating malenia fair and square with a rollin pin and a box of tic tacs then there are ways to make the impossible slightly less possible and less tedious.All in all the games is a masterpiece and I strongly believe the outstanding gameplay, superb combat and glorious open world by far outweighs the bismal frame frops. And hey if it's hard then maybe you should realise that it's a f**king souls game so man up puss1es. Or you can take 15mins every few hours to cry in the shower. We have all been there."

Positive,"Original Review: constantly hanging, its so disappointing. Been looking forward to this game for years. Iv racked upa ton of hours of ds3 and the ds1 remake on this system with no issues, cannot recommend this game in this state. unplayableEDIT****** it was afterburner that was causing the crashes. since turning it off ive had zero crashes. Hopefully this will help others.Since putting in a ton of hours, i am in love with this game. Game of the year for me so far. Still have to play it on a lower graphic setting than Sekiro and DS3 but is what it is. I can live with shitty looking shadows lol."
Positive,I'm usually hesitant to buy games at a $60 price tag but this game actually feels like it's worth that price tag and more which is so rare with games these days! This game has been an absolute joy to experience and I can't wait to stop writing this review and go back to playing because wow I'm obsessed with this masterpiece
Positive,"This is a terrible recipe if they are going to boast authentic. My biggest peeve is when a restaurant or otherwise present a “Philly” cheesesteak and it’s anything but. Just call it a cheesesteak and move on. Our cheesesteaks are simple: ribeye meat, whiz, and a roll. Maybe some carmalized onions, or long hots, or peppers, or some other cheese - those are personal changes/additions. But at its core, it’s ribeye, whiz, and roll. Done."

Positive,"I’m a veteran player (I’ve been playing for over 20 years) and I can’t praise too much how good it feels to play a game that doesn’t underestimate the player. It is exciting to explore an open world. Which succeeds in a mysterious atmosphere. Which serves a demanding but satisfying fights. Which serves one of the finest open worlds ever.Which serves the freedom to search and develop the character at your own pace if the challenge is too demanding. Depending on the style of play, the game is either very challenging, or easier if you focus on developing the character. This happens as if by itself as you explore the fascinating world. The PC version technically didn’t always keep the fps steady, but this didn’t ruin the experience. This will probably improve over time with updates.Elden Ring is one of the best games of all time, I can't add anything that hasn't been said by others. Buy and Play it already!"
Positive,"WOW, a game that actually lives up to the hype? It's insane how this hits every nail on the head perfectly. You know it's bad when you expect all triple A games to just be steaming piles of trash that you are shocked when a game works perfectly right away and has actual attention to detail in it. What's that? The water actually moves when you walk and role in it? Not only that but it cleans the blood off your character and weapons and adds a damp look to your character? This game is oozing with detail and works right out of the box. It's crazy and it was well worth the wait. Thank you.Actual review. It's like if Skyrim, Breath of the Wild, and all the Souls/Borne games had a massive orgy and made this masterpiece. There are times the game doesn't even feel like a Souls game anymore and that's a GOOD THING. Just to be lost in it and see it as it's own game rather than decending from something else is amazing. Of course you can't look past the animations and enemies being ripped right from the previous FromSoftware works but honestly, it all works. Just exploring and getting lost in the world and walking around, seeing all the amazing things put into this game is such a treat and with how games have been releasing lately, this should be a technical impossibility yet they did it, they really did it and made something amazing. Souls play-throughs usually take around 16 hours to beat. I'm 16 hours in (currently) and I haven't been following the main path at all. I literally went the complete opposite direction and it actually let me and I didn't get punished for it. Exploration is key and this game does an outstanding job at doing it.Game is so good, it's actually getting people who don't like Souls but love other games like BotW and Skyrim into it. You know they're doing something right when they can break out of their mold and attract other fan-bases like that."
Positive,"I'm not a Fromsoft fan. Never have been. I found their games themselves to be frankly, pointlessly difficult. I guess I can say I *wasn't* a Fromsoft fan, because now I am, lol. Folks say that Elden Ring is the most accessible of the Fromsoft games, I'd be inclined to agree. Including a tutorial, not slapping you in the face with a giant boss first thing and lowering the difficulty of the initial areas of the open world have really helped ease a lot of the pain points that plagued the previous games from this company. That's as critical as I can be. Genuinely. I started playing this game last week and I've already logged 45 hours in it. It feels like there's a new mystery under every rock and it seems like almost every item gives you a snippet of lore or a piece of a much larger story. Being able to party up with my friends (who know infinitely more about this game lmao), is also a massive help. The invaders range from irritating or terrifying to outright hilarious (FRIENDLYTORCHBRO, you're an absolute chad, thank you for the laughs and the... prawn?) There's scraps and pieces of hope everywhere you look, and the more you play, the less alone the game feels. There were so many times I'd come out of a difficult boss fight, defeated again, only to find messages from other Tarnished. Some encouraging, some amusing, even some wholesome (don't give up!) Even though you experience this beautiful and bizarre world by yourself, you never feel alone. If you've been on the fence about Fromsoft's games or you're like me and would have never, ever considered playing a Souls-like? Play this one. It's amazing. The music is incredible, the visuals are stunning, the world is vast and full of mysteries waiting to be solved. 10/10, genuinely deserved game of the year. Absolutely stunning."
Positive,Liked everything.  Game has space for someone to stop and level up if they aren't strong enough for a challenge.  Different builds feel completely different.  Each weapon feels very unique.  The tone and art of the game is amazing.  For me this is the best game in the past 15 years.
Positive,"One of the best games I have ever played. I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did. Really glad I picked it up. There was so much to explore and see. The lands are absolutely beautiful. The bosses, mobs, and quests were all interesting, unique, and fun to fight/complete. The game play was very refreshing. None of the ""go kill x mobs at this location"" rinse and repeat stuff. I constantly found myself challenged and wanting more. Really a step above the rest and shows just how great modern open-world games can be."
Positive,"Before Elden Ring, I had never played a souls game. Not for lack of interest, I had always planned on it, I just never got around to it. But Elden Ring seemed like a good starting point, I had heard it's a good introduction to the genre. And that it was. I got invested to the point where I ended up with 100% achievements, which is something I rarely do in games. The bosses, the world, the music, it's all extremely well crafted. After this game, I do plan on playing some of the other souls games. I do recommend consulting resources if you are interested in side quests. The wiki can be quite helpful and there are countless people in the community who can help. It can get confusing knowing where to go or what to do next for some of the character quest lines. Ultimately, if you are someone who is interested in the souls genre in any capacity, I think you will enjoy Elden Ring."
Positive,"This is the best open world game I have ever played. 10/10Pros:The designers iterated on Breath of the Wild, open-world-mechanics and mashed it together with a Souls Game. The result is a highly addictive experience that constantly delivers on quality dopamine.Visual Design: Every scene in the game looks like high-quality, Fantasy, realistic, landscape paintings. Then you feel like a tiny, little nat inside of those paintings.What lacks in story, the game provides in a character-building RPG experience. You're always stuck envisioning what your next improvements will be and you are driven towards feeling more and more powerful.The boss encounters and enemies are fun and satisfying when you defeat them after many, many deaths.Cons:Performance: At the time of writing this, the devs have fixed some of the performance issues, but there still remains some pretty bad ones. Moving through certain areas cause FPS stutters / lag. Random entire-game freezes that last 5+ seconds. These are NOT caused by lack of hardware as I am running on a Radeon 6900 XT and an intel i9.UX: The game has some bad UX issues. Exiting the game from the open world forces you to return to the Game Menu, which forces a lengthy menu including logos, a login screen, a warning and moving the cursor to Exit Game. Not being able to open the map in combat is also a frustrating issue(even if the enemy is far away and will not reach you).Summary:The design and feel of the game is so good that it gives me hope for the future of game design and outweighs the UX and perf cons considerably. I've seen many non-souls gamers pick this up and fall in love with the world it provides. From Soft really doing something amazing here"

Positive,"Aside from the pc stuttering issues, the unbalanced weapons/magic that make a lot of gear not worth using, & the fact you fight most bosses in the game 3-7 times each - it's a pretty alright game. (some issues patched since writing, & now no longer an issue)At least 100 hours of content here for completionists though some aspects of the game still need an extra hand if you want to find -everything- like having the wiki on hand.I mean, it's Elden Ring, if you're reading this then chances are you already bought it, played it, wrote an article for the wiki yourself, and yelled at someone on Twitter for not liking it so you're probably looking for some kind of confirmation bias via good reviews. So how about you stop reading this and just roll a new character already?"
Positive,"By far my new favorite souls-like game as someone who has put thousands of hours into Dark Souls. Fresh take on combat, but still familiar enough for me to pick up on most of it almost instantly. Doesn't really feel like i'm at a disadvantage by building in any certain way, every playstyle has a ton of options. Completely new optional game mechanics to make it easier to progress, but can be completely ignored if preferred. Even if you just focus on the main story there is plenty of content to play through. Playing both side and main content at the same time it took me around 70 hours to finish the main storyline and i still have a ton left to do after. Depending on what content you play through it can make the game take significantly more/less time to beat. One of the few times I can safely say a game is worth the money.Performance issues on a 2070 were almost negligible and never actually caused any deaths for me.  Even if you have a lower end PC they wont impact gameplay outside of the open area fights with lots of effects where you might see some significant frame drops. I would personally still give it a try either way."

Game runs for me at 59+ in dungeons 50 with minimal drops on a 1080. If you loved dark souls you will love this. Don't take these negative reviews into consideration UNLESS you are also a 1head monkey who doesn't know simple fps solutions.
Positive,"Elden Ring has no story? Well what the F is this then? -> I even recommend watching this video before finishing the game, it may contain obvious spoilers in some form but then again this game is so relentlessly big you'll forget 80% of what you've seen by the time you get there yourself. The big benefit is that you will feel emotionally attached to the locations you visit as it give you less a 'why am I doing this again' feeling. Miyazaki gives nothing for granted, he does not Kojima you with 15 minutes of cutscenes (I love Kojima but it's just a different type of cake completly, they may very well be to opposites of eachother)This game has 7 endings apparently and I still have to reach the first finale (after 250+ hours on steam, that means 170 actually on my save, I get interrupted in my life a lot lol and leave stuff running).I have to add I am lord leisure as well so I will not fit most gamers profiles, I look up every nook and cranny when playing games especially when it comes to fromsoft titles and this game has only ONE MILLION NOOKS AND TWO MILLION CRANNIES. And with that regard I always end up way to OP for the areas I am at right now.Why does this seem easier than previous titles? It gives you way more tools to work with and you don't get stuck at some boss because you just turn your bum around. Spend enough time and the game does become easier, which is a good reward, this game is not Ninja Gaiden.At first my biggest complaint was the recycling, a bonfire is called a grace, souls are runes... and I was like come on why don't you call this simply Dark Souls 4. My problem was that people where fooled into thinking 'oh I did not like dark souls but this will be easier so I will like this' that is a miss conception tbh. If you are not in to RTS games, the easiest RTS game will not make you like RTS games in my opinion, you don't like race games? the easiest race game does not turn you. This is not Zelda, this is Dark Souls on a horse with a Zelda map and you can Sekiro crouch and jump. A lot of assests are from previous FromSoft titles so in that sense this not as revolutionary as the almost ignored Demon Souls from 2009 was. Sekiro for that matter was way more different from a Souls title than this game is BUT!!!! this game is way more approachable because of the two major things I mentioned before, more tools to work with and freedom of travel.Also to prevent stuttering, let your pc do as less as possible, for me shutting down steam overlay, steam UI screen like chat and library and shutting down Discord really helped. The stutters occur only at some places in the openfield and when it got worse at some point simply exiting the game to mainscreen en returning helped out most of the time, probably some GPU memory leakage going on. I love japanese games and programmers but they are hardheaded when it comes to 'only use stuff brewed at home' like netcode for example.Very ood game, play it, when it gets repetitive go do something else for a while and return to it because this game is long as in Johnny Sins member long. The only downside is that there are no baguettes in this game. I am going to make a baguette now and I am not even French."

Positive,"Hilarious to see people complain about the difficulty, missing quest logs or the combat system when Souls-like clearly isn't their genre.Put these foolish ambitions to rest. Elden Ring is everything Soulsborne fans love & even better and bigger.ratio + L + maidenless + plumb out of luck + touch the grass + fully divorced from the strength of runes."
Positive,"If you are like me and hate the Souls games for being overly difficult and for always working against and not for the player, do give Elden Ring a try, you might end up loving it as much as I did.Before getting into the review I'd like to give my opinions some merit by saying that I played over 50 hours of Demon's Souls in 2010 on PS3, made decent progress too, then I played Lords of the Fallen on Steam(Not a From Soft game) and gave Sekiro a try and hated it. I also played a bit of the PS5 Demon's Souls remake.I have also tried other games with Souls mechanics and did not care for them one bit with the exception of Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order which had multiple difficulties and I loved from beginning to end.With that in mind, let's get into my Elden Ring review.Elden Ring is the single, best action RPG I have ever played bar none. I even took the time to ""Platinum"" the game which I pretty much never do. Sure it had its shortcomings but the overall experience was simply unmatched by anything.In order to keep it clean and easy to understand I will post pros and cons of the gamePros:- STUNNING Art Direction, the game looks like a moving painting at every turn. I was in awe from beginning to end- Even though the game has a rather sparse and vague storytelling, if you stick to quest lines you're actually going to relate to the characters and that's very sweet. They all have very little dialogue yet it's well written and acted enough to make the player care about them.- The game is full of AMAZING Random moments you wouldn't even think could occur- Incredible, epic, amazing boss fights- Fantastic gameplay that works FOR and not against the player unlike other Souls games which do everything they can to screw the player over- Essentially infinite healing items that only increase and get stronger as you explore the world- Weapons and armor don't break! Maintaining your equipment ruined so many games for me including Demon's Souls and even Breath of the Wild (I still finished BotW at least)- Very frequent checkpoints, a checkpoint before every major encounter- Specifically dedicated Farm Zones that make leveling up a breeze, they also have checkpoints right next to them- The world is full of content yet never once felt overwhelming or boring much less like some kind of a checklistSense of discovery like no other game before it, I was genuinely happy and excited to discover new dungeons, places, items, characters, vistas, everything is just so well put together it's incredible.- Brilliant eerie somber music and ambience that fit the world perfectly- Satisfying sound effects, from the sounds the main character makes as they walk or roll around to weapon clashes, hits, everything it's just perfect. With headphones on the game's sound helps with gameplay too.- Elden Ring lets the player make mistakes, experiment with fights, take risks without punishing them by wasting their time which is something other souls games doCons:- Quest lines could and should have been clearly outlined IMO, unless you follow a quest guide you have pretty much no chance of discovering or progressing through these quest lines- Some bosses were idiotic, mainly the 2nd form of the final boss and 2nd form of that one other boss tho her I dealt with by summoning two other players to help withMaking it complicated to get all three endings on a single file for console users, fortunately I was on PC so it was a nonissue for me- TERRIBLE CLUNKY MOVEMENT AND JUMPING which sadly comes into play in 2 optional areasMost spells, armors, items and weapons are fairly useless and only a few are worth using, so that's pretty disappointing- Unable to respec an unlimited number of times, you need respec items, I had 10 and used two I believe, but it would've been so much more fun if I could infinitely play with my build. You also need to find these items tho I seem to have found them without trying so there's thatMy final rating - 10/10An absolutely amazing experience, only marred by the final boss' 2nd phase for me----------------------------I still strongly dislike Souls Games for the following reasons, none of which are present as much in Elden Ring:- Even the slightest mistake can and will mess up your run in other Souls games, but not in Elden Ring- HP and MP healing items cost souls, souls take time to farm up, it's not your choice to farm, the game essentially makes you- Dying sets you back to the beginning of a level, if you opened up shortcuts cool but some levels don't have them, fighting the same damn enemies over and over is tedious when it is NOT your choice to do so. Meaning you are either perfect or you mess up, end up wasting healing items and what not just to die at the end of the segment and try again and again to no end.I play plenty of retro games, they give you far more room for mistake than the average Souls game.- Demon's Souls for example LOVES putting the player in small, narrow spaces with enemies. If you're melee good luck becuase your sword will bounce off walls, if the camera decides to mess up and it will, it's even worse. Elden Ring very rarely did this. Tho there were some camera issues in Elden Ring as well here and there but nothing major. - IIRC the more you die in Demon's Souls for example, the more difficult the game becomes, something about world tendency getting darker but I can't confirm this for sure, Elden Ring does none of this stuff."

Positive,The only game in which the tutorial level is filled with bloodstains.10/10 Recommended!
Positive,get ready for the next 5-10 years of games trying to just do exactly this10/10
Positive,"Done with elden mid. Loved the game, it was legit worth the hype and I enjoyed playing it, apart from optimisation i don't think so this game has any serious issues. Other then that I am waiting for the DLC if they have any plans about considering how successful it was. Godfrey's boss fight was one of the best shit this game had, full shonen anime vibes and a true definition of ""CONTEST OF CHAMPIONS"" as he himself states that ""A crown is warranted with strength""Stay M A I D E N L E S S lmaooooooooo"
Positive,"Movement so smooth for 2022 gameJokes aside...Elden Ring is a Soulsborne experience through and though. It’s impossible not to compare Elden Ring to the Dark Souls games, as their (Dark) Soul was the pigment that this title was painted with.This game is the culmination of all the past Soulsborne titles. From has taken all that they have learned and made a game that represents the evolution the series needed and manages to be everything I wanted it to be.Elden Ring constructs a world that is in it's own way colossal, while simultaneously ensuring constant worthwhile content to explore.I'd write more but this is already too much. It's good. A 9.5/10. Alas no game is perfect."
Positive,"There is so much content in this game but you really have to pay attention to everything to understand the lore. If that is your cup of tea.Good thing is you can play it however you want. The game can be easy or hard as you want it to be.Overall, the experience is like having a weird dream. I'm just glad that I finished it so I can move on to the next game.  It didn't give me any empty feeling after finishing the first playthrough unlike when I finished The Witcher 3. It's a great game but not the best game of the decade. It's just because other games at the moment are all shit."

Positive,"-The story is masterfully told (not always through dialogue) and is FULL of lore. (Try looking at your surroundings and the scenery)-Open world is HUGE and convincing (And BEAUTIFUL!)-The Atmosphere is (with all fromsoft games) absolutely incredible-Exploration feels organic. When you find something cool, it actually feels like you discovered it.  You aren't ""hand-held"" and guided to an objective by a quest marker on a minimap-The mechanics are well polished and varied-Weapons are plentiful and highly customizable-Ashes of war expand upon the weapon customization and are IMO the best addition to this  game.-Invasions by other players are fair - giving the host an advantage (*Controversial opinion*)-Compatible with Steam cloud saves - A welcome change from DS3-You can jump! (I know, right?!)-I could go on...-FPS locked at 60-Made for controllers - mouse and keyboard can be bit awkward-Performance can be a bit stuttery at times, especially in large, open areas-Multiplayer is not the best:--Connection issues are common (Peer-to-peer sucks)--Severely limits mobility and restricts you to the specific area where summon takes place  (Intended feature - Not necessarily a CON)*** If you are having a hard time or getting one-shot by mobs/bosses... GO ELSEWHERE; maybe level up a bit. (Also, try putting points into vigor... How hard is that to figure out?) Vigor = life. This isn't dark souls. (As much as it feels like it is.) There is no need to bash your head against a brick wall (a.k.a. a boss) over and over again."
Positive,After decades of innovation Fromsoft have finally bestown upon us the highly coveted ability to Jump
Positive,"I actually died to the first boss on its first attack because the game stuttered through whatever happened. Apparently you die in two hits, and I died in none. Seems fixedConsidering that I'm still playing after my initial review, I feel obliged to ""cautiously highly recommend"" despite my experiences: it will stutter and it will crash. Seems to have been fixed in the years since release.Stutters in this game seem more prominent early on, possibly due to a desire of serving a visually strong experience to players as the game begins. Seems to have been fixed in the years since release.All in all: fun game, would recommend but has issues that are exacerbated on m&k. This is one of the best games of all time. Also, can now easily use mods to remove whatever may cause issues.Switching this review to positive in 2024 as the stutters and crashes appear to have been fixed since I first played at launch years ago. Also, many toggles options were added in settings. New 2024 edits are in italicized text. Some old text removed.After launch, they've added lower mouse sensitivity--prior to the update it was absurdly fast at the lowest sensitivity, forcing me to use 400 dpi which was very inconvenient for menu navigation because I had to move twice as far as I was used to. Unfortunately, a few other issues also make/made gameplay annoying:1. Auto-camera: They added a toggle to disable it. The issue at the time was if you were moving left and the camera was turning left but you needed to aim to the right (aka moving mouse to the right) the auto-camera would fight the mouse input and cause stuttering/jittering. This was disorienting and over time caused headaches and other issues. Also since directional inputs are relative to the camera this can cause you to move in a completely different direction than intended even if sometimes only slightly--this can(infrequently) result in getting hit by a boss or falling off a ledge.2. Dodges are buffered through staggers. Inputs can also be buffered through your own attacks, but this feels inconsistent to me so it could be due to stuttering or some other issue during combat. I'm not experiencing this anymore so either it has been fixed or it doesn't happen because I'm more precise with inputs.3. Putting multiple movement actions on one button is just stupid(backstep, dodge, & sprint). At some point it will perform the wrong input. It feels like the game sometimes ""eats up"" dodge inputs, but I suspect it occasionally considers them a sprint instead--at least when not during a stutter. Still an issue but I'm more careful/precise with my inputs now so the occurrence is rare.4. Not all actions appear in the keybinds list. Some actions are not bindable to mouse buttons. Still true, still silly, not much to say.5. Even with motion blur off, turning in this game feels particularly awful. My brain adjusted after a few hours but not before dealing with headaches and discomfort. Feels fine to me now without auto-cam stutter, without stuttering overall, and without chromatic aberration. I suspect the biggest culprit was the camera stutter as that causes a huge disconnect between input from hands and output to eyes and the brain/body get confused.The camera smoothness suffered from the following:1. stutters (uses avg. <30% cpu and <50% gpu at max settings, 3 year old pc) Seems fixed2. 60 fps and below Fine without stutters but 60 fps cap is rough on pc3. fighting auto camera with camera input causes additional shaking Can now toggle off 4. high sens mouse camera--fixed(in 2022)5. lock-on is a bit goofy and for m&k users keeping it mostly off but sometimes toggling it to ""aimbot"" certain attacks, especially against dogs or flying enemies works well. It'd be nice if they have a better camera in a future game, but after the initial bad experience I don't mind it anymore. They also added some toggle options for camera settings that help.If you'd like to mod some display/QoL stuff, very early on fps cap removal, increased FOV, and widescreen were added. By now, you can toggle anything else if you grab some mods which takes like 5 minutes tops. Back in 2022, the increased FOV greatly helped with my disorientation with stuttering and auto-camera jitter. Huge props and thanks to modders!Fps cap at 60 is forced due to it having some ties with physics but it turns out that only a few things break. Without stuttering it feels ok but at the end of the day, 60 fps is still awful for pc, especially with the other performance issues at the time(stutters, crashing, etc). It can work with 2D or certain artistic styles, but for 3D games with camera turning 60 fps will always be objectively bad.--The game is very pretty with beautiful scenery and great effects. I've had a great time exploring the map and fighting enemies. The world feels full and has good variation in verticality. Bosses are varied as are their movesets. Many have mechanics designed to increase suffering, but that is to be expected.The story is not ""handed to you"". If you have any interest in understanding any of what is going on, you have to be quite active. Many open world games use a ""main storyline/sidequest"" strategy which sometimes have boring/useless sidequests, but since you generally cannot discern which is which here, everything explored feels like it has some significance. There are rewards for doing all manner of things, allowing you to journey however you like. You may frequently find yourself in higher level areas, allowing you the decision of turning back to explore more of what was behind or to forge onward towards more difficult battles. The only issue with this style is that for a few sidequests it is hard to figure out where to go. Otherwise, it's perfect and it is done very well.While it IS a good and playable game, I find it important to be harsh about the disappointing performance and the blatant lack of certain features. I will happily change my review to positive when I experience a day with smooth fps and no crashes with other issues fixed. The game has literally crashed every session. One error even caused me to expect save corruption. No longer experiencing crashes in 2024 so changing my review. I'm still criticizing just HOW awful everything was on release. Now that the large sweeping issues like crashing and stuttering are gone and some toggle settings were added it’s fine but at the time it felt like ""AND THIS TOO?!"".Despite my harsh review due to performance and other issues, I still had Elden Ring as my game of the year. It is one of the best games of all time and is much smoother now in 2024, highly recommend. Happy New Year, game is still in the steam winter sale for a bit so grab it if you haven’t already!"
Positive,This might be a game of all time
Positive,prase the elden ring
Positive,"I am Malenia, Blade of Miquella.I am Malenia, Blade of Miquella.I am Malenia, Blade of Miquella. I am Malenia, Blade of Miquella."
Positive,This game is just like Dark Souls
Positive,"So the launch is fixed and game works now. It's beautiful - truly a FromSoft game with outstandingly crafted places, interesting and gross enemies and difficult fights, however in true FromSoft fashion the controls are sometimes a bit unresponsive on M+K. While the game works now there are some serious frame drops in certain areas that make combat even more difficult. There is also an area in the map where I've fallen through but was luckily able to come back in.Still - guide, artbook, soundtrack are all .exe so you won't be able to enjoy this good on the good (imo this should have been stated prior to the release, since .exe is not you usual ""digital artbook"" and ""digital soundtrack"" file type. Sure you can then get the Soundtrack downloaded via the .exe but not the guide nor the artbook. What I'm saying is that this is a bit of a false advertising and I don't recommend anyone getting Deluxe Edition.It's just not worth it"
Positive,"Despite having two major shortcomings (lack of Ultrawide support and no PS icons for my DualSense controller), I can't help but want to give this a thumbs up. I'm not unaware of ""Souls"" games, but the main series left me cold. I fell off Dark Souls 1 and 3 with around 10 hours played total! That said, I enjoyed Souls-like games such as The Surge 1 and 2, and the open world nature of this convinced me this would be different. And it is!All of the Dark Souls trappings are still here but with the addition of so much more content to distract you from throwing yourself at a challenging boss over and over. Every corner of the map has something interesting and something deadly (often both at the same time). From Software has taken the Breath of the Wild concept and improved upon it with their brand of aesthetic, which is a perfect combination. Plus there is no weapon wear and your horse is far more useful than anything in that Zelda game. Also, where BotW was mostly empty, Elden Ring's world is packed with content.I read a review that said 80 hours to complete, and I scoffed. Not that that seemed unrealistic, but that I didn't think I would even come close to that. I've had the game less than a week and I'm at 25 hours played. Getting to 80 hours seems a given now."
Positive,"I have never been a FromSofotware game lover. Haven't played any Souls games, or Sekiro, or whatever. However, what I am is an aspiring novelist and storyteller, so take note of the following words as you will.In my twenty-something years playing video games, I have never seen such a masterful piece of art. I believe it was Picasso who once said art is a lie that reveals the truth. This game has much to teach its player in such regard. It utilizes illusions to break away one's delusions.The voice acting is superb. Every NPC I stumbled across is sincere, heartfelt, and touching in their manner of speech. Even the ones with less convenient manner of discourse (looking at you, Ranni) have a cadence that is just brilliant in making you comprehend what they feel and exist for (provided you are not a sociopath). The gameplay itself I will leave to the fanatics of the genre. So far it's been more dangerous than I can bargain with; but far as the worldbuilding, characterisation and narration go, there has yet to be a video game out there that can surpass this.This is a brilliant experience, and I am honored to be allowed to partake in it."

Positive,"Elden Ring is not only the best game FromSoftware has released to date, but it's also one of the best open world games I've enjoyed in recent years. We are facing a title that manages to perfectly mix each of its elements, and the results really could not be better. But dont forget praise the sun"
Positive,"About PC Performance, I'm playing with lower CPU than the min req, here's my specs:i5-66001060 6GB16 GB ramSo yeah, CPU bottlenecking especially on the field. I got 30-50fps in open area and 60 in closed area.New review after upgrading my CPU to i5-11400F and finishing the game.Performance wise it's more stable because huge CPU difference. I can get 60fps most of the time in mixed graphics settings, it can lower to 50s on certain areas tho.This is definitely the easiest souls game, really good for new comer. Some build are just kinda broken in PVE, literally making the game has easy mode. There are also plenty of spirit summons to choose to help you in many difficult fights.The map is really huge and filled with many things. Sadly many mini dungeons/field bosses are just copy paste. Maybe copy pasted bosses are fine if they got more moveset at later encounters. I liked it when I encountered that rot erdtree avatar and rot dragon, I thought we're gonna have much more variation of them, including the moveset.I'd prefer if the amount of mini dungeons are reduced but make it longer and harder. For instance, there are 8 catacombs/caves/tunnels in the first area IIRC. They could make it just 3 or 4 but longer and has more reward.My problem is many colossal weapons are not really good, especially for late game mobs & bosses where enemies become faster, stronger, tankier and sometimes not easily staggered. Their recovery times are so small that you gonna trade hit if you're using big slow weapon, meanwhile if you're using dual wield light weapon, you can deal a bit lower amount of damage but have faster recovery animation therefore a much safer approach. Colossals should be far more rewarding for it's cost. Crouch R1 or jump attack are the options for heavy weapon but it's kinda boring if I have to rely on them most of the time.I planned for heavy build colossals at first but then dual wield straight swords just carry me all the time.PVP wise, well it's kinda bad for now. Some skills/build are just broken/glitched that they take out the fun. And yes, colossals are pretty bad in PVP.Overall, it's a great game for the PVE."

Positive,"Although I recommend to hold it off until some PC patches for stuttering get resolved, this is single-handedly one of my favorite games of 2022. The systems and mechanics of other games are implemented very well here, and all without frustration. It rewards you for literally everything you do in the game, and doesn't feel easy. The art design and vistas are amazing and eye-catching, no two places look the same. If your PC and patience can vibe with this game, please pick it up. This is a love-letter to all souls fans. Although I wouldn't mind Bloodborne on PC"

Positive,I haven't beat the game yetElden Ring
Positive,"There are no words to appropriately describe the immense joy and fun I have while playing this game. Elden Ring takes concepts from other Soulsborne titles, improves upon them, and goes beyond expectation. The open world is beautiful with a lot of locations to explore and goodies to grab. The bosses are fun, challenging, and always satisfying to beat. With such a wide variety of content to explore, it is very difficult to run out of things to do. It's why I have so many hours in this game: I never got bored of it.My main criticism come more from personal experience rather than concepts the game has. Notably, the world feels smaller when you learn where everything is and avoid places to fight bosses or get items you don't need. This is to be expected as with other entries to the franchise, the experience feels linear and shorter with each playthrough. Despite this, I am still amazed at this beautiful world each time I ride through it.Please do yourself a favor and try this game. It is difficult, punishing at times, but the immense satisfaction and relief from beating a boss you've been stuck on for 5 hours never fails to make the mood better. Who knows, you may just find a personal favorite encounter."
Positive,"I played the game with 8gb ram and I suppose this resulted in some mobs turning invisible. Still, the game rocks. It has the best combat features of all soulsborne games and has a great variety. Worth every penny."

Prepare to visit the 200 different swamps with 3 different insant kill enemies, permanent HP drain in the zones, T-Rex dogs and immaculate i-frames that always assist you in getting hit.I love this game and I love shafted by 2 enemies at the same time ♥ (looking at you Godskin Duo)11/10 would love to hear ""I am Malenia. Blade of Miquella."" every 2 seconds again ♥"
Positive,"I love the entire Souls Like series. I started with Bloodborne earlier and then moved on to Dark Souls. After that I played Demon Souls which I thought was fantastic. And then I heard that ''From Software'' is releasing a new part which should even have an open world. At first I was a bit skeptical because I didn't know how ''From Software'' would deal with this new idea but I could say... They exceeded all my expectations.The graphics are truly stunning. Everything is designed in such detail. Both the world (which I still haven't fully explored) as well as the NPS's, enemies, bosses and much more. What I want to say is that I can't see the graph difference between Low and Maximum. From that point of view, I mainly play on Low so that everything runs smoothly.I haven't played a Souls Like part on PC before. However, I have to say that it was implemented very well. And besides, I love this game more than any other Souls Like parts and for a reason. There is a separate jump button! In the other parts it was or is quite annoying and sometimes hectic when you have to press several buttons at the same time.From my point of view, there is nothing negative anymore. Previously, for me, the negative was that it came to such frequent game crashes. Now there is nothing negative for me anymore. The price of Elden Ring does justice to the game in everything. So ''From Software'' has really surpassed itself.I'm going to play Elden Ring for a very long time, as I haven't fully explored the Big World yet. My goal will be to reach the maximum ''99'' for all stats. I also hope that there will be DLC expansions at some point. In addition, I would like to see a few more achievements because I now have them all.Graphic: 10☆ <3Game Mechanics: 9☆Spielspaß: 10☆Elden Ring is in my opinion a good game to get in because you can get a lot of support from the incantations of ghosts. If you add another player, the boss gets even more life than usual, which is why I would prefer the ghosts. So anyone looking for a ''Heavy Game'' with stunning graphics is absolutely in the right place with this game."
Positive,"Masterwork ahead!So, Offer rump."

Positive,"This is a captivating adventure filled with intriguing characters, mysterious locations, and epic battles.One of the most noticeable aspects of the game is its world. Every corner of Elden Ring is filled with mysteries and stories waiting to be uncovered by exploring the environment and engaging in conversations with characters. Additionally, the game world is shared among all players, allowing you to encounter and team up with others to explore it together.The battles in Elden Ring are also impressive. Each fight is a challenge that requires careful planning and strategy. Players can use various types of weapons and magic to overcome their enemies, and each battle is unique and exhilarating.Finally, I would like to note that Elden Ring is beautifully crafted. The game world looks stunning.In summary, Elden Ring is a game that every RPG enthusiast and adventure lover should try. It provides a deep and engaging gaming experience that will not leave you indifferent!"

Positive,this is the dark souls of open world video games
Positive,"Solid gameplay, great music, visually beautiful. One of the best experiences I've ever had."
Positive,"This game is the most fun I've had gaming in a long time! Not being the biggest fan of souls games in the past i find this one offers a great balance by adding in a super easy to use the multiplayer system. If you are struggling with a boss ask a friend or two to come help. The scale of the map is mind blowing. You always find cool new areas, items, and enemies no matter how much you explore. Highly recommended!"

Positive,I sacrificed my first newborn and wife for this
Positive,"Honestly probably GOTY, as a 10 year vet of the souls franchise, this is also probably the best of them all. They put their heart and soul into this game and it shows, worth way more than the price that they're asking for it. Even if you feel you aren't into these sorts of games, I'd advise giving it a try, it's so rewarding to do well in."
Positive,"(A review in progress)tl;drPerformance issues notwithstanding, Elden Ring is an amazingly well designed game with some interesting additions to its signature combat system and a large and engaging open world. The story (as seen so far) is pretty good too. In my 20+ hours of gameplay, I have encountered little to no performance issues/crashes. I'm playing the game on my laptop with an Intel i7 11800H, RTX 3060 and 16 GB RAM. Main ReviewElden Ring at its heart is Dark Souls by another name, but it is also a lot more than that. The player character is a tarnished (referred to as the dead who yet live) who has been set on a course to reunite the shards of the titular Elden Ring and become the Elden Lord. The game starts in a chapel where the player can walk around for a bit until a min-boss promptly slaps them into the training dungeon, a true souls game welcome.The game is set in a open world where the player starts off with a blank map and has to acquire fragments to reveal the actual map. The bonfires (Sites of Grace) are present with a reasonable frequency and certain sites point to the next site in order to progress the story. Fast travel between the sites is enabled from the get go. The map has several dungeons which the player is free to explore and defeating the dungeon bosses grant powerful rewards to the player. Elden Ring does not thrust the open world on the player and Fromsoft has not simply slapped an open world on to Dark Souls and called it a new game. The Lands Between and the landmarks found in it work as scenery story elements and of course, fight arenas. branching paths the player can take to move from one region to another enhances the non-linear gameplay of Elden Ring. In the open world, the music gradually transitions from the ambient music to the boss fight/combat music, the sound design is general is stellar. In typical Fromsoft style there are traps in game that leverage the open world design. The day/night cycle and the weather events also change the world state and there are some NPCs and enemies that appear on the maps only at a certain point in the day. The very first site of grace in the open world is within spitting distance of a boss on horseback and a dragon in a lake that are best fought on a mount which is provided to the player at a place beyond the horseback guy. It is also not possible to level up until the player acquires their mount. Fromsoft mitigates these immediate challenges by allowing players to sneak past enemies in the open world and has also implemented a system of stealth attacks similar to Sekiro: Shadows die twice. Stealth and an improved traversal with jumping/crouching on foot and the mount based combat makes traveling in the open world a really smooth affair.The combat is essentially the tried and tested souls formula and there are some new additions like the posture/guard breaking mechanic and guard-counters where a successful block can be followed up by a heavy attack that breaks the guard of most normal enemies. There are also spirits that can be summoned in certain point in the map and can aid the player in combat; the poison spewing jellyfish is really helpful against bosses. Mounted combat allows the use of melee, ranged and magic weapon while mounted and this allows the player to come up a variety of strategies to deal with enemies and bosses in the open world.Finally, it seems that several users are experiencing performance issues with the game, I have personally encountered a handful of frame drops and no crashes and the game ran at close to 60 fps even while streaming. The game also starts with the Xbox controller prompts by default but there is a setting in the game menu to switch to keyboard and mouse prompts. Fromsoft has acknowledged the presence of these issues and has promised fixes for the same, I'm inclined to believe them especially considering the number of copies of the PC version that have sold. In conclusion, Elden Ring seems to be a very competently designed game that moves the Souls game formula forward in many meaningful directions while retaining its own signature features."
Positive,"Absolutely. F*cking. AMAZING game by FromSoft once more. There's a few bugs here and there but the overall game is just gorgeous and fun and completely filled to the brim. Hours and hours can be spent just roaming around finding new things and learning the game before you even get to the first ""boss"". Just freaking stunning work here."
Positive,Another FromSoftware banger. Stuttering and screen tearing isn't terribly game ruining but it does exist. Purchase with caution until further updates address these issues.
Positive,Quite possibly one of the games ever made
Positive,"SPECTACULAR game. Seriously, this sh*t slaps hard.As a massive Dark Souls fan, Elden Ring so far is EXACTLY what I've been hoping for ever since I originally heard it announced all those years ago. I've been a fan of the souls genre for a long time, and without sounding too pretentious here, I consider myself really good at this style of game to say the least. However, even after all these hours of making significant progress, there's still no end in sight for the fun to be had and content to explore. This game so far is without a doubt the culmination of all of FromSoftware's previous work, but with an added extensive open world and less linear gameplay, which I love. It does contain a somewhat rougher beginning for newcomers compared to other FromSoft games-- but trust me, stick with it. Elden Ring is absolutely a punishing and confusing experience starting out, yet as with most souls-like games, you will feel yourself quickly growing and improving substantially with time. FromSoft veterans should know what's up though; this game is basically like a love letter to us. The inimitable feeling of narrowly proving triumphant over a boss that's been kicking your sh*t in only after careful study and constant minor improvements make souls games some of the most enjoyable experiences on the market for difficulty junkies such as myself.With all that stated, and I know I may be going off on a slight tangent here, but I personally am unable to understand some of the negative reviews. In my eyes, it seems like ever since Cyberpunk 2077 released (a good game that released buggy) some strange group of people find their fun in hating on whatever new game releases for the sole reason that it's released imperfect. I hate to break it to you, but there's not been a case in which a AAA game releases in a ""perfect"" state. Ever.  It's mostly because of this that I feel the need to write this review as someone who has actually spent time playing this game. I'd rather see more reviews on the game itself rather than entire reviews pointing out one insignificant flaw in hopes to discredit the game, company, and sometimes even fanbase as a whole. As someone who has actually been playing the game and enjoys fun, the only complaints that I find myself having are directed more towards the optimization issues on PC. (There, I said it.) HOWEVER, said issues will most likely be fixed in the near future knowing FromSoft, so does it really matter all that much in the big picture? Does it really warrant a negative review on the game based on that alone? So, that all being said, I cannot recommend Elden Ring enough. I recommend it even more-so if you're also a fan of previous FromSoftware games. If you do decide to purchase it, stick with it for awhile. Own your own opinions, negative or positive, instead of hopping on the bandwagons of others who just hate seeing people happy and love to be contrarian. That is all.EDIT: 05/03/2022 I beat the game and my opinion has stayed the same. Nothing short of spectacular."
Positive,"Beware, Betrayal Ahead"
Positive,Man I suck at this game.
Positive,"This is one of the best games I've ever played, without question.Elden Ring is my first ever foray into the Soulsborne genre. What have I been missing this entire time wtf"
Positive,"i am unemployed and lacks the social dynamics of a healthy life. this game has ability to replace real world, which is full of hate and nothing good. elden ring my happy place."
Positive,"Elden Ring is an evolution of established design trends of From Software studio. ER follows the same gameplay formula as Dark Souls 3 with few new added mechanics that don't fundamentally change the gameplay. As a game it's derivative of its predecessors, the new elements rather than changing formula, feel like continuation of it. Open world  Out of the all new elements, the open world aspect of the game is best realised. Instead of following usual practise of separating open-world activities and game progression. ER links game progression with exploration and makes its focus. At it's design core it follows principles of thoughtful minimalism and focus. Those combined together create a game world, in which player can navigate without utilising map. Instead player is visually lead and drawn to nearest objective or interesting places. What's impressive is that almost all major locations are visible from a distance, which helps to point player in right direction. The sheer scale and verticality of those location is spectacular. Instead of using elaborate illusions to make huge location like in previous games. ER aims to make its location fully explorable and massive at the same time. Addition of jumping button also allowed for more interesting and intricate level design. Royal Capital Leyndell is the pinnacle of this design - the biggest location in FROM games. Imagine Anor Londo or Yarhnam, but you can explore everything you see. With open world, ER also introduces an element of nonlinearity to the formula, which after Bloodborne became increasingly linear. This nonlinearity allows for greater build variety and gameplay freedom, player can beat almost any boss he wants in order he wants and pursue different rewards as a result. However, with this approach some corners had to be cut and as a result game reuses many assets and isn't as neatly balanced as previous titles.Crafting fits suprisingly well into gameplay loop. Not only it rewards exploration and incentives seeking new cookbooks, but most importantly it gives immadiate access to neccesary consumables without the need to farm them from the enemies as most of crafting resources are plenty and abundant in game world. Furthermore, this system is entirely optional, as crafting isn't tied to character progression and crafting selection is only limited to consumables and projectiles like arrows or knives. Not to mention many of said items are also sold by merchants and found on corpses. Combat ER builds upon and expands on DS 3 combat template. Most of major enemies and bosses follow the same design principles as DS3 enemies with thier delayed attacks and agressive combos. ER goes even further with this by making bosses even more agressive with more delayed attacks and smaller opening windows, some of them even adjust thier attack strings and behaviour to player inputs and position. This puts even more emphasis on evasion and swift attacks. In turn, this makes boss fights even more dynamic and engaging by forcing player to take risk and carfully find opportunities to strike instead of just waiting for a boss to finish his attacks. Furthermore, bosses have been specifically designed to punish the old habits of veteran souls players and to force them to adapt and change thier strategies to overcame the challenge.  I feel like addition of summon ashes has negative impact on the game's balance. The enhanced enemy agression and input reading can be in-part explained as way to combat trivializing aspect of this system. As a result, I feel some of the battles were design and balanced with summon ashes in-mind, especially Crucible knights duo. Edit: they fixed this in issue in patch 1.04 by decreasing bosses aggression when they're in group and most obnoxious cases of input reading have been removed since. Summon ashes still are an easy mode, but now the game doesn't corner you to use it as much as before.Ashes of war system is great. It allows player to change weapon arts of armaments and thier scalling at the site of grace. it highly encourages experimentation and weapon switching. Amazing addition that creates even more build variety. Horse combat is entirely uninteresting and becomes dull very quickly. Fortunately, game rarely if ever forces player to fight on horse and majority of open-world bosses can be fought on foot. I think that Torrent was only added as means of transport and combat was just an afterthought.  Conclusion Overall,  Dark souls IV  Elden Ring is natural conclusion of all previous FROM games. Fundamentally, It's just bigger and better than Bloodborne and Darksouls 3. However, this over adherence to already established formula hinders and restrains the studio's creative potential. I don't think they can follow same forumla endlessly. While ER is a great game, I wish they would experiment more with thier games, as it is they are starting to eat thier own tail.Finally, the most importantly  I want Sellen to sit on my face"
Positive,"I absolutely have no idea how to play this game. First time buying souls-like. Every boss is kickin' my ass, I don't know where to go and etc, but my mind is saying to me that he likes it and I can not disagree. I feel like this game is absolutely masterpiece. But I'm afraid to start the game sometimes :DStill recomend to everyone!"
Positive,Things playing Elden Ring has thought me.1. Confidence2. Patience3. Perseverance4. Courage5. Creativity
Positive,One of the best games I ever played. Took 110 hours to beat and I did almost everything. What an amazing journey!
Positive,"The best game of 2022, for sure.  I played for over 80 hours originally on PS5, mostly as a mage build, and then kind of lost interest when I got past the capitol into the latter half of the game.  Most of this was back in early 2022 around the time of the launch of the game, and a few months after that.  I was a fan of Demon's Souls, though I never was all that good at it, and I always bounced off the later Dark Souls games.  Elden Ring was the first one that I clicked with better, but it still took me a lot of using the (so called by some) ""easy mode"" type tricks like magic and ashes and whatnot to really feel competent.  By the time I was in the late game, I felt like I had a personal skills deficit that was going to make it hard for me to continue, despite being level 160 or so.  I wound up losing interest and moving on to other games.  This was about patch 1.04.  I had some specific complaints such as some areas feeling too overwhelming too explore, the world being a bit too large, etc.  But overall one of my favorite experiences ever, even then.About nine months passed, and then all the buzz about newer updates and GOTY and so forth happened.  I had a new Steam Deck, and the game was on sale and reportedly ran great on it.  I decided to take the plunge and start a whole new character, but this time rather than being INT, DEX, or INT/DEX, I was going to go a STR route.First of all, the game really does run amazingly on the Steam Deck.  I had heard all the woes about hiccups and such on the PC version of the game around launch, but the Steam Deck version at this point runs with pretty much the same quality and definitely same speed as the PS5 version now.  The main difference I notice is that there is a bit of lag of the map filling in when I zoom out or pan around too fast.  That's a surprising and ultimately minor thing, but it's all I have.Anyway, in my second playthrough, fresh character, I decided to go for a build based around the Gut's Greatsword, and I used some online guides to help get me off to a quicker start finding the items I wanted.  After that I pretty much just went based on memory and off of fresh exploration.  In 32 hours, I've roughly accomplished what I did in 80-something the first time, which is perhaps not surprising.What DID surprise me is that playing with such a slow sword two-handed really made me slow down, stop panic rolling, stop light attack spamming, and find a proper groove.  Also, since I don't have to juggle multiple spells, and sightlines for my spells, I actually find this a much simpler way to play.  It's all about dodging and timing and reading the enemy.  Trying to master offensive spellwork and shield usage and rolling and doding and read enemies at the same time was really messing me up in the first playthrough, and it meant that a lot of things that were enemy patterns were not ones I had time to notice because I was so busy trying to line up my own positioning for offensive purposes.What's interesting to me is that there are SUCH varied ways you can play this game.  That isn't true of something like Breath of the Wild, or any other open world game I can think of.  Playing a Faith build or a build based around guard counters, or the various flavors of mage, all offer completely different challenges and opportunities.  Some of the bosses that I found really hard in the first playthrough were trivial with my new build, whereas others that didn't really register much the first time were suddenly something I had to think out carefully with my lack of ranged attacks.My best advice for this game is to not saturate yourself with it.  If you're starting to feel overly frustrated or overwhelmed, take a break for a few days and play something else.  Heck, take a week or a month off and then come back.  Don't make this game your job.  If you play this game like a job, it's likely to be overwhelming and not in a good way.  If you treat it like an amazing place to visit and explore periodically, whatever that means to you personally based on your own tolerances, there is nothing else like it out there.I was a huge fan of Breath of the Wild, and have maybe 300 hours in that game across multiple playthroughs in a 5 year span.  I love that game still, but it now feels very shallow compared to Elden Ring, given so many of the things in that game are similar and predictable.  The lack of enemy variety is apparent even early on in that game, whereas the opposite is true here.  Even basic ""dudes in armor"" are extremely varied, and seeing a guy in some new armor and with a weapon you don't quite recognize is cause for pause; he'll act and attack in ways that are potentially completely novel to you.I've seen some criticisms of things like the catacombs and caves and mage towers and such being a bit repetitive, but honestly I don't think that's fair.  In general, when exploring any of them, there's always the sense of something truly novel with each one.  Every little village, ruin, etc, feels unique and has secrets that are meaningful and worthwhile.This game won't be for everyone, but it really is hard to understate what an achievement it is."

Positive,"Thank you, really.255 hours of fun and suffering. Made a character as a samurai at first because I'm a weeb. After around 70 hours, I was really frustrated because I couldn't wield the katana properly. Made a second character as a vagabond because I'm a cool wandering knight.Still frustrated. So as a knight, I went to get myself a katana because I like bloodloss.It was hard and long battle, I only use physical attacks. I didn't know how magic and incantantion damage works, I also thought they were really slow, so I just did random physical build with weird talismans and no buffs. Now that I take a look at it, it took me a year to get to the last boss. My friends who bought the game just this year already got to their Journey 4, I hadn't even gotten my first ending. Got advice from them, built myself a faith character. Finished all three endings. Journey 2 and 3 each only took me a week. Thank you, Elden Ring wikis.A BIT OF SPOILER OF THE ENDINGS AHEADGetting all the three endings is really satisfying.Gotta say the Frenzied Flame ending has the best scene out of the three.If you're planning on getting all the endings. I really recommend getting that ending at your 3rd playthrough if you haven't gotten/seen it yet."
Positive,"NOT A FINAL REVIEW Don't buy this game yet! Terrible performance even with the best hardware in the market. Wait a fix!When this game gets optimized, I'll write another review._ REVIEW UPDATE _I played on PS5 to not lose the game hype for my Twitch channel. Played the PS5 version, because at the moment of the release, the PC version was trash in performance. Now, the PC version is good.Finish the game with 200h and this is a master piece! You need to play it!"
Positive,"game seems great but it runs so poorly i cant confirm or deny that statement. horrible frame drops when any enemy encounter happens and my rig is well above minimum specs. the game is clearly poorly optimized and I will keep this review negative until it is addressed.edit: they patched it, it's aight. drop the resolution if u have to. gl gamers."

Positive,"Elden Ring is a relentless open-world ARPG set in The Lands Between. You are journeying to contest the world's former heroes to become the latest Elden lord and mend the Golden Order.FromSoftware has gone above and beyond to create the most complex character customisation in any Souls game, with the option to select one of ten starting styles. The vast amount of customising allows you to become whatever you want.The game is aesthetically stunning, with excellent visuals and an artistic approach analogised to Dark Souls. The game has a night and day rotation, which is also pleasing. There are many environments to traverse through and interact with directly or indirectly.The ominous soundtrack does not disappoint in a significant boss encounter; this is noticeable. It fits in perfectly with the backstory. The atmosphere is enormous, and there are enough songs to keep you going.Elden's ring combat has improved immensely with the inclusion of various new mechanics - including item crafting, spirit summoning, jumping and more. The core of battle remains challenging and lethal. Many bosses are capable of one-hitting you. It's similar to other Dark Souls games, where you need to find the right balance, with many opportunities to improve.Some quick points.Although it isn't game-breaking, stuttering happens enough to hurt immersion.- I don't understand why FromSoftware locks games at 60FPS. There will be tools to bypass this, but they need to break out the 60FPS lock.- No DLSS, FideltyFX or ulra wide support.- EasyAntiCheat & DX12 performance issues?- KB+M is too sensitive."

Positive,"Using Lenovo Legion 5 Laptop, 1660 ti CPU: 10750h and with those two it runs flawless 1920p however the STUTTERING is god awful on release. That being said this game is heroin and my controller the needle... I am addicted... Worth a buy."

Positive,"Genuinely one of the most engaging and complete games that I have played in years. I'm new to Fromsoft games. The hardcore nature of the Souls series never appealed to me, and I never considered myself to have the time or patience for them. But the world of Elden Ring shown in the marketing material really grabbed me, and I was unable to ignore how fun it looked. I bought the game expecting to maybe get 20, 30, 40 hours in before it got too hard for me - and I was fine with that. I'd keep trying but eventually quit and those hours with the time would be worth it. Well, that wasn't the case.  I beat the first boss and kept going. I beat the second. The game is designed in such an accessible way that skill does play a factor, but you have alternative options - levelling up, gathering equipment that will help you. But I quickly found the appeal that so many find in these games - the harder the boss, the more I enjoy it.This world is so complete, so vast and so engaging that it's a dream to play. I've seen 'Skyrim with good combat' thrown around a lot, but it's more than that. It's a fully realised world with rich story and characters. It's beautiful, it's scary, it's rewarding to explore.My main criticisms with the game would be difficulty. Due to the nature of the open-world, it's next to impossible to balance. Some areas were a breeze because I had levelled too much, whereas some bosses were like smashing my head against a wall. The frustrations are few, but the game gets so much right that you notice the issues.It's worth noting that I've had no technical issues with the game, though I'm very aware they exist and can be damning for some.  In a world of early-access, rushed and incomplete AAA titles, playing such a complete and polished game was refreshing. A great entry point for new fans, and likely a game that will redefine open world games in coming years."
Positive,"Dear God above, it's finally here.Disclaimer: I have spent a little over two thousand hours between various Steam accounts on the DARK SOULS series. You will see comparisons in this review to FROMSOFTWARE's previous games. Invasions are not mentioned beyond this disclaimer, given the majority of players will not participate in them due to the nature of Elden Ring making solo players un-invadeable without opt-in. The lack of transparency around invasion matchmaking once again will make invaders rather unhappy, once Bandai Namco begins multiplayer balancing. (edited as of Patch 1.07; near/far invasion explanation in the patch notes is the best transparency we've ever gotten, thanks Bandai).I must admit the prospect of a FROMSOFTWARE RPG set in an open world daunted me a bit. After the rather disastrous dev cycles of the Souls games resulting in iconic but incomplete worlds, I feared this would be much of the same. Cue the pandemic and resulting delays, and I expected the worst. Luckily, these fears were ultimately cast aside by what is most likely the best iteration that FROM can produce on their RPGs going forward.ER's world, while not seamless (lifts in particular as well as the Roundtable Hold), *is* complete - and there is direction to it. Yet, open-world dungeons, mines, catacombs, and more concrete story progression are all freely accessible while working between other bits of content. This allows for an approach to Elden Ring that even newer players can agree is far more consistent with the value that Dark Souls attempted to teach - if you struggle, just head somewhere else and come back stronger. The world expands in every direction, and every time you find a new area the game has expanded in a new direction each time. North, south, east, west, in the sky, beneath the earth - it's all in there. The freedom to explore along with upgrade materials and bosses providing constant incentive to explore in new directions is simply wondrous, compared to the linearity pointed out in Dark Souls 3 in particular.The Ash of War system allows for incredible build flexibility simply unparalleled by the predecessor infusion and upgrade systems in previous titles. They may also be transferred with a weapon they are slotted into in order to trade them to another player, unlocking the Ash of War for them to later duplicate and place on *even more* weapons. Unfortunately, this is gated by a limited number of Lost Ashes of War (the item required to duplicate an Ash of War at Smith Hewg), but nothing NG+ doesn't fix.Boss encounters are plentiful and, per FROMSOFT charm, difficult but not unreasonably so - and with 12 years between Demon's Souls' original release and Elden Ring, quite a bit of time to iterate upon making them fresh and interesting. There are no Capra Demon-esque arenas in this game, much to our relief.. but there are many, many bosses that have AoE attacks also inflicting contact damage in addition to status buildup, something the previous games did not do. I'm curious as to why this change was made - perhaps they felt status encounters were too weak?..Arguably, there are only three things the single player experience could really improve upon (bar a change to upgrade materials themselves):1. A legend key for the Map, *or* teaching about the Map Marker system instead of hiding it in a menu at the bottom of the screen.Identifying certain points of interest that you cannot hover over, such as mines, can be difficult. In addition, discovering a mine will *remove* its already-unclear indicator from the map if you pass too near to it, making it difficult to return to it without external assistance (such as map screenshots from other players) if you hadn't rested at its Site of Grace. This makes it significantly more tedious to find the mines which, gated behind their bosses, have Bell-Bearings that hold unlocks for infinite upgrade materials purchasable for runes. If you want to experiment with weapon choices, or pivot to a new build mid-game, this becomes... difficult without the appropriate Bell-Bearings.2. More greatly emphasizing nighttime re-exploration and adding a Midnight time-of-day.Time is divided into several sections in this game - Early Day, Noon, Late Day, and Night (with weather variations). However, Night has no divisions within its duration - causing deaths during Night to advance to the next time of day, Early Day, and making it a proper pain in the ass to continue nighttime exploration. There are several nighttime-exclusive bosses and having to essentially go through two loading screens between attempts (one post-death, one to pass time to Nightfall again) is *extraordinarily frustrating*.3. Quitting the obsession with boss duos composed of previous encounters in a *certain region* of the game. (Thanks, Caelid.)These do not necessarily mean two of the *same* enemy (most of the time it is double of similarly appearing enemies with different movesets, or two completely different enemies), but there are several boss duo fights which lack the grandeur, charm, and frankly the fun factor of previous gank bosses. To take examples from previous FROMSOFTWARE games: In Dark Souls, Ornstein and Smough are universally loved for the character they provide even if the boss fight itself (waiting for bosses to lock themselves in an animation isolating them in a corner while you whack the other) is lacking. Dark Souls 2 was called out for usage of what amounted to monster closets of previous encounters, including bosses, being thrown at you. Sister Friede and Father Ariandel in Dark Souls 3 were rightfully criticized for reinforcing that a gank boss could ""only"" be another Ornstein and Smough.But, in the Ringed City DLC for Dark Souls 3, FROM produced a near-perfection of the double boss formula - the Demon Prince fight from Dark Souls 3. A large arena where you can kite the melee boss around while the other boss acts as an area hazard you can occasionally run in on and punish, *while still kiting the main boss*, was wonderful - along with distinct changes between which of the two bosses is acting in that role.Elden Ring, however, seems to have forgotten this lesson. Double bosses are almost universally a poor experience given the pairings of wide sweep arcs with constant gap closers from the other bosses - or, worse, persistent ranged projectiles from behind said wide sweep arcs in small arenas. This is disappointing and aggravating, but *certainly* not unplayable (as the bosses themselves are well designed on their own).*Overall, Elden Ring is a strong 8, perhaps deserved 9/10.*I wouldn't have binged the game as hard as I did out the gates if it wasn't deserving - but there are issues with FROM's formula that are recurrent from their previous titles which *must* be addressed at some point. They do not greatly detract from the game, but you will find yourself thinking about them."
Positive,Outstanding.  Fun exploration and a hefty challenge.
Positive,"After years of waiting, Elden Ring does not disappoint representing the culmination of all the things FromSoft has learned over the recent decades, taking and refining previous ideas to perfection. Elden Ring possesses an unparalleled level of exploration, gorgeous terrain, well hidden secrets and incredible boss fights making it one of the most compelling open worlds ever. Aside from some reused content and poor balancing of certain aspects of the PvP and PvE, this game remains a masterpiece of both RPGs and open world games alike."
Positive,This game sucks I was just playing and some red asshole came out of no where and hit me and did alot of damage then he threw poison pots at me and waited for run out of heals and watched me die. Like what did i do to make him that made 0/10 but i recommend it because at least it was funny

Positive,"yes yes yes. good, very good."
Positive,"Elden Ring is good is the most discussed in the media in the recent times ago. Even it has happened in January 2022, but some of the public still curious about what is exactly happening and to be the reason there is a rumor comes out about it's good. At that time the game became the massive video gaming rumor. The public, especially its' haters are shock. It just came out with its good rumor which is spread massively. This time is not about its bad game, but its good rumor. The rumor is out of standardize of truth, according the last reported this game revealed itself as good. Do you still believe or not, this rumor is really much talked by people even in a person of its haters."
Positive,"ELDEN RING is a rare gem in gaming which feels special the moment you get into it...Elden Ring successfully implemented Fantasy and RPG elements into this game and it feels amazing. So much so that this is now my favourite game of all time...From the game's open-world to its gameplay, world design, visuals, characters, story and so so much more! I've spend so many hours already that I didn't even realise it and still when I get into the game, there's this fresh feeling to it and there is so much more yet to be discovered and it's so fun to explore them......For so long I've wanted a game like this, and especially, if you love RPG and Fantasy genre, you will absolutely fall in love with this game. I definitely did...The way it integrated it's online feature is also amazing. It might not be new, but it is for me and that is also very good...Without a doubt, I can say that this game is 10/10. Sure it has has problems and the only one I faced is the FPS drops in certain areas and/or fights but I never felt that it ruined my experience...And make no mistake, this game is hard but when you do overcome that wall, you will really feel rewarded for your hard work...""Remember the days when we used to play games without worrying about anything but to complete the game itself, and we used to either ignore small issues or we were too young to understand these things and just enjoyed the game we were playing?""- Elden Ring just made me remember those days..."

Positive,Blaidd my beloved
Positive,"Elden Ring is a game of contradictions. It has some of the best and worst ideas in the whole series, taking in what was learned in terms of player character mechanics yet completely misunderstanding certain crucial aspects of the world itself and its own mechanics. It is a beautiful game in terms of aesthetics, with the best roster of weapons and spells in a Soulsborne as of yet as well as having great visual variety for armour. In spite of this, repetition and poor design plagues the game, especially when it comes to the optional content that, ironically, ends up weighting down on the main experience. Reused areas, bosses and spam of hardy enemies, matched by the occasional overly frustrating dual and triple bosses that in no way complement each other when it comes to movesets, are among the biggest issues, tied with an overall mixed balance that stems from an open world with a haphazard design philosophy that contradicts FromSoft's traditional, closed world cohesiveness.It is a game with a lot to like and hate both, and one's experience will be tied to their own ability to put up with the plethora of issues that take away from the core experience."

Positive,10/10 masterpiece. not much else you can say besides ohhhh Elden Ring.
Positive,"I loved how I can defeat demigods and also slaughtered by 3 rats. Thank you for the masterpiece, From Software!"
Positive,"I am in no way a Dark souls style game player, but Elden Ring has me 100% addicted and would recommend that everyone needs to play this at least once. It is equally frustrating as it is rewarding and the high you get from downing a boss that has kicked your face in multiple times is the best I've gotten from a game in a very long time. 11/10"
Positive,"Starting off, this was my first souls-like that I've actually played a decent amount of. And I'm really glad that it was. When I tried DS3, I kept getting frustrated over and over because I could only take bashing my head against a boss for so long before just wanting to give up, and the fact that the game was so linear made it so that if I couldn't clear a fight I couldn't progress further. With Elden Ring, I don't have that issue, as, if I get stuck somewhere, I can go do something else, like running dungeons, exploring the world, or doing side quests. and then come back when I'm not so frustrated and I've leveled a bit from when I first tried. Because of this, I've been able to take my time doing the different things the game offers and I've had a lot more fun. The world is so expansive it's hard to fathom, it genuinely feels large. Even just looking at the map when I'm halfway through the story, and seeing that I still have so much more to reveal and explore is staggering. The gameplay is enjoyable, and all the different Ashes of War (essentially, weapon skills that you can apply to standard weapons or come as unique abilities on certain weapons) make gameplay varied and enjoyable. Speaking of the Ashes of War, they all feel strong in their own ways, and all have their own builds and situations they can be used in. None of the ones that I've used have felt lackluster or weak, and for the ones I haven't used, it was purely because they didn't fit the style of play I was going for and enjoying. There's a lot more I could say about this game, but honestly, I think the only thing that people look for in a review is whether the game is worth getting or not; In this case, I can absolutely recommend this game, whether you're an experienced Souls fan or new to Souls-like games. It has something for everyone who's interested, whether your playstyle be more ranged or up close, slow and hard hitting or fast and light, or any other things that I can't think of right now. For those who buy this, welcome to The Lands Between, and may the words of The Fingers guide you"
Positive,"Despite poor PC optimization, which I believe will be fixed sooner or later the game is 10/10 :)"
Positive,"friend died before he could play the game, this one's for you bud"
Positive,I think I just played my favorite game of all time.
Positive,"After beating the game and done 100% of all the achievement, I can finally say that it is a good game."
Positive,Just get it. 100/10 perfect game
Positive,"The game violently humbled me by murdering me on the first boss, stuttering on my 2k PC and telling me I ""have no maidens"". All within the first 15 minutes. But the jump button is pretty cool"
Positive,"Putting aside the current performance issues (stuttering), the game looks and feels amazing, torrent handles very well, the upgraded dark souls combat is great, and gathering items in the open world to craft with was a nice addition. Although, I wish there were PS4 controller prompts in-game to make it easier for me to familiarize myself with the button inputs."
Positive,"Technical short comings aside the game is amazing! I highly recommend it. However, I just wish FROM SOFTWARE did a better job with this port. 60fps cap, no UW and a stutter (has been improving with patches) in 2022 is terrible. They are lucky the game itself is so good."
Positive,"I don't think I played the same game as everyone else, it is a good game but I didn't find it perfect and flawless like everyone else is saying in the reviews. It ins't even the best Miyazaki game in my opinion. I like the combat variety, the visuals, lore seems interesting and Torrent is cute (these are big parts of the experience). I don't like how much content is reused and the abundance of boss fights makes it feel like none of them matter (most of them are recycled bosses or enimies). It is really easy to skip an area because this game has no real indications of the order you SHOULD do things, I don't want the game to MAKE me do things in a order but at least it should be clear where I have to go so I don't outlevel all of the enemies and bosses. Also this game has a lot of artificial difficulty, even more than Dark Souls 2 (wow, congrats from software)There's still a lot of things I don't like in this game, but what i'm trying to say is that even with the really bad errors Elden Ring still is a GOOD game, not perfect, but good."

Positive,"Hi I've been playing since the first month of release and have now decided that I don't mind giving a review for the complete game, now that Shadows of the Erdtree has released. This isn't a Shadows of the Erdtree review, I will have done that separately, but all I have to say is that I do wish I was talking about the expansion instead.Elden Ring is a great, cinematic, entertaining, customization trove of a game, yet is an incredibly bloated mess.Classic soulslike combat from the people that pioneered the genre coupled together with unforgettable boss fights (for better or worse) Elden Ring's combat takes the center stage for the game, Together with a oodles of customization; plenty of weapons that can be customized with skills or gained from bosses, lots of shiny or digusting (if that's your thing) armor sets and masks, bunch of perks, spells, sorceries, and everything else you'd want to slap onto your high fantasy action rpg character is here on a massive scale.So why do I call it ""bloated"" if there's so much customization that would take you dozens of hours to collect? I'm a massive fan of FromSoftware games, but admittedly I'm not a big fan of open world games. My main criticism is that there is too much empty space in open world games as they've been released and from what I've played through. Elden Ring suffers a bit from this. Don't get me wrong, definitely at least an 8/10 game, I just don't want to be repeating what everyone else will tell you when it comes to the best parts, the rest of what I'd say would just spoil the fun for you to experience.So what I mean by referring to this game's ""bloat"" has to do with the amount of very clear repeat animations on skills that have entirely different effects, reskinned bosses made solely for the purpose to again, literally bloat the game's 'grand scale', yet sometimes almost ignoring certain endgame areas seemingly in an attempt to rush the player into completing the game.I've played a ton of this game with plenty of build combinations, and I definitely would recommend the game as it is. My gripes however just go to the developers that surely are aware of the problems with the game. My theory is that the game was either rushed at a certain point or the budget halted randomly towards the end of development and many assets were reused. This kind of thing is excusable for workers that have to deal with these problems that end up happening through development, but for the game's overall value it definitely causes it to tick of a point or two.Overall, an amazing experience that gatekeeps the best soulslike experience through it's expansion! Bye! :D"
Positive,I sold my kidney to get Elden Ring.

Positive,woman hugged me
Positive,"I was a wimp and a coward before ELDEN RING... but for only $89.95, my life improved significantly. I became smart, I got buff, I married the love of my life, and so much more. Bless FromSoftware Inc. and this game is the greatest $90 you could ever spend on Steam."
Positive,"I could not possibly recommend this game enough. A true masterpiece. I've had zero performance problems since day 1, but i know it was an issue. I haven't heard anyone have that issue since the updates. This is the game of the generation. Even if you're new to Souls games and FromSoft's work, try starting here.. I promise you will not regret it. Best game in the past many years, and to see a game with such an absurd level of hype not just meet that hype but exceed it is magical, especially with how AAA releases with lots of hype have been the past many years now."
Positive,"Elden Ring is probably the only AAA game that I have bought with 60$ without regretting.I refunded Cyberpunk 2077 right after 3 hours wasted, wasted 1~2 hours of my life during Battlefield 2077  2042 beta, Total War Warhammer 3 only lasted 50-ish hours for me compare to its prequels because the god awful game designs and bugs.But Elden Ring? no game's perfect and this game still got bugs and performance issues yet over 100 hours and I am still having fun, still finding new stuff, the game is still surprising me. I love Sekiro and Dark Souls 3 but I think From Software really nailed the open world gameplay, there are always choices to choose, always decision to make, always secrets yet to be discovered. And finally Faith is somewhat useful and pretty fun to use. Ubisoft can learn a thing or two From Software but they won't.I have only one complaint though.Why is Ranni such a lovable sort? No, really. I think my heart has melted."
Positive,"I played it for almost 100 hours, and it was about 80% of the game before I started to deeply dislike the mechanics, gameplay and content but ended completing it, probably never to return.Get it on discount when you can. It's still a great game but my favorite Soulsborne games will always be DS1 and DS3.The game has one thing I admire: it single-handedly ""debunks"" a lot of the design pseudo-science that AAAs swallow today as if it were self-evident truths.It simply ignores many of the commandments of what AAAs need to succeed, and it doesn't fail because of that, it succeeds even more. That's why you see this phenomenon of Western developers publicly trying to dismiss Elden Ring, because they realize that the game is a threat to a whole design culture that is accepted as absolute truth, but is nothing more than a rationalization, and can be completely abandoned without any harm to the final quality and performance of the game in the marketplace.This worries a lot of people, people whose careers depend on suits believing that in order for a game to be successful, they need to hire these people who will add the right design elements, be it in difficulty, be it in gameplay, be it in the damn user interface. It turns out that these people are basically useless. And Elden Ring clearly demonstrates that."
Positive,"Ran great for me besides one big stutter while on a horse. Otherwise smooth as butter and 60 fps on 1080p, all high. Gtx 1080, i9-9900k, 32 gb of ram. Not everyone’s having issues. Hopefully there’s a solution for those that do.Overall, one of the best games i’ve ever played. Open world Dark Souls with wandering threats, tons of secrets, and gorgeous views."

Positive,"An open world RPG with the typical Souls gameplay. Some new additions add a lot of the basics and the wide open world has plenty of hidden treasures in every nook and cranny. A year ago I was of the mind set that this game might not turn out to be anything special, but the more I play the more I enjoy the game as a whole. Personally, I love the way the game allows the player to do anything they set their mind to. There are very few barriers aside the occasional ""boss that blocks the way"" or ""lock gate requiring some action to pass"". I feel like Fromsoft has really learned how to incorporate all the good ideas from their past Souls games and rolled it all up into one amazing package. If there is one thing this game does well, it's empowering the player by giving them a plethora tools for any which way they want to build their character.  Both melee and ranged combat feels engaging while allowing all sorts of mixes when it comes to build and skill variety. This helps combat the meta builds by allowing for more mix-ups since you won't know what someone has up their sleeve until they slam it into your face. Like any game there are some downsides and failures. The online can disconnect you from the host for seemly no reason which can be annoying when trying to help a friend or just simply invade. Some of the reuse of enemies can be disappointing but overall there is a wide variety of enemies the game has to offer. And the largest complaint currently (I imagine there will be a fix at some point) is the performance issues where you will experience large frame stutters in certain areas most likely do to the game loading assets as you move around the world. I would be lying if I said this hasn't caused me some serious grief and gotten me killed more times than I would like. Overall, I highly recommend taking the time to play through and experience all this game has to offer if you are a fan of the Souls series."
Positive,I hate this game!10/10
Positive,game good i geuss
Positive,Fix the performance.
Positive,elder ring yea
Positive,"Honestly this game is a mixed bag. TLDR there is a lot to praise and there is lot to complain about. Elden Ring feels like the amalgamation of the best of FromSoft also along with their worst. A lot says this is Fromsoft's best yet, commercially, yes, but a masterpiece? F NO, which is a shame because it could have been. Ultimately I admire the ambition of this game but it all falls down to its execution. First off the Positives:-The open world is great and potentially a new standard for the genre, reminds me of exploration BOTW. The lack of hand-holding is great the first time experience. There is also a bit of skyrim in it, the dopamine of discovering a new location, new dungeon, new area is always astonishing, though diminished by repetitiveness and lack of reward.-they really know their audience, fucking maidenless mfs. That was fun-Finally weapons arts are fun as fuck and useful, build variety-Story/Lore/Storytelling/themes/worldbuilding is pretty much the same in previous souls games, but damn this is where i prefer it the most. Feels like the story is not over, makes me crave for more. Maybe a sequel or in the DLCs?-As always they have their cool concepts, Designs and gimmicks. I love all the bosses' designs The Negatives:-Balancing is all over the place, like either boss are way too juiced with damaged and health or i have too much damage and bosses become a joke. The late game bosses are just the worse, they are cool of course, I like the gimmicks and the designs, but it feels like they just ramp up the damage and speed/aggression for them or they have a huge health bar and fucking chase them all around the arena. A lot of times the challenge feels artificial Its doable of course, but is it fun? NO-Too many repetitive bosses and dungeons, at first fighting some of them is nice, then it becomes a fucking chore, or they just cram shit ton of them in a fight. That is just lame design. Reminiscent of DS2, quantity of quality, they didnt really put much into thinking. With exploration of the dungeons its boring, and unrewarding really, especially its really all just the same.-Camera/lock on is still shit especially with multiple enemies-The summons are a mixed bag, I don't find shame in using them, they can be fun at times and there are times it can be balanced, but when your mimic tear just straight up finishes a boss and becomes the punching bag, it just diminishes the boss fights even more with having that as an option. But at the same time you are really tempted to just use it to cheese some bosses because most of them are just a fucking chore to fight. For example, on some duo fights, they are not well designed that they just don't give you a room to breathe and does not encourage the player to study the boss fight rather make them either run around, dodge forever, use summons or just cheese them-Broken builds, Cheese. Come on-Torrent is underdeveloped ffsIn conclusion, its a very ambitious game, making it into an open world was a great step and made in a non-traditional manner. It still has the soul of the ""souls-like"" games, here I couldn't help the feeling that fire fades in here. I would say that they deviated from their philosophy of not dividing the player experience, and this game is real divisive. Making a game more accessible is to other players is a good thing, but that always comes with drawbacks and conforming to what is mainstream.Ultimately I do recommend this game, because they dared to do something new to the table. Elden Ring is definitely Emboldened by the flame of ambition, but is incomplete and shattered."

Positive,- Best game ever made- 420 hours lmao- Netcode is complete garbage- Feet- Game tells you when you've been playing for too long by crashing your computer- Learn to hate wild animals- Learn to hate domestic animals- Laugh at a literal bird with wings fall down a cliff and die- Watch a man with 6 arms use only 2 of them to climb a ladder- Lie down in a coffin and literally go to a better place- Everyone you meet dies and it's your fault- Dung Eater
Positive,"It feels like this game is not from current era: no bullshit collectibles, no cosmetic shops, no battle passes. All the while giving us truly open and immersive world, good fighting mechanics, and non-trivial fantasy story."

Positive,"This is an outstanding game with an epic soundtrack but it can be a bit difficult for new players. I surely recommend it to those who seek challenging boss fights, exciting world design, fun with friends and ability to make your own character with a unique combat style and appearance. Although I've already defeated all main bosses, there are still lots of other activities, quests and places to explore. In this videogame you can ride a horse and teleport using sites of graces to get to a certain place or return to your lost runes. There are also some endings. If you want a specific one, you need to collect all the items for it and stick closely to some steps to make sure you’re on a right way. Guides on Steam can help with that to give you all useful info to accomplish every ending properly. To sum up, I'd say that it's an unusual videogame which undoubtedly will test your strength."
Positive,Friendship ended with Dark Souls 3.Now Elden Ring is my best friend.
Positive,Soul series is a masterpiece with rich content and playability. It is scheduled to be the best of the year this year.
Positive,"Forget about George R. R. Martin, this could be mistaken for any other Souls out there. The same badly told, pretentious (because it seems designed to make us believe it's there and great) story of the others.And while they improved accessibility a little (very little) bit, it's still the same mess: terrible menus, designed for controller not mice, obtuse messages and item explanations, not much to learn from... you will get lost almost 1/10 of the times you get mudered (i.e., a LOT). And still... this game is certainly a masterpiece. The Souls series isn't about good plots and storyline (could be, should've been, but isn't), it isn't about polishing the crap out of commands and interface, it isn't about confort.It's about GREAT gameplay. It's even hard to define what draws us to this game, but I think it's the satisfaction that playing brings. Controls responds how they are supposed to. You can move your character as if this was a fighting game (ok, too much, but you get my point), and it feels great to accomplish anything in this game. Not dying for a few minutes is already a goal in itself."
Positive,"There is a setting in game under SOUND AND DISPLAY > DEVICE FOR ON SCREEN PROMPTS > Choose Keyboard and MouseThere, your problem with ""Controller"" issue is solved."
Positive,You can summon a maiden to keep you company

Positive,Magnum Opus of Hidetaka Miyazaki Elden Ring is a great game don`t let the negative reviews about performance cloud your judgement. If your pc runs this game properly you will have a blast playing it. Otherwise wait till Fromsoftware fixes the PC port. Game doesn`t deserve mixed reviews just because of performance issues.
Positive,"Miyazaki once said he wasn't a big fan of open world games, and would never do them unless he thought it contributed to the game. But did he deliver?Short answer; YesTL;DRI'm always worried about open world games, lots of busy work stretched over large empty spaces. Randomly plopped enemies, ubisoft towers. You name it.This game still has large stretches of places to explore. But it all feels a lot more hand crafted. With little nooks and crannies you want to explore. Because in true Miyazaki fashion, he'll have no qualms with hiding things away where some people may never find them. Questlines in spots you wouldn't expect, caves, catacombs, mysterious footsteps and npc's, great enemy designs and bosses. It all made me just want to explore more of it.And on top of that, you still retain the creative and well thought out enemy placements in the overworld. Using elevations and cliffs to its advantage. Ambushes sneakily tucked away, snipers terrorizing you from up above. And what's new, is the way you get to explore this world. I always was happy and fine with the Souls series, knowing it was focused on its great combat and oldschool explorations of nooks 'n crannies. But never did I expect to have such smooth control over my actions. No more feeling your character snap in place for a backstab. Jumping has become a joy rather than a cursed challenge. And your own horsecow mount is absolute bliss.And on top of that there is a healthy mix of underground catacombs to explore. Caves to traverse with their own bosses. Huge castles to traverse that give me flashbacks to just how big and interconnected the world of Dark Souls 1 felt. But also crafting.. and boy I did not expect to welcome that addition. But they really made it work. No more grinding for RNG humanity drops so you can play multiplayer, now you can just pluck some flowers which are fairly to invite your friends and traverse this huge beautiful world together.Overall I can highly recommend this game. The world and it's setting are wonderful, and the game is challenging and still hard as balls. This is what it looks like to make an open world feel dense and meaningful, and I hope other companies will take notes."
Positive,"Honestly, this game is genuinely one of the greatest experiences I've ever had. I know Souls type games aren't for everyone, but this game somehow manages to nail the satisfaction of exploration and overcoming ever greater adversity, nail the feeling of an adventure, and still manage to be the most approachable Souls game yet (lots of new features like Spirit Ashes that let you tip the scales in your favor).There's so many gorgeous vistas and the world is well-crafted to capture the essence of a freshly war-torn kingdom, full of magnificent architecture, terrifying depths, and a people without direction or hope. The story is fairly par for the course (especially for From Software), but the villain is one of the best written villains I've ever seen.Really, my only lamentations with this game are a few poorly designed boss fights that disappointed and/or frustrated, and the obligatory performance issues, but for me, everything I've loved about this game I've loved enough to forgive those problems."
Positive,Would choose to be hugged again 10/10

Positive,"If you want a difficult game, this is for you, not for casuals..."
Positive,So much fun. Yes sometimes the framerate dips to 30 fps but that is not an issue for me. I survived the original blight town ;)
Positive,"Elden Rings is like a massive, giant, fuck-off butt plug, three INCHES in diameter. you start putting it in, and it's not so bad, but it starts to hurt, and hurt, and you're really not sure if you like it. bit by bit you continue, telling yourself it'll be worth it. it's so painful, you keep pushing through the pain and tell yourself if you keep pushing it'll feel much better - but ultimately you're not sure if you want to stretch that far just so that it'll be comfortable as a part of you"
Positive,"+++++ A lot to explore, all of it very pretty.++++ This is basically dark souls 4.+++ big variety of items, weapons and builds+++ Longer quests with small story arcs (and one great one)++ GRRM helped write the lore and it shows, it is clearly far more coherent and cohesive than previous FromSoft games. Since he's the new factor I can only assume his input helped a lot.+ Jumping, double jumping.+ Ghost spirits in case you don't want to summon people.------ Namco Bandai fucked up the translation on at least one of the endings, completely ruining its meaning.----- Weapon Balance is atrocious, you can quite easily break and ruin any semblance of difficulty if you get your hands on certain weapons early.----- Online Netcode is awful, constant disconnects, desyncing, poor lag compensation, laggy gameplay for everyone I have spoken too.----- No multiplayer content. You compare this to previous entries the lack of covenants is very disapointing. There's really nothing to do in the world with the multiplayer beyond cookie cutter invasions, duels and co-op. By comparison DS2 had white summons, gold summons, blood arena, blue arena, red invasions, dragoneye duels, blue invasions, bell invasions, abyss invasions. DS3 had purple summons to at least bring some interesting variety to the multiplayer. Elden Ring has none of this, not even an arena. Though there are three arenas on the map they don't work yet. From have not said if they will be adding future content as of yet.---- A lot of the exploration feels not worth it, but you just know if you don't do it you'll miss out on something really good hiding away in a random catacomb.--- Weird time progression triggers that can sometimes advance the worlds quests without you even trying or wanting too.--- World lore still has a lot of plothole by design philosophy FromSoft are infamous for."

Positive,"Dark Souls The Open World.The names have been changed to protect the tarnished but for all intents and purposes, this is just more Dark Souls. Is that a bad thing? Perhaps not. Although it would have been nice if they had moved a bit further away from their source material as they did with Sekiro. Instead there is a return to form and the traditional Dark Souls gameplay. A much tighter experience is exchanged for a sprawling open world with vast levels of build options available. Whether or not this is preferable is likely to be entirely subjective. It is certainly grander than prior Souls games. Although by the end, you will be entirely tired of seeing certain copy and pasted catacombs and fighting the same bosses for the tenth time. The game is plagued with technical problems on PC and most of them still haven't been fixed. The multiplayer is also extremely unreliable which would be a bigger deal if there was any gameplay reason to play multiplayer outside of a desire to play with friends or invade for the sake of invading. The covenants are gone and it feels almost like a tacked on feature.The real negative mark against the game comes at the end. Elden Ring leaves a horrible taste in your mouth. It feels as if the first half of the game is well made and each area feels unique. The moment you cross into Mountaintop of Giants and beyond the game stops feeling interesting. You face nothing but recycled enemies and bosses and every area is just tedious. It feels almost tacked on as if the game was meant to end at one point but then decided to continue on for another 45 hours.In the end, Elden Ring is sometimes brilliant, sometimes frustrating, sometimes confusing, and deeply flawed game. It is still a very enjoyable world to explore but you may be feeling quite hollow by the end of it."
Positive,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:6 tablespoons unsalted butter1/2 cup white sugar1/2 cup brown sugar1/4 cup water1/4 teaspoon cinnamon1 pinch salt5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced1 pastry for double-crust pieDirections:Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
Positive,"Elden Ring stands as one of the greatest games of all time, for me at least. Not only is this game very accessible as a Soulsborne title, it promises one of the greatest experiences any game can offer. The game is massive and visually stunning, with masterful art direction. It would be beyond my linguistic capability to articulate their immenseness.The world-building is grandiose, interwoven with captivating narrative and intricate lore surrounding every facet and character in it. Everything that exists has a reason to be there and a purpose to serve. Every place in the game narrates a tale, which made it very rewarding when I stopped amidst the questlines every once in a while to figure them out. It was one of the most gratifying things in the game. I was immersed throughout because of it and it fueled my motivation to complete some of the most arduous of quests.The game has a gigantic open-world to explore, something I enjoyed wholeheartedly as an avid explorer in any game. However, I can understand that its open-world structure may not appeal to all, as I noticed many of my friends losing interest due to it. Nevertheless, it's one of the reasons why the game is very accessible too. The game incorporates numerous quality-of-life adjustments compared to previous Soulsborne titles, which has made the game much more accessible. Moreover, there's a vast array of weapons, items, and skills in the game, which has contributed to it too, while adding a lot of depth to the gameplay. Though one of my biggest gripes was the imbalance in weapon effectiveness. Even after fully upgrading, certain weapons were vastly inferior to other weapons with minor upgrades, which put me at a great disadvantage while playing with a weapon that wasn't 'meta', especially in PvP encounters. Or perhaps that was just a massive skill issue on my part...The combat mirrors that of the Dark Souls trilogy. The boss fights were spectacular, and that triumphant feeling upon vanquishing them always remain unparalleled. While one of the negative aspects of the game's challenges that I just couldn't overlook were the occasional unfair combat encounters, notably evident in duo boss fights. These fights kind of necessitated the employment of spirit ashes for me. Perhaps it's just a massive skill issue on my part again.One of the popularly discussed shortcomings of this game is the decline in quality observed in its late-game areas. There's a noticeable repetition of content. While there's lore explanations for them, that isn't enough to cover up the game's clear flaws. However, these problems were meagre, and the game for the most part has a sheer amount of nothing but pure quality, and it severely outweighs the lacking part. Though I was disheartened when I saw some cut content in the game, I hope they plan to bring it to life with the upcoming DLC.To put it simply, buy this game. I wholeheartedly recommend it."
Positive,Id suck the scarlet rot out of malenia's ass
Positive,Think i'm in love with this game like omg!
Positive,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"
Positive,MasterpieceNow where bloodborne?
Positive,Dying in PVP to people connected from an Ecuadorean hut while they abuse bugs to one-shot you is a certified good time.
Positive,"Being in NG++, I still dont know if I could write a proper review but I'll just do it anyway.1. Overrated because it's the easiest entry to souls series which warrants a lot of new and curious players for the genre thanks to their marketing and the hype people brought upon themselves. The easiest if we were to play the game normally and utilize even just some of what in-game provides us. However, difficulty is subjective, you do you.2. World is unnecessarily large with lots of increasingly dull side contents as you keep playing and some reused bosses/ elite mobs models that might dampen your experience. One might count and argue that they dont really reuse the models a lot but to each their own.3. While exploration is certainly made easier with Torrent and being able to teleport anytime/ anywhere as long as you aren't in combat/ being underground, it isn't any less tedious either given the scale of the map whether you are playing the game for the first time or starting ng+.5. Incentives to play ng+ in ER are almost non-existent outside of doing missed quests, going for alternate endings of quests, collecting missable items, trying different builds.6. 1 hand is enough to count the bosses with designs I really love and enjoy. I love DSs and Sekiro's bosses a whole lot more, but this is something you must experience and compare yourself because peeps like different things.7. Again this is my personal opinion but I think that the worlds in past fromsoft's titles are more intricately and exquisitely crafted than ER's. Try them out if ER left you wanting for more of the genre itself.8. Performance and netcoding sucks, I wrote about this last because I'm sure at this point there are lots of trolls who will just tell you to stop using a potato PC and upgrade your internet too. And there are enough information to go by if you search it up.Despite the flaws, I still recommend the game, to an extent."
Positive,I only got this game because the reformed orthodox rabbi Bill Clinton whispered into my ear on Little St. James Island to buy it and give it a thumbs up!
Positive,"It's like pong for the ""Woke"" generation"
Positive,Elden Ring restores my humanity.
Positive,Despite the performance issues its still my game of the year.
Positive,"Dear FromSoftware, this game has changed my life. My whole outlook on every open world game that exist, In fact in the entire gaming industry. I can never look at anything.This game represents emotions most normie gamers could never comprehend. But I can, Thanks to this game I have been awakened to many things previously thought unimaginable, Thank you FromSoftware for this exquisite game.."
Positive,"This game is GOTY of 2022 because the gaming industry sucks.I honestly think FromSoft messed up big time with their open-world game design. A lot of people say this game is packed with content and therefore a lot of people are going to miss most of the content. However, I think the real reason why people are missing most of content is that FromSoft is being almost as cryptic with hiding valuable gameplay content as they are being with telling the story. That cannot be a good thing because there is approximately zero people on Earth who understood the story of a FromSoft game without coordinating a group effort by gathering the efforts of tens of dedicated players as if they were solving a crime. A lot of ""open-world puzzles"" are physically unsolveable the first time you see them, and a lot of things that seem to be puzzles are actually just things that you should return after finishing some random questline. The game never tells you this and almost never even implies it, so you could spend hours trying to solve a puzzle that doesn't exist. I know releasing this review out to the public is inevitably going to bring some people ridiculing me for being bad at figuring out those things. But no, I am confident that this is a problem with the game. If the game is going to be all cryptic and pretend it is worth analyzing, then it should live up to that expectation by not wasting my time 90% of the time I actually try to analyze it. There are other open-world games (such as Zelda BOTW) that handle the open-world puzzles in an almost-objectively superior way.The difficulty progression is non-existent. All optional bosses in one area will be a non-challenge for you, even if the main boss in that area is extremely challenging in the usual FromSoft fashion. I genuinely don't remember any other game with a difficulty that is as inconsistent as this game.Lastly, no, I did not misclick the ""I recommend this game"" button. It is fun and addictive; it is a FromSoft game, with all the great things that were there in their previous titles as well. If you have heard of this game, then you already heard of many things it does great. However, contrary to almost all reviews I have seen of this game, I think open-world is not something FromSoft managed to handle properly. I think this game is simply more fun if you follow a f'ing guide through the entire game. That is something that is extremely revealing about the flaws in FromSoft's approach to game design, and it is also horribly understated. This is absolutely not one of the best games of all time, and I don't even think it is the best FromSoft game."
Positive,despite some technical issues and some enemies I absolutely loathe this is a pretty big rpg that if you liked from's other offereings you'll probably like. or you won't. I can't ever tell with y'all. Y'all gamers get so disgruntled these days.  please don't hang onto your anger and frustrations. ok i love you good bye
Positive,"What an adventure. Turning every rock upside down and looking into every corner just to become insane from this single question of your friend: ""Did you find this *specific item* too?""There is so much stuff to discover and Elden Ring really shines at the exploration part. It is not easy to make the trade-offs for an open world game, but boy was it worth it.Definitely Game of the Year 2022."
Positive,"A fantastic entry in the Fromsoft line of games.  This game is a blend of all of the great elements of the previous Soulsbone titles.  There are some nitpicks; I would like to see some sort of FP regen talisman, some of the gank fights kinda suck, and there are some performance issues.  However, the only change I really want to see in this game is the removal of Easy AntiCheat."
Positive,"""Try jumping""That's the last time I listen to any notes left by other players..."

Positive,FIVE STARS :: RADAHN FEST 2.0.2.2. FEATURING HEALTH AND SEXY WOLF MAN
Positive,"I want to start with Elden Ring on PC is poorly optimized. I would checkout Digital Foundry's info on it, basically it won't run well on any hardware until FromSoftware optimizes it for DX12. Hopefully that happens sooner rather than later because...This game is a piece of art. It removes all of the guard rails other games would give you and let's you struggle through the weird lands between. It gives you little direction other than the golden path and then teaches you when you're not ready to complete the next part, you're best bet is heading in the opposite direction.Of course the combat is challenging, but Elden Ring rives you the opportunity to literally walk around some bosses. I would even say some are put in front of you early on to troll veteran Dark Souls players to teach them that this isn't the same Souls games. Due to the open nature it's easy to ""git gud"" at your own pace by picking areas close to a site of grace to grind on and practice weapons. A lot of the weapons and builds are super fun and unique. I've only played a couple hours at most of prior FromSoftware games because I struggled with combat, but now I just ride my dope goat horse away to try again later.I love the sense of wonder and travel that this game produces. Just run around wondering ""what's that"" ride over to it and then get rewarded for your curiosity. I also love that in some of these instances you find that door to a mini dungeon and it's nestled in some dark crevice when looked at just right. Sometimes it's a giant troll or a two story tall golem shooting arrows at you. It's never not awesome. I love that it shows, rather than outright tells, some of its story. Seeing the aftermath of a wagon attack and slowly realizing a nearby character who is sitting all alone is the sole survivor was a great form of storytelling that some games wouldn't think to try with their audience.tl;dr - PC needs optimizing. Would recommend for the fun times had with dope goat horse buddy constantly wondering ""hey what's over there!"""
Positive,It's good game. Buy it. I do this for achievement.
Positive,"Extremely overrated, DLC even worse."
Positive,"If it were up to me, Melina would have the most lavish lifestyle. Sure, there’s better looking guys out there but….one day she’ll realize they don’t make her laugh the way I do. She’ll eventually come around and I’ll make her dinner, play her a nice song, sing to her, give her everything I can in the cruel world she lives in. I’d comfort her when she felt down, and forever seek to fulfill her every desire with absolutely nothing in return. I’d compliment her tattoo, and make sure she knew that she doesn’t need to feel insecure about her one eye. Melina, if you’re reading this. Please summon me so we can live forever together. We can adventure alongside each other and start our love story"
Positive,fight die and repeat. fun game
Positive,"Eldening the Ring was never this fun before, 10/10, recommend"
Positive,This ring sure is Elden
Positive,"I played this game for 230 hours, got a partner, showed it to them, broke up, and played it for 231 hours."
Positive,"I have never loved anything in my life as much as I love Elden RingSo yeah, it's pretty good."
Positive,For people who would like to play a good videogame.10/10.
Positive,"Best FROMSOFT game to date, and probably one of the best games ever made. The sheer amount of content and quality present surpassed what I expected. Unfortunately many people are experiencing serious performance issues, which is greatly affecting their ability to experience this masterpiece. I haven't had many of these issues personally, but I pray they are resolved quickly before players become frustrated and write-off the game altogether."
Positive,It's a good game and it is even better to play it without following any guides. I urge everyone to stop searching youtube or googling this and that. It is not that hard if you take your time and relax with any game.
Positive,"Absolutely loving the game, people are having stuttering issues because of the day one patch screwing things up, its unfortunate but fromsoft is aware and will fix it within the week, that being said i have not been plagued by theses issues and this is by far the best souls game ive played and im only 7.4 hours in at the time of righting, the atmosphere is amazing, the combat is fast and deliberate. I personally could not be happier and i know this is going to quickly eat up my life. im 8 hours in and have seen roughly 40 enemy types (not including bosses), have killed only the first boss and only explored the first map area. its gonna be a long one boys strap in.dont listen to the hate give it a week and itll be early game of the year contender.Edit: gonna be game of the year and i absolutely cannot wait for DLC"
Positive,"This game is the best intro to soulslike games. I am a casual gamer and I struggled with DS3 and could not pass the first level of bloodborne, this game for whatever reason made all the components of souls games come together in a way that made sense as well as ensared me in the world. This game brought me the same joy and wonder skyrim did when it first came out all those years ago. A truly free world to explore with nearly countless things to do. When I am not hunting down a new armor set I saw posted somewhere I am coming up with new builds for another playthrough. I spent about 40hrs on my first character when I finally understood what I was doing and begun a new character. I still wait with excitement to return to my first character to play and try to course correct. I cannot stress enough how much fun I have had in this game. This game is not without its flaws, there are some graphical problems I've had, getting stuck on ladders, and certain armors or locations crashing the game. These instances were few and far between and not that much of a hinderence. Most of them can be solved by restarting the game for verifying files on steam. I understand for many this is a line in the sand but for the amount of fun and amusement I have gotten its more than worth it. I hope to see you in the boss arena."
Positive,"I like how a lot of the scumbag triple-a devs will be indignant when hit with backlash for releasing garbage like Bethesda or epic and act like we're the ASS-H0LES, its hard to make a satisfactory product.Then FromSoftware comes in with their massive D1CK swinging like ""Sup? Here's a 10/10, no biggie, see you in another few years with another."""
Positive,Probably GOTY 2022
Positive,Elden Ring destroys you. Over. And over. And over. But it's SOOO satisfying.
Positive,"This game probably has the best combat system out of any Soulsborne game ever. The various weapon arts you can find throughout the game enable weapons you'd likely ignore in other games to remain useful and relevant all the way to the end of the game. It enables you to try many different builds and just really do whatever you feel like doing, and if you get bored of your weapon's' current setup you can easily reset and change it to something else.The world is massive with bosses, mini-bosses, rare mobs and side quests just about anywhere. Pretty much every enemy or friendly NPC you encounter with fancy armor can be farmed from said enemy/NPC, or found somewhere in the world or rewarded to you. Same with their weapons - there is a ton of weapons and you can dual wield just about anything with very polished combat associating it compared to past game's clunkyness. I initially thought bosses were overtuned and had various moments of being seriously tilted, but upon reflecting I think everything is meticulously balanced. You *will* die a lot, but you can also make bosses regret getting in your way too thanks to things like the weapon arts or ash summons allowing you to be just as unpredictable as them.Something that is an especially great quality is the amount of freedom you have. You can go in just about any direction you feel like and find useful things or fights you may regret challenging. Admittedly it felt overwhelming at times with how much exploring I had available to me but it made the game so immersive. The story is yet another original and likable tale that you will most definitely get absorbed into. I fully expect there to be tons of theory videos and the such for years to come.This game also has a ton of polish when it comes to quality of life:1. You can edit your character in the main hub unlocked early on, or through an NPC later on.2. You can change the time of day.3. Dual-wielding powerstances for you instead of having to manually enter it.4. Enemies, animals and I believe (some) plants respawn endlessly so you may farm to your heart's content.5. Miracles/Pyromancies/Sorceries have been streamlined to where sorceries are their own thing, and miracles and pyromancies are now ""incantations"" that require the same tool to cast them, while sorceries require a traditional staff. Incantations and sorceries are also way, waaaaay stronger in this game than most of the others.  6. Multiplayer is also a lot easier to engage in through the summoning pools that plop down many signs, but can still be found around different spots too if manually placed there. You may also use the password system to ignore typical level restrictions and play with your friends no matter how much stronger one is over the other. There's also the ability to enter different group information to have messages, summon signs and bloodstains from that group show up more in your world.7. The flask system is the most generous out of any game (at least if I recall right it's been years for many of the games) in regards to how many doses you can have along with how potent their restoration is, but this is more balance than quality of life I suppose. The most important thing though is to understand that you will die. A lot. You'll be sitting there thinking you have the boss of the day's number, and then it whips out a random extra attack on its combo that catches you off guard. Many of the enemies in this game are also capable of punishing your rolls, being greedy, being cowardly with a shield or running away to try and heal. I genuinely think it's the most challenging combat out of all the games, but also the most satisfying when you do win. 10/10 in my opinion they really took past concepts and enhanced them for the better while adding new stuff to keep it fresh. Well worth the money and time to invest into it."
Positive,Worse than Dark Souls 2
Positive,i've spent about 6 hours on just customizing characters..
Positive,"I've played Dark Souls 1 and Dark Souls 3 but never completed them. Elden Ring is my first FromSoft game I have gone far in and even defeated Melania. This game is fun but the boss designs are disrespectfully poorly designed. Like utter garbage when you compare it to Sekiro or Souls bosses. In previous games they were difficult yes, but they were fair. I felt accomplished when overcoming hurdles and felt rewarded. In Elden Ring when you defeat something you are just glad it's over. Sad really. Only bosses I felt was amazing was Godfrey, Radahn and Melania. It might sound like I hate this game but I love it, it's healthy to criticize games you love. I realized why it feels more RNG and why the bosses just feel like they have too many cheese. It's because I refused to use the tools that are available. I beat Melania without a summon and with a pure Dex katana build out of pride that ""I have to beat her without a summon/no magic"". Elden Ring is not Dark Souls, the bosses will cheese you and it will be RNG sometimes. But use what the game gives you, level past 150, use summons, cracked pots, respec, mage, cheese builds, etc.  Be resourceful because sometimes, pure builds just get shit on with the bosses in Elden Ring. And thats okay."
Positive,"Drop in the bucket, but this game really falls apart in the last 20% or so. I mean really badly. Later boss AI is very cheap with characters who many players feel may not have been playtested fully. You can get 100 hours easily of an amazing game, but beware, the last part is recycled enemies and bosses who suddenly do far more damage, and come in packs. Melee vs magic is hideously imbalanced, and summoning is required for many bosses, something I didn't do in previous Fromsoft titles. Your awesome mount is basically taken away thru many late areas, and the enemies begin to rely more and more on cheap tactics and input reading.I don't think reviews covered this problem because it's so late in the game, and some folks don't mind the last parts, but many of us Dark Souls fans have a bad taste in our mouths from it.Edit: I stand by my review, but changed it to a positive. Why? I got 120 hours of great, jaw dropping fun, with 20 hours of cheap filler at the end. It was still worth the purchase, but the end game issues I cited are still in full effect. You make the call, but I am glad I played it.Tough but fair went out the window, and I'm pretty disappointed in Fromsoft."
Positive,tongue but hole
Positive,"1000000% amazing game, ive never been a big souls player, I made it up to about half way through dark souls 2 and the main thing Ive struggled with in it is the feeling of being lost or not knowing where to go next.this game has no issues with me for that. there is a map, there is location markers. and there is never nothing to do. I have to say im about 45 hours in at this point and probably not even 30% done with the game and have enjoyed every second of it even when dying."
Positive,"I really enjoyed this game. I'm a fan of FROM's games, so while I was confident they'd make an good game, I was worried that the move to an open world format would diminish some of their other strengths. I think instead they were able to show new strengths, creating an open world that will be a new standard by which to compare others going forward.The gameplay is much like other FROM games, though I did appreciate the effort they made to make it more varied, and even in their own way make it more accessible through additional gameplay options. Between the many new options in this game like Spirit Summons, and the resurrect ability in Sekiro, you can tell FROM has been looking at ways of giving players alternative methods to overcome the difficulties in their games in smart ways that don't compromise their design and aren't a bland difficulty slider that changes the game globally. PVP seems to have improved feature-wise, however the times I have played it I found it to suffer from a lot of lag. It's hard to tell if this is caused by players or the game, but it's extremely common and makes PVP less enjoyable than it could be.I found the bosses to be overall easier than in previous games, with some notable exceptions where it seemed FROM was almost making a point to show they can still make a hard as hell boss fight when needed.The world design makes incredible use of scale, and the areas have a good amount of variety, both in terms of types of environment but also in terms of the enemies within and the content density. The first few areas are packed with places to explore and things to find, while some of the latter areas are a bit more sprawling and sparse. I didn't care for some as much as others, like the blinding snowfield, but with so much, that's bound to be the case. The enemy variety is worth noting too. Someone recently counted them up and found that Elden Ring had more enemy types than Breath of the Wild, AC: Valhalla, Ghost of Tsushima, and Horizon Forbidden West combined.The emphasis on open world does mean a bit of a step down in terms of the small scale level design. Many of the past games, Dark Souls 1 in particular is renowned for its incredible interlocking vertical layered approach to the world. Elden Ring does have a bit of this in spurts in areas the community has taken to calling Legacy Dungeons, but not quite to the same extent. The graphics are a huge step up in quality for FROM. Basically look at any screenshot of the landscape and it would probably make an amazing wallpaper. FROM has always had a good artistic eye for presenting the player with interesting focal scenes, and having an open world just allowed them to do that all the more. Characters designs are largely the same as past games. Passable, but not their strong suit, particularly with the faces. And as ever, the character creator is very difficult to work with, perhaps even the hardest boss in the game.The UI is very much a FROM software UI. There are some quality of life improvements, like sorting and some better presentation of information, but it is what it is.The armor is very cool, but for all the variety I kept hoping there would be more. Maybe it’s a case where there's just never enough, but knowing how big of a deal fashion is, I keep hoping they'll lean into it more. The armor alteration system is interesting, but it almost feels like it wasn't fully fleshed out, as in most cases (with some notable exceptions), it's just about removing the cloak. In the future, at the least, it would be nice to see color palette changes as an additional option.As far as the lore of the world goes, this is probably the best realization of FROM's style of presenting lore in the abstract but discernable through the world and items you find, and the lore of this world is very interesting to learn about as you go through the game.Quests are a bit of a mixed bag. I enjoyed the content of the quests, such as there is. I'm not opposed to FROM's typical minimalist quest design. FROM tends to not treat quests as traditional RPG quests, but more as fleeting ephemeral experiences with characters, and things you do in the world may or may not advance your relationship with them, much like life. I get that. However, there is also a good argument to be made that it's still a game. At the very least if you're going this route, with a system where the conditions for advancement are not transparent, then you need those quests to be reliable, flexible, and bug free, and I feel like in the game's current state this is lacking.Many times there are quests that behave in unexpected ways, or only via exceedingly strict conditions. For instance, I had one quest that would not advance until I had rested at one specific site of grace. No other site of grace would do, and this one was not obviously associated with the events. I had another case where a bug preventing a character from speaking with me, that had me spending time trying to figure out what I was missing (fortunately this was fixed in patch 1.04).I kind of wonder if a lot of the non-mainline quest content was added at the very end of development and that's the cause of these issues. I get that feeling because even as of the most recent patch, new stages to quest chains are still being added, which is pretty unusual. Unfortunately, combined with the previous issues, this also leads to problems. There is one new quest line with a new character announced in the patch notes that I am unable to even begin because of a non-quest related action that I took before they were added to the game. In short, I'm open to the way FROM designs quests, but I think they fell short of what they were going for.Ultimately, these complaints don't detract from the overall experience which is still pretty amazing. I highly recommend this game and look forward to future DLC."
Positive,"This has to be one of the best culminations of the whole ""Souls Franchise"" FromSoftware has been putting together. It feels like the elements of every game they have made so far have been pieced together to create this game. Along with this, it brings it to the next level being totally open world and filled to the brim with content. Since this is a continuation of the souls series, this game is still quite the challenge and feels similar to Dark Souls III in my opinion.In comparison to the previous souls games, this game is more forgiving with allowing for more variety in combat, however, to counteract this they made bosses more aggressive to take into account the new summoning system. In attempting to reach a wider audience of players, they had to make many of the bosses revolve around fighting multiple foes. This can cause a problem of balancing issues for those who want to run solo without the help if they wanted to.However, this game changes it up with how you approach the bosses. In previous titles, the mechanics of every fight would usually boil down to rolling and hitting, but now there is horse-riding, jumping attacks, a plethora of spells to cast, summoning and much more. I think that there is a huge emphasis on using all of the tools at your disposal because as you progress, the bosses will start to use different attacks that can't be killed in a certain way, causing for necessary readjustments in playstyle.Dungeons, caves, mines, and other kinds of loot are scattered across the world in various amounts allowing for so many different builds for your character. With this game being open-world, exploring feels not just necessary but rewarding for finding ways to progress further. All in all, I think this is a solid game, but I hope they don't follow this same path of having to make use of spawning multiple entities to win boss fights in the most effective way.(Sidenote: Performance issues at launch were terrible and I averaged around 30 FPS in the beginning area. While this issue has been mostly fixed, whenever I enter new areas I get huge dips in FPS until I reboot the game and have the new area loaded in.)"
Positive,"Even though the game has some performance issue, it's still an exceptional game. This game has all that they have learned from all their previous titles as well as some new exciting things!"
Positive,i am the elden ring
Positive,"I normally take Gaming Journalism less seriously than I take a child's opinion, but in the case of Elden Ring they got it right. This game is insane. Everything about it is a joy. I've spent about 40 hours in the game just exploring Limgrave, the starting area, and every time I go back to an old area I thought I'd cleared out I'm finding more things to do. It's enough like a Dark Souls game to feel familiar, but it's also unique enough to be worthy of being it's own thing entirely. All the things I love about the Souls games are present, from Challenging but fair combat, Deep Mystery, incredible set pieces and a deep system in which to build a character. On top of this you add a massive open world to explore, hidden secrets and puzzles, I can't rave highly enough about this game."
Positive,"Comments are allowed on this Review.I honestly don't understand why everyone is belly aching about 60 FPS on this game.Lower your settings you dingbats. The people who are complaining about optimization just need more copium so they don't feel bad that they can't run everything on max.If frames mattered that much, go lick a window. The window will not stutter no matter how much it would like too.Today, 0.75 million people played this game. Some for over 10 hours. That's 6$ an hour of fun right there.You will get your moneys worth from this game.It is fun REGARDLESS of how many frames you drop.Personally I think it's a solid game, co-op or not."
Positive,"Despite the issues of optimization and poorly designed end-game bosses, this is actually a really good game. Exploration is even more rewarding and satisfying than Dark Souls at times and the world map has lots of variation to keep things interesting."
Positive,I was super hyped for this game and I was really hoping it would live up to the hype. And surely enough this game has. I could not for the life of me put this game down and this is easily game of the year. At points the challenge seemed to much and I grinded and came back and destroyed it. One of the best feelings I have ever had. This is my favorite game I am not sure what could ever top this. Some bosses were meh but the good bosses which are pretty much all the demi-gods were a 10/10 Masterpeice . this entire game is a Masterpeice and thank you From soft for allowing me to experience this.
Positive,"Graphics: HighEndPCStory: ""That which commanded the stars""Multiplayer: Coop is amazingI give 10/10 with happiness in my ''soul'':Elden Ring is an open-world souls series type made by FromSoftware.A few months ago I played Dark Souls 3 and I really enjoy it and I made a very great decision to pre-order Elden RingThe entire map is huge with a lot to exploreWeapons are outstanding and sorcery and incantations are amazing !Enemies are insanely hard to deal with but it's alright because that's what Souls Games are, right ? :)All and all this game is a pure masterpiece and I recommend with pleasure !"
Positive,"Just like any other Souls game in the series, there is something so lovingly hated about the best and worst parts of this game. Your cookie cutter favorites will never live up to the hype of this title. A mash up of all the desired pieces of gaming history has created a hodgepodge of pure bliss. Love or hate the title, it's a game that has truly become the foundation of ""Souls-like"" titles. Never has there been such an accessible title in the Souls franchise that many can enjoy to their heart's conten---  YOU DIED  --- as I was saying, this game is great. Let's start with the mechanics: thoroughly improved over some of the older classics. Crafting? Got it. Death? Pffft, it wouldn't be a Souls game if your monitor didn't have the words YOU DIED burned into your screen. Ashes of War is something relatively new to the franchise. Customize your favorite weapons to better suit your build. Scale your weapons to fit your attributes, and voila: you have a recipe for pure chaos. They have expanded on some of the earlier concepts, turning this title into the mega-ultra-super --redacted-- version of what a Souls game could have been 15 years ago. It truly hits home in so many aspects that I was engulfed by it's Flamed Frenzy for 200+ hours before I finished the game. In fact, the game is so accessible that people who would generally hate titles like this, or maybe even hated Souls games a decade ago, are now playing this game and realizing, ""Hey, this game is HARD AS FUCK. But WOW, I killed that boss after 15 tries and it FELT SO GOOD"". It's Euphoria to say the least. The open world has really garnished a new set of players that, to be honest, would never play a Souls game. Now that there is an enormous player base, there is more love to share when---  YOU DIED ---- well, I  think you get the picture.Masochism, sadism, religion, destruction, it all behests the title of Elden Ring.But honestly, do YOU have the balls to become the Elden---  YOU DIED  --- ....um, ya. I think you get it.<3"
Positive,Good game ahead.
Positive,"Elden Ring. Oh Elden Ring. My beloved Elden Ring. Where do I begin? If I recall correctly, it all began on launch day. As an avid Miyazaki supporter, I was sure to pre-order the game and viciously slander all of the people who doubted the game online. There was one fellow online who explained to me that ""Dark Souls just wasn't his thing"" and that ""he understands why people like it, but he would rather play a game that he enjoys"". Well, when I heard this I just simply could not believe it. I quickly found all of his social media profiles, and realized that he posted a photo of himself at his college. Big mistake buddy. So I did what any real gamer would do and I contacted the college board and told them that this gentleman was actually an incredibly abusive boyfriend, and someone who used racial slurs incredibly frequently. This got him immediately barred from his college, and I followed him online as his life continually went down hill. His family rejected him. His employers fired him. He had nothing left, and soon he became a husk of his former self. I laugh to this day knowing what I did this to man, knowing what he told me that fateful day. Well anyway, I was patiently waiting on my porch for the mailman to come for what seemed like forever. But when he did arrive, there was not a single package addressed to me. Now this couldn't be possible, so I argued with the mailman that someone had to have done something wrong. I quickly pushed him aside and entered his truck, opening boxes upon boxes until I found a copy of Elden Ring addressed to my neighbor down the road. I snatched it and left the truck, only to be snagged on the collar by the mailman. ""The hell are you doing!?"" He screamed. I smashed the game over his head, knocking his back momentarily before I tackled him to the ground and brutally beat his face in with the package over and over again. Eventually his skull caved in and he stopped moving, but there was one large problem: The disc had been destroyed in the process. I soon realized that I had used my copy of Elden Ring to end this mans life. I looked around, noticing that there were witnesses all around me, so I quickly ran into the garage and got in my car. Where would I go now? Where COULD I go? My face was visible to everyone, and it was only a matter of time before the cops began looking for me. But I had time, and I had a purpose. I needed Elden Ring. So off to Best Buy I went, and soon I arrived. I jogged into the store, only to be met with the screams of customers as they looked upon me. Why were they screaming? I looked down, only to realize that my clothes with dripping with the blood of the mailman. I sprinted towards the game section as the employees began to call the police. Elden ring... Where is Elden Ring!? Then it hit me, like a light shining from the heavens above. A single copy of Elden Ring, just for me. I grabbed it and hugged it, blood falling onto the sleeve and all. Now I just had to return home and play the game. This wouldn't be easy, though, as the police had just arrived. I sneaked over to the computer aisle and grabbed an iMac off the shelves, then quietly hid behind one of the shelves. The police entered and began searching the area. In particular, there was one officer all alone near the aisle I was in. I came up behind him and continually slammed the iMac over his head, then grabbed the glock from his holster and shot him in the chest five times. Well, this alerted all of the police to my location, and a firefight soon occurred. Bullets were traded back and forth, flying throughout the store and destroying precious electronics in the process. It was at that moment I had been shot in the leg, and I fell to the floor. They began to surround me, but not before I took out two more before succumbing to the continuous lead entering my body. I would die with a copy of Elden Ring in my arms, just like Miyazaki intended. It was a perfect way to leave this world. And one day I too will rise as a tarnished."
Positive,"Game journalists, one and all... Bear witness!"
Positive,"As a long time Souls fan this game is everything I hoped for and more. What Fromsoftware managed to do is take everything good from previous instalments and throw them together, while allowing the player to choose the playstyle they like most. This is no easy feat and while the balance can be off at times, Fromsoftware still managed to do it well enough for it to be an engaging and truly open ended experience that rewards creativity and experimentation.Storytelling:Elden Ring manages to lift the vague storytelling from previous instalments to something that is a bit more digestible and understandable without ever losing that esoteric edge souls games are known for. Quests are less difficult to understand, their consequences on the world are clearer and characters even point you in the right direction to help you in your search (unless they want to trick you). It's impressive that none of this clarity breaks away from the storytelling Fromsoftware is often praised for. The themes, lore and motivations of characters are still vague as ever, but they managed to craft a layer on top that. A more straight forward thread that helps the player intuitively grasp what's up and what needs to happen.Exploration:The exploration is truly engaging and has many mouth-drop moments. I'm about half-way through the game (I think) and already experienced countless moments that made me go: ""Did they actually went out of their way to make that? That's insane."" There's also no sign of these moments slowing down, or becoming less as the game progresses. In fact, the longer I play the more these moments seem to pile up and intensify. But there is something that does bother me, which brings me to a closing critique.Critiques:I believe the game copy/pastes bosses a tad bid too often. This doesn't have to be a bad thing (for example: the mini-dungeons), but when you're fighting a boss that feels significant and  legitimately gives you goosebumps, meeting that boss again messes with their aura as a unique entity in the world and can forever ruin your first encounter if it's done poorly. This aura is important because it immerses me in the world and makes me believe the boss serves a purpose within it. When that boss appears again without a clear reason, this aura evaporates and my immersion takes a hit. While this is not necessarily bad, it requires a good explanation that the player can intuitively grasp. For example (spoiler for DS1), you find out the demon bosses in Dark Souls 1 are just enemies that clawed their way up from Lost Isalith, which flips the aura from the boss being imposing to the place they came from (it's unfortunate then that they dropped the ball in designing the place). This grounded approach is required, because the aura of the boss has to do with direct emotions the player feels while they stare in the mouth of adversity. Elden Ring, just like Sekiro before it, drops the ball a tad too much when it comes to this principle and it sometimes leaves me scratching my head as to why they just didn't cut a few of these boss copies from the game.Lastly, the performance issues still seem to be there, but are becoming a bit less frequent for me with every patch that drops. I have faith Fromsoftware will manage to (at least) make the game's stability passable in the near future as they have pointed out to know what causes the issue."
Positive,"Easily one of the best open world games I've ever played and quite possibly one of the best games. Even with the technical issues (FPS stuttering and such), it's still extremely enjoyable. I just passed 100 hours and haven't finished the story yet, but other games, I would've gotten bored around the 50-60 hour mark, sometimes even the 20-30 hour mark. I just wanna keep exploring and going."
Positive,"""First off, you don't have the right"""
Positive,"Comrade FromSoftware remains based by making everyone's game run poorly regardless of their pc specs, therefore achieving perfect balance and fairness among the playerbase by offering them all the same experience. GOTY"
Positive,"Best game I have ever played hands down. Customisation is on point, and the difficulty of facing bosses makes the game incredibly fun to play. World building and fantasy lore is on point."
Positive,How to Play Elden Ring:-Get mad at a boss-Threaten to destroy property-Google the fight-it magically worksRepeat
Positive,try finger but hole
Positive,"Masterpiece, i have played all of the souls games made by fromsoft with the exception of demon souls and bloodborne because of ps exclusivity and i think elden ring is just the best game that fromsoft could offer.I dont have the greatest pc and played the game at medium graphics, i suffered a lot of stuttering (almost never in boss fights) but the game captivates you so well and is so much fun that i just dont care that my pc is crying.Overall i think elden ring will get a patch that fixes the stuttering problem, i will continue to play it till i get 100% and it will probably get GOTY as well."
Positive,"OOOooohhhh Elden Ring Elden Ring is a game developed by the folks over at From Software, and directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki, a man who started taking more pictures of himself rubbing his chin and looking thoughtfully into the distance after Dark Souls came out.And also Yui Tanimura, but the joke doesn't work if I mentioned them as well. You play as the Tarnished, someone who had lost grace with the Erdtree and banished from the Lands Between. But now everything has gone to the toilet so now you're being beckoned back to fix everything because of course you are. And so you embark on an adventure to become the Elden Lord, and put everyone who stands in your way into the dirt.Elden Ring, also known as Big Dark Souls, is an action RPG with combat and themes similar to previous Fromsoftware games from 2009 onward. Not Armored Core, though, you don't get a new one of those. I don't know how I can explain combat outside of you try to not die and smack things with a sword/axe/spear/club or light them on fire, or turn their bones to dust, or hit them with an arrow or crossbow bolt. You got a lot of options for murder via self defense in this game. Unlike previous games, Elden Ring is flat out an open world instead of a larger, connected one. You spend a lot of time hoofing it on foot or via mount to get to where you want to go. The main theme is exploration here, since the game doesn't tell you where you have to go.It just SHOWS you where you have to go. With large, noticeable landmarks and even a little arrow created by the Grace that says “This way, stupid.” There are no check markers or anything like that, but you can manually mark areas on your map so you don't lose your way. Area's are distinct and unique from one another, and the draw distance goes so far that you can see and keep track of landmarks from great distances.What I'm trying to say is you have to actively be trying to not know where to go. Bosses go anywhere from a total blast to a complete slog, though I'm pretty sure it changes depending on what build you're going for. There are bosses I had to cave and summon a friend for, but most of them you can probably just fight through if you're willing to adapt. But its always funny to just be minding your own business when some regular dude with a sword shows up specifically to start problems. Elden Ring is kind of the perfect Dirk simulator, as in you wander in random directions and pick fights with strangers. I liked -most- of the areas I had to go through, and finding catacombs was also fun for the time I was actively seeking them out. There are some things I don't like, though.For one, it feels like the enemies are pulling some fighting game crap and reading my buttons sometimes, although I don't know how true that actually is or if its just me being paranoid. There's also a gross reuse of certain bosses, forcing you to fight the same dude a couple of times. But sometimes their stronger! OR THERE ARE TWO! Either way, it can be disappointing. Also, this might just be a Dirk thing, but I was hoping all the underground stuff would be longer. Once I found the ant hill that led to a ruined city I was hooked. It does that thing where the deeper you go the more messed up everything gets, especially with the implications and other horrid shit you can find down there.Elden Ring, in a sense, was the Dark Souls game I wanted. Big world, lots of stuff to hit with a sword, and random dungeons I can just explore and rob. Its probably not my favorite game of 2022, but its up there. Oh my god, its 2022. There's nothing I can say about this game that hasn't been said before. I wish it wouldn't randomly stutter at times, and From really needs to work on its online exploits and balances. Its fun to explore, fight, and its fun to play with friends, so if those are all your check boxes, then hey, good to go!Elden Ring gets 9 Names that are too similar out of 10.Special, big boy hugs and kisses thanks to ViceVerscant for gifting me Elden Ring while I was picking through garbage to find Burger King Coupons. Hey man, you're the best.Octopuses have three hearts.  Oooooohhhh, Dirk's Ring"
Positive,"So. Where do I begin? Elden Ring.Elden Ring is a combination of all the work and learning FromSoftware have done during the making of the Dark souls, Bloodborne and Sekiro games. They bring in a large amount of the positives of each games and combined them together. They then proceeded to mix it with open world and a New Story. Mechanics wise, it feels good, the open world aspect was done well with it not feeling empty or over crowded and having the first boss somewhat diffecult for new players coming into the series was a odd choice. Overall Elden ring on the other hand has do alot of good things, Infact its one of the first games in a long time thats got me stuck in and wanting to play for days on end. Hopefully there will be Dlc to see how better they could make this game.Overall if someone wants to play this and have no experience with simialar games? maybe but if you have any of the souls games. I would recommend this game.Currently there are tech issues like pc frame drops and bugs. People have been complaing about 60 fps cap but uncapping it can have negative results in the game in general. No widescreen support? well theres a few problems that can come from widescreen support. Overall a great game. generally deserves the notice its getting. Honestly the Scale of the Open World is insane.If you wondering what my pc specs are while running this at medium at 60 fps with some stutters from loading new areas and pc problems. The Game isn't fully optimised yet.i7-7700k 1070 gtx 16gb ddr3 2600 1TB Corsair M.2So if you have a similar pc or better you shouldn't be having many problemsGOTY? Yeah. Its GOTY. (Just ignore the performance issues)"
Positive,"This is my first experience with this type of game and although I found dying over and over frustrating at first, the game grew on me as I got better and I'm now addicted. It has its flaws but what game doesn't? Recently I've been spending money on games that I quickly regret but this time I think I made a good choice and it's worth the money."

Positive,Even if there was a white screen - we continue our search of the Elden Ring
Positive,"First off: ""Elden Ring a wonderful looking game"".I was skeptical regarding the open world aspect but after actually playing it, i have to say, it's actually fun and a nice change.Does it feel like previous souls title? Yes and No.We can actually jump up things now, thats crazy!Jokes aside. It's is a nicely crafted game i do enjoy it a lot.Now regarding the performance, i am playing on PC and except for having a slightly better CPU than recommended i am fulfilling those requirements. Do i have stutters in game? Little to none, the game runs fine for me on high settings.I read other people having performance issues which might be true but for me that is not the case, i am guessing the performance issues might be resolved in the future, so if you wanna lay of the game until then go ahead or get it now and see how it works.(Feel free to keep any gRamAtical iSsues for yourself :P)"

Positive,"It's REALLY good.... and I HATE ""Souls"" games. Imagine."
Positive,"The game is just beautiful! This is my second souls game and it feels a lot better in combat than Dark Souls 3. Unfortunately it's also a lot easier than DS3, now I understand why people that have played that game says this is a lot easier. I have seen a lot of gameplay of this game, maybe that why I know a lot of bosses mechanics already. So the only one that Im  worried about is Malenia.  If I manage to beat her, then my goal is to 100% this game!"
Positive,"My first souls game, it's pretty fun so far. I love the world building, the open world is massive, doesn't feel like copy-paste. If this is your first souls game, it has a pretty steep learning curve and I had to use a couple of guides (e.g. how should I play my class) and there is a lot of items that are essential and easy to miss.All in all get this game, it's great."
Positive,"Now my favorite FromSoft game. TL;DR here: Phenomenal and rich combat, beautiful world packed with secrets, dark and twisted story that is never spoon fed to the player. The game does have some performance issues. It runs just fine, but on the borders of loading zones, the game WILL drop frames even with a beefy computer.Phenomenal combat, taking elements from Demon's Souls through Sekiro. The stance system brought in from Sekiro is the highlight of the combat. The game truly rewards heavy attacks. Torrent, the player's steed, offers another layer of combat mechanics. There are many styles of fighting to master, and the game offers the player the opportunity to explore different styles throughout the game.Fighting in this game is difficult to access, and the player won't make real progress until at least a moderate level of mastery is obtained. There is a boss that serves as a filter, and the player cannot progress through the story related dungeon until they have some level of knowledge. However, the upside of this is that the skill ceiling is very high. I have well over 2000 hours across their catalog of games, and I was not able to stop using my shield until nearly halfway through the game. I am very stubborn, though, and if I had tried different methods of play I would have had much more success. In many ways, Elden Ring is more difficult than any FromSoft game, but also easier than any other because of the numerous options the player has.Beautiful world full of challenging enemies. Less linear than any FromSoft game prior, and done beautifully. The player is encouraged to explore and rewarded for it. There is also a massive plethora of completely optional content that hides incredible levels and bosses. Level design is fantastic, including looping dungeons with many paths of progress. Tons of clever shortcuts, including around story dungeons. Wandering in the Lands Between is challenging, often terrifying, and always rewarding. Spend your time collecting items and finding new parts of areas you have already been to, and you will unlock even more of the massive world.Story in Elden Ring is presented to the player much like it is in the Dark Souls series. Item descriptions and careful observation will lead the player to draw their own conclusions. The player is faced with choices that have impact on the story, and these are not minor choices or impacts. They all contribute to different endings, only one of which I have experienced. Deep and rich factions will present themselves to the player, and it really is difficult to know which one is 'right'. The story is dark and disgusting at times, and many characters are mere hollow husks of the heroes they once were. There are scarred battlefields of stalemate wars, and these battles are explained through item descriptions.FromSoft rewards skilled, observant, and curious players. This game is not for people who want a casual game to wander in. This game is for players seeking to challenge themselves and explore a dark and twisted world at their own peril. This game won't be for everyone, and that is okay.(spoilers), Blade of (spoilers) is the most challenging, rewarding, and beautiful boss I have faced in a FromSoft game. This boss alone could make this game go to second on my list of From titles.Elden Ring currently has what many would consider serious performance issues. Loading zones have been an issue for FromSoft in the past, and this game makes those issues quite apparent. When on the junction of a few loading zone borders, the game can drop frames like crazy. I have a 5700xt, and at high/ultra settings under good conditions at 1440p, I get a stable 60fps. In heavy combat with lots of enemies, the framerate is still stable. The framerate issues are entirely down to loading zone borders. FromSoft is not a lazy company, and I am confident that the issue will be improved over time, but it is present currently.I rate this game a 9.5/10. If it performed correctly all the time, I would rate it an 10/10. This is my favorite game in my steam library.Edit:I have now played an additional 240 hours, and done some thinking.I think that this game is objectively better than any Souls game prior, including demon's souls. With this said, Elden Ring is also perhaps my favorite game ever, and my least favorite Souls game. I realize that these are contradictory, allow me to explain.This game is phenomenal, for all the reasons listed above. I feel that as of patch 1.06, the game is quite well balanced and quite bug free, especially for a game of this scope. If we think of other large scale AAA open world games, like Skyrim or Cyberpunk, the state of the game currently is much more 'finished' than either Skyrim or Cyberpunk, especially after only 6 months. My overall rating is a solid 10/10, it is a highly refined masterwork.Since it is a masterwork, it is not my favorite souls game. I lack that absolutely charming and endearing feeling that DkS1 gave me, and Demon's Souls gives me the same nostalgic fuzzy feeling. DkS2 is obviously a diamond in the rough, and DkS3 is even better than DeS or 1 or 2, but I didn't like it as much. Just now, after struggling with how to phrase this for months, I have come up with a sentence to summarize some semblance of a sentiment.Something about having an incredibly powerful formula and framework already developed removes the creative challenge of developing a new framework to fit the narrative of the game. The penultimate SoulsBorne formula found within Elden RIng constrains From's creative genius to its own creative framework.With the existing Souls formula, refined to micron-perfect polish, all they could do with Elden Ring was make Big Dark Souls (TM).However, this level of polish cannot be put into a one-off game like Demon's Souls, Dark Souls 1, Bloodborne, or Sekiro. The magic is lost on me, since I have seen all of these things that exist within the Lands Between before, in one way or another. The erdtree? To me, it is a really big golden stone archtree that exists above Firelink. I've seen the Darkmoon Greatsword more times than I care to admit. I've slain countless From dragons, I've seen plenty of Curved Greatswords, you get the point. I'm not talking about reused assets or anything like that, they save the developer time and money and improve the game, if used correctly and sparingly. Using prior experience only serves to make a better game. However, Blizzard and Activision and Bethesda have already lost me as customers as they are completely unwilling to do anything new. I am sick of this creative rot that needlessly and inevitably consumes everyone who becomes successful. FromSoft is quite literally the only horse left in town, the only studio with the balls to say ""F U"", consequences be damned. They made the safe choice with Elden Ring, and the safe choice is rarely the correct one. I love FromSoftware, from the bottom of my heart, and that is the only reason I criticize them so harshly here.There are moments of brilliance here. The boss fights, the ones that don't gank you with a recycled enemy, are so refined that they may be the best I've ever experienced. Sekiro may still take the cake, but ER is close. They can adapt to a variety of playstyles very well, and the game was built with this in mind. Torrent is the one moment of brilliance that I can really say ""Yes, they pushed the limit of what they knew, and did something completely novel, and made the game better because of it."" All the other game mechanics, narrative elements, discoveries, and moments? I feel like I've seen them before. They feel comfortable and known.FromSoftware can do so much better, but because Elden Ring is literally the culmination of 12 years of mastering the same formula, they cannot do better than Elden Ring while stepping outside familiar framework. It makes me sad."
Positive,"Short version is it's just Dark Souls 4 with jumping and a horse. Long version is that it's one of the most in depth games I've ever played.The world itself is so detailed that you can easily miss little secrets and dungeons. The environment is beautiful and numerous times I've had to check what time it was while playing. I have just gotten lost in the world exploring. If you are a souls vet, you should already be playing this. If you are on the fence, give it a try as it is easily one of the contenders for game of the year already, and its only March. For the PC issues, yes there are stutters, but they aren't that bad and as long as you have your drivers updated you should be fine.Also for the record, I don't believe anyone saying they are beating the game in 60 to 80 hours unless they are following a guide or skipping all of the content that makes this game special. For reference, I have just completed everything in  Limgrave , and have only beaten the first major boss. I have explored a little bit of  Caelid (red area to the east)  and have just went south to  The Weeping Peninsula . I am almost at 60 hours and have barely scratched the surface of this game."
Positive,best game ever made
Positive,Despite dying a lot i having fun exploring this beautiful world!
Positive,"If you like difficult games or souls-like in general: that is 100% amazing game. It's a MUST play for you.If you don't like the aforementioned games - that is 100% NOT for you. There is no in between. You either like these things or you don't.I'm a youtuber, so I had to buy and try this game even if I'm not a harcore player and souls-like is my nemesis.And after 10 hours of playtime I had to give up. So I paid 6Eur/h - that is not cheap. In general I just got too tired of dying over and over and over again every 5 minutes. It is very beautiful game with amazing atmosphere, but if I ever play it again - I will download a difficulty reducing mod and play on pussy difficulty like a boss. This is 100% a masterpiece. But not for everyone."
Positive,"I'm revising this review after putting in a ton of time while using Flawless Widescreen and the Seamless Co-op Mod. While I'm still disappointed with the glacial pace of technical improvements and the missing features, I still think this is one of the best open world games ever made.I think going forward this will be used as the new benchmark for open world design. The same way Witcher 3 is a high water mark for writing and quest design.Almost certainly my game of the year. Just wish FromSoftware put as much care and attention into the engine and PC port as the rest of the game."
Positive,A magnificent game for magnificent people
Positive,10/10 game i love everything about it

Positive,beeg dark sole
Positive,The game is great. If you've played FromSoft games before you know what you in for but the world is bigger with a lot more weapons to play with. If you haven't played a FromSoft game before this game isn't easy. This game is going to put you up against fights that can only be won not buy out leveling a boss but dodging at the right time and knowing the range of attacks. YOU WILL DIE and that's ok because you can win. Plan ahead learn what you can and apply it. This game is a great challenge.

Positive,"Love it and the vast amount of things to explore and do, and the world that was created, but it's not without its flaws.For those looking for something fun and challenging, with a butt ton of exploration, Elden Ring is well worth the price, and you'll get your money's worth in terms of time spent playing the game.The game also heavily encourages you to experiment, try out different weapons, and find what you like after some time with the game, so you're not ever locked into one build as you can re-spec once you get to a certain point, and there are many tools provided for you to succeed and really play the game your way."
Positive,its good (i will take back what i said about the game)
Positive,"the first souls game I've ever played, currently 33 hours in and loving it"
Positive,Densely filled open world where there's always something new to explore. The fights are challenging and rewarding. It caters to players who enjoy a challenge.

The deaths, figuring out strategies, different types of weapons, the boss battles are just awesome and insane!!!!! I can play more hours of it, and I always want to play more!!! It is such a great game, and I now know why it won game of the year!!! I have just bought the DLC and can not wait to conquer it as the ELDEN LORD!!!!!"
Positive,Elden 'try finger but hole' Ring
Positive,game has turtles. i like it.
Positive,"Every time I think I'm relatively done with the game, I find 10 more miles of area to explore and new enemies to defeat. Most expansive open world game I've ever played."
Positive,Dark Souls meets Skyrim. Great game.
Positive,No idea what happened at any point in the story but it all looked cool and gameplay was fun. 9/10
Positive,"Do you have masochistic tendencies? Do you *think* you do, but aren't sure? Do you want to develop them? If you can answer yes to any of the above questions, you've found your perfect match. This game will have you giggling like a madman as your 214th ""You Died"" floats across the screen. The death music will haunt your dreams. Yes, you will dream about this game, that's not optional. You'll play it so much and get sucked so far into its gorgeous world and game play that it will absorb your life. If you've had any experience with a ""Souls""  game in the past, you know what to expect and what you're getting into. If FromSoftware doesn't immediately cause your heart to palpitate at the slightest mention, congratulations, you're fresh meat and in for a lovely treat.This game is as long and large as you let it be. (That's what she said?) You can always (try to) rush through the main story line, kill all required bosses and secure your less than stellar rushed ending in a relatively brief time period, depending on your death count of course. Trust me, there WILL be a large death count. Or. And hear me out. You could actually take the time to enjoy the game and easily spread it over near 200 hours as you accomplish (nearly) everything in one go. This isn't completely possible though, due to different quest lines giving you several better ending variations that clearly you can't achieve in one run.This isn't one of those games that brags about having 100+ hours of game play only because it adds in quest NPCs with unlimited fetch quests. There's none of that here. I'm pushing on 100 hours now, a tad over level 100, missing a LOT of the bosses, both optional and story related and I'm still stumbling on new places to explore and new NPCs to talk to. Elden Ring doesn't fluff up and pad its running time with anything frivolous. We don't do that here. It would rather add in meaningful death trap filled areas, designed to make you need a warranty on your keyboard and/or controller as it trolls you with death messages.TL;DR - You Died."
Positive,"The writing on the tin says ""Dark Souls, but open world"". And you get exactly what it says on that tin, give or take a few quirks. And it's a rare case of an open-world conversion done right.The combat is the same old soulsborne system that you've already made your mind up about whether you like or not, with some extra tweaks for variety. But what Elden Ring really excels in is the open world of exploration it wraps it in. Strong art direction coupled with intruiging writing make for sights worth seeing, and the reward loop for exploring is borderline addictive. Every single little cave, camp, crevasse and keep has its own boss and unique item as a reward for beating it, making for a ludicrously large assortment of builds to go for. This, of course, comes with the standard high difficulty attached. But in practice the spikes of hardship make for satisfying goals to work towards via leveling.There are other sharp edges, however, that you'll need to acclimate to. In a bit of ""have your cake and eat it"" design, you'll be showered with lots of weapons, but you'll still need to stick to one and upgrade it. Which can get really boring over the course of a hundred hours if your moveset is narrow. Some items and spells are balanced around PVP instead of solo play. Which can, unintuitively, lead to upgrades being downgrades in practice. And you won't be able to tell until you've invested a lot of resources into unlocking or upgrading them. There's also plenty of things to watch out for that will make the game harder if you're not aware of them:1. The game is designed for co-op. The bossfights are tuned to be challenging even when two players are bouncing aggro between them. Which means that if you're playing solo, your summon is a part of your build as much as anything else. And forgoing it makes things exponentially harder.2. The game expects you to explore and level a lot. If you try to just stick to the critical path to beat it as quickly as possible, you're in for a rude surprise in its later half of the game due to the sheer amount of damage enemies deal there.3. Not all builds are made equal. Your experience will vary a lot based on whether you have a ranged attack, or are going melee only. Especially since some of the bosses are so big that being in melee range means you can't see their swings.But all of those aren't necessarily shortcomings. Think of them as an indirect difficulty setting. You can go for the easiest approach in each scenario, or you can self-impose challenges for extra thrill. It's just a mindset thing that you have to be aware of going in. Other than that, the game is sublime. You'll encounter the odd glitch and weird physics interaction here and there, but other than that it's way more polished that you'd expect for the open-world genre."

Positive,"Great graphics, great gameplay. Flaws are small enough to be overlooked, or do not detract greatly from the experience. 10/10 game.(DLC reviewed separately as it is large and pricey.)"
Positive,"this game realy makes you go ""oh wow"" at the map design and the realisation that almost any and all things you can see in the far distance you can reach.. the combat fits to well with the dark souls games wich i realy likeand i find it realy difficult wich is exactly why i play it! thanks a lot dev team for a game i realy enjoy so far"
Positive,"This is one of the best games ever made.but some GRIPESi havFromSoftware's Dark Souls 4 is the 7th game in the Dark Souls series and is like Dark Souls 3 but you fight each boss 5 times and they're all like Dark Souls 1's Manus fight but bullshit.Its less about dodging and hitting at the right time, and more about using the mimic tear to tank the 50 unblockable attacks, and then spamming spells from far away.It wants you to use many different means to defeat enemies. its a shame then that when you find out what works isnt very fun or challenging. Using the new mechanics often feels like a crutch for the difficulty rather than being a challenge. ""In our games specifically, hardship is what gives meaning to the experience."" - miyazakithe hardship in this game is the challenge you put upon yourself, as what you use determines the difficulty.i think this is how the game is meant to be played, exploring an open world to get more OP stuff to make the fights easier.FromSock has a formula that never fails, and this is no different... it has all the great parts from the other games but in an often unbalanced and unnecessary open worldelden bing 4/5"
Positive,"First Souls Game I could actually play and have some success. The world is amazingly detailed and continues to draw me back in constantly and consistently. I originally told others to avoid this game but I take back what I said. This game is a beauty and a masterpiece and dont be afraid of death, embrace it, learn what you did wrong, and just try again. The feeling of downing a boss is unmatched. The art music and design is one of the prettiest and scariest things I have played in a long while and I am constantly screaming WTF as i encounter each new monster. I want to see everything this game has to offer, even though I dont know what 99% of what I pick up is useful for. If youre hesitant, wait for a sale, but dont sleep on this one. You will want it in your library. GLHF and Safe Travels."
Positive,"For those who was waiting, the time has come! The amazing review of Elden Ring Experience!First of all, i'm a fromsoftware fan, but i was not sure what to expect of this game in special.For my absolutely surprise, it is way better than any expectation. This game is much more than a new open world RPG and a Fan Service for souls like series, it's a warm hug for someone who like or not this kind of game. For someone who was asking if Elden Ring will be or not the GOTY, we don't need to worry. Even most of the most important critics says that the game it's just a ""Complete Masterepiece"", and if you join this wonderful and complex, beautiful and amazing new universe, you will agree with all. The famous combat mechanics from all prequel company series will be all mixed and improved im my opinion. The variety of bosses will make you spend hours trying to follow those movements and patterns, a absolutely chaotic dance, aways a epic feeling. But if you're not a hardcore gamer, you can just explore the beautiful and vast open world (a real immersion), ""git gud"", have a variety of new weapons, miracles and sorceries to make your gameplay a bit easier. There are so many options that you will be impressed for sure.There are a few problens, like little bugs in areas and the coolest hourse that you get (ty elden ring) and some frame drops and crashes. But to be honest, it doesen't affect the immersion that much, the game it's just to awesome and nice that you will not judge that few problnes during the entire gameplay. I have actually 20 hours of gameplay and the game just gets bigger and bigger, new secret areas, npcs, side quests in places don't 'cause there so many things that datails can be missed, so you can go on new game + and explore those little secrets like your first try.A special Thanks to Miyazaki and his team for this game. A 10/10."
Positive,"great game if you enjoy being sadjokes aside great game btw, trust me"
Positive,The experience I had with elden ring was equivalent to how it felt to play dark souls 1 for the first time in 2011.
Positive,Feels like a masterpiece but 10 years ahead of its time.
Positive,"L + MAIDENLESS + NO RUNES + TOUCH GRACE + UNGRAFTED + INVADED + PARRIED + SCARLET ROT + ONE-SHOT + YOU LEVELED DEX, not accurate? dont care. didnt ask, plus youre tarnished. Maybe, JUST maybe, if you got rid of that yee yee a** pot on your head, you'll get some maidens on your spindle."
Positive,"It's definitely one of the greatest games ever made - one that seriously raises the bar for other developers moving forward - and has elements from all the Souls games, BloodBorne and Sekiro. More than that, though, is that it has one of the best and most beautiful open worlds ever. This actually feels a little like Morrowind, in that there are no quest markers and you are actually given DIRECTIONS instead, like: ""head north along the road out of the forest and take the animal trail that veers to the right."" So, keep this in mind and get some paper ready for notes. There are also Zelda and Shadow of the Colossus vibes all wrapped up with that Souls combat, character building and the many boss fights - along with a LOT more lore, characters and story than your typical Fromsoft game, and all of that is incredible as well. George R. R. Martin's presence is definitely felt in the names and themes going on in this world.In less words, it's incredible and filled with jaw-dropping moments that keep you wanting to play more. It's also much, much larger than you think when first going in. 9.8/10 - for performance issues, a few bugs and 1 minor nitpick (the inability to even look at the map while an enemy is aggro'd.)"
Positive,"Breath of the Wild had a baby with Dark Souls 3.Magical. It's everything I was expecting and then some!Other reviewers are right, there are significant frame drops and even stuttering in open areas where the game has to render a lot of content. It's not acceptable but it does stabilize after a bit.I thoroughly enjoyed the 5 hours I've played so far and I've died at least 30 times already but so souls game has ever been more encouraging to keep trying again and again. It rewards your persistence. But you always have the option to not engage in a fight if you don't want to. It's an open world.. go around and find other ways to get stronger and come back!"
Positive,"Edit2: I think they finally fixed this cpu 100% issue in the newest 1.05 patch. I alt-tab multiple times out of the game and game worked fine. There're still stutterings and all but at least it is playable and i do not fear to alt-tab out of the game anymore. And because of that, im changing my review to positive. Edit: I found out why that cpu 100% issue happens. It happens while playing on borderless fullscreen and you alt+tab out of the game. After that, game is basically unplayable.Also those are my pc specifications: RTX 3060, ryzen 5 3600, 16gb ram, Windows 10 I really don't know what to say. On the one hand i really enjoyed this game, but on the other hand some things are just bad and it took my enjoyment away. Elden Ring is basically a combination of all previous souls games made by From Software, and i really like that. It has mechanics from previous souls games for example: Power stance from Dark Souls 2. I was really hyped for the game, i even platinued previous games from Demon's Souls to Sekiro.I completed the game multiple times, got all achievements, collected every single weapon, armor piece, talismans and so on.I really enjoyed most things. Game is beatuful, all places look fantastic, the art style is top notch. But unfortunately game has many problems. My main problem is that the game works like sh*t. It has terrible performance. The game stutters basically all the time. There are many fps drops. CPU goes into 100% for no reason at random moments, even while standing still. Even on ps5 the game had many fps drops and stutters (i don't know how it works on ps5 now, i was playing on day 1 patch). Another thing i really don't like are boss fights. Elden Ring has over 100 bosses. The thing is that you will fight with the same boss for a few times. Sekiro had the same thing, but you would fight with same boss just twice. When i saw Crucible Knight for the first time, i was enjoying the fight, it was not hard but also it was not easy. The bad thing is that you will fight the same Crucible Knight or Watchdog few times. I would rather have less but more unique bosses, because it really feel's lazy at times. There are also really unfair fights like duo bosses in the game, for example: Crucible Knight Duo. Also all those enemies really have long combos, and after they're done then maybe you will hit them once or twice. While in ds3 for example you could hit them during combos to punish them.  Another unfair boss is Malenia. She has that waterfowl garbage move that will obliterate you. Even souls veterans said that this move is extremely hard to dodge. She does it in random moments so many times you will not be able to run away in time. Many of her moves have power armor, and because of it you can't stagger her. She can even cancel her own attack while our character can't do it. It's really cheap boss, too bad it was advertised in trailers etc. and then we get this.    There are also input problems. Sometimes our character will not attack or roll. Roll has a weird half of a second delay and when you get hit, game remembers that you pressed dodge button and our character rolls on his own and because of that we can get hit again. I died many times because of that and it is really aggravating.Overall, the game is really good, it's nice to just explore big open world. Even though the game has many problems i was enjoying it. But i can't recommend it right now. Day one patch worked better, it had fps drops but that's all. Patch 1.04 has those cpu problems. Very often it is just unplayable, and the only fix is to restart a pc. I really hope From Software will fix the performance. When they fix it, i will change my decision.Sorry for my english"
Positive,"It's hard to put your hand on that which isn't visible, let alone describe it in words. That... thing that Elden Ring leaves with you when you finish it, the carving on your heart, and that bliss in your mind, the fun you had, the horrors you came across and the joys you experienced, the ones you met foes and friends alike. It's indescribable, but it can be described... felt... and beheld if you assume the role of an eyewitness to the ushering of a new age, at the foot of the Tree, where an excellent game was made, and where the stuff of legends was forged... and shattered."
Positive,This is soooo goood!
Positive,This is just amazing! 140 hours in and i still feel there's so much to explore and do. Simply a Masterpiece! Be wary of strong foe. No liar ahead.
Positive,Maidens*editGame needs more maidens. Where is Bloodborne PC.
Positive,No better feeling than touching grace
Positive,"Beginnings can be rough, but if you stick with it, it's a really beautiful experience."
Positive,I got all achievements and I'm still maidenlessEDIT: the Reformed Orthodox Rabbi Bill Clinton DLC is also worth a buy
Positive,"Beautiful world, interesting enemies, can summon wolves, awesome weapons and quite good armors. With those aspects I already love this game, I will go through many NG+ and I will be waiting for DLC's."
Positive,This game is magical. I almost feel sad after every encounter because I know I'm never going to be able to experience it for the first time again. Fingers crossed that the game keeps throwing this amount of god tier content my way as I progress.
Positive,"I do really love this game to bits, one of the best FromSoft put out, the only issue is that the pc port is horribly optimized like every other souls game released on pc (dark souls prepare to die edition?) with constant stuttering and freezes which allow the enemies to easily kill you."
Positive,"Elden Ring summary: Bunch of people are racist to you because you are a tarnished. You get mad cuz racsim bad... so you decide to kill them all one by one and become their king. You may find a blue multi-armed doll waifu along the way as well. You may also decide to kill a feisty one armed ginger who has a brother complex.In all seriousness, open world dark souls is probably the best game I've ever played. Instead of wasting your time here reading my review, you should be playing it.Rating: 10/10Recommend Price: full price is worth itedit: deserves to win GOTY"
Positive,one of the best games i have played in some time
Positive,"The best souls game, finally dethroning Dark Souls 2 for the crown. Its been a long time coming old friend."
Positive,This game is pretty good.
Positive,TRY FINGER BUT HOLE
Positive,"After hitting over 573 walls due to every sign telling me ""secret path ahead"" over the course of 120 hours, I can now confidently say the internet was a mistake."
Positive,"sigma fromsoftware PC version-no ultrawide-60fps cap-game stutters-graphics settings that are designed by someone who doesn't care about their job-no fsr-no dlss-poor implementation of dx12 overallThe game itself is fantastic tho so play it and stop being annoying. Probably the best souls game to date.EDIT: I've done a few things to alleviate the stuttering and it happens a tiny bit still but better than nothing. Its also worth mentioning that I'm now getting low performance with particles and passing through foliage. Here's what I did: 1. Go to Windows bar and search ""Graphics settings"". click on the settings icon there and browse to eldenring.exe and set that to high performance.2. Go to Nvidia control panel. Go to global and set Shader Cache size to unlimited.3. I didn't do this but may work: Windows key + X —> device manager —> software devices —> right click disable Microsoft Device Association Root Enumerator - credit u/CrossbowJohnson"
Positive,I completed the ritual and 100%'d this game. Now put Bloodborne on PC.
Positive,Great game; a natural evolution for the Souls-borne franchise
Positive,"After 500 hours of gameplay, acquiring all the achievements (legit) and hours upon hours of painful PvP experiences, I am finally making this. The game is beautiful visually, the world is very well done, however, exploration feels unrewarding ever so often. The difficulty of the game varies in an odd way. I breezed through 90% of the game, but then ran up against a brick wall. Get past the wall and the game is easy again. Fromsoft reuses enemies and bosses so very often, it gets kinda old killing reskinned versions of the same soldiers. The standard soldiers/knights are used 6 times (Godrick, Cuckoo, Radahn, Leyndell, Mausoleum, and haligtree) and they are so very common. The game crashes at least twice a day for me, and I far surpass the requirements. I understand that some of these issues derive from the open-world aspect of the game, and many other games suffer from it as well. I know that they can’t create 100 different enemies for every area of the game, but it still bugs me. I know this sounds very critical but I absolutely loved the single player experience. I desperately wish I could play through this game blindly again but I can’t. So naturally, I turned to PvP. To clarify, I am a souls vet. I have countless hours doing PvP, countless victories, and countless deaths in the souls franchise. Not to toot my own horn, but I am far better than the average player, winning 3v1 fights consistently. This game's PvP is a huge let down for me. First, no covenants. Minor gripe. Secondly, hosts can only be invaded in one of two ways. Having a phantom, or using the Taunters Tongue. Invaders get four choices. 1v1 (by a host using tongue), 2v1 (Standard invasion), 2v2 (Host uses taunters tongue with a phantom) or a 3v1 (another standard invasion). So all of these are against the invader, except the 2v2 option, which the host has to activate, and has the power to remove. So it blows my mind that hunters exist. You can be 3v1’d, kill two phantoms, then get 3v1’d again by the hunters, and get no backup. Imo, a host with 2 phantoms should warrant at least 2 invaders. Third, the connection. Disconnections are far too common. Lastly, this game has by far the most atrocious balancing I have ever seen in my life. Countless near one shot abilities and basically invincibility with a speed boost (looking at you, bloodhound steppers). It is nearly unplayable. Players win countless fights with absolute ease in PvE and PvP by spamming an over-tuned ash of war. I know the ashes are over-tuned because fromsoft has already issued nerfs to ashes that are completely overshadowed by some of the current game ashes. That's just the ashes of war, that's not including the spell spam, or the dual wielding one shot builds that exist. The list of things just goes on and on. The cherry on top are the hackers. The anti-cheat does absolutely nothing. I run into stat hackers constantly (hackers who give themselves unacquired levels). Wielding powerful sorceries, incantations, whilst using extremely high strength requirement weapons, wearing the heaviest armor in the game and maintaining an insane healthpool. Then there are the blatant hackers who just don't even try to hide it. There's the AFK farmers as well. Most of this boils down to the community just meta scumming the game. If you are a genuine souls player looking for a good time in PvP, this is not the game. If you do PvP… Prepare to Die."
Positive,Among the best that Fromsoft have made; at its peak are my favourite areas and fights that Fromsoft have made ever.There are some issues in the later game like Godskin Duo for example.
Positive,Had to reinstall windows in order for the anti-cheat to stop crashing at start up. I think this game is awesome if you can get past the jank. No judgement if game breaking issues are not worth the effort.
Positive,Try fingersbut hole
Positive,An amazing game with tons of new discovery with every new playthrough of the game ! DLC WHEN?

Positive,A complete and addictive game worth the priceGame of the decade (:
Positive,hidden path ahead
Positive,Legendary developer From Software did it again. I've been a fan of From Software since King's Field 1 USA. Flawless legacy. Always count on From Software.
Positive,"10 hours in, and this is far and away the best open world game I've ever played.  There's little stuff everywhere.  And the best part is that when you find some enemies they aren't just boring trash fights, they're Souls fights."
Positive,lost 60k runes and countingcried 2 hours and counting10/10

Positive,buy it. then buy it again. then buy it for your playstation and your xbox. then buy it for all your friends. give them all of your money because they deserve it.
Positive,ooooo elden ring
Positive,one of the greatest game in all time
Positive,"I spent roughly 2.5 hours riding a horse and being chased by giants, double jumped up the side of mountains , and met Santa Clause. 1000000000000000000000/10"
Positive,"Don't listen to these naysayers.. They've gone hollow.  This game is precisely what the core audience of From Soft games want.  It's takes a lot of DNA from the souls-borne games, a little bit from Sekiro, and sprinkles in the open world, while still having classic souls style areas (shortcuts, etc). It could be a bit more optimized, but I get a steady 60fps with a 2080, not many drops at all after turning off AA. For some reason a large audience of players who dislike soulsbirne games in general got hyped for this game and then upset when they didn't like it.. Oh well.Prithee be careful"
Positive,"Let me preface this review by saying this is my first FromSoftware game. I did my research, however, and I had a pretty good idea of what I was walking into before I bought the game. It does not disappoint.Gameplay:This game is hard, but you probably already know that. So unless you're some sort of gaming god coming from the future, you'll die a few times. If you're like me and this is your first FromSoftware experience, you'll die a lot.That said, dying in this game feels like a part of the learning experience -- the more you play the game and find out about opponents' patterns and weaknesses, the less you find yourself looking at those dreaded red letters spelling your doom. It embodies the good old ""git gud"" experience without being too punishing, because it is an open world game. But more on that later.Overall, gameplay is amazing. The controls are solid, there's approximately a million different ways to approach every situation and it feels very rewarding when you finally kill that boss that's been mopping the floor with you for the past thirty minutes.Graphics:This game is proof that you don't need the absolute latest and greatest top of the line graphics to look beautiful. Even though it doesn't have super mega detailed textures or ray-tracing like some other AAA games, Elden Ring more than makes up for it with its art direction -- it's absolutely flawless. Really. Everywhere you look, the game not only looks stunning but it also makes sense. Everything is there for a reason and it creates a very cohesive aesthetic that just works. Every region has its own quirks, so places feel different from each other, but at the same time they're all held together by this consistent art direction work. This game is gorgeous and the attention to detail never ceases to amaze me -- even the paintings on the walls look great. Solid 5/5 here.Sound:Sound is another big win for me. The soundtrack is 100% in tune with the rest of the game: it pulls you in, connects you to the world and kicks in when needed. Most of the time it's a very subtle (yet very atmospheric) tune but there are also some amazing compositions to be heard during boss fights. I found myself listening to the soundtrack on its own just for fun.Everything else in sound design also makes sense and gives you clues on how to play the game. Small things like the sound when an enemy is killed or when you land a critical attack are very satisfying.The World:Elden Ring's world is huge. At the time of this review, I still haven't seen all of it but it is indeed gigantic.You'd think it gets repetitive and boring after a while, but there's always something new to see. I find myself going back to places I've been before to do another round of exploring (which by the way is easy to do thanks to the very convenient Fast Travel mechanic in the game) and I end up finding stuff I missed the first time. The world feels lived in and rewards you for exploring.Like I said previously, all areas of the map feel like their own little map because there are specific characteristics to each one, but somehow the developers made it all work together. It really is a masterpiece in world design.Story:On the story department, there's a few cutscenes here and there, but for the most part, the game doesn't tell you much about it, leaving it up to you to find out (if you want to!) through NPCs, items and the world itself. Speaking for myself, there's still a lot of things I don't understand about the story. While I still haven't finished the game, I have a feeling that it won't tell me everything about the story without making me go the extra mile and work for it. Personally, I'm a fan of story-driven narratives so I wouldn't mind having some more explanation on what's going on, particularly on some parts of the game.Replay Value:Oof, where do I start? I'm 62 hours deep, on two different saves. So far, they feel like different games. That's how good the replay value is. You can be a mage, you can be a tanky guy swinging a huge sword, you can cast incantations and use magic weapons... the options are endless. You will play this game more than once and it will still feel fresh and new the second (and probably third and fourth and fifth...) time.Bugs:I've had a few frame drops and stuttering issues here and there. And I died randomly once while climbing on my horse. So while it's not been a completely flawless experience, I'd say these are acceptable little bugs (that the developers are working on, btw).Is this game worth the money? From a first time FromSoftware player, the answer is hell yeah! It doesn't hold your hand, it makes you work for it, but it is extremely rewarding. And comes wrapped in a beautiful package with some of the best art direction I've ever seen in a video game. This is a game for gamers. Buy it."
Positive,"With Bias towards the Dark Souls series: This game is the epitome of everything beloved about the Dark Souls franchise. It is a gorgeous adventure, full of over a hundred hours of content all spanning from the high points of the series we've come to know and love.Without bias: This game is difficult, but rewarding. The world is massive, there's tons of content and the adventure will be rough, but worth all the effort. There are multiple ways to play in combat from hacking and slashing to slinging amazing spells, dual-wielding nimble weapons or you're classic sword and shield gameplay. This game has quickly become one of my favorites, it is highly addictive and very hard to put down!"
Positive,"Brutal but fair, exploring and the combat are incredible, even if you're not a souls veteran you'll enjoy if you're willing to put in the work to get better gear, level, and find cool items. Anti-cheat causes crashes and gives framerate issues but that aside flawless game"
Positive,best game of 2022
Positive,11/10 would love to get sniped by Lobsters
Positive,Get rektGet betterKill bossGet rekt by small bird
Positive,im having fun accidentally
Positive,"I haven't pleasured myself to many games prior to my wife leaving me but after I laid my eyes on Melina, I just knew that I needed to spend the rest of my government cheque on a body pillow [Link below ;)]. After hearing the voice of Giddeon Ofnir the all knowing in my walls, I knew that I needed to stop taking my schizo meds as he fills my insides with knowledge. Don't let my hours fool you I have 4k hours on PS5 and majority of those are looking at Rennala""s feet, Lord I have sinned. The only lord in my life is the Elden Lord and boy o boy does the Elden Lord deliver. I no longer miss my wife and kids. I have thrown out all paraphernalia like photos of my first born and other meaningless objects like birth certificates. CPS can have them for all I care. Melina and I are like no other couple, our love is comparable to nothing you mere mortals have ever laid your pathetic eyes upon. Everytime Melina and I are alone together, she comes up with crazy thoughts of pleasure and proceeds to puncture my virgin hole viciously until I succumb to the pleasure of the Astel butt plunger. Miyazaki needs to acquire someone with my prowess and build an Elden Ring Erotic Boutique so that real fans of Elden Ring can pleasure themselves too. The only thing I am not impressed by is Miyazaki having the gull to make Melina fully clothed and NOT EVEN SHOW HER SWEATY FEET!!?? That is borderline criminal and i would hope that he would fix that in the shadow of the Erdtree DLC.""Arise Ye Tarnished""https://www.aliexpress.com/i/1005004698197427.html"
Positive,The real bossbattle is not losing your sanity and stopping yourself from suicide.
Positive,"10/10I can understand people are not satisfied with stuttering and frame drops here and there. However, while I have issues like stuttering too, they are not game-breaking for me and to be honest it is so easy to look pass these minor flaws.The combat, the story, and environment, the level design, the music, all perfect. Just like what we would expect from From Software.They do seem to like to put big boss monsters in tight limited dungeon space though. And it seems they like copy and pasting bosses here and there too (You will see similar boss which are just usually bigger version of their dungeon counterpart).While I personally still enjoy Sekiro's combat system more, the combat system in Elden Ring is 34572093x better than that of Dark Souls 3, and that alone would make me want to keep playing this game.TL;DR: Minor performance issue, almost perfect everything else."
Positive,"Fantastic game, stunning and incredibly massive world, some hard-as-nails bosses, but plenty of tools and options at your disposal to tackle them. The sense of wonder in this game is astonishing, as youre free to do and go as you please, with very little handholding. Its a joy to explore it all, and there is always something new to discover around the corner.I'm not even usually a Soulsbourne player, but this game just dragged me in like few before."
Positive,"Best open world game i ever played!dab on them ubisoft, horizon and battlefield hater devs"
Positive,"I will be revisiting this review later, but 10 hours in and I'm having a great time.  This is one of those few games that I can recommend at full price.EDIT: I have beaten the game, and have played for 75 hours.  Time for a more comprehensive review.This game is a fantastic entry point into Souls for people who bounced off the series before, while still managing to be a top tier entry into the genre for those who were already on board (such as myself).  The open world is expertly done, taking many lessons from Breath of the Wild and improving upon it with a better reward structure for exploration, tense encounters with many different types of adversaries, and a wide possibility of builds for your character to progress through the game with.The sense of discovery found in this game is near unmatched.  Every major area feels unique in both visual aesthetic and gameplay requirements.  Quite a lot of time and love went into making it a joy for players to stumble into areas that were much grander than initially perceived, and those moments just seem to keep coming.  Like all Souls games, Elder Ring has its share of secrets areas and bosses that many people will never see, even after hitting the credits.  While I encourage you to explore actively, I would also advise you to not look up those secrets until after you complete the game, and let your first adventure in the world be truly your own.  Trust me, you will have plenty of resources without having to resort to any walkthrough."
Positive,"Try Finger, but hole."
Positive,A modern classic without equal.
Positive,"This is probably one of the best games (100% best soulslike, sorry Nioh 2 :<) i ever played. I really can't think of last time i had such blast with AAA title. There are minor things i didnt enjoy like few stupididly overpowered enemies or few gameplay features like horse combat, but overall - open world and such exploration works amazing in soulslike formula.About perfomance, I personally didnt have problems with stuttering or frame drops (I did crashed 5 or 6 times during my playthrough), even more my rig is below minimal specs and i had stable 30fps on high settings. I highly recommend, even to new souls players.And Ranni best girl, best ending."
Positive,"Elden Ring was my first Souls-Like game, but it has completely changed my entire outlook on modern gaming. I have beaten the game, after almost 100 hours, and I still haven't even gotten close to 100% the game. The only ""main"" optional boss I haven't killed is Malenia, which almost broke me.Summary - Here is a summary of my review as most people probably won't want to read the entirety of it. Elden Ring's World is absolutely stunning, and filled to the brim with content. It's gigantic. The combat is a bit hard to get used to if this is your first Souls-Like game, but its a lot of fun once you get the hang of it. There are tons of builds that can fit you, depending on how you want to play the game. The bosses are really fun to fight, and I enjoyed learning their moves. They also look extremely unique compared to other modern games. There are a lot of repeating bosses, which can get annoying, but they still drop unique items, and most are still fun to fight. There are a few bosses that are extremely annoying and unfun to fight, but like I said, there are so many bosses in the game that the annoying ones are just a tiny portion of the game. The game performed fine for me, and I have a decent PC, I only crashed about once or twice in my entire 98 hours of gameplay. I HIGHLY recommend trying Elden Ring out if you would like a fun challenge, its extremely unique and addicting. In my opinion, this is one of, if not, the best game I've ever played!The World - Unlike most Open-World games, Elden Ring actually fills up 99% of the world. Every corner you go to, there is some kind of dungeon, boss, npc, and loot to be found. Even just the starting area of the game, Limgrave, is huge, and could be it's own game itself. The world is not only filled to the brim, but is also beautiful. There were times when I just stood still, and admired the world. This game also doesn't make it feel like a burden to explore, it makes you want to explore, and get as much loot as possible. The ""dungeons"" or catacombs are also a ton of fun, even if some feel a bit repetitive. Some people may not be interested in the lore, as it's a bit confusing, but it is extremely detailed, and every item you find has some type of lore behind it. FromSoft really put all they had into the world, and I can't wait to see more of it in a DLC.Gameplay/Combat - The combat may not be for everyone, as its a bit hard to get used to, but once you get used to it, its a ton of fun. There is a build for everyone. If you enjoy magic, there are almost an infinite amount of magic builds. If you enjoy melee combat, which is what I chose, there are tons of different types of melee weapons. Though, some bosses are extremely hard depending on what build you choose, which can make it a bit unfair, but it's not that difficult to change a build using the Rebirth/Larval Tears.Bosses/Enemies - The bosses and enemies are amazing. There is always some type of unique item you can get from killing an enemy. In Souls-Like fashion, the game is extremely difficult, and the bosses take a ton of practice. One boss I attempted to kill took me 60 tries, but the feeling you get from defeating the bosses is another level of motivation. Though, some bosses are repeated, which can get a bit annoying, they still usually drop unique items. The only downside I had to the bosses, other than some being repeated, are the spam attacks some bosses, like Malenia, do. It gets extremely annoying to try to dodge these bosses, and aren't fun to fight. Performance - I'm not much of a performance guy, but the game seemed to run fine for me. Out of my about 100 hours of gameplay, I only experienced a crash once or twice."
Positive,Maliketh and Blaidd are hot furry bait.The game is good too I guess.
Positive,is good :D
Positive,"Easily FromSoftware's best work yet. The game borrows a lot of elements from Breath of the Wild and of course slathers it all in Dark Souls, but that works really well in justifying the big open world and encourages just so much discovery. Combat is fun, leveling is still rewarding, this is pretty much just a Souls games as there are many characters and weapons from previous games. With that though comes the completely lackluster story and needless obfuscation, but really that is about the only thing I can fault it on."
Positive,"Best Soulsborne title without a shred of a doubt, not (personally) a 10/10 quite though, because I do miss invasions as they happened in the older titles, though I get why they aren't in (it's super annoying to get kicked off your horse in the open world, that would be worse)Also the lack of horse customization is something (given that I love Elden Bling/Fashion souls) that's a bit of a bummer to not have, and last but not least the connection is horrendous in PvP/Coop due to server issues with that many people I assume? But that's about the three points that keep it from a 10/10 in my view, anything else is ridiculously good, an actual masterpiece. Also it takes SO long to finish, it has so much content I'm almost willing to complain that I can't finish the game because there's too much to do. (And it's more difficult than Dark Souls too lmao)"
Positive,Rage so good.
Positive,"everywhere I go,fort,night"
Positive,I got so bricked up when i played this game
Positive,"With Elden Ring, From Software has not only delivered on the promise of a Souls game set in an open world, they have gone so, so far above and beyond my wildest ideas of what this type of game would actually look and play like. Elden Ring is massive and gorgeous - it's the punishing and precise combat of the Souls series set in the most massive and incredible world that From has ever created. The scale is simply unbelievable. 30 hours in and I'm still working my way through the early areas of the game. The option is there to pursue the main, semi-guided story objectives, but I've spent most of my time simply wandering around this huge map, delving into ruins and caverns. And dying, over and over again. Like the games that came before it and inspired it, Elden Ring is no pushover in the difficulty department. The handful of ""main"" bosses that I've encountered so far are easily some of the most complex and challenging in the entire series. Maybe my opinion will change once I've finished the game, but so far this feels like the most difficult Soulsborne game in the entire catalog. Your patience and persistence will be tested. But Elden Ring gives you more tools than ever before to solve the puzzle that is each boss encounter. That, coupled with the fact that the game lets you back away and explore elsewhere to your heart's content, leveling up and beefing up your arsenal, means that you never really feel stuck in this game. You can always come back later, stronger and wiser. I'll update this review later on if my opinion changes, since there is clearly a great many hours left for me in this first playthrough. But my impression from 30-ish hours in is that this is easily one of the most fascinating and engrossing games I've ever played. There is just so much to be discovered and explored in Elden Ring's world. Pick a spot on the map, hop on your horse, and get out there and explore. The world map alone is worth the price of admission here, since it is head and shoulders above any other open world game map I've ever played on. Elden Ring is a massive love letter by From to their fans, and a culmination of all the best parts of their past decade of award-winning action titles. Even with the performance issues on the PC port at launch (they are certainly present, but in my case at least they are relatively minor), this is an easy, 100% recommendation to buy. We'll be playing this one for years and years to come."
Positive,add sex in the butt please
Positive,"very fun, sometimes game stops but the game continues and fast forwards to where everything would be overall pretty fun so far"
Positive,"There is a woman in the game that wants to hug you 10/10 would buy again(I've never hugged a girl before btw)Side note: A lot of people are complaining about stuttering in game, I haven't had any issues. gtx 1080, 16gb ram, i7 9th gen, ssdit's weird seeing people saying there 3080 can't run the game with out lag.Edit: Def the game of the year"
Positive,you can insert your needle into malenia's scarlet flower
Positive,Praise the review
Positive,"First: I am not very good at souls games  and it is sometimes hard for me to stay focussed and don't get too frustrated. I play on an rtx3080 and the performance sucks the most in the open world. There is no difference for me to play on low or ultra, the frame drops will appeare anyway.But in legacy dungeon or other not so open areals the Performance is just fine. A fix, plus widescreen support would be highly appreciated.It is a masterpiece.I roamed the open world and found places, friendly characters and scary enemies. The longer I played, the better it got to just explore and taking risks.The ""bon fires"" placement and additional options have made a huge step in the quality of live direction.You can take runs on bosses/npcs/situations without to beat half of the game and slay 3 demi gods on the way. But I already experienced the dark souls feeling in some places but you are far away from being forced to be stuck. The fights feel as good as in other souls game and therefore I can ignore that I am fighting the 1000 knight or skeleton (or crab). 10/10"
Positive,"Never seen such an amazing keyboard control configurationHope this helps you all to figure out stuff.Q = back NOT ESCAPE its effin Q -_-X = crouch really? - Change to CSpacebar = dodge roll - Change to ShiftF = jump -_- who tf jumps with F - Change to spacebarRight Arrow = change primary Weapon LOL - Change to 1Left Arrow = Change secondary Weapon - okbye - Change to 2Down Arrow = Change potions - down arrow - Change to 3Up Arrow = Change items - Up arrow - Change to 4R = Use item - Change to FG = Map - Change to ME = Action - This is fineAs for the game, I played the closed beta so I really love it. Oh yes I almost forgot, the game still has frame drops, but I am still not going to give it a negative review because it is a good game but I just dont the fact that i cant get 60fps on a 3070"
Positive,It might be the best game.
Positive,Unable to Summon Cooperator
Positive,"Deffinitely the most 'accessible' Souls game, directly from the source From Soft.  One amzing game, providing many ways to olay it. Not forcing uou to do so in a specific way. One that forces you to keep track of your quests on your own, almost like classic table top RPG games.The PC port is not without some issues, but the patches have really made it a better game. Certainly a strong contestant for Game of the Year."
Positive,greatest game ahead ⚔

Positive,"For thy soul is tarnished, for thy eyes are red, i keep playing for more than 17 hours a day help."
Positive,FromSoftware does it again and delivers a game of generations. Just like Dark Souls 1
Positive,Great game precisely because it feels like something made 20 years ago
Positive,I WAS HERE.
Positive,humanity isn't worthy of this game
Positive,"Intro made no sense and had zero context. Controls were kind of jank. I spawned into some ruins and promptly got destroyed by a centipede thing. First message was ""try finger, but hole"".Some girl still wants to hang out with me. I have no idea what I'm doing. This is EXACTLY what I was hoping for when I bought this."
Positive,"At this point, I think that this game is just a massive flex.Who told FromSoft to go this hard? How did they manage to make an open-world game actually feel like a giant adventure instead of devolving into a soup of waymark-chasing and repeated content? How did they manage to make a Dark Souls map the size of Madagascar? And then they clenched their fists, shouted ""more"", and nested a zillion smaller levels inside of it, like some insane matryoshka doll. Like, who hurt them? What are they trying to prove?This game is objectively incredible, but all I know is that whenever I used to find myself going this far above expectations, I was low-key trying to make someone feel bad for ever doubting me. I'm halfway expecting to find yet another dungeon tucked away in a secret cliffside, walk through a fog wall, and see the entire development team standing there, arms crossed, waiting for an apology.How is anyone supposed to top this?"
Positive,"So far I've done four entire regions, and there are three more to go. I explore every inch and every corner of the map, and have found half a million secrets or hidden areas, items, bosses and NPCs.The game is a joy to play, and I am absolutely loving everything. The combat is great, especially with all the new ideas thrown into the mix such as counter attacks and much more mobile bows. And of course mounted combat.There is a crazy amount of bosses in this game, and even a whole slew of open world bosses that only spawn in very specific areas at night time. I would advice exploring at night if your wish is to find everything. While there is also a lot of reskinned enemies in the game, they will usually always have their own special gimmick, such as the basic as soldiers in each region having their own different kind of throwable item that they use to spice things up. The regions are really tailored to their gimmicks, with the first region being the most basic.Can't recommend enough."
Positive,try finger but hole
Positive,"After 269 hours of playing this game. I would not recommend it in its current state. I will skip the pros as this game has alot and everyone seems to talk about it so much. so ill only review the cons. Alot of deaths feel unnecessary, some mobs that stand outside the boss fight do more damage then the bosses themselves.As the game carries on, players are funnelled into switching their classes as their viability simply disappear. bosses become too fast for hybrid classes so you have to pick between range and melee. The game forces you to play in specific ways ( ex; mage cheesing from range or spamming heavy knock back attacks)some weapons don't even work in pve such as eclipse shotel. it should proc deathblight but never does in pve, only in pvp. my biggest problem with the game is you cant play the way you want, you play the way you have to in order to succeed. Another huge con i find is you can take 30% of the games content away and they game wouldnt change. There are so many recycled bosses that it just becomes annoying to fight them. The game rarely credits you for exploring, youll find yourself spending so much time killing bosses or using stone keys on dungeons that offer you something you didnt even want or need. This discourages you from exploring. YOU'LL SPEND TIME EXPLORING A CAVE, FINDING  ITEMS YOU DON'T NEED, TO KILL A BOSS YOU ALREADY KILLED SOMEWHERE ELSE AND GET AN ITEM YOULL NEVER USE. out of my 269 hours of playing id say i spent 100 hours trying weapons that stop working and exploring places that offer me very little. 20 of those hours i spent on google trying to find places that are pretty much impossible to figure out without a wiki. An invisible bridge? really? the game constantly snaps you out because you need to figure stuff out (ex if youre too weak to be in an area, or the mobs just one shot so you feel as if your behind.)Also it would be a great idea if mobs outside boss fights couldnt interfere with the fights by swinging from the damn door. TO SUMMARIZE, 20-30% OF THE GAMES BOSSES ARE RECYCLED, HARDLY ANY BENEFITS TO EXPLORING, POWER SCALING NEEDS IMPROVEMENT, STRUGGLING WITH A BOSS FOR HOURS ONLY TO SPAM ONE ABILITY AND WIN, HAVING TO OVER GOOGLE.Revised reviewAfter plenty of updates i can finally say that this is easily one of the greatest game ever created once you have knowledge of what its world can truly offer. You can make many builds very strong once you know what talismans, buffs, armor, stats to use and prioritise. Items that feel useless have a use in some way shape or form. The late game difficulty spike has been fixed and its not so often you get randomly one shot so exploring even for items you dont need doesnt waste too much of your time. Still the only con i can think of for this game is simply its scattered information. I do not like how much i have to google for info about items, world, so on and so forth. Especially when it comes to essential information such as having the sentry torch to reveal invisible enemy's. i dont not need quest trackers or points on a minimap but a simple book would be nice. maybe a feature where you unlock info as you go. I love immersing myself in a game but i still find myself hopping on google and checking wikis for question i have which destroys my lock in flow. This is a wonderful game, you can play it in a difficult way or an easy way. you can play it in a long way or a short way. But when a game feels like solving easter eggs for necessary items it does get very annoying."
Positive,I've had many experiences with my many builds in this magnificent game. But nothing can compare to being Varre's lambkin and having a furry blood ritual roleplay with Mohg.
Positive,Dark souls 4
Positive,finger but hole
Positive,Didn't expect very good open world Dark Souls...

Positive,Absolutely one of the best games I have played in years. Even if you are not a soulsbourne player please give this game a try. Don't let yourself get stuck in any error just go another way and come back to try again some other time
Positive,Never played a souls game before.. was a bit weary being i just play a lot of FPS games. Easily one of the best games i've ever played.
Positive,fricken epic game aleady wasted alot of time gonna waste more

Positive,"Game of the decade. A rare example of a complete video game, no micros, no season pass, it's all in the game. One of the most accessible souls games out there, yes it's still punishing, but there is a LOT of strong weapons/spells in the game that will help you through. 11/10 game."
Positive,"Hands down one of the best games I've ever played! I'm kind of new to the Soulsborne type of games, some of my gaming friends used to be die hard Dark Souls players, however for some reason I never got into it. But Elden Ring sucked me in and I managed to spend a ton of fun hours in it. In times like this when greedy publishers like EA are all about lootboxes and pleasing their shareholders, these FromSoftware boys come out with this gem and show us what it feels like to play a proper game again, thanks guys! I'm actually gonna start playing Dark Souls after this.Awesome game, highly replayable, beautiful world and no gated content. You should be playing it right now instead of reading this review."
Positive,"Edit to my initial review, for what it is worth: I still recommend this game highly, it is fantastic. However, after a significant amount of time playing it, I feel there is a pretty stark change in difficulty at a specific point. It's a Soulsborn etc.. but really. It goes from ""teachable"" moments to really spongy enemies that can 1-2 hit you everywhere, I am at level 140+ with the second highest armor on and 40 vig. It isn't a curve either, you don't go from doing okay (relatively for this sort of game) to getting crushed slowly, it feels like the end game isn't tuned right yet, like someone forgot to carry the 2 in the programming or something somewhere and just turned everything up to 11.The patches so far have improved the performance markedly, at least for my rig. For this game to really be a 10/10 though in my opinion: I think the last 1/4 to 1/3rd of it really needs to be balanced more like the first 3/4s to 2/3rds. I am playing pretty cheese too, I don't even know how melee can be a thing later on. Maybe the bleed builds but that is it. It's just too much mega aggro hitsponge death squad encounters and that's just the field mobs and no real opportunities to tweak your build to deal with it, besides maybe trying to grind out another 100 levels but even then, I dunno. I think the end-game is just kind of broke right now. Definitely got my 60 bucks worth but yeah."
Positive,"It's the best game I have played in a long time, great soundtrack, incredible maps, multiple weapon types, a versatile combat system, and beautiful to look at; I haven't finished the game yet but so far Elden Ring it's a breath of fresh air."
Positive,"Usually I hate open world games, they're slow, full of quest and collectible markers, full of empty space with no challenges between main points of interest, exploring feels unrewarding etc etc...Elden Ring is the complete opposite!- Every area is a challenge from the start.- The pace is yours to set with battles coming to you no matter where you go.- Random encounters throughout the lands between invasions, random dragon spawns, and other enemy boss spawns.- You feel humbled by the fact a standard enemy NPC can kill you in seconds, always treating them with a slight level of respect before fighting them or groups of enemies.- Exploring is rewarding with many caves, graves, and platforming puzzles to give you new weapons, spells, incantations, and spirits to help all build types.- Winning tough battles feels rewarding- Leveling doesn't make you OP, it just helps you catch up faster before reaching the next challenging area.- Multiplayer is a good laugh and has a hidden ettiquette in invasions.- Secrets everywhere!I'd say the only disappointing thing was the endings, for all the effort you can put in for various endings they feel pretty lackluster especially after the final few fights you take on before being able to finish the game.Overall, I'd highly recommend this game as it's a welcoming challenge with an open world full of surprises that'll keep you engaged on your journey to become an Elden Lord! Just be prepared to die... somewhat frequently.p.s. Malenia is easy. The laser dragon is the one to watch out for if you don't catch a lucky break."
Positive,"12/10. Fuck you FromSoftware, please never change."
Positive,Unce upon a time there was an old man stretching open his anus and revealing his Elden Ring™*Epic Music*
Positive,The crack cocaine of souls games.
Positive,"Punishingly difficult, very rewarding exploration. Gear system is a bit meh but easily this year's GOTY so far."
Positive,Pretty Good all around
Positive,"literally dont know how people are having issues with this game, blaming frame stuttering for their lack of gitting gud... smh"
Positive,"FROM Software's first (recent) attempt at an open world game; pretty damn good.  You can tell they don't have the open world layout perfected, but it's amazing regardless.  I feel like the pvp was probably more polished in Dark Souls 3, but maybe it's just because the game is young and we don't know how to fight yet with these weapons and builds yet.  The creativity packed into this is astounding, from the environments to NPCs to enemies and weapons, it's incredible.   10/10 would simp for Raani again."
Positive,"I feel like I can safely say that this game deserves a review.I've had games suck me in before but Elden Ring is the first FromSoft game to do it. Others have always felt like they were trying to balance accessibility, difficulty and lore in such a way as to be very difficult to get to grips with initially.Elden Ring is still hard, at least by modern standards, but the number of tools and methods of approaching problems is so massively increased as to make every single encounter feel incredible to complete. You did it your way, and you're unlikely to see people beat bosses or encounters in exactly the same way for a while. The exploration makes the whole FromSoft experience even better in terms of its writing and lore. You're always finding something out in the world and when you do, it's always satisfying to investigate and discover what secrets it holds.Whether Elden Ring will go down as one of the ""greatest"" games ever made is going to take a while to determine, but it's certainly the greatest FromSoft game ever made and that alone is exceptionally high praise."
Positive,so hard but so good
Positive,She Elden on my Ring till i Elden Ring
Positive,game hard make me hard
Positive,This is going to be Game of the Year hands down.
Positive,"It has been a long time since a game has captivated an audience like this.  Play how you want, explore and discover, be challenged, and overcome.  A massive, gorgeous world full of endless possibilities.  Taking all the best features from previous souls games and putting them into this masterpiece.Easily Game of the Year.  First timers and vets alike will love this game."
Positive,"Elden Ring, O Elden Ring. You already know why it's so good, but like Dark Souls, the game is a sad tale of two halves. The first half is absolutely brilliant; an open world experience that encourages a lot of exploration. It really took me back to the good old days of playing video games with a sense of wonder and curiosity. The second half of the game however, is really all the bad things about the new Souls games. Unbalanced and unfun, just stacking ""le epic"" boss after boss and making them difficult for the sake of difficult. Gone are the memorable bosses of True King Allant and Gwyn, but now replaced with bosses who have to be a ""spectacle"" and ""action-orientated"" for the sake of the fanbase. Still a great game though and way better than any of the drivel of open world games out there.-- Score: [9/10] --"
Positive,"Good game, having a lot of fun.Edit: Many hours later I am just flabbergasted. How From made this game in a few years is beyond me. The technical achievement aside, the art is fantastic, the combat is crisp and fluid. Many new mechanics open the souls world for new users, without dumbing the game down for the veterans. Everything was made right. My first gaming console was a Vecrex, so I think I know what I am talking about when I say there hasn't been a game like this in decades, if ever. The AAA industry has been shamed by Fromsoft, whatever shame was left. Ah speaking of, Elden RIng has no microtransactions, nuff said."
Positive,"Elden Ring is the culmination of every FromSoft title and it's unique traits to create an immaculate world full of interesting locations, confusing side quests, and very very Very hard bosses. If you love previous FromSoft titles, you will without a doubt love this one. The difficulty is just about perfect, albeit forcing you to change how you play a lot of the time to accommodate the new mechanics and highly improved magic playstyles for you to enjoy.I can't say much else other than go buy it if you think you will like it! It's the perfection of the genre and will stand the test of time."
Positive,I have fulfilled my masochistic needs in this game. Fully recommend it for those with low self esteem and crippling depression.This game gave me pure agony I truly deserve.Except...  I didn't deserve a loving wife.
Positive,try finger but hole
Positive,"Beautiful. 🥲Yeah, I'm 113 hours in - I cannot stress this enough. What an incredible title. I love this game."
Positive,42 hours in at time of review and I feel as though I've barely scraped the surface of this game. Absolutely fantastic experience so far.My only complaint with the game so far are the occasional frame drops.
Positive,"Demons Souls, Dark Souls 1, 2,& 3, Bloodborne, The Surge 1&2, Lord of the Fallen, and now Elden Ring......Oh yeah harder"
Positive,"initial impressions: this is everything i love about fromsoft turned to 11... i don't even wanna say anything lmaoo just play itabout performance complaints: it might be there for some people, but im literally playing on a CPU below minimum requirements and have had no issues so far.. done several bossfights and visited a lot of different areas"
Positive,"Souls games never clicked with me before this. Something about Elden Ring just hit the right notes. As unrelenting and frustrating as it is gorgeous and satisfying. This game has some head crushing depth and scale so be prepared. Sometimes it's a bit too cryptic about how to progress but that comes with the hands off philosophy these games have always had, which I greatly appreciate. It's been a while since a game sucked me in like this. Oohhh Elden Ring~"
Positive,Game runs a lot better now. Had to optimize my settings.Greatest fantasy game I've ever played.Customization would be nice on a bit more variety for bodies but the game is pretty much perfect.Edit: Changed to recommend. Holy shit.
Positive,It's Dark Souls with the Breath of the Wild treatment. Material Collecting/Item craftingMounted explorationOpen World ExplorationRandom Weapon and Armor DropsBeautiful SceneryLots of SecretsJolly Cooperation.NO BOTW WEAPON BREAKING SYSTEM
Positive,"i absolutely love this game, sure it has some problems like its random crashes and multiplayer functions disconnecting, but with that being said this is an amazing game that is full of lore and adventure. The gameplay, story and world design are all phenomenal. I would be shocked if this game isn't universally recognized as game of the year."
Positive,"Yeah, definitely the best game I have played for a very long time.I keep describing it as Zelda for adults. Exploring the world feels like exploring original zelda way back in the 80's, Minimal guidance, minimal clues but enough to keep you enthralled.From Software have truly outdone themselves this time.Highly recommend"
Positive,A genre defining masterpiece

Positive,"After 70.2 Hours, I've finally completed Elden Ring.There's so much I want to say. I ran the game with an intel i7 10700KF and a GTX 1070. The game ran at a smooth 60 Frames per second for most of the game and the few crashes I have ever experienced were attributed to summoning another player, or when trying to invade someone, which were few and far between.The game's utterly massive, every single time I thought the game had peaked, there was a new surprise waiting around the next corner. Everything you could have possibly thought of are waiting around the next corner.I have played every souls game, Bloodborne, Sekiro, and from a real place of love, this is absolutely the greatest game among them, and probably the best game I have ever played.This game is brutal, it's designed to reward, and challenge soul veterans while giving new players so many chances and tools at their disposal.Persevere, try, and be excited. I was skeptical of an open world but when I realized all of the possibilities the game had waiting for me and things I COULD do at my OWN pace, it created an experience like no other.Every time I played the game with my friends, we'd tell each other of something we found unique to our playthrough and share it, there was never a time when we wouldn't be able to surprise each other, and the way we explored the world and went about it was completely unique to each other.I can't believe this game got made. It is baffling how good it is. If you're still playing it, you know what I'm talking about.If you've played a souls game and you don't have it, you are missing out. (I know hardware limitations and PC issues are still rampant, and I'm truly sorry.)And if you have NEVER played a souls game, this game will eclipse all of them in quality, despite how great they all are.Don't give up on Elden Ring, and it will be one of the most unforgettable experiences you will ever have."

Positive,Open world souls game. It's a slam dunk.
Positive,"Easily one of the greatest video game ever made, if not the best."
Positive,Best game ever created. Simple as that.
Positive,You don't have the right
Positive,"Beautiful Graphics...check!Beautiful Scenery...check!Beautiful Deaths...DING DING DING!Beautiful Gameplay Overall...Checks across the mfin' board!Best 50 bucks I've spent since Dark Souls. Very challenging areas where it makes you lose your mind but it's worth it. Don't buy if you're going to rage quit after 3 deaths at the beginning of the game because of mobs. If you don't have that ""Gotta get good"" attitude then simply don't buy...it's not for everyone.Lately, I've been having frame issues with the game and getting disconnected offline but honestly at this point it's probably just my shietty internet and laptop so yea make sure your system can also handle the game. Either way, I still enjoy it my #1 game at the moment in my top ten MMOs list.  10000000000/10 would recommend!"
Positive,"I love this game more than I love myself, and I have yet to beat itedit: i beat it"
Positive,When I play Elden Ring all I think about is Elden Ring and when im not playing Elden Ring all I think about is Elden Ring

Positive,she hugged me >///<
Positive,"I never liked Souls type games, But when I was recommended this game by a friend I have never been more amazed of visuals and general gameplay than I have with ELDEN RING. This game is an absolute MASTERPIECE and I cannot wait for the DLC. Now I need to go clean myself and my screen :)"
Positive,"Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)🗡️ IntroductionAs a newcomer to the Soulslike genre, I dove into Elden Ring with a mix of excitement and trepidation.

Positive,Dying is fun
Positive,"SO... I own this game on Playstation and have already sunk a ton of hours into it, but enjoyed it so much that I bought it on PC with what little runes I have to spare. This is a fantastic game that you can easily sink hundreds of hours into - and not get bored at all. While it doesn't hold your hand - the lack of hand holding pushes you to explore, and boy oh boy does this game have a lot to explore. It is an absolutely fascinating world, and the lore is so rich if you choose to dive into it. But if you don't care about lore, and just want to kill while being killed more times in the process - this game ticks those boxes too. I'm just thankful that the game doesn't have a built in death counter. That would be embarrassing.TLDR;try fingersbut hole"
Positive,"Fromsoft innovates their souls formula with a refreshing style of open world game where you are really free to explore instead of being guided throughout like most other modern open worlds. It's an enormous game that never seems to end.All the locations are unique and gorgeous, their aging engine masked by stunning art direction. Most of the issues present in Dark Souls 3 were corrected making for a much more varied and replayable experience, with a plethora of unique items and possible build variations. Unfortunately thanks to the bigger scope, some aspects of the game fell short compared to prior titles, most notable the boss fights aren't as well balanced and finely tuned as previously with most boss attacks consisting of randomly flailing around or executing 10 hit combos that directly lead to another combo with no breathing room. It can become really tedious especially when you have to fight the same copy pasted bosses multiple times.Overall it's still an outstanding achievement that will hopefully lead to other developers making open worlds where you are encouraged to explore instead of handing you a checklist to grind through.There's a reason why this was the only game in 2022 people talked about for more than a week"
Positive,"I think they gave me another edition idk, the title screen says ""Your A** is not ready for this"" Anyway I enjoyed it a lot 11/10"
Positive,bu oyun benim allahim.
Positive,"Best game of 2022 and I was so busy playing this game I forgot to even leave a review! Its a challenging fun game, my old pc turned every Mob invisible so my first 10 hours in this game where super hard! I enjoyed even that so much I got myself a new pc lol! If you have not picked this one up yet you are truly missing out, its worth full price and its worth getting a pc that lets you see what you are fighting. Fun with friends although the strongest player can carry abit to hard so try and scale down a little to not ruin your friends first run."
Positive,"Once in a great while, a game comes along that seamlessly combines impeccable gameplay, a wondrous world, incredible tone-setting music, and unparalleled art direction. That game is From Software's ""Elden Ring,"" an action RPG that channels the best aspects of the studio's last decade of work into one enormous package. This absurdly ambitious open world captivated my curiosity, enticed me with puzzles, secrets, and mysteries, and served up unbelievably satisfying moments as I experienced one of the most extraordinary adventures of all time.From my initial foray into the world to the final moments, every step of the journey is a note in a personalized epic that kept me coming back for more. This trek through dark and twisted fantasy is an endless exploration, continually serving up sensational sites that only get more enthralling and fantastic as the voyage goes on.The Lands Between is a world full of discovery, and while a clear path forward exists for those seeking guidance, roaming the lands unfettered without a particular goal in mind often yields surprises. I often had a spot to explore marked on my map and got off track along the way, sometimes leading to entirely new areas and feature-length zones.Elden Ring is not a theme park-style open world where each ride is bolstered by breadcrumbs so they won't be missed. There are significant areas, bosses, dungeons, and other huge revelations that can be passed by, making these finds even more delightful. Even after over 55 hours, I know that I've missed plenty. Instead of pining over what I haven't found, I'm inspired to keep exploring. The grandiose world is chock full of characters, quests, and various dungeon crawls ranging from tiny catacombs to massive multi-layered tombs.While the journey starts with little caves, mines, and other dungeon delves, these experiences become more complex. Two-room affairs eventually become intricate teleport puzzles or scenarios where you discover unusual ways to interact with the environment, like learning to use traps for traversal or sniffing out secret walls.Even the most straightforward open-world dungeons house hidden boss rooms and treasures, in addition to their standard yields, rewarding the most inquisitive adventurers finding creative ways to travel to places that don't appear accessible before the standard path guides you there. It feels remarkably refreshing, and more than one area serves up breathtaking vistas upon arrival. Looking over a new area for the first time and realizing you can go everywhere you see, and probably should, is fantastic.Some open-world locales, like churches, ruins, and ancient trees, may feel a bit familiar from realm to realm, but make no mistake, there are numerous and unique points to explore and get lost in for hours. From mysterious castles to haunted magical grounds, the world is full of exciting diversions.Your character is incredibly customizable, which I found highly rewarding. You can attach various skills and scaling mechanics across the board, allowing you to truly create your vision of a traveling hero. Re-specialization and alterations allow you to finally tweak your creation without worrying too much about experimentation along the way, as you arm yourself with everything from explosive pots to potent perfumes to complement your ever-growing arsenal.Combat will vary greatly from player to player and build to build, but the precise dance of melee combat is more refined and diverse than ever, featuring a behind-the-scenes stagger system that rewards players for taking chances with timing. The flow of battle makes the singular spammy strike a lesser choice in the face of a daunting foe.The open world is majestic, dripping with flavor and atmosphere, and full of fabulous finds. However, the legacy dungeons are the stuff of legend, often connecting to the outside from multiple points. These curated sprawls are a dream to dissect, and Elden Ring often offers different ways to maneuver through these areas. For instance, in one of these giant dungeons, I discovered a completely different way to solve the route to the final boss and then went back and found a divergent path through another environment, leading to a wealth of battles, bosses, and loot. Sometimes, access to certain areas is in the last place you look, but the route to unearth it is laden with even more attractive paths to pursue.While some monster and boss designs are reused, the scope and scale of Elden Ring are enormous, which makes the repetition easy to ignore. I feel like I ran into around 100 bosses in my playthrough, and I'm not exaggerating. Some of these may feel commonplace and uninteresting at the end of a small dungeon, like a repeat cave troll or magma drake, but the overall diversity of encounters meant that I never knew exactly what I was going up against at the end of any given expedition. I might run into a re-skinned knight, but I might also go toe-to-toe against something truly astronomical. The big bosses generally found at the end of legacy dungeons feel like wonderful wars against demigods. These brilliant set-piece battles are thrilling exclamation points to an outrageous odyssey, absolute spectacles, and masterful combinations of tension and triumph.Elden Ring has the distinction of having the most challenging and best boss battle in any From Software game to date. Hidden away and optional, this encounter had me waking up in the middle of the night to come back and crash against its beautiful and terrifying destruction over and over again. After finally besting this opponent, I let loose a triumphant victory roar while sitting in the dark and wearing my pajamas, wanting nothing more than to experience the encounter again. This example speaks to how unbelievably compelling an immersive element ""Elden Ring"" is. I regularly put it down with the intent of doing something else and found myself back within minutes. There's always one more gnawing mystery to unravel, one more boss to beat, and one more hidden route to find. Elden Ring challenged me, captivated me, and fascinated me an unyielding deluge of discovery and artistic vision unbound.""Elden Ring"" represents a truly amazing combination of various game elements that all come together to create something fascinating, special, and unforgettable. It's one of the best games ever made."
Positive,"Elden Ring ist das Beste Spiel des Jahres 2022 und eins der besten in den vergangenen 5 Jahren.Nach mittlerweile 215 Stunden ist mir der Spielspaß nicht vergangen und immer noch so hoch, als ich zum ersten Mal in Limgrave gelandet bin.Wer aber nach einem gemütlichen RPG-Abenteuer gesucht hat, ist hier falsch. Elden Ring ist schwer. SEHR SCHWER!Aber nach endlosen Sprüchen der Bosse, wie: ""Put these foolish ambitions to rest"" oder ""I am Malenia, Blade of Miquella"" hat man trotzdem den Willen diesen Boss zu schaffen, da die Bosse zwar bockschwer. aber gleichzeitig auch wunderbar designt sind.Wo wir schonmal bei Malenia sind: Der schwerste Boss der Videospielgeschichte! Lasst Euch überraschen :)Und genießt unbedingt die wunderschöne Open-World dieses Spiels, ich verrate nichts, das müsst Ihr selbst gesehen haben.Then enjoy the grind, lowly tarnished :)"
Positive,"A very fun, entertaining game and very easy to get sucked into. Great music, visuals, presentation, world, it offers the most refined version of the trademarked Souls series combat. Even though the game is great and I think is easily this year's GOTY, it does not bring anything new to the general landscape of actual games; it does not innovate, it is just more of the same, executed brilliantly. From the bottom of my heart, I hope FromSoft doesn't continue with this trend.About the narrative and story, I didn't particularly enjoy it, I thought it was too cryptic for its own good, but that didn't stop me at all from enjoying this game to the fullest."

Positive,"I have never enjoyed a Souls game before for a variety of reasons. I generally do not enjoy open-world games, as they tend to feel shallow and unrewarding. And yet, I greatly enjoy Elden Ring. I have like over 100 hours in it and haven't even finished the game yet (but I am getting close!), and have no intention of putting it down any time soon - it is the most well put-together open-world game I've ever played, and I think that they very successfully adapted the Souls core into an open-world format.The combat is tough, but as an open world game you can always go explore and level or find a new build if you find yourself up against a wall. If things suck, hit da bricks. The world feels generally rewarding of exploration and filled with ways to tweak builds or upgrade items or have better/more heals, and you genuinely have the tools at your disposal to make the game easier. If you ever feel like you're throwing yourself at a wall, you probably are! You should go find a ladder or another way around it!The game isn't perfect (no 21:9 or >60fps without launching the game 'offline' with anticheat disabled, some inputs are not rebindable on kb+m (e.g. map) which makes playing with my split keyboard impossible - which is fine, I wouldn't play a souls game without a controller anyways) to name a few minor complaints), but generally, the core game itself is almost perfect on its own. Most of the issues are just in how it's packaged up."
Positive,Absolute masterpiece! FromSoft have surpassed themselves. I love it! 😍P.S. 28 hrs in 4 days. Totally not addicted. Kappa
Positive,"Rewarding exploration. Sometimes the difficulty spikes are annoying, but then you realize you need to git gud. Open world allows you to explore and level more before finally felling a difficult boss.Multiplayer needs fixing, a good amount of sessions end with a connection error. When it works, it's fun, whether that be with a friend or a stranger that needs help.Easier to 100% than previous from software games."
Positive,Truly best 60 dollar game
Positive,"There is a character who is half nude, T poses, grunts, and faces the sun. BEST CHARACTER 2022"
Positive,I dislike this game. I can't stop playing this game.  Send help.
Positive,"GOTY, no doubt about it."
Positive,Worth every penny spent.
Positive,What can I say about this game. I have never played a FromSoftware game. This was my first and I absolutely loved it. I loved every single moment of this game. I fell in love with so many of the characters and the lore. I still need to improve my fighting abilities but I can see myself playing this for a long time to come. If you are thinking of getting it and you like big open world games I would definitely give this game a shot. The game can be a bit difficult at times but that makes it all the more satisfying when you beat them. Highly recommend!!
Positive,"An absolute Masterpiece. I hated the Soulsborne-Genre, but this turned it all around. Never has a game been more beautiful, more artistic and more mystic than this. The last time i had this feeling of excitement, curiosity and wonder was when i was 14 and playing Baldurs Gate 2. The gameplayloop is impeccable. You explore, you fight, you die, you learn, you get better and after many tries, you win. And the win feels earned and not handed to you by a gameplaysystem designed to produce cheap dopamine rushes but by challenging you.I'm almost done now but just dont want it to finished. If you want a pure feeling of curiosity and mystic wonder, go in blind, dont use guides, dont google min/max builds or anything - Find stuff and see whats cool and what works for you."
Positive,"First time playing a souls like game since bloodborne. I'm getting fucking bullied. I've always been terrible at these games, but this is different. It's SO unforgiving but in a good way. It's so much fun, and when you finally kill that boss you've died to for the 1000th time, you feel amazing. I would 100% buy this if you want a challenge like no other game can offer. This review is being written at 38 hours and i'm nowhere near done or close to completing it.10/10"
Positive,"Finally, a woman hugs me. At least in the game."
Positive,i am maidenless
Positive,Probably my favorite open world game ever.
Positive,"I don't remember what grass feels like, i only know grace"
Positive,"Bring lube, this one fucks."
Positive,i'm having fun
Positive,this game is so sicc bro
Positive,It's okay I guess ?
Positive,"Great game, definitely worth the money in playtime. Huge world to explore and hundreds of hours of playtime.Is it a great game? yes. Is it a masterpiece? totally no, most people that say so, they're either still on the honeymoon phase or haven't left the starting zone yet.The game has lots of content to explore. The world building, level design and lore is some of the best in souls series. Gorgeous views, super complex domains to get lost into. Lots of secrets and surprises when exploring the open world. At least on the first couple of areas.Sadly the quality dips a bit after around half the game, and the open world areas start to feel more generic fields with stuff thrown around.This applies as well to the boss design. The quality dips down on the second half of the game, and there are notable design problems. First, the lack of originality, since every boss has basically the same moveset: every boss has a big AoE that oneshots, every boss throws puddles of poison/dots around the arena, every boss has a grab attack that oneshots, every boss has an anime multihitting unrollable dash that you need to run away from... Also if you're one of those people who disliked DS2 for the ganks, I got bad news for you, cause again past the midpoint of the game, they just started doing ctr+c ctrl+v to most of the early game bosses, so you'll have to face 2 or 3 at the same time.Then some other boss fights are straight up bugged or clunky. From bosses too big to fit the room where you are fighting, making them glitch through the walls or the floor, to bosses that you fight in the open world that can get bugged with height changes on the terrain, making them glitch up and down from rocks or cliffs.If you are interested in pvp, other than duels, there isn't much going on. Covenants are gone, and invasions only work if the host is playing coop. And as of the day of the review, there are several instant kill cheap builds ruining the scene that hopefully will get patched.Personally I'd give it an 8/10. Is a great game, specially if you want to get into souls games, since the open world design allows to take it easy and progress somewhere else if you get stuck, plus there are several new systems added to make the game more accessible. This also sadly lowered the quality of boss fights, which is the biggest appeal for me."
Positive,Don't give up skeleton!
Positive,game of the year
Positive,"Well, let me begin by saying: This game is NOT for everyone. If you got comfortable with the excessive handholding, markers everywhere, forgiving combat, and aren't ready to experience a game without it, this game is NOT for you. This is a Souls game at its core, granted, the easiest Souls game to get into since you can explore the COLOSSAL world they've built for you, and get way ahead of the curve before the story bosses.Now, for those who are either familiar with the Souls series or are up for the challenge this game is absolutely AWESOME, i still can't believe how big this game is, i'm on NewGame+ after defeating every single big boss available, and just yesterday i found a cave i've never been to in the starter area. The combat is at its peak, they took every lesson from previous games and applied here. Not to mention the insane variety of builds you can come up with.Definitely recommend it."
Positive,"Disclaimer: The open-world, specifically the very first area, had performance problems for me, massive micro stutters and fps drops. A patch fixed it for me, but you might wanna read up about the technical state of the game first. Everything else ran absolutely flawless though, including open-world areas.Second disclaimer: Elden Ring is addictive. Straight up, not gonna pretend it's not. If it grabs you, watch out. Especially if you got a procrastination problem.That out of the way, this is a masterpiece. Fromsoft have done it again and even blow their own games out of the water regarding scale, scope, content, creativity, design etc. I've read there are over 70 unique bosses alone. That is absolutely insane.Sekiro still has the best combat system ever made, but this might be the best open-world game ever made, and certainly is the best Souls game. It's VERY Dark Souls, but borrows a little from Sekiro, and a teeny tiny bit from Bloodborne."
Positive,"This game is a masterpiece. Not only is the story captivating and interesting, but it is incredibly deep too. The storytelling at play here is almost perfect in my opinion, the way its story is so intertwined with the gameplay is phenomenal. One of the best things this game does, is allow the player to become the narrator in some ways. What i mean by this is it allows the player to choose how much of the story is told, whilst controlling the pace and complexity too. If you are someone who wants to play through an RPG, get a basic synopsis of the story and leave it at that, you will love this game and its story. If you’re someone who loves a rich and complex story with twists, turns and complex characters, you will also love this game. The game allows the player to explore the side quests and story’s in a rewarding way that avoids spoon feeding content without making it too hard to find and digest. It also provides a lot of contexts for the world and its characters through item descriptions meaning your understanding for a previously completed side quest could be flipped on its head upon discovering a certain armament or talisman down the line.On top of its phenomenal storytelling, the game doesn’t disappoint in terms of mechanics and systems. The combat feels smooth, rewarding and almost addicting. Whether it be colossal swords and great axes, or sorcery's and incantations, each of the plethora of builds the game offers feels fun and rewarding to play. Not only do these builds all feel unique and enjoyable but they are also incredibly well balanced for the most part, after 4+ playthroughs I have experimented with every weapon type and plenty of different attribute builds, and none felt nonviable or even bad. On top of being enjoyable and well balanced, the sheer amount of possible builds this game allows for is mind-blowing. Part of this is due to the fact you can use a main hand and offhand weapon, soul ashes (summons) and mix potions that allow various skills from damage buffs to infinite mana for a short amount of time. When combined these unique systems allow for a massive number of possibilities from all ends of the spectrum.I expected the story to be good (not this good), and the systems to be well designed (again, not this well) but i was sure that the open world aspect of this game was going to be a weak point at the very least. Not only was i wrong in that assumption, but i would go as far as saying the way the world is designed is potentially the best thing about the game, and that’s saying something. Not only is it massive, but it is jam packed full of content. There wasn’t a second i spent running from point A to point B where i was bored or wished i had something to do along the way. Whether it’s a unique pack of enemies to fight that are protecting a rare item, a dungeon I stumbled across with a mini boss inside, or a gaol with a great enemy locked inside waiting to be defeated, there wasn’t a square metre of the map left untouched. Not only this, but almost every single boss fight was unique and original and the same can be said for the enemies spread throughout the world.Yes, the game had optimisation issues on launch, which can’t be overlooked. However, despite having these problems the games devs worked quickly on fixes that were rolled out successfully and I personally haven’t had any issues with FPS since. I also think it’s important to note that, especially since these issues have been resolved, I don’t think this should take away from the incredible world, in-depth story, and amazing systems that FromSoftware have created here.Overall, this game was by far the best gaming experience I have ever had, the story and lore are incredible, the vast and breathtaking world is phenomenal, and the systems and mechanics implemented are perfections of ones present in other beloved FromSoftware games."
Positive,I think my name speaks for the quality of the game
Positive,i have caught an excruciating case of the SCARLET ROT (IRL) (Real life)
Positive,"130+ hours on my first playthrough, did my absolute best to go through every nook and cranny of the entire map which is just insanely big. Looked up two specific NPC quests to not miss out on secret/hidden areas which turned out to be huge.The best thing that I like about this game is the design and architecture of the gigantic castles, they are beautifully designed and a lot of fun to explore. My favourite location in the game is the Raya Lucaria Academy, gives a very ominous feeling throughout and looks completely different during night time. The scale of the open world areas is huge, you can go anywhere you want from the beginning of the game wherever you can see, even the very late game areas which can be accessed through hidden portals and some key items. This is a great feature of this game, thank god FromSoftware didn't lock these late game areas behind boss fights. I spent 12 hours collecting map fragments and just running around just to see what is there in these late game areas as your horse can outrun most enemies, came across some field bosses who just randomly one shotted me when exploring lolPlayed as a sorcerer as using spells on horseback makes the game easy, you can take out most open world enemies and bosses by spamming your spells from afar sometimes without taking any damage. Most boss fights are okay in terms of difficulty based on your stats but some of the boss fights are just insanely difficult even with big stats and maxed out mimic tear, had to summon other players to help out with those.PC performance is fine but definitely needs work. Played on a R7 1700 and GTX 1080ti and was able to get consistent 60FPS at 4K on low settings with medium shadows. Stuttering is an issue but this happens only in a few specific areas for a second or two and not randomly all the time which is good but needs to be fixed.Overall, the game is amazing, gameplay is great, combat is brutal, boss fights are epic, open world exploration is great and this time around, you get a lot of tools to make the game easier. If you are stuck on a boss, you can simply go and explore other areas and come back stronger. 10000000000% recommend."
Positive,Never have I been swept with such wonder roaming around a map in a game before. An absolute masterclass in world/map design. Fromsoft straight up made my favorite open world game on their first attempt.
Positive,"Welp, I can for sure say this is the best game I've ever played. 12/10 hands down."
Positive,great souls game with a few too many repeated bosses. release the DLC miyazaki u fuck
Positive,finger but hole
Positive,"This recommendation comes with an asterisk(*).You like Dark Souls?  You wanted more Dark Souls?  Well, here ya go, but open world.  For those that haven't played a Dark Souls game before, you may not realize what the community means when we say it's an open-world Souls game, but it very much follows the same formula, minus a few additions - dedicated jump button, mount, and a couple minor changes.  This means KB/M support sucks dick, so prepare to use a controller.  If you can't stand controller or ""PC Master Race"", then I don't know what to tell you.I honestly cringe these days when ""open world"" is a big tag line for a game.  I've started feeling like it's overdone and very formulaic - find the tower, open the map, touch the areas of interest, move on.  They really manage to use almost every square foot of this map for something.  Whether it be *Surprise bitch* traps, NPCs, boss fights, enemies who actually seem like they belong there rather than are placed there to fill the space, or an area meant to hide caves and dungeons.  They've made terrific use of the space available to add fantastic scenery and neat weather effects, both wide-area and localized.  From some angles, certain castles look almost disney-esque, then from the another angle it looks like a giant sat on it.Just like our classics, we've got our invasions (though they work a bit differently), multiplayer and all of it's awkwardness, solo and group-possible bosses, NPCs with both simple and convoluted quest/story-lines, and world story that you have to pay attention to to learn about.  Just like in the Souls games, the story is in the notes attached to items, from the NPCs, the cutscenes, and the locations.  Also, the bosses are often HARD.  I'm playing primarily as a sorcery caster, and I can tell you some open world bosses I found easier solo while a lot of the dungeon bosses got easier with a friend or two pulling him away from me, but there's definitely been times when we've had to retry a few times, all the way up to me dying to Mr. Golden Knight way more times than is proper to admit before I would move on to do other things (I did win, but it was a classic case of forehead vs brick wall - I may have brain damage, but that wall fell down, damnit!).tl;dr:  The gameplay is terrific, if you're looking for a GOOD open world and/or more Souls action, this game is definitely for you.  If you take your time, you can spend absolute hours looking around and helping people.  I have over 100 hours on my only character and I've not even gotten a second great boss down yet.*:  There is a bit of bugginess, which unfortunately is rather common these days with game launches.  I'm not happy about it, and neither should you be.  After a couple of patches, my frame hitches went away and MOST of my multiplayer issues have left.  Our #1 biggest bug at the moment is multiplayer connectivity.  Dropping from one another is very common, and the best way I've found to solve this temporarily is to restart the game and/or PC and we find that it'll usually stop dropping us during the session.  It's not entertaining, and I certainly hope it gets patched very soon, but I still feel like the game is worth fussing with this issue.  If you don't play multiplayer, you probably won't even notice."
Positive,"it starts good, and the longer you play, the better it gets."
Positive,This game has no right to be this good. No right...
Positive,"It's the best one. Not my favorite one, because Bloodborne even in it's flaws is incredible, but this one is the thing. 97 hours at the time of this review, I haven't finished, but did a bunch of sidequests and I am closing in the last big side area and in the story. If you like Souls, there's no question. If you don't know Souls, this is probably the most approachable one and the one with it's gameplay systems and design better solved.  You will not explore for more than 10 seconds without finding something fun to do around the corner and lose yourself in the game.There's still some bad encounters/design stuff, but at this point, it may as well be me who is the bad encounter, everything is so well put together that I cannot make a complaint.Elden Ring is one of the best games that there is. Period. It's a masterclass in open world design, combat systems, encounter design and just plain beautiful everything, art, characters, environment, music, writing. It's a masterclass in what open world games can be.If this review is it's because I played 100 hours in a week or so and I need to sleep and have a life man."
Positive,"Have completed a large portion of optional and main content and have had frame issues at only two fights on release, and one cut scene. Other than that the game has ran great on a 3070. There is always, and I mean always something to do in this game. If you take just a minute to explore there will be mobs, bosses, dungeons big and small, and/or NPCs everywhere. If someone is saying the world is empty and nothing to do, they might be blind. It's definitely the most accessible souls game in the sense that gives you more info about mechanics and what to do rather than leaving you blind to figure everything out. Also if you are stuck at a main boss, you don't need to throw yourself at it 500 times to try and progress and can instead just leave and do 200 other things and come back to it later. The amount of alternate endings as well as NPC questlines that can directly affect other questlines leads to massive amounts of replayability to do different quests and outcomes as well as try different character builds with the respec feature."
Positive,I had high expectations and this game still impressed me. Do yourself a favor and play it!
Positive,Fuck you Miyazaki
Positive,Everything I wanted on a game is in there
Positive,elden ring cured my depression
Positive,Very fun game but it will make you become suicidal at multiple points and make you scream racial slurs and punch your monitor. 10/10
Positive,"Holy shit.This is probably the best game since witcher 3 and death stranding.It's been a while since I had a game that I just didn't stop playing.Is it hard? kinda, but not really. It takes a bit to get used to the playstyle of Elden Ring. If the game gets too hard for you, you can always decide to make it easier for yourself. There is countless ways to increase your damage or take a different approach to a boss. It can be really hard if you try to slam your head against the wall, but it can also be surprisingly easy if you (ab)use weakspots.quick update after 100+ hours. Still great - nearly got all achievements :3Can't wait for DLCs or a Sequel."
Positive,"I've never played a game on release as much as I've been playing this game.Playing it on a killer computer.10/10 easy. As someone who did not play any previous dark souls game I can say this game is a challenge, but the MMO grinding gamer in me absolutely loves thr difficulty Tried to just grind and stay away from bosses until I learned the combat, alas I found myself accidentally in a boss room with 20k runes on me, so I had to fight it, my first boss after 20 hours of learning, it was fun, tough, but I did it in one go, and you can too!Update: Still a great game, but that fire giant >.<If you are looking for stunning graphics, like the dark souls series, want a challenge, just game, or are an MMO grinding champion, this game might be up your ally!"
Positive,"Valhalla is under attack by dragons, wererats and sentient pot people and it's up to you and your trusty steed to backstab every single one of the demigods to become the one true king beneath the Yggdrasil."
Positive,"""Here's a stick, go kill God"""
Positive,I don't think I will touch grass anytime soon  : )
Positive,Took like 30 minutes of optimization but I'm running this masterpiece on a 1050Ti and 8G of RAM. Update your drivers.
Positive,"This is coming from a person who has never played any soul game series I have read about stuttering and performance issue and promptly updated my drivers, and I have ZERO stutter despite not having the highest end of rigs. I understand this is boss battle type of game but I love the freedom that I don't have to fight a boss if you are a coward like me. Margit? What Margit? I barely survived invasion from Eleanora LMAOPeople who rage quit at the game 6hrs in (aka Dr DisXXXXX if u know who) and attempt at boss at beginner level is unwise. What do you think would happen? LOLThis game isnt skyrim or witcher 3 so don't even compare this to them. Don't go into boss 1 hour in and expect to win. Even experienced players with well built character will die from this game. World is full of mystery, jaw dropping visuals with well designed secret zones. When I play this game, I have youtube video guide on the side as I figure out how to get a particular gear piece and how to defeat a particular enemy. There isn't any tutorial on this game, and it would take me YEARS if I were to explore it on my own as I am indeed, small brain. There is no masterpiece in newly released game and flaws/bugs are expected, but this game earns 8.5/10 from someone who has no CLUE about Fromsoftware gameMinus point for coop experience, as we can't mount our sexy horses, and rest at graces, all the more reason to make your character extremely OP by grinding day and night for sufficient resources during coop. There's no Site of grace when you do COOP which is my main gripe of the game, but can easily counter by just making the right build, learning the boss moves.Kb/Mouse controls:Not your typical controls and camera movement in third person plays, so expect to get used to the janky camera action unless you use controller, or you can rebind your keyboard controlsCharacter leveling & Exploration 10/10P.S Seek Lover, then offer hole ( A player dropped sign I encountered ingame)"
Positive,Open world Dark Souls. Do i need to say anything else. ? 10/10
Positive,"Well what to say about this masterpiece, the magnum opus of From Software?It is just GREAT! Provided you like the general 'soulslike' approach and setting, this game is a wonderful step forward and truly takes the whole thing into an open world. There is so much to explore, to uncover, to find... and to get pounded into the floor.If you are absolutely new to From Software's approach on difficulty and gameplay, then Elden Ring is the most userfriendly one. A really slow paced tutorial (compared to: this is how you move... YOU DIED.) so even newcomers have can get accustomed to the core mechanics.But don't get me wrong: the difficulty spikes are still there, and you WILL DIE A LOT! But this is actually part of how these games work, so do not falter when your health runs out yet again.It is really hard to write a lot about it, without spoiling anything. So to be brief: imagine Darksouls, just in a huge open world, with a metric ton of bonfires and small dungeons and challenges everywhere.Welcome to Elden Ring :)Don't turn hollow <3"
Positive,"Elden ring is a masterpiece. There is no other word for it. The world design, boss fights, music, story and literally everything this game does is done perfectly. My enjoyment for the game hasn't been ruined by the performance problems because I haven't really ran into them other than when I first started up the game. I have an i5 9600k and a 1660 ti (which are both around the recommended specs) with all the settings at high with a couple like depth of field and motion blur turned a little bit down. I understand that the game has stuttering issues and frame rate problems but the true quality of the best game I have ever played and most likely will play for a very long time is hindered for anyone that looks at the steam store page and sees the mixed reviews."
Positive,"A true artistic masterpiece. Faithful to From Software's iconic genre and a perfect 10/10.However....People are complaining and review bombing for micro stutters but what they lack the knowledge of is that ALL PC PORTS HAVE AT LEAST SOME ISSUES, IT JUST HAPPENS AND THERE IS NO WAY AT LAUNCH THEY CAN MITIGATE FOR EVERY PC CONFIGURATION! If you are one of those entitled PRICKS that like to put bad reviews over micro stutters that aren't even that frequent or don't even last that long then you don't deserve the game. Grow some balls and wait for a patch, OH WAIT they're already releasing them. If you are running top end hardware and claim to be having performance issues then I'm sorry but your PC is clearly fucked if people with lesser hardware can run it perfectly fine, so how about you fix that first."
Positive,"First of all, in short this is probably the best modern ""Soulsborne"" cinematic universe game we've gotten thus far in PC (Bloodborne when? pls). The addition of certain micro mechanics like jumping, the horse riding (and battles) and now an actual open world that gives you freedom from where to explore to a much higher extent compared to the other games is honestly just great fun. I would not be surprised If the average playtime til completion in Elden ring is at least 2x of the other games and even as an entry into the series it does the job just fine (I do think Dark Souls 3 is a little better as an introduction to the series)BUT, It's been confirmed several times that FromSoftware/Bandai Namco and whoever else is making money from these games. They make A B S O L U T E bank money when they release these games on PC (And If Bloodborne ever got ported to PC that game would also absolutely be bank money). As FromSoftware is literally one of the few Japanese game studios that is so widely recognized and loved in the west I just wish they actually cared about this market as much as *we* love them. Other people that played the game know this, all the reviewers have mentioned this in their YT videos, I have a computer that is quite literally way more powerful than any console running this same game yet I'm getting the stuttering, frame drops. And this entire thing is a reocurring thing with Soulsborne games ported to PC and the kick in the balls is, while this game is absolutely beautiful, it is not the most ""graphically"" challenging game in recent times at all.Should this previous complain deter you from trying out this game? Actually? Absolutely not, I would still recommend it and while I have other minor complains about certain game design things themselves it's still an absolute blast, I'm not even half way through the game yet as for people that are completionists this will really make you want to explore every nook and cranny but this is just a warning and just to get the message out there because I don't know how else you get Bandai/FromSoftware to care about the Steam market that actually makes them drown in money.TL:DR: fort night"
Positive,★★★★★ / ★★★★★
Positive,it mucho fun 👍beeg dork souls 😳
Positive,"So far Elden Ring has exceeded all of my expectations. It's all I wanted it to be and much more than I could ever ask for. It plays like Dark Souls 3 and feels amazing to play. The Lands Between is beautifully handcrafted world with full of surprises and treasures to find. Exploring feels rewarding. Horseback fights work surprisingly well, too. I have encountered a bit performance problems. Especially the starting area seems to be worst in that regard, but problems aren't bad enough to be dealbreaker, least for me. I hope they will address these issues in upcoming weeks."
Positive,horah who now???
Positive,very guud game :D
Positive,"EDIT: While I'm keeping my original negative aspect here because I'm still crashing and stuttering, as well as disconnecting frequently in co-op (but I think that's just because almost a million people are playing and people probably have bad internet), at this point I feel the game is stable enough that you can fully enjoy it.The most anticipated game in several years, and it's an absolute masterpiece, but I have to advise you to not buy until they fix this horrible PC port. It hurts. It hurts so much. As soon as they patch it and people report not having many more issues I'll change my review but until then, shame on FromSoft for releasing such an awful port. People are crashing and can't play at all including my friend, the game stutters constantly for me with a 1080ti, enemies are invisible, several things don't work like bloodstains, my game freezes randomly and I have to close it, the game takes several minutes to load. Disaster."

Positive,Game is good.
Positive,"This game is really fun, I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the franchise or is curious. The reviews are mixed, and most of that issue seems to come from people saying their game is constantly stuttering and having issues. While I haven't noticed any issues of that sort, it is possible to lower your graphics in the settings and this would likely help with the issue. The game's pop in and strange shadows make me feel as if the game is lacking some slight polish, however I believe that it's not much of an issue at all and that this kind of stuff is to be expected from such a large game.I feel like the game, while fun and effective in keeping ones attention, may have issues in keeping players engrossed if they enjoy running off the beaten path, as many of the encounters are difficult to either encourage the player to come back later, or to nudge them in the right direction. In one situation I opened a chest that transported me into a poisonous swamp with seemingly no way out (fast travel is always an option so long as you aren't in danger, and I didn't realize this until after enduring large amounts of stress)Many of the enemies one will encounter are difficult of foot, and a horseback approach may help to easily defeat them, that being said make sure to use all of your materials to their potential, as crafting can be extremely helpful in taking down strong foes. Thank you, and if you agree with any of my points, or will consider purchasing the game due to my points, please leave a helpful rating."
Positive,"Its hard to put into words the joy Elden Ring has brought me.  Rarely do I see a game where you can explore and fight your way through a huge fantasy world, with so many functional builds to play as, and just so much  to explore and so much to see, stuff to find that actually matters for the improvement of your character, and unique underground and hidden areas to find.It expertly blends the grand sense of adventure and discovery in the open world, with the tighter more focused exploration of its large 'dungeon' type areas.. while while blended seamlessly with the surrounding world, also feel like a self-contained experience that is more traditionally Dark Souls like in a lot of ways.  You'll see what I mean when you get into Stormveil Castle for the first time and see how the feel of the gameplay shifts to something veterans of the Souls series will feel more at home with.I also think it does a good job of making the game a little more accessible to players who found From's similar games to be too difficult, while still offering a challenge.  I particularly like how the world allows you alternatives to just trying to push forward when you're having difficulty.. It's a simple matter to just abandon the area or boss that is giving you trouble, and trying your luck elsewhere for a while.. and maybe out there you'll go up in stats, find some more charges for your Flask, improve your weapons or find better gear, obtain some new magic or learn how to craft a helpful item, and also hone your own abilities as a player with practice without frustration.. then when you come back, that impossible boss won't seem so hard anymore.I love this game.  It's just one of those things that checks all the boxes for me, and I'd encourage anyone curious to try it... especially since they're now already patching the game to try to relieve some of the troubles that PC players were having on launch (I count myself lucky to not have those problems myself.. I've seen on stream what the issue looks like and I understand the frustration for those that are experiencing that weird 'chug' or 'stutter')"
Positive,game of the year easily
Positive,like dark souls but with more dark souls

Positive,One of the bests games i played in YEARS
Positive,GOAT GOTY 2022 TOM HOLLAND WHAT THE HELL
Positive,"10/10 I love this game more than my girlfriendUpdate: The first playthrough of this game was amazing. However, reuse of bosses and dungeons make replaying the game significantly less exciting."
Positive,"Incredible game. Do you remember when Dark Souls first came out and it spawned dozens of copycats and essentially became a new genre? Elden Ring will do the same for open-world games that come after it. Areas are packed with secrets to find, visual storytelling and interesting encounters. It avoids boring open-world checklists and ""go here"" quest markers.If you like Souls games, this is a must buy. If you don't, probably skip it. If you aren't sure, go pick up one of the Dark Souls games on sale to see if you like it and don't give up. Initially you may get frustrated and want to quit; dying is just part of the learning process. Dark Souls 3 is probably the closest in playstyle to this game, although Elden Ring includes a LOT more magic and mobility options. For those worried about the difficulty, this game includes options to summon both other players and NPC helpers in difficult areas. You'll still die a ton, but it makes the fights much more accessible. Caster builds let you play more defensively to help with the difficulty. TL;DR: Probably the best open-world game so far. If you're into Souls games you were probably already going to buy it. If you're not sure, buy an older Souls games on sale and really give it your all."
Positive,Great game poggers
Positive,this game is one of the most game ever.
Positive,"I don't care who she is,  I just really need that hug."
Positive,I do enjoy this game
Positive,"The game is absolutely stunning; Elden Ring does so much right and for me, personally, it feels like they combine the best parts of open-worlds (e.g. The Witcher III, Skyrim) while still having that wholesome Soulsborne-feeling to the whole game.There are, at launch, however weird frame drops even on very high-end PCs (RTX 3080 OC, i7-high-end-models, Ryzen 3800X) that need to be taken care of. Also, the FPS is locked to 60 for me."
Positive,"EDIT after fixes: I'm turning my review into a positive because after multiple patches, the performance is a lot smoother. This may be the best Soulsborne game ever made. They've also did a great job on crafting a meaningful open world game. And I'm sure this will have the effect of making previous games better, like if I went back and played Sekiro again or played Bloodborne for the first time, it'll be a blast. Form Software somehow makes games that compliment each other in a retroactive way.FIRST VERSION OF MY REVIEWAlmost non-existant optimisation. Much better looking games run much faster than Elden Ring on my PC. Other than that, great game. FormSoftware basically built upon every game they previously made and also made it open world. I'll change my review to positive when they patch the game properly."
Positive,If you like Dark souls as a series you ll prolly like this one. Its at least till endgame more streamlined and easier.Pros:*Open world *The immplementation of the horse is very good. They could have messed this up in several ways. Kudos to the devs.*Loads of contentCons:*Reuse of annoying enemies/bosses*Putting annoying bosses/enemies one after another Rant:e.g. Hey how about we put the player ina lake of blood and spawn an enemy that has frantic/weird as movement and the player can only fat roll in that lava and to boot let's stop him from summoning any spirit ashes/horses and hope that he dies of the bleed damage but ofc the player can roll into a rocky zone where he can move freely so yeah lets put that one on a cliff side where the player can roll into the abyss or just get pushed by the huge ass enemy. Oh and all for some dumb smithing stone he ll prolly wont ned anymore anyways.*So yeah some of the repeat enemies/areas just got skipped by me. It just made more sense to spend all your runes and grab whats there and die back to the grace(spawnpoint) which saved alot of time.Sometimes shorter is sweeter. If they had kept the game shorter with less repeat bullshit situation at the end it would have made the game more enjoyable.Anyhow 9/10.
Positive,"First Fromsoft game that I've played, and I'm already 17 hours deep in just a handful of days. I can tell this is going to keep me playing for at least 100 more, if not many more than that.The game is absolutely gorgeous, the combat is tense, and it looks like there are many different builds you can go for replayability. I cannot stress enough how beautiful it is. Every vista looks like a wallpaper. Between the amazing artistic style and the intense, almost equally beautiful soundtrack, it's a delight for the senses to play. For once, I don't regret buying a full price game close to its initial release.Be forewarned: even meeting recommended specs, not minimum, your computer probably WILL stutter and suffer a bit during the course of the game. The performance issues people complain about are very real, and it's possible it could affect your enjoyment of the game if you're particularly put off by those kinds of technical hiccups. That said, it generally runs decent enough, just some rough moments. I can't recall a technical hiccup resulting in my death yet, which is my main fear with stutters. The main cause of my death is the very aggressive buffering in place, guaranteeing that panicked button presses will result in possibly unintended actions.If you have avoided the Souls games until now, this seems like an amazing entry into that universe for you to get your feet wet. Just don't spoil too much for yourself, and don't be afraid to die. A lot."

Positive,Severe lack of female companions?
Positive,"Elden Ring is by far my most favourite game of 2022 and possibly of all time, it has given me a nostalgic sense of adventure similar to what Skyrim did back in 2011. My first FromSoftware game was Bloodborne back in 2015, this game definitely tops that in my opinion, it was a good that I was able to be apart of the Dark Souls community all the way from Dark Souls 1-3 and all the stories I encountered, the bosses I've defeated and died to, all the unique builds, enemies, weapons and armours I've discovered, it all culminated to this game's hype and it was worth the wait."

Positive,9.9 / 10 - Masterpiece
Positive,"the best advice i got from this game was: ""try finger but hole"""
Positive,why is it always weak foe?
Positive,In my opinion this is the best game I have ever played and easily a contender for best game ever. So goated they keep topping themselves
Positive,"I was expecting a ""revolutionary"" new game, but its basically dark souls 5. Still love the game, but its still the same template with a beautiful world and monster design!"
Positive,"Had a ball with Elden Ring. I played a lot of Dark Souls 1, and I can say that I'm really happy with how the game came out; there's still things that feel unfair, or encounters specifically designed to annoy (rather than challenge), but I still think it was a great experience."
Positive,"One of my favourite games of all time already, so much to see so much to explore.I will be stuck on this one for a while.Once they fix the performance issues so that everyone can have a smooth experience I have no doubt this will go down as one of the greatest games of all time."
Positive,Brings the best of all the FromSoft games in one package.
Positive,games fucking sick

Positive,10/10 masterpiece. Get it before you die irl.
Positive,basically 3D terraria
Positive,"I can comfortably say this is easily one of the best games I've ever played and I recommend it to everyone, especially those who aren't good at and/or have little interest in Souls games. The very nature of the game makes this one something else and, as someone who sucks at these games and can't parry to save my life, I managed to kill even the hardest bosses."
Positive,Probably my new favorite game. It's something special. Give it a chance. 10/10
Positive,"They decided to go open-world, which they didn't exactly know what to do with, which contributed to several game-design conundrums and generally gave the game a bit of a different feel. Otherwise it's peak Fromsoft."
Positive,Good Game Ahead.
Positive,"Oh my god, it was you... You're the Elden Ring"
Positive,Great game.phenomenal graphics. Thank you reformed orthodox rabbi Bill Clinton.
Positive,"Game is good, but there is too much to do. The controls feel excellent and responsive. But, the world is just so large, magnificently beautiful, and immersive, that my eyes just can't take it. What kind of a game can you put 100 hours into and still be in your first play through. There's just too much to see and to do that it is exhausting. I haven't been able to go outside in days. I just need to become Elden Lord."
Positive,"It's all I think about at work. It's all I think about during love making. It's all I think about when reading. It's everywhere. This game, its impact, has greatly enlarged my brain with equal parts dopamine and skin-tearing rage. There is nothing else to say; buying this game WILL make you an Elden Brain."
Positive,"BE PREPARED TO REFUND IF THE GAME DOESN'T RUN WELL FOR YOU AND WAIT FOR A PATCH, THANKS FROM SOFT.Outside of people who have gimped performance. 11/10 game.  Absolutely perfect.Finished game. Still 11/10."
Positive,"It is a masterpiece. It's the culmination of everything Fromsoft has been crafting from a long, long time, and for those who have followed them, played every game, enjoyed every second playing, this is graduation day: A vast, open world filled with so much to discover, a thrilling story and so many new things that will blow your mind. This is a game that will be remembered for the ages.Maybe avoid if you're not a Fromsoft fan, discouraged easily by challenges or just want to enjoy a more approachable casual game. This requires commitment to learn every nook and cranny, but the reward is the satisfaction of learning and overcoming obstacles. Believe me, if you put the time, you'll enjoy an adventure that has you exploring and learning for quite the time.Technical issues will be patched down the road, if you're a Fromsoft fan you know what to expect from a PC port. In my case, though,  the performance is smooth and flawless in Windows 11 with a 2070 Super, so I guess I was very lucky, and after a couple of patches things are getting better."

Positive,"1. the first 10-20 hours of elden ring is some of the best content video games as a medium have to offer, period. the last 60 hours are just bad dark souls 3 where almost every encounter is more predictable and disappointing than the last. every unique boss is amazing. every duplicate made me wish i was playing dark souls 2 (bad vibleo game but I enjoy it all the same). 2. difficulty across the board is pretty damn good, except portions of the midgame where i melted shit for no reason. died to malenia more than any souls boss but what a cool fight! i love myself and the community going batshit over a bullshit attack. it reminds me of the capra demon, which is just a brilliantly bad fight and summarises everything i love about dark souls. i'm a f,reaky bitch. 3. stormveil castle makes you think you are playing the culmination of every good thing about souls games. caelid, snow area one and two, mount gelmir, every single dungeon (probably hundreds), every fucking teleporter than ruins the sense of discovery, and the moment you realise the only way to interact with one of the greatest video game worlds ever is to hit it with a sword - just makes you feel like you're wasting time.4. there's a lot of epic, slow attacks available to the player in elden ring. no boss in the entire game will give you an opening to use them, though! i played strength and a jumping attack is the maximum amount of attack you're allowed to use. weapon arts not allowed. spells only allowed from a distance. whack.tl;dr: elden ring is one of the prettiest games i have ever played, but it would be much better if it was a snowboarding game so i could snowboard throughout the game rather than press r1 300,000 times to kill enemies i don't care for to get to the end of a story that doesn't capture me. the same exact criticism applies to every souls game, but i love them all because at least they are constantly surprising me. i love novelty! and snowboarding!"
Positive,"I have played every single Soulsborne game to date and completed them all multiple times across multiple platforms/generations.  I can say with confidence, Elden Ring is the combination of every great aspect of every game in their line up.  It has been so long since I have played a game not wanting to stop with childlike wonder the whole time.  Since playing Dark Souls in 2011, I have been saying that an open world style Souls game would be incredible.  Now that we finally have it, I could not be more impressed and happy with the product.FromSoftware has also made some quality of life changes that just add clarity and could make it easier to people new to the franchise.  Don't get me wrong, the difficulty and learning curve is still here.  I have been humbled quite a few times already, and I foresee it happening through the rest of the game.  It may be in a new universe, but it still plays exactly like a Soulsborne game taking some gameplay hints from Sekiro.To address the technical/ other issues: I have experienced a few.  For starters;-The lack of ultra wide support is not a factor for me so I can't really say much there.  HOWEVER, it's 2022, I feel like this should be a setting by default in the industry.  It's like not adding FOV in a FPS, it should be a crime not to do so.-The addition of Easy Anti Cheat is a good one I think, it'll definitely make modder's lives harder to create fixes especially for online use.  I am unfamiliar on how effective Easy Anti Cheat is, but any big name software to make it harder for cheaters to play and get away it is music to my ears.-Although I OBVIOUSLY prefer to have uncapped FPS, 60 is playable.  Trust me, I remember the days of playing on console at 30 FPS as recently as Bloodborne.  Amazing game and still probably my favorite in the franchise, but dear lord is the framerate and frame pacing absolute trash.  60 FPS feels like more than double the smoothness and responsiveness compared to 30 FPS in any scenario.-I have to unplug my keyboard before launching the game because Elden Ring will recognize the first device on start up.  It's annoying, but there are worse things and hopefully this can be patched-Bugs, they have been few are far between, but I have had a boss totally freeze and not react after dying to it but somehow living.  Like, legit being brought to zero HP and still living.  This happened only once in my experience during co-op, so the servers probably had some effect on that.-The stuttering is not acceptable in 2022 with an Ryzen 5800x and RTX 3070.  Elden Ring looks good, but this rig will crush just about any game so having essentially the Dark Souls 3 engine bring it to it's knees is a HUGE no no.*To expand on the stuttering, I have honestly had not that much once you move past the ""starting area"".  There are some detail heavy areas throughout the game, I really have not had issues.  But every time I return to the small starting area: stutter city.  Mileage may very, test out your game and refund if it persists would be my suggestion.*"
Positive,"Elden Ring is a masterpiece that has restored my faith in gaming. I could start off by telling you how beautiful the lands between are and how its breath taking landscapes make me get lost and finding myself taking the road less traveled more often than not. I am currently 35 hours in and I have 0 idea where I am at on my progress on or where I'm at in the story. I just keep roaming the landscape looking for new bosses to fight, items to loot, and spells to learn. Never have I lost time so easily in a game. The music blends amazingly well with the environments and seamlessly transitions during boss encounters. If you are new to souls type games or if you aren't. I can't recommend this game enough. If you are thinking about it just do it."
Positive,"41 hours in and I barely got my first trophy; Rountable Hold. That's not a boss, it's just getting to a location. Not rushing myself and having fun."
Positive,many dogs 10/10
Positive,Rage inducing but yet so addictive
Positive,The people who say this game is hard are lying.
Positive,"This is the best souls like experience From Software could ever grace us. From the very moment you start in Elden Ring you are introduced to the new and interesting world and it just becomes ever more confusing the more you play! You meet tons of characters on your journey who may be of service, betray you, give you a chuckle, or just call you out that you have no maidens. There are tons of bosses and challenges for you to face even after you beat the game because of how expansive this game is. I am just going to put some good things and bad things I have with the game as I do want to specify a big issue I have. First I want to start off with the good: The world design is fantastic as every area feels different from the rest. Certain places give you a sense of adventure while some may give you a sense of dread and fear of dying in .2 seconds. The weapons and armor are some of the best in the souls series. The combat is much more fluid than the previous souls game. Horse combat and gameplay is a very nice addition to the game. Most if not all the characters you meet feel unique and confusing as they all speak tounge. Now I could go on and on about how good this game is but I just need to point out my biggest issue. There are tons of reused bosses in this game. In addition, I have seen regular enemies become bosses later. Worst of all, there are bosses that you fight one on one and then they are reused as a duo boss. The three biggest culprits are the dragons,  godskin noble, AND THOSE CRUCIBLE KNIGHTS WHICH YOU FIGHT 7 DIFFERENT TIMES. These of course are just only a few examples of reused bosses. Just a side complaint here is the performance in some areas of the game. I know this will probably be fixed later in a patch but man those stutters are common and have affected a boss fight or two. But these performance issues didn't happen all the time to hamper my overall experience.In conclusion, Elden Ring is phenomenal and I do have my personal complaints of the game but at the end of the day if you enjoy souls like games that From Software releases I think you should pick this one up. Good luck out there Tarnished! My Rating: 9.5/10"
Positive,this is the dragon's dogma of dark souls
Positive,please add sex and huge boobs please
Positive,"The Good:From what I've played, I think it is the best FromSoftware game I've played since Dark Souls. It feels like it takes the best parts of DS1, DS2, and DS3 and meshes it all together while simultaneously adding new features and content such as the larger open world, stealth, and horseback riding.The Bad:Starting and closing the game. Easy Anti-Cheat makes the game startup slow, If you are trying to play with a mouse and keyboard the game by default has all its menu tooltips in controller buttons which you have to navigate to the settings menu and find the prompts option to switch it to Mouse and Keyboard (after this whole endeavour I remembered souls games are designed heavily with a controller in mind so I dug out a controller). Then, after I'm done playing the game, I have to: quit to the title screen, Log back into the server, and go back to the main menu before finally I can quit to desktop. Then it takes the game around 5 seconds to figure out how to close to the desktop. Afterwords the game may not close properly and I've had glitches such as looping audio clips playing after the application exits that have resulted in me having to restart my desktop. All of these negatives only apply to starting and closing the game. Game play wise the only negatives are things typical in From Software Souls games like its tutorials feeling a bit too conservative. That said even here the game has some of the most extensive tutorials I've seen in any From Software game so these negatives don't seem as pronounced as in their other games.All in all I really have enjoyed this game thus far and think its probably a must play for souls fans. That said, I would be prepared to deal with some annoying oversights and performance issues when starting and wrapping up game sessions."
Positive,I'm absolutely loving the game so far. It is what I wanted out of the next Souls game. There are so many surprises around every corner.My only complaint is the performance of the game during combat. Horse back combat stutters crazily on my 1080 / i7-6700K running at 1080p. At times it is unusable. I'm hoping further patches will fix it.
Positive,"i lost my job, i lost my wife and i lost my children, but i will never lose to Malenia again"

Positive,"I just have to put my two cents in fixing this game's review rating.I'm 26 hours in, I did a lot of things and still I see that the game ahead of me is several times bigger. And all this time I was, am and will be incredibly entertained.Everything in this game just feels perfect for me (outside of perfomance - yeah, I have to acknowledge that, I'm not blind). Exploring the world, fighting, riding the Torrent, upgrading all the stuff I can upgrade, exploring some more, studying the lore, backtracking to areas I already explored and discovering 3 new unexplored paths, doing some PVP, exploring some more...Elden Ring is basically an ideal game for me. It takes everything good from the games I like, something good from the games I don't appreciate enough, fills it in with infinite amount of original mechanics and design choices - and gives me pure fun. And we really need some clean fun in times like this,Go get it.UPD: I finished this game twice, once with a total sweep and once with sweeping everything up to Leyndell. Totally worth it."
Positive,"yeah it's a good one, but you knew that already, so i'll talk about other stuffso far it's notably easier than past games which, despite what the dweebs will tell you, isn't a bad thing. i expect it'll get torturously hard eventually but i'm enjoying where it's at now george rr martin's influence is only making things slightly less interesting than the previous games, at least so far; FromSoft seems to have mitigated his penchant for boring shit for the most part and while it's less bizarre and otherworldly as the Souls games it's not by a huge amountthe community has already formed brand new memes with the in-game message system, as well as resurrecting most of the classics, so like, if that's your thing you'll be pleased therecharacter creation/customization is better than previous FromSoft games but maybe not quite as good as Demon's Souls 2020? depending on what you're looking for, anyway. if you want to start the new Monster Factory i think you'll be pleased; but it's not impossible to make a conventionally attractive person either if that's your jamthere's stuttering and shit for sure which is a bummer but it beats trying to buy a PS5 and it's still better than the earlier, jankier games at their sub-30fps frameratesEDIT 10 HOURS LATER: okay it's very hard now"
Positive,мне все нравки значит игра топчик ^_________^
Positive,im dogwater at this game but its fun as heck
Positive,"It very well might be the greatest game ever, if not definitely in the conversation. As much as I hold DS1 and DS3 near and dear to my heart, Elden RIng is trying to take their places as my fave FromSoft game. Currently running back through the base game to finish alt characters so I can enjoy the DLC with a few different builds. What amazes me most about the game is the little different things I pick up on after each playthrough. There's always something new to discover about the game during a new playthrough. Have fun fellow Tarnished ;)As always, Praise the Sun!!! :D"
Positive,I hate this game 10/10
Positive,I love to ring up with the boys - Leon Sex Kennedy
Positive,"everything about elden ring is amazing i really liked the boss fights, a worthy challenge i can't wait for the expansions"
Positive,L + ratio + you have no maidens + you're tarnished + touch grace
Positive,"I am over 20 years old. When I was a child I would enjoy video games in such a way that brought pure joy into my life. However, either through life or personal choices I lost that feeling long ago, at least I though I did. This game brought back that feeling as if it was a familiar smell allowing me a little bit of respite to recall fond memories that were buried deep deep down, memories that sparked joy."
Positive,"My main gripe is we don't get enough runes per kill in the starting areas before Godrick, the Golden Boy they showed off in a bunch of trailers. 50-65 runes per kill and we need 7400 to go from level 34-35? That's the harshest aspect of the game, I think. The stuttering is intermittent for me and hasn't hampered my gameplay at all. It really only seems to happen when I'm transitioning back out into the open world or during a storm when I'm whipping the camera around to look at the trees trying to take off into the sky with the fury of their shaking. I still love the game, though. A lot of fun. Super punishing."
Positive,Cons:No ultrawide support! Performance could be better on 2080ti + i9 9900k!Pros:GOTYBest game i ever played in long time!Plus:I died on first enemy without hit him one f* time 10/10 hahaha

Positive,"Very challenging game but once you figure your way around the game becomes more manageable.  There were probably only a few times I felt when I died it was unfair.  Most of the times mistakes were made and understandably my character would die.  This game is very artistic and attention to detail was spent on the story, the environment, the characters, and behavior of your opponents.  The lore is a mix of western and Buddhist type art work.  Everything about the world is subtle in nature and the store explains itself as you progress.  Highly recommend this game but you will have to be patient and invest time."
Positive,"A showcase of meticulousness and intent.Immaculate art direction and worldbuilding. Whether it is cramped spaces like the Roundtable Hold or huge environments like the Sofira River / Nokkron there's always a mesmerizing, painting-like quality to the background, from the firsts steps to the climax. Sometimes Creepy, often eerie and always awe inspiring, the world of the Lands Between is very intentional and deeply integrated in the gameplay and lore. Undeniably satisfying to explore and uncover, emphasized by very little guidance and an important freedom of choice.The gameplay is really mastered, riding a fine line between difficulty and balance with the addition of horseback riding, offering a refreshing and dynamic element to a usually grounded and methodical combat although completely unforgiving.Rage inducing at times but impossible to quit as even the hardest bosses always show you just enough glimpses of an opening and winning is ever so satisfying, you just have to reopen the game and go for it one more time.Wonderful game."
Positive,"Was afraid it was going to be formulaic AAA open world, but still feels like formulaic Dark Souls, 10/10. Runs lag free for me on Linux, playing at 4K high settings on a 6900XT,"

Positive,"Great game. No woke garbage, no condescending hand-holding, just good ol' fashioned open world RPG with spectacular environments. Accessible to gamers who were never good at the previous Souls games. Still challenging but in a good way. Just be prepared to play on the controller because the camera movement with keyboard and mouse is annoying. Git gud scrub."

Positive,"Ok I lied.I said Gujian3 would be the only game I'd ever write a review about but that was before falling in love with Elden Ring. It was my very first FromSoft game and overall my very first souls / souls-like game, but it was SO MUCH FUN and although I'm quite a noob I had a lot of fun, enjoyed the boss fights, the musics, the story and the various ways of playing you get to experience. There are so many ways to get past everything and anything, and I've had a great time trying different things on different bosses, learning them, getting my butt beaten and coming back to them with my bones in shambles (I love you, Malenia, I really do). It gives you a lot of manners to simply make it work without forcefully using spirit ashes, be it through incantations, spells and all, and upon forcing myself not to play with my Mimic Tear in the DLC (I did it on two bosses, I admit, but I hate that Golden Hippo and I didn't use it that much in the base game), I've learnt a loooot of ways to still have fun and am quite proud of what I've achieved. It's a very good first experience for a non-experimented player, I think, but if you're not used to games where basically everything wants you dead, it can be frustrating (and also because fuck Gaius).The game is a master piece, truly. I've utterly fallen in love with it and I now have a little Elden Ring corner on my shelves with artbooks, guidebooks, goodies and all... Be it through its lore, its landscapes, its voice acting (I love you Messmer), its music... Everything is astonishing and I, sometimes, couldn't even believe what I was looking at (or hearing). (I might as well try the other FromSoft games when I'll be rid of my BloodBorne traumas.)"

Whom grace would again bless.A Tarnished of no renown.Cross the fog, to the Lands Between.To stand before the Elden Ring.And become the Elden Lord."
Positive,"This game is just a masterpiece if u played souls like games (Dark Souls & Bloodborne). First of all it’s an open world game (dark souls and bloodborne no), the lore is insane and huge, the graphic it’s the greatest I’ve ever seen so far. Probably you will spend 100 hours or less because it’s an open world and you will feel like confused or lost (I remember it’s an open world) but once you understand (by guide, wiki Elden ring etc…) everything it’s absolutely worth to continue. About performance on pc is kinda good, but there are some bugs which it depends on probably or from your game or pc specs like GPU. Overall, for the game itself is absolutely GOTY (5/5 rating) and I recommend this game if it’s your first soul like game."

There is lots of variety in weapon choice and fighting styles which again makes it more appealing for people new to this game style. I would say for people starting out in Elden Ring, don't get disheartened when you cant get past a boss, take time, level up and try again!"
Positive,"Words are hard to find for this game, Personally i didnt know how much i would love lore of this game. soundtracks are just masterpieces and game mechanics are insane how much creativity u can put on your character. If anyone is thinking about to buy this game, u should have no hasitations and buy dlc too (i will buy it soon).Thx FromSoftware for making this masterpiece and thanks too you all for great community !One more time big THANKS !"
Positive,"Elden Ring mudou a maneira como vejo e aprecio os jogos. Ele não apenas aperfeiçoou a fórmula dos títulos anteriores da FromSoftware, mas também me impactou pessoalmente. A sensação de conquista, a profundidade da narrativa e a beleza do mundo me proporcionaram uma experiência que vai além do simples entretenimento. Este jogo me inspirou, me desafiou e, de muitas maneiras, mudou minha vida. É a obra-prima da FromSoftware, elevando os souls a um novo padrão e deixando uma marca indelével na história dos videogames."

Positive,"This is definitely one of the best games ever produced, and clearly one of the bests from From Software. The graphics and quality are stunning, the fluidity is amazing and you will never get such an amazing open world for a Souls-like again. The fact that you have to puzzle the whole story together also makes it feel never ending. I feel like this is a generation's accumulation of gaming and Data all put together to create one huge masterpiece. I cannot wait for ""Shadows of the Erdtree"" and am getting sooo impatient about it. Would recommend to anyone trying to get into Souls-like games."

Positive,"One of the best games i've ever played in my life. Worth for it to be called GOTY. Spending hours learning patterns, builds, and strats best feeling i've known. Futhermore, the OST is sick as hell. Yuka Kitamura is really the work of art to these soulsborne games. Favorite boss of all time to Maliketh, The Black Blade truly a design.Thank you Hidetaka Miyazaki for changing my life to this game."

Positive,"Ahh, I knew you'd come. To stand before the Elden Ring. To become Elden Lord. What a sad state of affairs. I commend your spirit, but alas, none shall take the throne. Queen Marika has high hopes for us. That we continue to struggle. Unto eternity."
Positive,"Elden Ring experience transcended the ordinary, reaching a state of incomparable bliss as i achieved a lavishly orchestrated victory against lore shattering bosses, attaining a level of gameplay that was both prodigious and transcendent—truly a moment of reaching Nirvana in the digital universe."
Positive,"maidenless at first, but then not maidenless. Update: currently maidenless again"
Positive,This game perfectly immerses you in the world of Elden Ring ❤️
Positive,hard like me
Positive,I like it
Positive,YOU HAVE DIED
Positive,"as a person who has lots of sex all the time, i can say that this game is 100% accurate to having sex with sexy women. like i do. everyday. this game did not make me horny however. i am not gay. i just have too much sex with real women to spend more than 15 minutes in this game. on the other hand i would recommend this game to people who do not have sex (unlike me because i have lots of sex with women a lot) as there is a naked woman in it and she is naked. she kinda looks like one of my many girlfriends who i have sex with a lot. i have lots of sex. i also an very handsome and women ALWAYS want to have sex with me because i am very muscular and handsome and very good at video games. all my girlfriends say im very good at sex and playing video games and being handsome. one of my girlfriends asked me to have sex with her but i told her i was playing a sex game instead so she started crying and became a lesbian and killed herself because i did not have sex with her. i have sex with women. not men. i am not gay. i am very cool and handsome so girls always have sex with me because i am very cool and sexy. my penis is very big. all my girlfriends like my penis because it is very big and i am very good at sex with my women. every woman ive had sex with is very sexy and so am i. i have lots of sex. i am also very handsome and sexy and i have lots of sex."
Positive,This art is a total game-changer. It's indescribably beautiful. You have to try it; even Elon Musk recommends it. 🤍

Positive,i'm so glad i had literally 0 idea what was going on in the story all game. very cool
Positive,"I think I've said ""Oh god, oh fuck"" and ""what in the nine hell is that?! RUN!!"" a million times while playing ER. Just trying to dress nice in the game in the middle of all the fucked up things that's happening. The lore is amazing. It's hard but it's a good hard (whut?) Tried a few builds that fits my play style but ended up with the m e t a, rivers of blood, a bleed build. my most favorite quest here is ofc the jelly fish quest. most hated boss is rykard bec he gave me nightmare and he's an opponent of cuteness. patches is a dick and Ive been tempted to just give in to the chaos of the lord of the frenzied flame. best place bec of aesthetic is Nokron, the Eternal city. Best game and ended up one of my favorite until Malenia. Would recommend"
Positive,My first Souls-like game I've ever played. It deserved the best game of 2022.

Positive,"immensely carried by its incredible enviroment, art direction, character design and voice acting. Whomever was in charge of art direction and voice acting pulled out the most stunning miraculous mesmerizing world ever created, a crowning achievement only comparable to when God created light. Seriously not enough praise in this world for everyone involved in the visuals, audio, and lore. A game which somehow has multiple characters that have noticeably changed my personality, not to mention i know more about the in-game lore than i do actual real history. Unfortunately, whomever was in charge of the gameplay department did not have such divine insight. In fact there is such a discrepancy of quality between the gameplay and everything else that i unironically think they should issue a public apology to all the artists involved for what they did. Somehow after making basically the same game 5 whole times, they are still making the exact same mistakes over and over again even though literally everyone hates them. There is no reason anyone in 2024 should have to cross a fogwall and see yet another terrible gank fight with enemies that were never designed to be in a gank fight. Or another giant that doesn't even try to fit on the screen so you can't see more than 20% of him. Or see nothing at all, because the camera got stuck on a wall or some uneven terrain which they for some reason keep including into an unacceptable number of bossfights. Elden Ring is still probably my favourite game of all time, but every time i play it I just get infuriated by how much better it should be. I believe this is the closest we'll ever get to a perfect game, and if I could just change a few things here and there we would have had the greatest invention since fire. The lore introduces a near-infinite amount of incredible stories to be told, characters to get to know and love, and empires to watch rise and crumble; and then delivers on like 3 of them. If you have a good imagination it's not that bad because you can just fill in the gaps by simply making stuff up, but it would have been really nice to see at least like 50 more plot points receive some sort of official information. Gameplay seems interesting, and at times it really really is, but a lot of the time it just feels like 'o i wonder what the delayed timing on THIS aoe attack is'. Maybe it's just because i'm autistic or maybe fromsoft games just aren't for me, but personally i can't stand stuff like lingering aoe attacks that require unintuitive weird methods to dodge, or laughably delayed swings where the guy literally just stands there with his hand raised like your big brother going ""i'm not even hitting you why are you flinching"". I love this game so so so much and that's what makes it all the more frustrating to run into the brick-wall-flaws on every playthrough, hoping ""surely the 14th time i play the game it will be different"". It's worth playing more than any other game, but knowing just how talented and dedicated these creators are it's sad that even something this good doesn't live up to the standards and expectations they should be at. Giving Elden Ring a numerical score is hopeless, as it can be anything from a 7/10 to an 11/10 depending on what you're looking at"
Positive,"I finished Elden Ring - played on Linux, flawlessly.Elden Ring has all the ingredients of the Dark Souls series: fascinating combats, loads of intriguing weapons, spells, and a fantastic environment. Elden Ring shines additionally that it is now fully open world plus you can now spring and crouch and sneak up behind enemies. And a horse.Which you'll need since the land ""in between"" is enormous. Not only on the surface but underneath is another continent to explore.All this is in the same line as Dark Souls gameplay.Including a confusing storyline of the Golden Order and the Erd Tree. It is a perfect Souls game. With one minor drawback: it's way too big. Much. Too. Big.9/10"
Positive,"Elden Ring is the kind of game that will leave you completely immersed in its world for hours on end. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is challenging and rewarding, and the lore is absolutely fascinating. FromSoftware has once again outdone themselves with this masterpiece, delivering an experience that is truly unforgettable.The combat is fast-paced and requires strategy and precision, with a variety of weapons and spells to choose from. The enemies are challenging and will keep you on your toes, forcing you to adapt and improve your skills. The open world is beautifully crafted and filled with secrets and mysteries waiting to be uncovered.But what really sets Elden Ring apart is its captivating lore. The game's world is rich with history and mythology, with each area and character adding to the depth of the story."
Positive,"Once again, FromSoftware has created a world that's both breathtaking and brutal in Elden Ring.Take Malenia, Blade of Miquella, for example - she's one tough boss that'll keep you on your toes. Her moves are downright unpredictable, but once you crack her pattern, victory is oh-so-sweet.And let's not forget the story and world, crafted by none other than George R.R. Martin. It's as rich and immersive as you'd expect from the mind behind Game of Thrones.In the end, Elden Ring is a must-play for anyone who loves a good challenge and a good laugh. And if you manage to take down Malenia, Blade of Miquella, you've earned yourself a round of applause... and maybe a well-deserved break. Good luck out there!"
Positive,best game i have ever played
Positive,Won Game of the Year award for a reason. Definitely worth playing.
Positive,Step on me Malenia
Positive,Elden Ring is the best game ever till Elden Ring 2 comes out
Positive,"finna kms, had to get homie to carry me. 22 hours just to kill margit :D"
Positive,"My favorite part is when Ranni says ""hnnnng its Ranni'ing time and Rannis all over the place (commits war crimes on fingers)"" and then I get confused by the thousands of plotholes but mostly forget about them because being beaten to death over and over by a skin fetish edition of Ornstein and Smough is more fun than thinking. Other than being a faux predecessor of the souls series that probably disappoints most hardcore dark souls fans, it brings a refreshing light on the Miyazaki soulslike genre making it more accessible to a wider audience."
Positive,"Ah, tarnished. Thye is witnessing something beautifull, gracefull, and magnificent. You shall become eldenlord!"
Positive,"Die to the first boss, run from the second.10/10 mental torture simulator."

Positive,"Beautiful desolation. This is basically an AAA low fantasy STALKER, with fewer bandits, and everything i thought games could be when I was a kid.Fuck crucible knights, though. Armoured bastards."
Positive,I got f•cked hard
Positive,"An incredible experience your first playthrough, probably the best if not one of the best first playthroughs I've ever had of a game. Make sure to savor and enjoy it because if you're like me, when you go back to experience it again it'll be all too familiar. This is the game I would erase from my memory to enjoy it for the first time again. Like other souls-likes it'll be frustrating sometimes. Enemies hiding in corners and ceilings waiting to ambush you and take cheap shots, bosses that'll overwhelm and crush you until you die enough times to figure them out. But this game has an unparalleled feeling of exploration and discovery that I haven't experienced in other games that keep me willingly risking those ambushes. If you want to play Co-op with a bud undisturbed and experience the whole game together, I'd recommend the  Seamless Co-op [www.nexusmods.com] mod which you can find on Nexus Mods. It'll prevent invasions from other players during Co-op and allow you to play through all areas of the game that may otherwise prevent Co-op in the Vanilla game. Never was a fan of invasions so if you aren't either it is a good solution."
Positive,Melina and Ranni so fine10/10 game

Positive,"Elden Ring è un capolavoro del genere.Finalmente From Software aggiunge un tutorial VERO all'inizio del gioco, che pur non spiegando piccolezze tecniche, dà un'ottima infarinatura generale anche a chi non si è mai approcciato al genere Souls.Il mondo di gioco è vastissimo e quasi ogni angolo dell'interregno è immediatamente raggiungibile dopo qualche minuto di gioco a partita iniziata.La quantità di contenuto in questo titolo è smisurata, e ad ogni passo ci ritrova una ricompensa unica, come ben pochi titoli nel 2022 hanno saputo fare. Il sistema di combattimento è completamente personalizzabile: ogni arma ha il suo moveset specifico, e una mossa speciale che può essere quasi sempre cambiata con una a scelta tra le decine disponibili; oltre a questo, il sistema di gioco spinge a questa specializzazione offrendo la possibilità, oltre ai classici incantesimi e stregonerie RPG, di aggiungere qualsiasi status/elemento a quasi ogni arma, rendendo il gameplay vario e ogni playthrough completamente nelle mani del giocatore.10/10 meritatissimo per l'incredibile esperienza di gioco che offre"
Positive,This game lets you hug a woman
Positive,"Masterpiece, i don't think ill be able to explain to you the amount of fun i've had playing Elden Ring, you're just gonna have to play for yourself, why aren't you doing that already? First few hours were really tough, from figuring out the main fundamentals of the game to mechanics of it since this is my first souls game since Bloodborne which was a really long time ago, so just power through the first few hours and first main boss and you're good from there. you will also lose track of time A LOT, so keep that in mind, you'll have one objective you wanna do in mind but you'll end up with five instead because of how huge and amazing the world is and the different things you'll encounter, i just can't get over how massive the world is.Since this is a review i have to mention some kind of flaw, and honestly there are very few to none and they barely had an impact on my experience to be honest, the most obvious one is performance issues which is honestly understandable since this is mainly a console game, you will wanna play it on controller trust me, don't even try playing it on M&KB, barely any effort was made by the devs to make the game playable on M&KB unless you do a lot of rebinding, but im guessing that's due to them wanting you to play it on controller. And this one just doesn't have to do anything with the game but with community, the community can be a bit toxic and they will tend to shame you for playing or defeating a certain boss with a certain mechanic (not everyone can defeat a boss with no hits at lvl1 bruh), so just ignore that minor part of the community and play as you like, all mechanics and play styles in the game are intended and non are cheesy, just enjoy yourself! 10/10 would play again ."

Positive,game of the year.
Positive,"""Elden Ring"" is a masterpiece action and adventure game that offers players an extraordinary and immersive experience. The game's vast and intricate world provides ample opportunity for exploration, and players are encouraged to discover its secrets on their own, without the use of internet guides or wikis.With a journey that took over 500 hours, it is evident that the game provides a wealth of content for players to discover and enjoy. The game's combat system is highly praised, with the game's difficulty level requiring players to master their skills and strategies. The game's difficulty level was also noted as challenging and requires players to learn the mechanics of the game to be able to progress and discover the hidden secrets.I would recommend to play this game without any kind of guides or revealed information, as the game is designed to be a thrilling adventure game that offers players the opportunity to discover its secrets on their own. The game's lack of discovered maps and hidden locations on the first days of release, has made the game an even more exciting and challenging experience. The game's potential is acknowledged, but it is recommended that players approach it with an open mind and be ready to face the challenges it presents."
Positive,"Easiest FromSoftware game by far.Honestly, this is like Dark Souls 3, ""a flawed masterpiece"".If it weren't for the fact that one of the core game mechanics (the lock-on system) was fundamentally broken, and the fact that you can essentially out-dps almost everything (could have been fixed by boss hp scaling to the player's level or something of the like), then it would have been one of my favourite games of all time.That being said, even though I'm being critical, I genuinely loved the Elden Ring experience, pushed through all the way to NG+7 in about a week!Would recommend to anyone who is thinking of trying the FromSoftware series :)"
Positive,"After a long time, I finished another masterpiece by FromSoftware. When I started the game considering the previous parts I knew what to expect. The atmosphere of this game seems like a reward enough in itself for hundreds of deaths and effort. Each place in the game has its own story and each in its own way increases the imposingness of this world, waiting for the tarnished to increase his ambition to become an Elden Lord. In my opinion, the mysterious story that touch existentialist philosophical thoughts as well as the depth of the characters make this game a masterpiece, especially the last place in the game which, like Ash Lake in Dark Souls, makes you feel like you've discovered some incredible truth, lost to time. It would be stupid of me to finish writing this review without mentioning the music of the game, which took a special place in my heart and perfectly matched the ambiance of the places. Just by listening the music, you can conclude many things related to the story, such as the tragic fate of certain characters, heroism, loyalty, exaltation, affection and other similar things. I would especially highlight the music in Leyndell Royal Capital, Altus Plateau, the battle with Malenia, the battle with Godfrey, Elden Beast and Radagon. This music that I mentioned is personally special to me, but each one is impressive. And at the end, considering the success of this game and the rating it has achieved, I sincerely hope that this game will be game of the year 2022."

Positive,"It's an outstanding visual style and a combination of the most awesome parts of the previous games. You'll find something from Dark Souls and Dark Souls III, Sekiro, Bloodborne, and Demon Souls mechanics and items. Its lore is intricate but it is worth it to get deep into. It's hard not to miss something because of the open-world concept but on the other hand, it gives you more flexibility in actions and choices. It's not a copy of Dark Souls and those games couldn't be compared because they are different and great on their own. I think everyone who went through the main story waiting for the DLC, am I right?"
Positive,"Even though there are different opinions on the Internet, EldenRing has brought me an unparalleled game experience. Some problems in the game design can''t hide the super game quality of EldenRing itself. Even though there are more and more open-world games at present, the formulaic sandbox design and the same to-do list are gradually flooding. Under the background that European and American manufacturers put political correctness above the logic of the game and force disgusting players, it is not easy for fs and Miyazaki to patiently polish such an excellent open-world game. I once heard a game veteran  from a domestic stand-alone game field:  ""Many games are like things in life. If you don''t experience it when you want to play it, you may miss it forever. Even if you come back to play one day, it''s hard to find the feeling of entering that world for the first time. ""In the past during this time after the EldenRing was released, it has given me an unparalleled immersion experience from the game to the community. I sincerely thank fs and Miyazaki for their efforts over the past few years."

Again.Another thing that intrigued me was the content. There are so many things to see, from hidden dungeons to unique items. A lot of work has been put into this.Finally, the vistas. The game looks gorgeous from any angle, no matter where you are. Its like walking through various paintings."
Positive,"Another Soulsgame, another masterpiece. If you like to struggle, overcoming a challenge and having a wonderful feeling of success after beating a hard boss in a mysterious and beautiful fantasy world, then this game is for you!If you haven't played a soulslike game before, then Elden Ring is the perfect start!There are many Builds (Bleed or Magic for example), NPC Summons or Enemy type summons (called Spirit Ashes) which will aid you in battle and make the game *almost* too easy. In my first playthrough I did a Solo run as usual (Love you my trusty Zweihander), which many veterans will most likely do, but on my second run, it was a breeze with my Battle Mage Spirit Ash summon. You can also play co-op with friends, which is nicely done via password matchmaking.The new approach they took with this game, compared to their other games, is that it's open world now. There are tons and tons of secrets. Hidden dungeons, mini bosses, secret items or quests, no matter where you go, you'll find something, which impressed me a lot. Especially as many open World games have quite an empty map sadly.To traverse the stunning world, you'll get a goat spirit horse. You can also explore the world by foot like I did, but be ready to explore a very, very, veeery big map (first playthrough took me 280ish hours by foot, exploring every nook and cranny).This is sadly one of the points which made this game a 9/10 instead of a 10/10 for me. The map is almost too big. Sure, it is filled to the brink with stuff, but some dungeons and mini bosses are repeated, with only slight adjustments. I think the reason for that is, if a normal person just rides through the map with their goat spirit horse, they'll miss tons of dungeons and mini bosses, which makes it ok to have some of them repeated. For Hardcore explorer like I am, it was a bit boring to fight through some same dungeons again and again. Wasn't too bad in the end, but a slightly smaller map with less repeated content would have made the game perfect in my humble opinion. 10-20% smaller map maybe.The combat feels great, weighty attacks with nice feedback and reactive gameplay. Replayability is guaranteed with so many spells, weapons and weapon arts (equipable upgrades, which gives you a special attack or spell for you weapon, a great system to make builds even more unique)!The game plays completely different depending on your build. Some bosses which are hard for one build are a breeze for the other and vice versa.I'm excited for the upcoming DLC(s)!Give Elden Ring a try, it's a masterpiece through and through. And if you do, then make sure to check out other games made by FromSoftware too!"
Positive,"I guess I didn't review this on completion, but since then I've gone back and completed Dark Souls: Remastered, Dark Souls III (almost lol got burnt out), and started Dark Souls II, and I can satisfyingly say, this is an exceptional addition to the series. Great map, lots of unique and interesting weapons, armours, weapon arts, and so much more.As far as boss fights, main bosses are pretty cool, fun to fight for sure, most of the filler bosses are mediocre, and just feel like normal enemies with a bloated hp pool (which 8 times out of 10, they are just normal enemies with a bloated hp pool lmao)overall 93/100 game, I had a lot of fun, and I could absolutely tell this was the mastering of years of games and content, gg wpEdit: I have now finished DSR, DSII: SOTFS, and DSIII with 100% achievements on Steam, completed Demon's Souls on the PS5, and have amassed well over 1000 hours total with the Souls series. I can easily say this absolute masterpiece is the reason I took the time and gathered the motivation to complete such tasks.This series is absolutely phenomenal and has become one of the most important things to my person and interests. I love you Dark Souls, for changing my perspective on gaming forever."
Positive,"Elden Ring is the latest installment that FromSoftware has brought to us and it did much more than what I expected, the delivery was just perfect with an amazing world building, secrets, bosses and gameplay to accompany thru your travels on The Lands Between. The fact that you can approach the bosses however you want and whenever you want adds more to the fun material, the absurd amount of weapons/spells/ashes of war/spirit ashes(summons)/ that you can unlock to make your own builds just makes the game a better evolving experience. I've played all the previous games that they have released and Elden Ring without a doubt can be placed top 2 for me.PVP wise might be something that you don't enjoy or just are not interested in but pretty much everything can be used and if you are getting stomped on by the other user build then you have at your disposal and absurd amount of weapons and spells to counter the most ""broken and unfair"" builds, latency might be *dodgy* sometimes but for the time that I've played PvP I am more than satisfied with it."

Unparalleled Art & World design, Complex yet competing combat styles, Dense yet engaging lore, Rewarding exploration - is worth sending ripples in RPG genre of games.So i personally don't regret putting a single minute of mine into this for getting 100%.From the Get-Go, ER doesn't impose any particular playstyle or route on you.Acknowledging the fact that initial release in PC port had issues which felt to be a bit frustrating, but they were able to catch & patch it up real quick. Being optimistic towards these imperfections because nothing worth playing comes easy. !Hidetaka MIyazaki, George R.R Martin & Yuka KItamura together puts in a godly combination of Legendary bosses, Breathtaking world & Epic music.Thus, Elden ring is a Masterpiece - Having mastered the Art of showing without telling !"
Positive,"This is one of my favorite games of all time, the Souls formula has been perfected, its a game that let's you make any kind of character and buils, i really dont know whre this games are going to go but for now this is the best Souls game Ever Two Hammer Two hand Superior Army"

Positive,"Elden Ring... I don't even know where to start. It's an awe-inspiring world brimming with adventures and experiences. The FromSoftware concept, established with Dark Souls, has been perfected and expanded into an open-world setting. Players can discover a myriad of weapons, spells, and incantations, allowing the game to be played in numerous ways. You can truly choose your own playstyle and difficulty level. If a boss is too hard, you can explore elsewhere and come back later. If a boss is resistant to holy damage, switch to a weapon that inflicts bleeding. Overall, the game is simply a masterpiece. 10/10.DLC ReviewAfter nearly 70 hours, I can confidently say I didn't expect the DLC to live up to Elden Ring's stellar reputation. But damn, the DLC is outstanding. Every boss, every weapon is fun, intriguing, and visually stunning. The difficulty level has increased compared to the base game, which, as a Souls fan, is definitely a plus for me. Simply superb. 10/10."
Positive,"Great game. Did the exploration aspect really well. Being teleported to the capital for the first time or seeing the Hogwarts academy for the first time in the distance are great exploration moments that remind me of the best moments in Breath of the Wild.The endgame is also not nearly as hard as people are making it out to be. It's like another JRPG, Pokemon. If you play nuzlocke, it can be frustrating and hard but if you use what you have available, it will be easy. You need to work to find that middle ground.The worst part of the game is that a lot of simple features are hidden behind stupid doors that are easily missed. I didn't find that spirit summons was a thing until I had already done the first two-three regions in the game because the NPC who gives them to you only spawns at night and I happened to pass by there in the day. The multiplayer rules are also weirdly obscure and complicated, and a friend had to explain them to me because the menu does a terrible job of it.I enjoyed this game a lot more than I would have because a Soulspro friend walked me through the first dungeon (Stormveil) until the boss in multiplayer, explaining how different mechanics in the game work."

( especially the mimic tear).The new ""SEAMLESS COOP MOD "" is also a great mod that lets u play with friends without any interruptions , although i encourage you to play your first playthrough vanilla.Onwards to duelling now.fun"

Positive,Its very fun and awesome and you can be characters from different video games (if you're good at character creation) and itrs good 10/10
Positive,"I want you to know, that as of 116 hours into the game, I'm still finding new areas, new bosses, new dungeons, new items. There's a whole area of the map that I can see I havent gotten to yet but Idk how to even get there. There are still NPCs i havent interacted with. Its insane. Part of me wants to just finish it so I can make a new build and start over. the game is super fun. Has to be my favorite FromSoft game. I'm super happy. There is so much to do and it all feels so fresh."
Positive,"This game is beautiful, visually it is amazing, everything in the game you can actually visit which creates a whole new level of exploration. The main bosses are all fun, and if you are not good at Souls games, you can steal beat them with the usage of summons/magic. Every castle/cave/area gives you a reason to explore it, with usually a unique boss at the end resulting in just spending hours exploring and gaining new resources. I am 35 hours into my save file, and I am still only past the first boss. This is because I have spent all my time exploring all the different locations and not really caring about the actual progression of the game. Unlike many other games, Elden Ring is actually worth 50 pounds, it has hundreds of hours of content and potentially DLCs coming in the future. Elden Ring is incredibly rewarding as a player, spending hours trying to beat a boss only to ultimately beat it feels amazing. My only complaint is the FPS drops which doesn't happen during the gameplay in my scenario, only during the shop menus/inventory. I also do not enjoy fighting large enemies as it makes it really hard to see the thing you want to hit, but that is personal preference.Overall, this game is amazing. A true masterpiece.10/10"
Positive,"I have lost an average of 12 hours of sleep, with a total of 48 hours of playtime so far, dedicated to playing this game it is honestly a master piece and bring me hope that games will be good once again. I cannot take my hands off of this game."

Positive,"As someone's first introduction to games like this, it was truly an experience like no other. I struggled hard with the first couple of bosses but after learning what the game has to offer, figuring out what build I wanted to go, and exploring the open world, it's without a doubt this game is GOTY."
Positive,I finish elden ring and I have one word. AMAZING this world is beautiful and they have a lot of emotion in the same time. This is the first time a play a Dark souls and i think i fall in love with that type of game. great gamethis game deserve is popularity and my note is 10/10 (execpt the lag and bug) but still a amazing game
Positive,"This being the only FromSoftware game I've played past 10 minutes, I LOVED it. The addition of an open world makes the difficulty more bearable for more casual players, but keeps the challenge for those dedicated who still want it. It opens a whole new spectrum of what's possible, and trying new things or limiting yourself on subsequent playthroughs is extremely satisfying. This isn't even to mention multiplayer, which I haven't touched!In this game, the possibilities are endless. BUY IT, and have fun!"
Positive,"This is the game I've pretty much wanted since playing Demon's Souls back on the PS3. After ruining Bloodborne for myself by jumping onto every guide I could, I deliberately went into this first playthrough with as little knowledge as possible - blocked Twitter refs, avoided gaming articles, etc and for 170 hours I have been basically blundering around in awe at the sights, sounds and experiences this game provides, whilst hoovering every area, not wanting to miss any events or people. You've read all the reviews so I ain't going to bother but the feeling the game gives you is similar to when you bought a Fighting Fantasy book as a kid and there was a dizzying freedom because you had the power to choose where you wanted to go. (Although if this game was a Fighting Fantasy book it would be 3 Forests of Doom, 4 Citadels of Chaos, 5 Warlocks Of Firetop Mountain and 23 Scorpion Swamps :)) - I spent around 30 hours on the first area and it's peninsula, (with just one pant-staining accidental trip to Caelid, of course) soaking up the atmosphere, constantly coming across amazing little finds and that set me up well for the rest of the game which just ratchets up the intensity and scope as it goes along. The art direction, especially considering the ridiculous amount of content, is never less than stunning - I may take a post-game ride around and snap some holidays shots before NG+...the Capital city...wow.And the sound...will never forget getting to Leyndell for the first time and hearing the weird tones of those wee marshmallow mens trumpets...As per usual with Soulsborne games, the story is batshit crazy and extremely confusing to anyone who has not watched any Vaatvidya and despite poring over item descriptions, it's only post completion hitting Youtube that I have had those ""Aha! So that's why X was angry at Y and why Z turned into a giant snake"" moments for certain storyline beats. This is par for the course for these games though and part of why I love their almost fever-dream like atmosphere. Cons - I can never go back to any earlier From games now unless they patch in a proper Jump button. There goes my replay of Dark souls on PC and Bloodborne on PS5. :) Pros - one of the best games I've ever played and I wish the DLC would come soon so I can dive back in."
Positive,"GOTY, managed to acquire myself a maiden and become Elden lord. Now all that remains is for me to become a functioning member of society :(Edit: Managed to become a functioning member of society, now I feel depressed."
Positive,First time playing this kinda game. First review i'm doing because I think its an amazing challenging game that allows you do whatever you want while still having a story and a world to explore.
Positive,Made me love gaming again. Absolute banger I highly recommend.

No long cutscenes, no inventory weight to worry about, no long animations to do simple stuff, no QTEs. Just pure, unadultered gameplay.Nice replayability as is common with From games thanks to non-linear progression, build variety and PVP / coop.Absolutely 100% recommended."

Positive,"Before Elden Ring, I had never played a FromSoft game, and had no interest in their titles what-so-ever, viewing them at their worst, as pretentious and sweaty.  I got caught up in the hype and decided to buy. What I have learned is to never let a fan base or reputation shape your idea of a game, or any artistic creation for that matter. Elden Ring is a wonderfully crafted game, with so much intricate and meaningful detail put into both the world and the level design. I was inspired to complete all achievements, which in 20+ years of gaming, I had only done twice before. It was able to inspire awe right up to the very last moment, and leaves me with so many memories and surprisingly complete knowledge of its massive map. After finishing the game, I found myself watching hours of lore content on YouTube. Despite all of this, I do not view this as a perfect game, and I would not score it a 10 / 10, but it is very close. There are balance issues present, both in player weapon and enemy damage at times, and it can feel bloated. The story telling is sparse and its style is personally not for me, though the lore of the world in itself is interesting. It can, at times, feel extremely punishing, and at others, trivial. It's an odd place they have decided on for difficulty. At the end of the day, it is a must play for pretty much anyone in my opinion, there's just so much to love. It serves the same purpose as BoTW for the Zelda franchise, bringing fans and non-fans alike into mutual appreciation. I never played Zelda before BoTW, and its sequel has become a day one buy. I never played a Souls game before, but the Elden Ring sequel / any DLC that FromSoft decides to put out, has become a day one buy. Elden Ring made me a fan."
Positive,"A fantastic game FromSoftware, probably the best game they've ever made alongside Bloodborne. While the gameplay formula mainly stays the same, they expanded exponentially on the world you get to play in,Unlike other Souls-like games where your options against a challenge are fairly limited such as farming up or become really good at reading a boss's movements, Elden Ring provides you with a plethora of options. You can explore the world and find new weapons, level up up, buy or find several unique items some of which are made to work against bosses like kryptonite.All in all, it's quite accessible more so than before so there's a lot to love here.That doesn't mean the game has become easy...oh no...It probably holds the largest amount of bosses in any games ever released. They're just staggering, with some of them being unique as well as recurring ones. While they do recycle a few, I have to say it doesn't take much from the experience as it gives you the feeling of growing and becoming more experienced showing that your struggle and effort was well worth your time.The items and weapons as well as magic gives so many options for so many builds and things to mess around with.You can now re-edit your character in case there's something you don't like about it as well as resetting your abilities in case you want to try out different builds. This addition was great and it doesn't mean you have to remake a different character just in case you want to try something different.The map is huge, enormous even and in any direction you will go, you will stumble upon something interesting. Those things can be either a quest, collectable crafting items, various dungeons, enemies, portals, weapons and merchants.I can't put my finger on it but this game truly has something special going for it. There are some downsides I'd like to mention that I wish they were different.First off...while, for the most part, the start of the game as well as the mid-game feels fun, challenging and everything you do is rewarding, the later parts of the game become absurdly difficult in a not-fun way.Vigor is a stat in the game and it's quite important unlike Bloodborne for instance. While Elden Ring provides you with fast moving abilities and spells, it still doesn't match Bloodborne speed....This means that the chances of getting hit are quite high unless you're going out with a shield. The thing is, enemies late game will one - two shot you and it'll make you feel that the effort you've put in the game was for naught.... it's not too bad but it's surely not fun. The exaggerated difficulty spike could've been reduced a little bit by maybe 15-20%. While the bosses are super cool, I found issues with the camera sometimes. Not too big but there are some  large bosses that love to fly across your screen. The Lock On system is useless in such situations since it will mess you up. I wished they would innovate this part just a bit and take some risks such as zooming the camera out a bit.The PVP of the game is....not so good....broken builds, 1 shot, cheesing, cheating, the list goes on. You'll either love it and have a huge fun with it or...not care about that at all unless you're invaded while playing co-op. The likeness of this mode depends on the player. I don't mind that it's there, in fact it's good that it's there, it's just not for everyone. And the last negative I have to say isss....the story.It's...huge...complex, dark fantasy...but not too special. Bloodborne rocks that front...Dark Souls 3 too.And that's it... Elden Ring is a masterpiece of a game. It's not perfect, it has its flaws but the game's unique, it brings something new to the table and it'll be remembered."

Positive,"I want to discover the world but if I do that that I'll be so overpowered for the next boss what a dilemmaWho am IHello everyone I'm kinda Dark souls veteran who played 1,2,3, Sekiro and thanks to  VaatiVidya  I was also mesmerized by their story. But yeah enough talking about me what's up with that header why i'm saying it's not dark souls 4. In this review i'll try to share my humbly opinion. (I didn't finished the game and i know it's not accurate to write a comment before it but i'll change this review after if any of my opinions is changed)Wdym by Core loop change? The core game loop is changed in the Dark souls series you need to learn the attack pattern but in Elden ring you just need to come back later or you are already overpowered. The problem with that it's kinda breaking the competitive spirit sometimes. I remember the relief it gave me killing Dancer of the Boreal Valley after dying 100 times. I realy wanted to fight Black Knife Assassins yeah.So what's the new loop then? Opposite to the dark souls games when you are stuck at the boss or a place you change your route and go exploring the map after you gain more levels and experience you came back to that place since there's no upscaling sometimes you became so overpowered. The game gives you too many options. You can be a casual player go double sword strength build and jump attack the entire game, +10 mimic guy, double sword bleeding guy. You can be a meta guy who copies his entire build from wiki and doesn't change it the entire game. You can be a dex guy who parries and backstabs the entire game etc there are too many options.Even though there are too many options every ash of war every new weapon changes your game style entirely. And the most important thing is the game always pushes you to try new things . Are you a strict katana player after you added bleeding your gameplay changes. You found a lightning katana yeah now you can pretend to be Lightning McQueen and say ＫＡ－ＣＨＯＷ after every lightning attack. The options are too much. And the spells are so fun and epic.But there's a big problem here you can also finish the game with comet azur and mimic + 10 without calling a meteorite strike on your enemy and realize how cool is that. And I think the cooler item gets the weaker it becomes. You can't lure the enemies in the bubbles using their good childhood memories because those bubbles aren't magical you are actually using normal bubbles or at least that's the effect and damage it gives. TL;DR : In the Dark souls series you learn patterns but in Elden Ring you come back later or you are already overpowered. The bonfires are now fast travel points but checkpoints and the game is unbalanced.Pros : + Too much choice on weapons and spells+ Too big and filled open world+ Fun and Epic ways to play+ Good way to combine Dark souls, Sekiro and bloodborne mechanics+ The map itself looks very beautiful and well designed+ There's too much different type of enemies+ You still can write Horse but hole+ The story + Radahn's horse+ Albinauric Mask Cons : - The game is so unbalanced it makes you use broken boring meta weapons- The game is so unbalanced it makes you use broken boring spells- The game is so unbalanced it makes you one tap bosses- The game is so unbalanced it makes you use co-op- The game is so unbalanced it makes you strenght + doublesword jump attack entire game- The game is so unbalanced it makes you use Mimic instead of cute Spirit Jellyfish Ashes- You can go pure strenght but you can't go pure dex you need to use Int, Fai, or Arc.- The poise system makes some underground bosses op without giving you clueIt's my first serious review i hope you enjoyed it my overall score to the game is 4/5"
Positive,you can hug a woman
Positive,Hidden Path Ahead!
Positive,"First game in a long time where you get exactly what you payed for and exactly what was advertised, no micro transactions, no battle pass, just a massive playground where the only one limiting your enjoyment and progression is you. The only thing as grand and marvelous as the world itself are the horrors attempting to keep you from your goals. Elden ring is as hard as you make it.Flaws are few and far between (a few npc quests were unfinished and guess what, its already been patched-looking at you coz!). I wish other game developers put as much love, care, and dedication to its games, its fans, and its employees as FromSoftware has.."
Positive,I thank God everyday for allowing my to exist in this time of this creation of life to experience a beautiful work of art. This art has allowed me to be thankful for the unique set of challenges I will face in my life with courage and ambition for the better. Elden Ring has taught me to face challenges with courage and to never give up in spite of failing more times than I can count. The beauty and joy in life is not only the reward of accomplishment and values but rather conquering the unknown challenges and ideas that we must face with patience and persistence. May the dance of time and space guide us to a high better place with our loved ones in the chaotic world we live in.
Positive,"It's honestly incredible what FromSoftware has achieved with this game, there is so much content. It is so fun the world is breathtaking, it's an incredible game that i can't do anything but recommend. I have bought it 3 times now, once for me and twice for friends because I love it that much, please give it a chance you won't regret it. Truthfully, even something as incredible as this isn't above criticism, so I will mention what I think is the game's current biggest flaw. Staying true to their roots as Japanese game developers they have done a poor job with the multiplayer net code, I am hopeful they will work on it, but currently it's incredibly unreliable and needs work. All in all, though, I still heartily recommend it."
Positive,The best game in the world hands down!
Positive,Onion ring :)
Positive,Worth DYING for
Positive,"Praise the dog, dog ahead, offer but hole, fort night, hidden path ahead, liar ahead, hands down game of the year.Game of the year.."
Positive,it beats me up but i like it!!!
Positive,"Its Dark Souls 4 (with an ""open"" world)If you love Dark Souls, you'll like this, if you don't you might or might not.For me; this is the best game in years... that's more about how bad games have been lately tho :-P"
Positive,"A refreshing open world game full of well curated zones and vistas that through the wanderlust of the player, it greatly rewards exploration. Boss fights have been ramped up in the chaos department but have been matched for the player through the expansion of weapon augments and now with the easier path to respecing, changing playstyles and builds is highly encouraged."
Positive,"As an player who has never enjoyed dark soul series or never passed the random guy at the gate on dark souls 3 This game changed everything and made me fall in love with this game and the franchise. As well exploring the unknown, boss fights, enviroment, pvp, makes this game god tier 10/10 and i recommended it for anyone who plays or doesn't play these types of games."
Positive,"Great game. 10/10. GOTY 2022 for sure.Few quests bugged out on 1st playthrough, Invader Vyke not spawning, Finger Hunter Yura not spawning after helping him with invasion at Raya Lucaria. Everything smooth on NG+. Might have been a trigger I'm not aware of. Poor port. Playable with fps issues. 3/10.If you don't have any issues with the game running on your PC, even more power to you. PC specs:i7-8700kGTX108016GB RAMRunning at 2560x1080 Med/High settings. Motion blur off. Grass quality medium."
Positive,big dark souls
Positive,the game is 10/10 except for the flame giant fuck that dude
Positive,Only partway through the game but I can state with confidence that this game is a pee pee out of a poo poo
Positive,I got a hug!
Positive,Best game for Self-torture lovers like me !
Positive,have to hold back the urge to kill every npc
Positive,needs to add more femboys

Positive,"Never played souls-like, but this is...Best single-player* game I've ever played.  First time I experienced such level of immersion.Played first character for almost 40h (not finished ofc) and started new character with even more fun and pleasure. Still haven't beat the game, gladly :)Aesthetic domination. Sounds and visuals.Gameplay domination.Combat domination.---*Single player only - since I use mod to unlock 60fps limit, thus playing offline.  avg. 75 fps outdooravg. 90 fps indoor/dungeonsNo stutters.@ RTX 2070SHave not experienced technical difficulties but my Win10 is properly debloated and optimized for competitive gaming."
Positive,"A game for masochists who hate themselves, the world and everyone around them.  This game will make you detest yourself and the creators of the game.  It is an abomination that should never have been made.  10/10 would play again."
Positive,Game of the year
Positive,beating any boss solo is the only happy I have felt this year.
Positive,"Definitely a game for you if you like dying over and over, but everytime you die you actually get better and learn from your mistakes!"
Positive,one of the best and greatest games of all time. 10/10.
Positive,this is the game ever
Positive,"If you appreciate open world games and seek for a challenge, consider buying Elden Ring. I am at about 60 hours in (For some reason my in-game timer and steam play time are not identical) and I feel as I am not even close to finishing it. There is a lot of hidden content that require discovery.I get lost in this game, very addictive and well made."
Positive,"I did my best to not hop on the hype train, but ended up on it 2 weeks before the release. This game may be the only game I've played in recent memory that not only met the hype but blew it out of the water. I'm 176 hours in and I'm still finding new areas, interesting weapons, and bosses that make me want to throw my controller. I will say that I have had some issues with fps drops and the occasional crash. Overall 9.5/10. I highly recommend."
Positive,"Starscourge RadahnIf you are among the few that had complained of Generals Radahns difficulty I pray for the children that you will bear, I pray that the character you shape of your offspring will not be as pathetic and weak willed and weak minded as you, I pray that they will not be as bitch made as you are, you pathetic, weak, cowardly little whiny bitch made freakmuch love fart xoxo <3"
Positive,10/10 would pick random plants again. I can't stop laughing at the name finger maidens lmao!
Positive,finger but hole
Positive,game of my life
Positive,"One of the few modern AAA games you can buy at full price and get a huge amount of hours per dollar paid.This is Dark Souls ramped up. The world is bigger, the weapons are crazier, the bosses have more BS moves then before and there is just sooooo much to find in the game. Don't go thinking this will be an easier game straight away. It IS easier but not for any mechanical or gameplay reason. It's easier because you can just bypass most roadblocks and go exploring, find more materials and weapons and get levels much easier then previous Souls games. The actual fights will still be challenging and require you to spend time learning boss attack patterns.The game design overall is still ""hard but fair"" but be aware that by ""fair"" they now mean you can utilise just as much broken stuff as the enemies can, and not utilising it will often hamstring yourself.Overall it's still not that super tight DS1 design, but it's so, so much larger in scale that it's it's own beast and an absolutely amazing game to play."

Positive,I'm really bad but I love exploring. I'm banking on that being enough to get me to a point of passable skill so I can progress the main story more.
Positive,A masochist's wet dream :)
Positive,"1000hrs in roughly 200+hr chunks, each one never getting started until I unlock the Noble's Slender Sword. VIP S-Tier straight sword, highly customizable top boss-staggering stratospheric critical giver that basically cuts through the Lands Between with insane drip. It begs to be covered in those elemental greases! Buff it with incants and spells for other cool effects. I like to pair it with Assassin's Crimson/Cerulean Dagger Talismans, a shield.. But whatever you pair it with, you'll look Noble AF"
Positive,"This review comes from someone who has played almost every From Software game out there, and Elden Ring stands improved in almost every area. The game combines and betters all the mechanics from the previous games and somehow makes it even better! Is it as hard?Personally I do not think elden ring is as hard as the other Games by From Software. The bosses are Amazing and will punish you for your mistakes, but level up enough and you could cut through them like a hot knife through butter.I am at the end of the game, and I feel I haven’t even scratched the surface and I cannot wait to get back into it and explore further. One of the best darn games I have ever played."
Positive,Final VerdictDog / 10
Positive,I like Dark SoulsThis game is big Dark Souls
Positive,"I never beat a single soul's game before buying this one...I'm currently 71 hours in and have no urges to stop yet.Elden Ring is a robust & satisfying experience that immediately pulled me in and never let go. Offering a wonderful respite from the mainstream blues that the gaming industry is experiencing right now, Elden Ring is the palette cleanser that I needed after Battlefield 2042 left a void in my soul. Few & far between are the games which offer as beautifully crafted an open-world as Elden Ring. The amount of gorgeous and breathtaking vistas crammed into this (arguably huge) map is truly incredible. Whereas other open-world games will pepper their game with cinematics to convey various story elements and character development, Elden Ring uses a very minimalist approach to NPCs and lore--instead your relationship with the world is how you explore & how you fight the vast array of enemies inhabiting it. Therein is what I love most about Elden Ring. Very rarely is ""mystery"", ""enigma"", or ""wanderlust"" something that a game can generate for a player. Yet these are the sensations that come to mind when trying to describe my feelings while playing the game. Once you embrace as a player that /you/ are invading this world, and that this world is not hospitable to /you/, and /you/ need to figure out how to survive in this world; everything begins to ""click"" into place. I have yet to find everything. I have yet to fight everything. I have yet to uncover the whole map. I want to keep going until I have done all these things. The world of Elden Ring begs you to explore it."
Positive,"“Wow this game is amazing”, that's what i actually thought to myself several times while roaming the world of Elden Ring. This game is truly a masterpiece and exceeds all expectations. The world of Elden Ring is lush with life and feels like a complete world. Paired with a limited sense of direction and no hand holding, it truly fulfills the open world exploration genre. Without all the waypoints and markers, exploring every area actually feels rewarding. The world is on such a large scale and actually filled with engaging content, no area is dull and boring. This is aided by the incredible visuals, the truly unique enemies and bosses and fantastic fantasy writing that most fantasy genre enjoyers will appreciate . With a large range of different weapons and builds you can truly satisfy your gameplay fantasy and play the game however you want. This game is a truly special game and has the level of excellence  that other games should strive to achieve. This game for me is the best gaming experience I have ever played and would highly recommend.10/10"
Positive,"Never been a fan of souls series but Elden Ring completely change my perspective, I'm a hardcore fan now. A truly masterpiece that will always have a place in my heart throughout my whole gaming life. What makes this game stand out the most for me is  the level design with massive exploration that keep going on and on forever, it continuously tapping you to explore every corner with hidden secrets. The moment I feel like I don't want this game to end, I know this is a masterpiece.Overall, I rarely rate any game with a 10 but this one definitely deserve a 10/10 for meTL;DR: You need Elden Ring ONCE in your life."
Positive,100% it......DLC When?
Positive,Best souls game of all time! These games only get better and better with each new generation of game! Much like how you progress in the game it starts hard and you mess up alot but get better with experience! 10/10 Will recommend!
Positive,"After 200 hours of playtime, when I go to sleep I only dream about dogs, pickles, and doors that I can't open cause I don't have the right.Regardless this is by far the best souls up to date, and arguably one of the best games ever made.Yes it is just bigger dark souls with a horse and jumps and that's exactly what we needed."
Positive,"For old members:What are you waiting for? Just add this to your cart already.But for real, Elden Ring is like all the techniques and skills FromSoftware learned over the past few years by developing Souls game and Sekiro. You can feel the smoothness of being the single hand ninja and the overwhelming souls like feel. In short, you can treat it as the fully upgraded version of dark souls, but as you progress through the game, you will discover more about the game, and it is more than dark souls. You will not regret your choice of trying it out.For newcomers: This game is advertised as a Souls-like open-world RPG game, and it is not lying in any aspect. You can experience the hardcore of a souls-like game. You can experience the vivid variety of play styles of an RPG game. Moreover, you will be surprised by how dense the map is. You can always find something worth exploring no matter where you are travelling. Its open world is undoubtedly not a gimmick for advertisement; it has meaning. I understand why people say souls-like games are not for everyone, but this one is good to get started. It is not because it is easier, but it provides more options than forcing you to get good. If a boss beats your ass, you can always level up yourself a bit and come back f him up later. In general, Elden Ring is a tightly packed and dense game with exciting character and environment design. Even if you are not a gamer and not that interested in the gameplay, I am sure the story, NPC or the environment will captivate you with its breathtaking quality. Just give it a try. It is worthy, at least more deserving than those so-called 3A games lying in your library, and it is even cheaper than them.Thank you for reading till here and I hope this can help you with your decision.Try finger, but hole."
Positive,This game fucking slaps. Really blew my mind with how incredible a game could be. This game is the game I have been waiting for for years. Absolutely incredible.
Positive,Godrick just like me
Positive,"I beat this game with my eyes closed and with my hands tied behind my back and I still thought it was too easyExcept Godskin Duo, they should be the true final boss of the game"
Positive,"I don't make a lot of reviews because I can't be bothered. This game however, is an exception. You absolutely need this game on your Library especially if you're a fan of the genre, or simply likes RPG. The game is very very very challenging. Don't take it as easy as your BOWild or Genshin run of the mill sort game - It's not. You need to be patient, probably die 20 times against the same boss(OR MOB) that you know is very much killable, then you get better at the game."
Positive,"I'm not really the target audience for Elden Ring given it's a souls-like, but if that is your cup of tea, this game is phenomenal. Despite really, really not being the game for me, it was mechanically engaging with beautiful visuals and audio. Although capped at 60 fps, it runs buttery smooth and never drops frames on my system. The story is complicated, a little too complicated for a game who's target audience is just going to roll and slash through all the bosses without really paying attention to any cut scenes or flavor text. Some are saying its the greatest open world game they have ever played, to those I say stop playing souls-like games and actually branch out. Elden Ring's world is jam packed with content and enemies, but it always felt small to me and too easily traversed to really be compared to any other large open world game. Lets be realistic, if you think this is GOTY or even comparable to other great classic titles like RDR2 or BoTW, then you already think that FromSoftware's next game is GOTY for 2023 or 2024. My only real complaint is that the multiplayer is HORRIBLE. Despite being the most accessible souls-like game for newcomers, no one thought to allow players to opt out of invasions. Definitely a lost opportunity. The game is hard enough without getting sweat on by people who have never seen the outside world. Playing with friends is clunky, unintuitive, and tied to an in-game item that you have to grind for. FromSoftware clearly walked down the street and pulled the multiplayer design from Nintendo who is known ubiquitously for their HORRIBLE multiplayer implementation. Had the multiplayer been more sound, I likely would not have given up on the game at 14 hours in."
Positive,"This is probably the best game I've played in literal years, not only that, but it's probably one of the best games I've ever played in my life. It's the amalgamation of practically all the previous Fromsoft/Souls games, every feature, every design, every skill they've honed over the course of years making these games, put into a gigantic and incredibly immersive world where you're constantly being rewarded for adventuring out on your own. I think it's pretty safe to say that we just don't get games like this anymore, especially without a flood of micro-transactions and other ""pay for convenience"" abominations that have plagued games the last 8 years. This is just a good ass game, full stop. It's one of those games that not only lived up to to hype, but somehow managed to exceed it in a lot of ways."
Positive,"Best game to come out in years. Im so glad that im now able to pour hundreds of hours into this masterpiece of a game. FromSoftware games have for the most part always been and will continue to be some of the greatest games to ever been made. Up untill this point Bloodborne has been my favorite Souls-like game but Elden Ring might just take the spot. 10/10, well desirved.If you are a SoulsBorne fan, buy it its amazing.If you are new to the genre, do your research before buying it. FromSoftware games are in their own category of games, if you go in thinking it will be something its not it might have you dissapointed. Their games are hard, sometimes BRUTALY hard and thats partly what makes them amazing. So dont go in thinking this will be some average RPG because it is so, so much more.Also sure preformance a bit lacking in some places bla bla bla someting needs to be fixed bla bla something NO ONE CARES the game is fucking great i dont give a shit if it stutters a tiny winy bit when traveling on horseback play the game stop crying you baby. Cry about the fact that theres Cheaters in PvP cause thats actually a real problem."
Positive,"I am in love with this game. I've played Dark Souls for years now, and always find new ways to love them.Elden Ring breathes new life into the series and brings answers many of the other entries problems.I have never thought that having no sense of direction would help me in a game, being always lost has left me wandering a lot, discovering and learning.This game truly is one of the most notable games I have played in a long time, would recommend to anyone willing to brave the difficulty of any Fromsoftware game."
Positive,Not Enough Yes!
Positive,"I recommend this game if and only if you are already a fan of FromSoft souls games. A lot of people come into this game thinking it's a GRRM version of Skyrim or Breath of the Wild. It is not. It's a Fromsoft game, which means:   1: Direction: There is very little to tell you where to go, and when to go there. This game has some direction (which is more than previous games due to the open world) BUT this direction is not a direct line you should necessarily take. The game is big and the direction on the map is your eventual destination not your immediate goal. Exploration is rewarded.   2: Story: There is very little in the way of exposition in Fromsoft games. Every item description, every scrap of dialog, the position of ruins on the map all tell the story for those who care to search. However the story of the world is not hand fed to you.   3: Difficulty: This isn't the easiest Fromsoft game and Fromsoft is known for “difficult games”. You will die a lot, and that’s okay. While there is no menu option for difficulty in game, Fromsoft games are known for having builds that can trivialize the game. If you want an easy mode find the weapons/spells that make the game easy. Right now free Kamehameha Wave is crazy good (look up SpiffingBrit on YouTube)Current major issue I am aware of:There is a bug that can cause significant frame drops regardless of the specs of your PC. This does not affect everyone. 2 of my roommates and I have Identical specs. 1 gets frame rate drops the other roommate and I do not. As far as I can tell there is no way to know if you will have the issue until you get the issue. Don't people who are upset about this. Not being able to play the game is a valid reason to be upset. In conclusion: If you have never played a Souls game, see if you can get one of the Dark Souls games on sale and try it first. If you already don't like Souls games don't bother buying it, you wont like it.  I don't buy racing games because I don't like them and that is fine. It's okay if you don't like Fromsoft ARPGs, don't let anyone tell you differently."
Positive,I am the Elden King of the Elden Ring.
Positive,One of the best games I've ever played
Positive,"Fantastic game, covers almost every corner barring the performance issues, but I hate the storytelling of soulsborne games, and this game is no different. Don't get me wrong, the story is actually very well thought, but the game doesn't present it to the player in a manner that is easy to understand. You will not fully understand the reasoning or background of some events without piecing together the knowledge yourself from bits and pieces of information that you get while playing the game. All in all, I bet many players don't have the full picture of the story, and they have to watch a youtuber summarize the story for them. THIS, I don't like, I don't like this kind of storytelling.I really want to NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME but the core gameplay is so much fun, and I guess not many people hate this kind of storytelling, but I friggin hate the storytelling so much that I am on the verge of not recommending it."
Positive,just buy the game
Positive,"Excellent introduction game to the genre. The game is absolutely a blast and I have so much more to go. If you play and you are having a hard time against the first few bosses go explore some! I died to an early boss for hours on end until I realized this was the game telling me that not everything was meant to be tackled as soon as you see it. Obviously veterans won't have issues, but don't be afraid to use the resources the game gives you."
Positive,"Placeholder: Really enjoying this game as a souls noob. Probably easiest out of all thanks to open world, allows multiple options in case you find yourself stuck on a bad guy or boss. The coop, though convoluted, is a great way for new players to learn in another person's game without lose of runes too if that's a concern for you.Anyway, give it a go with some patience, and a lot of people on the fence should end up loving this game. Go in blind where possible, the sense of exploration, and rewards for doing so, are pretty unparalleled."
Positive,Absolutely infuriating... I love it
Positive,"So I think this will be my very first legit review ever and let me just say this game is everything it's been praised and more. First of all I don't think people who give it bad reviews based on their computers specs and crashes should even be valid as I myself don't have the best CPU out there, but would never downplay a game when my hours played would be close to none. If you aren't familiar with FROMSOFTWARE (i.e. Bloodborne, Dark Souls, Sekiro) games either and just hopped on the hype train of what's popular and got slapped in the face with that difficulty shock don't take it with a grain of salt it's meant to challenge you. People also out there like ""There's no open world or Lore or Loot"" I don't know what you're talking about cause there's literally loot and lore all over if you actually explore and pay attention. Yeah there's no tutorial or quest page to guide you when playing or to hold your hand but you can always also use Google like almost 99% of everyone when they get stuck somewhere or just look up a guide and don't feel ashamed there's literally tons of info out there on the game to easily guide you by without needing a in game tab. Everything about his game is rewarding, from killing that crazy hard boss you are just determined to finish whether you die 100+ times or not. You can respec your character later in the game so even if you find something you want to use which you didn't build your char for you can always alter later on or if you really feel like it just grind it out like most games require these days as there's no real max level in the game as opposed to skills capping out at 99 which you can actually get every attribute to if you really wanna be Elden Lord.The game had some flaws at launch but then again almost every game now and days days one has some sort of broken system to it which usually gets fixed right away or down the road. One major thing about this game no matter how much you might think you're a video game god is you're going to die.. Numerous, numerous times. Laugh it off, learn from your mistakes and move on. I've never clapped my hands so hard and yelled so loud to myself in excitement after getting down that boss I thought was ny imposible.Graphics aren't as good as one would expect from a AAA game coming out in 2022 with 10/10 reviews and no it doesn't have DLSS or Ray Tracing or anything but you also have to understand it's all about the gameplay and it still looks pretty damn beautiful if you ask me. I haven't got a chance to wander the lands with a friend yet but I heard it can be even more of a blast in co-op which I'm interested to try.All in all. If you were waiting for a new RPG you could just play by yourself or with others on your own time similar to games like Witcher 3, Nier Automata, RDR2 and etc with lots to explore, numerous endings to unlock, New Game +'s to catch anything you missed the first time or so on and wanna just be your own badass hero whether it's wielding a Giant sword, Shooting Bows, Casting Spells or basically doing almost anything you could in the likes of Skyrim then give it a shot.My biggest piece of advice before purchasing is just know like most others have noted of the games difficulty and don't let it frustrate you do the point of quitting. The game basically comes at you with no difficulty setting but similar to very difficult versions or your favorite games you might be used to playing on Normal or even Easy and just aren't used to the challenge cause you just wanna enjoy and finish it. Don't aggressively attack enemies without properly dodging or blocking, it's not meant to just smash the hit button and heal.Lastly just take your time, we're not all speedrunners out to smash records. You get no rewards in finishing it in one hour or one week. Chances are you're just gonna miss out on more stuff along your run.Anyways I just wanna say I've loved every second I've spent with this game so far and can't wait to New Game plus it numerous times to learn and discover more and more. Coming from someone who's died hundreds of times enjoy everyone!! :D"
Positive,I hate apex legends
Positive,could this be a dog?
Positive,lots of fun and pain :)
Positive,"I love how they made the world, monsters, and detailed stories. Monsters look scary and super cool. It seems each place has its own unique monsters, which I like very much. Though, they should improve co-op because my friend always disconnects a few times per hour for no reason. For me it's much more fun to explore the world with friends."
Positive,It might sound like a lazy comparison but this game really is the perfect marriage between Dark Souls and Breath of the Wild. Amazing open wolrd (better than BOTW) and yet the best From Software has to offer in term of what they do best! It has some really tough bosse and still has even more options than ever before to make your fights easier if you don't want to spend hours struggling. Very small issues (yet to be patched?) do not cast any real shadow over the magnificence of the Elden Ring.
Positive,"elden ring is like if breath of the wild took cocaine, steroids, and speed all at once, then showed up to your house at 3am after a bad breakup to take out its anger on you.best fromsoft game ive ever played.10/10."

Positive,"Just stunning, one of the best games I've ever played in years. <3"
Positive,"ive never played a souls game before, because they were too hard. But this one... It's too hard, and the most amazing single player game i feel ive ever played"
Positive,"Don't listen to all the negative reviews, good chance those are all by people who thought the tutorial was ""too unforgiving"" because the boss is scripted to kill you lol, but lets be real, those people wouldn't have made it very far anyway, one of the best games I have ever played."
Positive,"List of things I have broken so far while playing Elden RingUpdated:  3/16/2021 - 16 Hours in Keys: NUM Lock Key is missing, 74,1 (Numpad) flew offMonitor: Bottom right corner of my monitor cracked after I hit my desk sending my monitor off my desk Random plate: Desk was hit, and it flew off shatteringHeadset:   Launched across the room, LEDs now flicker"
Positive,"If this doesn't win GOTY, then i don't know anymore"
Positive,This is the best game that has ever been made in the history of the universe and the only thing that will make it better is when they improve performance and remove 'pests' from the game.
Positive,Why is it always Perfection?
Positive,"Super good. Love it. This is a great example of an open world done well. It's full of things to do and find, but doesn't hold your hand and lead you around with a list of things to do. Visual design in all the areas is great, especially in Caelid. Elden Ring seriously feels like an adventure from start to finish. My main gripe would have to be the bosses. FromSoft clearly wanted to punish players who roll and block too much. But in doing so kinda over-engineered some of the bosses. Some attacks are followed up on too quickly to dodge; others have hitboxes that last too long so you end up taking a hit even if you dodged at the right time. This is small beans in relation to the full game though."
Positive,Try finger buthole
Positive,I have evolved from being called virgin IRL to being called maidenless by a fu*king videogame. 10/10
Positive,"Having put 200 hours in this game, reaching the soft cap in almost every attribute, having collected all legendary armaments, talismans, and spirit ashes, I can say for certain that this is one of the greatest games I have ever played and possibly will ever play in my life. This game is for die hard soulsborne fans and newcomers to the series alike. (and yes, this is a souls game I don't care what any elitist fan has to say.) The world of Elden Ring is a world filled with grandiose beauty, mystery around every corner, and a lore with a depth so unfathomable and secretive it at times shook me to my very core. The combat is so well done and polished, the weapon and armor designs were badass, and the character customization is the best it has ever been in a from software game. For newcomers, they have added the ability to fast travel to various spots on the absolutely daunting world map. While riding Torrent, your mount, you will experience some of the best mounted combat which had echos of legendary open world title Shadow of the Colossus and the final boss of Twilight Princess on Epona. Now, onto the difficulty. I know this has been a topic of debate among fans but I will give you my honest opinion having sunk hundreds of hours into the soulsborne titles: this is the most difficult soulsborne game to date and has undoubtedly two of the hardest boss battles I have ever faced in my 25 years of gaming. The gratification gained for sticking it to some of the bosses in this game was immense and full of a mix of overwhelming emotions. With all this being said, please, pick up this game, believe the hype, it is a masterwork for Miyazaki and the From Software team."

Positive,"Elden Ring is, without a doubt, one of the best open-world games ever released, and among the gaming ""Hall of Fame"" of the past decade - among the likes of Skyrim, Witcher 3, Red Dead Redemption 2, God of War, and Breath of the Wild.The best features, among many, have to be its unique and refined artistic style and direction, detailed world and lore, mysterious yet alluring characters, incredible bosses and visual effects, and the wide array of weapons and magic at your disposal.The biggest area to nitpick is the graphical fidelity, which, for this time, is outdated. However, as mentioned before, it has an unparalleled artistic design, with a look and feel that more than makes up for its shortcomings in texture quality. The way the color palettes blend and contrast with the beautiful lighting, along with the sheer grandiosity of The Lands Between, culminate into a remarkable masterpiece.The difficulty is punishing. Let me be clear - I am not a fan of such types of games. But as an RPG and open-world lover, with a penchant for medieval fantasy settings and huge swords, Elden Ring hits every other spot for me. A tremendous title for the ages."
Positive,"Quite frankly the best open world I have ever played and will play for a long while. It really is the only game that has perfected open world and that sense of ""open"". It doesn't force you or tell you to do anything, it throws you into the world with little direction and the wonderment and curiosity of the player take the reigns from there. Very similar to BotW but with an outstanding world, packed to the brim with fun, unique encounters around quite literally every corner. There is always something new just at the end of your line of sight that has this amazing power to draw the player in. The amount of content, and varied at that, that From Soft was able to fit in here will be talked about for years to come.The game wasn't without it's downsides though, albeit few and minor. The performance on PC was terrible and remained for the 2.5 weeks it took me to play. No excuses at this point for framerates locked to 60. The game also for better or worse does not tell you much and while that is a welcome change and makes the discovery feel better, there needed to be some kind of codex for the player to remember the plethora of plotlines. The world is so huge that the next time you return to a plotline you end up forgetting 70% of it. And lastly the balance of the game, something From Soft were absolute masters at with their previous entries, is beyond broken to the point where it is a bit frustrating. I fought Margit completely underpowered because I favored the main story at that point but from then on I explored 95% of the world before tackling the main story portion in the area and found bosses dropping like flies. They need to work in some kind of scaling system if they continue with the open world. For this reason this was hands down, and not even close, the easiest Souls game to date (post Margit).A fantastic entry in the series that also deserves a nod for the world that was created by GRRM. Very unique and very cool with a whole slew of interesting and well designed characters. Will definitely be a game you see high up on many ""top games of all-time"" lists, and an easy recommendation for anyone, especially due to the low level of difficulty."

Positive,"From Software, with love...I've always had a love hate relationship with From Software games since their genesis. The atmosphere, environments and artistic beauty is second-to-none, and the *general* combat feels weighty and extremely satisfying...but the latter set of opinions in this review below may not be very popular, especially to die hard Souls fans. Firstly, I'd like to get a few great things about ER out of the way--this is not only a major GOTY contender, but it just might go down in Hall of Fame history for being one of the most expansive and detailed open world games ever made. Sure, we've seen incredibly detailed massive open world games before in games like Read Dead 2, Skyrim, Fallout, BotW, Horizon, or Assassins games...but the way ER handles it's vast open world is like none of these aforementioned titles. It doesn't hold your hand. You are given a general opening sequence, and then you are set out to explore an open world with no map, and none of the myriad icons that plague all other open world games--they all tell you where something is or might be...or a main quest, and side quest, and second side quest...none of that is here in Elden Ring. The only small hint you're given, is a tiny graphic in the map's fog-of-war, of where a map you can grab to visualize an area is. And this isn't some highly marked up map--the amount of icons and location-based foreshadowing is minimal. A lot of it is handled by the art. The rest is up to you. And boy is it a cool experience. Now I'd like to get to why I hate Souls games. The bosses. Yes, I said it. I will proudly say that I for one am *not* drinking the koolaid here. There is absolutely nothing fun to me about being forced to fight a boss upwards 50 times before you 'get gud' and are able to continue on with the story/game. That is madness, I think the overall concept of boss fighting mechanics is lazy and broken. I think it is the weakest part of these titles. A few higher-ups decided somewhere that they would design bosses to be straight-up infuriating. They thought, 'how can we design a boss to really piss people off?' It goes far beyond fun for me, and is the main reason all the other Souls games don't inspire me. Look, I can get behind the idea of an i-frame, and timing my dodges and attacks just right...but the bosses in all Souls games go beyond your general boss difficulty, and straight up ruin the entire game for me. Which is why...I love Elden Ring so much. Not just because they nailed the open world and the true feeling of seeing a cresting mountain cliff, and knowing that you can actually explore that later, but because if you don't like a boss, or a mini-boss, or a minimini-boss mob, you can just get on your horse, and high-tail it out of there. That's the beauty of Elden Ring! You don't have to beat a boss to get more content. There is so so so much beautiful content out there, and it's not hidden behind a boss wall (keep in mind, the boss mechanic annoying design is the same in ER, you're just not stuck behind that content wall). Other open world games need to take note of Elden Ring. They need to learn from how ER let's you roam free...to explore by visual cues and other small details. It's so refreshing. Elden Ring is an incredible game. It truly feels like your in a dark, dank, Dungeons and Dragons campaign. It's gritty, high fantasy but somehow realistic. The amount of monsters and locations to find in this game is just mind boggling. Find a random location on the map, turn a corner, find an out-of-the-way door, go in it, and find yourself in a single dungeon the size of some of the older Souls games. This game is huge.Please, for the love of god, stop being such gluttons for gaming punishment. Stop being OK with fighting a boss over and over 50 times. That is not fun. It will never be fun, no matter what coat of paint is on the game. Thank Eldentree that you don't have to fight the bosses in this game until you want to.8 of out 10 (10 if the boss design wasn't lazy and infuriating)"
Positive,Put a ring on an elder now she wont stop calling me her handsome grandson
Positive,"Finished the game after 90 hours.I can now say that this is simply the GOAT, best experience in a solo game and open world. FromSoftware doesn't mess with their fans and gave us the game we wanted, even a better game than we thought.I enjoyed exploring every pixel of this damn map and getting kicked by bosses (Malenia <3 <3).Even if there are some issues to me, like the poor optimisation on some parts of the map, or some stutturing when exploring, some recycling of some bosses in dungeons, or cameras issues and some other stuff.It is a must play for any player even if you're not familiar to Souls games, they made it accessible to anyone wanting an easier game, while still keeping the difficulty of the other games.(I might be delusional but i don't really give a fuck)TY FROMSOFTWARE"
Positive,pretty good game.
Positive,"I have played every souls game there is, but instead of going for new game plus, i always started with a new character to test other builds, and this game has the biggest build flexibility that i have seen in a souls game."
Positive,"Give the shaders some time to compile and you'll notice the frame drops disappear. As someone who has put hundreds of hours in every single FromSoft title since DeS I gotta say this is the penultimate experience.

Positive,"So this is my first souls game and I can definitely see what people mean when they say the game is made more accessible for people. One of the best things about the game is you decide the difficulty, if you put the patience into learning the game you can easily beat the bosses ""required"" for the story's completion if that's your idea of beating the game. The final gauntlet of bosses in the game gets tiresome, but the story payoff you receive for completing the game is satisfying and wraps up the plot nicely. As for performance concerns, at the time of writing, there are certain occasions in the main world where I will briefly lag spike, but they're never long enough to interrupt gameplay or make the game unenjoyable, it's a very stable product overall.As for the open world, fromsoft did an incredible world at making the world both huge and full of things to discover. It is so packed with life that it's hard to not be immersed, and the art direction as well make the experience stunning to look at. The amount of picturesque moments in the game - from a studio not very famous for their visual - is stunning and it's hard to believe. It's simply an incredible looking world to explore and play with, and you can easily log 60 hours just from exploring and not even be complete with the story yet. Incredible game, easy goty"
Positive,10/10 This game is the culmination of everything FromSoft has learned in it's years of development. Certified mastapeece
Positive,I HAVEN'T BEEN OUTSIDE IN WEEKS
Positive,"This game reinvigorated the childlike anticipation of adventure and the unknown within me, something I have not experienced since the first Pokemon game I have played. Unlike other games that nudge you to all the content, Elden Ring leaves you to discover it on your own knowing you won't find everything in your first playthrough."
Positive,"Hooo boy where to even begin with this. This game is big, like, really big. My first playthrough as a relatively completionist player clocked in at just over 100 hours (and im certain i still missed stuff), and I've just finished respeccing to give my second playthrough a go. As has been said countless times before, those of you who have played DS3 will notice a lot of similarities in mechanics, abilities, and movement in Elden Ring, with a few things added in from Sekiro. I did have some performance issues with basically minimum specs (rare unexplained framerate drops/freezes in the open world) and had a few crashes in the midgame, However after progressing past the midgame (or due to the patches From had been putting out at the time) crashes were quite uncommon. Unless an absolutely amazing game comes out this year it will easily, easily be my GoTY, and is certainly in the running for my favourite game of all time. This is the open world fantasy game as far as I'm concerned, highly highly recommend.Now for those of you who want a little more detail in your reviews than a general recommendation: Music:  Yuka Kitamura does a brilliant job as always, ER has many tracks that are on par with or better than the likes of Maria, Gehrman, Ludwig, SoC and Gael. The ambient music in some areas is absolutely beautiful too, especially a couple later game zones. Imo this is overall the best OST Fromsoft has blessed us with yet, as well as the largest.  Open World:  I was cautiously optimistic when I heard Elden Ring would be open world, fearing it would feel formulaic as a lot of the other open world games these days do, tending to leave me burnt out halfway through and rushing to finish them. Fortunately that was not the experience I had with Elden Ring, the world is vast but distinct and exploration is most often rewarding (of course there are times you get baited by arteria leaves and get sad) but there are some very cool and interesting items and weapons you can find off the beaten path, as well as beginning or continuing hands down the best questlines From has ever made. The addition of the Guidance of Grace was also very freeing, as I personally tend to go whichever way is not the main progression path first to try not to miss optional stuff, so knowing which way was the main path was very welcome. New Mechanics:  Crafting was very rarely used by me on my playthrough, reserved exclusively for occasionally making poison arrows, and the poison/rot curing items. There are more status effects here that in any other Fromsoft game, bringing over terror from Sekiro (because that was fun) and revamping frenzy from Bloodborne (because that was also fun) on top of more familiar ones from previous Souls games (and op DS1 bleed). Torrent (your horse) and horseback combat feel pretty good and much better than I expected them to upon finding out about them, while horseback combat was never my first choice when picking an engagement, more due to habit than it being bad, there were certainly enemies and even bosses where it was obviously the no brainer choice over regular old ground melee. The addition of a revamped posture system makes defense playstyles especially much more effective, along with the introduction of guard counters, I cannot speak too much on how different those playstyles feel since I played as a 2h Dex user who relied on dodging and at times parrying for defense, but from the little I tried they seem  very  powerful. Likewise I never really delved into ash summons aside from a few interactions in the open world for items/etc, but they seem quite powerful and effective when used correctly. Bosses:  This is the point that i am most conflicted about honestly, and where most of my grievances with the game are. The vast majority of bosses in ER have two phases with a few exceptions that are usually limited to open world/caves, and a lot of them change very drastically between phases. Early on i genuinely have nothing but positives to say about the bosses, they remix some of the tropes from previous Fromsoft games and are overwhelmingly very aesthetic and well designed. When you get to the lategame however, it feels like a lot of the designers were designing bosses around the players ability to use magic (can't complain too much because TBH the poor magicbois have had a rough time with DS3, BB and Sekiro), however it ends up making some bosses feel very melee-unfriendly, with very large aoe/ground effects that at times combo together with very long chains or sweeping delayed attacks, and a lot of bosses have vertical/very fast movement. Some hitboxes also seem to be a bit wonky on explosion attacks (especially a  bloody  boss I won't name) with me being hit by them despite being to the side of the boss.Before you say anything, yes I fought  THAT  boss, that everyone complains and whinges about, I died to them for about 6 hours, and honestly I can say I enjoyed all of those 6 hours, and no, they are by no means unfair, they do however require a higher level of skill than most every other boss in the game (which is something I'm perfectly okay with, given the difficulty of finding them and the fact they are optional). Unfortunately the excessively melee-unfriendly bosses aren't the only issue I take with some of Elden Ring's bosses, I'm just gonna say it, the devs created too many gank fights, there are far too many instances of a boss fight just being two of the same enemy you fought earlier, not even two enemies that do different things, just two of the same enemies (they may use different weapons but aside from that no major differences), which leads me to my BY FAR most disliked boss in the game. It is one of those gank fights and it appears From tried to marry together two of their better gank fights from previous games (Bell Gargoyles and Demon Prince P1). However due to how gosh darn big they are, combined with their propensity to rapidly move to the other side of you, it creates a fight that isn't necessarily hard but is very frustrating and unfun, where it's at times impossible to keep both in LoS, regardless of how good your positioning is. Enough about them though, i could probably write two whole pages on why they don't work and Demon Prince P1 does, that example was more to illustrate a point. Those types of fights are more common than I would like, and a lot of bosses are just too big to actually see what theyre doing, leaving you just spam rolling hoping to avoid whatever that sound he's making means.That being said, the overwhelming majority of the main bosses are phenomenal, ranging from the best kind of classic From bosses to the best and coolest caster boss they've ever made, the second last boss is probably my favourite of the game, with the first phase of the last boss being a close second. Somehow From managed to make the second phase of the final boss worse than Nashandra/Moon Presence though, which was kind of a letdown. Characters/Story: GRRM's influence in the story and world is apparent but make no mistake this is still Miyazaki's vague, high fantasy, up to interpretation story. However, the overarching story is portrayed a lot more clearly in Elden Ring than in previous Fromsoft games, thanks primarily to the abundance of cutscenes From has implemented, which is a not unwelcomed change. The depth to characters is still there and as mentioned before ER has hands down the best character questlines in any From game, there's so much intrigue and mystery to their lines that end up paying dividends big time. There do seem to be one or two that kind of just stop rather abruptly but the game has only been out for 2 weeks so theres a good chance I just don't know what secret location/item I have to go to/get to continue them. Conclusion (since I'm running out of space): The game is good, get it, play it, its worth every cent and more."
Positive,"FromSoft shakes up the Soulsborne genre by adding an open world twist to the game and they seem to have pulled it off wonderfully. The addition of open world to a Souls game enables the player to revisit an area/boss if they are underlevelled, allowing them to go do nearby dungeons, farm souls, and gather important and key items and weapons. This method of approach prevents players from feeling like they're ""stuck"" on a boss. That being said, at its core it's still very much so a Soulsborne game, with an ultimate choice affecting the fate of countless lives just like yours in the end. The path to that throne is littered with required bosses, all being essential to the plot, the majority of which are well designed and epic fights, leaving me awestruck all throughout, from the moment I walk through the fog wall to the very end. The soundtrack is masterfully crafted, as nothing less is expected from Kitamura (thanks again for Friede's theme, hands down my favorite boss fight). Gameplay is as you'd expect from a Souls game, polished, smooth combat, beautiful weapon arts. Sure it's a bit janky w/ the i-frames, but then again that's part of the Soulsborne charm. The vast variety of weapons, incantations, sorceries, etc allow for a nearly infinite multitude of different builds and playstyles. Want to be an obese, clunky, rotund knight with two massive colossal swords, you can do that. Want to be a graceful and mysterious archwizard of the dark arts, casting forbidden blood spells and incantations? You can do that too. Having been an avid 1, 2, and 3 Souls enjoyer (no console), as cliche as it sounds, if you enjoyed previous Souls games, chances are, you'll love this game. To those new to the Souls genre, don't assume this is some elitist club, if you're a fan of what I've mentioned thus far, don't be afraid to try the game out. It certainly isn't everyone's cup of tea, but I feel as if Elden Ring has adopted some facets that facilitate the gameplay a bit, making it less ""you're on your own, go do x/y/z"", allowing for bonfires to point you in the general way of progression. Also there isn't as much feet as I had thought, what the hell Miyazaki? I'll give you another chance to rectify this problem with subsequent DLC. That being said, it doesn't come without its cons, however they aren't as major and gamebreaking as say other AAA releases as of recent. The biggest concern regarding the PC version is/was performance. Day of and subsequent days of gameplay revealed massive frame drops in certain graphical heavy areas, granted a 1080 isn't exactly the best in the industry, it ran perfectly fine on max settings everywhere else. Since then, a patch or two has alleviated most of the stuttering issues, but I'm sure it'll be something that'll be ironed out in due time. Another issue is connection error issue, as every other attempt to summon a friend often results in connection errors. There are also some bosses, namely Commander Niall, which are simply put, poorly designed boss fights. Granted the boss NPC has a very cool design and couple moves, the small arena, and two tanky summons with moves that deal 90% of your HP even w/ 40 vigor are complete BS. At least he's optional. Lastly, weapon balance in PvP is and always will be a tricky thing, as some weapons aren't viable for PvE, but are downright broken in PvP, resulting in one shot kills with no counters. From the very point which you first launch the game, with its truly epic soundtrack, to its immersive and jaw dropping environments, to its butt clenching boss fights that leave you spamming ""oh shit oh shit oh shit"", I truly believe Elden Ring is well worth its asking price, as it offers a beautifully crafted open world, reminiscent of the typical Soulsborne game level of quality, full of actually interesting lore, secrets, and neat weapons and armor to help you on your journey to facing off against the Elden Lord."

Positive,"FromSoft stapled Dark Souls 4, 5, and Bloodborne 2 together and it's great."
Positive,"After completing the game three times and having all of the achievements complete, I think I'm ready to rewrite this review. To start, I think this game is just phenomenal. The amount of things to do in the game is crazy, as you'd think a game of this size wouldn't be as jam-packed with content. It just blew my mind how everything is done. Although there are a couple of repeat dungeons and bosses, it just adds to the completionist factor of the game. The demi-gods and all of the main bosses are designed so well, like (Morgott, The Omen King and Maliketh, the Black Blade) but there are also some bosses with ""questionable"" designs like (Fire Giant and Godskin Duo.) There are many bosses I'd love to talk about, but I don't want to riddle this review with spoilers.The amount of builds you can create in this game is so amazing, and I think that basically offers it so much replayability, as well as the amount of different challenges that you can do to make the game much harder. I think this is FromSoft's best work yet, and that's crazy to say when they've put out games like Sekiro and Bloodborne. I think Miyazaki and everyone at the team did great with this game and while this game isn't perfect, I'd say it is very well on the course to be perfect once they fix the performance issues and some balancing issues. I'd give the game a 9.5~ /10!"
Positive,If you have the stamina to run along the whole game. play it.
Positive,probably the best game I've ever played
Positive,"Elden Ring reinvents the open world in the same way Breath of the Wild does. By breaking all the trends associated with modern open-world games. No hand-holding, no quest markers, no collectible-based progression, and no copy and pasted zones. You can explore any part of the world from the beginning, nothing (but a few tough enemies) is stopping you from exploring the farthest reaches of the world from the get-go. Build diversity is at an all-time high. With a plethora of play styles available, and with a generous ability to respec (around halfway through the game). I've played three wildly different characters, and each time I was able to make my idea come to life easily.Combat feels as fluent as ever. Strength weapons feel meaty and have a huge weight behind them. While dex-based weapons are fast and fluid. Int and Faith also shine with a huge arsenal of spells/incantations available to try.The only complaint I can levy against this incredible game is awful ultra-wide support and some choppy frame rates in certain areas of the game."

Positive,"This game is truly amazing from not only It's graphics to It's design to bosses being extremely fun to play against even if it takes hours to beat and the amount of things you can do in the free world. I've only just gotten the game and I'm in love with it, if you can just think past some stutters which are not due to your rig then the game is a true master piece. IF you don't have it you should right this instant."
Positive,"Elden Ring is best described as the sum of the best parts of all of Fromsoft's games. If that wasn't enough to get you interested, then the absolutely enormous and sprawling open world certainly will.There may be problems with performance and late game content, but this is truly a game that revolutionised the open world genre. Going forward, I foresee a large number of games that try to mimic what makes Elden Ring so amazing."
Positive,"Fromsoftware took everything they learned from the Souls series, applying it towards a game that redefines what an open world game can be. Consistently, I found myself wondering how they could have packed so much incredible content into the game, while not sacrificing the immense scope, and having killed the final boss, and roughly 29 other bosses (my play time is actually much longer than steam says, for some reason the playtime, I still find myself wondering. Although performance issues are a problem on PC, I have been relatively lucky since launch, even thought my system is far worse than some other reviewers who have experienced issues (Ryzen 7 1700x, and a GTX 1080). At this point, however, what few performance issues I did have are gone, and I'm able to run the game buttery smooth at high settings, with only the occasional dip when exploring the over-world. The game isn't perfect, however. There are a few too many repeated boss encounters, and some of the boss encounters rely a bit too heavily on taking another enemy and multiplying them, instead of adding a new boss entirely.  There is also a recurrent problem of certain enemy types appearing too often. This is helped, however, by the remarkable number of enemy types that are wholly unique, to the point where, after beating the final boss, I went exploring and happened across a new enemy type I hadn't seen before, even though I had thought I had seen everything that wasn't a reused asset. All this said, the game is most definitely flawed, but the flaws do not detract from the game in any meaningful way, and you would be doing yourself a disservice not to play the game, and see if the Souls genre is right for you.The game is a flawed masterpiece. Not so flawed as Dark Souls 1 was at launch, especially on PC, but certainly not perfect. A must play. yes."
Positive,Try finger but hole O dog.
Positive,dank souls but u run around picking weed and smoking it
Positive,"A game is a long time non-seen experience, which doesn't make fool from a player; and another great souls-like title from FromSoftware. Great aesthetics and rewarding gameplay, where only your mistakes are fault of your doom.Really well balances old and new school solutions, thanks to the nature of game, it's fairly accessible to beginners, giving variety of tools and fighting styles, while still being fun for veterans.- As for the FromSoftware games, I have to sadly admit the mouse+keyboard players will STILL have hard time of learning how to play and navigate through menus. I still can't understand why, regardless of past experiences, they can't implement such bizzare thing like optional icons layout for keyboard users."

Positive,"Elden Ring is the only Fromsoft game where the player character is canonically gay, but only if you're playing as a woman. This rules. Oh also it's really hard git gud etc etc its a soulsborne cmon you know the drill"
Positive,classic rapier > end-game youtube sword. change my mind
Positive,this game is fish
Positive,tenza ka to je dobr
Positive,I bet Rogier gets so many maidens
Positive,"In a current stream of in game cash shops, hand holding games or just games that are built around a bare bones concept padded with boring content, Elden ring is a refreshing masterpiece that immerses you into an adventure with lots of unique quests, challenging boss fights, breath taking design and just pure addiction, it's a simple game with no fluff and no trying to be more than it is and what it is has been crafted to perfection. I only hope that other big game companies take a look at this game and see how games should be made."
Positive,"An excellent instalment in the series.Visually stunning, both in the graphics quality and the visual presentation, something that's often lacking in modern games. Combat is sharp and requires a decent amount of skill and trial-and-error to get used to. Very rarely did I feel a boss was needlessly unfair, but I'm also not surprised to see that only 0.3% of players have finished the game a week after release.Some of the late-game stuff is alittle unbalanced, a few of the boss-fights are recycled and poorly designed (  Godskin Duo  ) and I'm pretty sure I already saw someone hacking. Again the way to progress is sort of left to ""search every inch of the map"" or  ""look it up online"". But overall some minor chips to an otherwise perfect product.9.5/10."
Positive,"This game is torture and enjoyment at the same time.  The game really demands you to get better. On the difficulty side of things, this game is easier than the dark souls series, so it's a great for players who are starting out in this ""Souls"" genre or just want an easier dark souls experience.Performance is okay-ish, it could be better. I am getting some dips here and there when entering a new area in the world. The game definitely is worth the price. You can wait it out for discount of course, it's up to you.Now, excuse me for me to continue slam dunk everyone and constantly dying because I suck at times."
Positive,"My first souls game and I have to say I am completely addicted to it. Love the difficulty, the game design, the open world, and just the satisfaction you can get from this game. Fully recommend it!"
Positive,try fingers but hole
Positive,"I would write a more in-depth review, but I'm too busy playing Elden Ring."
Positive,This might arguably be the best game to ever exist and I'm not exaggerating
Positive,its like torture in a good way
Positive,Best RPG ever.And ever.
Positive,I had sex with your mom
Positive,I have clenched and have been stretched all at once
Positive,im very bad at this game
Positive,10/10 best souls game I ever seen!!
Positive,"Don't give up, Skeleton!"
Positive,"The most content out of any Fromsoft title, a lot of enemy variety and free roaming is fun af."
Positive,POG ASS GAME enough said
Positive,"In short, a masterpiece. Never once have I encountered a game which encapsulates the feeling of exploring a vast fantasy world. The sense of scale and escalation is so goddamn perfect. If you wanna read an in-depth review, go look at any of the million 10/10 reviews, they'll be better at speaking for it than me."
Positive,"It's just as Dark Souls but with fresh coating and enhanced experience.Big open world and you can also mount on a horse to travel around faster, lots of interesting bosses too.Loving it so far and carrying on with the fun!"
Positive,"Worth the price. 10/10 for early and mid game, but 5/10 for the end-game part.The map design for the end-game content of Elden Ring is horrible: starting from the Subterranean Shunning Grounds to the Haligtree, you would have a drastically awful experience in terms of discovering the right path that leads you to the boss / grace as enemies could be found everywhere; in most corners and rooms, there will be some sorts of enemies hidden in the dark and trying to stab you from the back. If you are not careful enough and fall into one of these Miyazaki's traps, you would lose half of your HP bar (I had 50 vigor and yet it still hurts lmao). While these kinds of stuff happen everywhere in soul games, but it is really until the late game part that you would find them truly disgusting. P.S.: sorcery build is broken in Elden Ring; it makes Elden Ring easiest soul game from FS Software lmao."
Positive,"This is a great game, it is pretty good. it just does get better than this but past your first playthrough it's quite dull and you notice flaws a lot quicker."
Positive,One of the best game I have played in my life. Don't miss it.
Positive,HEHAHAHAH FINGER BUT HOLE HAHAHAHHA
Positive,Собака впереди *цельность золотого порядка*
Positive,"One of the most breathtaking games I have played in a long time. It is so much more than a simple evolution of the souls formula - It's a reimagining of it in a world that has seen the release of Breath of the Wild. And yet, it's not a simple application of the soulsborne formula onto that type of open world. Rather, Elden Ring manages to solve some of the biggest problems present in Breath of the Wild (e.g. all exploration leading to the same rewards) while staying completely true to the identity of the souls games. The sheer breadth of content in this game and the number of mysteries and moments of discovery you have playing this game is hard to overstate. Elden Ring, especially when played in tandem with a group of blind friends that you share information and experiences with, is a game that will continue to surprise and offer new and exciting things in the least expected places - both in narrative and gameplay. You can sit in a call with friends playing this game and hear ""Holy shit, what the hell?!"" on the regular. You'll get to share what it is you found, try to piece together the narrative and solve puzzles and have an incredible time doing so. The sense of mystery it creates is basically unrivaled. Play this game. I can't wait to see other games learn from it in the coming years."
Positive,Very nice game. All souls titles combined with a large open world really makes this game the most enjoyable of all.
Positive,"One of the most beautifully designed games I have ever played. From the boss fights, to the atmosphere, to the music. Everyone is playing this game for a reason and it's a literal masterpiece"
Positive,"Since patch 1.0.3 and beating the game 100%This is the best game I've ever played.Game is near perfect, few performance issues but they fixed a few + it's not too bad if you use RTSS.11/10 game0/10 keyboard controls (controller definitely required)fps cap (60) is fine if you play with controller, which you should anyway."
Positive,You know what this is. It's Dark Souls. It's always Dark Souls. Buy it. Play it. Die. Wear nothing but a helmet and gloves so you can fast roll. Die again. Play it more. Visit the shrine to Kentaro Miura. Cosplay Guts. Realise you don't have the strength for that. Die to the guardians of his hearse. Be a summon for bosses. Die whilst helping. 10/10
Positive,its not amongus but its still good tho
Positive,recommended if you like soul like game
Positive,This shit right here...
Positive,"if your stuck on a boss, try finger, but whole"
Positive,"First off, the problems with stuttering that had been happening are mostly gone now, and being patched. And while the game has crashed on me once or twice, my experience with the game has been spectacular. Also, my rig is just over minimum requirements.Amazing game, the difficulty might not be for everyone, but it's very rewarding. The open world is very refreshing and relaxing compared to other open world games. It's not empty, but there aren't markers cluttering the entire surface area of the map to distract you, I think that Breath of The Wild is the best comparison in terms of world feel, but I think it's pulled off better in Elden Ring. There are a lot of hidden bosses to fight (I think there are something like 80), and items to find, along with the main quest lines. While this is definitely a very hard game, the difficulty is done in a much more forgiving way than previous souls games. If you get stuck on a boss in this game just go fight something else, level up, and come back later. While I am nowhere near being done with the game, I can't imagine that something would change my opinion on it at this point."
Positive,"In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face, is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But there are times when a critic truly risks something, and that is in the discovery and defense of the *new*. The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations. Last week, I experienced something *magical* an extraordinary game from an amazing company. To say that both the game and its maker's have challenged my preconceptions about fine gaming is a huge understatement. They have rocked me to my core. Not every game can become great, but a great game can come from anywhere. It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the geniuses working at FromSoft, who are, in this critic's opinion, nothing less than the finest game devs known since 5th of February 2009. I will be returning to Elden Ring soon, Yearning for more-Greloks The Masochist"
Positive,"10/10 GOTY 2022Best RPG and genuinely fun game in a long time. There is no hand holding and that's what makes the game so rewarding. The difficulty of Souls games but a bit forgiving if you decide to roam around and get stronger before taking on main bosses. The addition of a mount and jumping has also taken the Souls games to the next level, making vertical exploration possible (some places can only be reached by jumping with the mount for example). Fast travel is extremely accessible and abundant. Playing with friends is also easier as the item needed is craftable using easily found mats from the open world. The open world puts you in control of the adventure and difficulty. You can rush through the main story or take your time and explore the dungeons and take on mini bosses. Exploration and discovery can be found in every corner and the world has unique zones and mobs. There are mystery elements in that the story is told not only via cutscenes but also through notes that you find and NPCs that you speak with (which aren't always in the same place or time of day).The bosses are all unique and have their own movesets to learn. You can choose to take them on just you or you can bring in spirit summons/NPC summons/co op or even use cheese methods (which are plentiful) to beat the bosses. The music is phenomenal as well and really sets the mood for the fights."
Positive,"If you like dark souls or any souls like game, play this. If you like breath of the wild or any open world game, play this.Idk, just play this. Give it a chance if you aren't used to this type of gamed.FromSoftware never fails to deliver with the quality of their games. The amount of though that goes into creating the background stories and the environments of this game is unrivalled. This is one of the finest open world games to ever be made. You may be familiar with the classic open world games that studios like ubisoft is making now, go here do this. go there do that. This game is not like that. Exploring is one of the best things about this game and it truly feels rewarding. This game is full of content not just filler. There are so many unique situations that are wonderful. From enemies to friendly npcs and their stories and to weapons there is a huge variety of content. Heck I'm 95 hours in and I havn't finished the game yet but none of it has felt like a chore. I've enjoyed all of it and it 's definitely my favourite game of all time.There are a lot of people getting stuck on this game either saying it's too hard or that it should have a quest log. Some people are seeing the first hard enemy they find and giving up because they can't beat it. You don't have to! It's an important lesson that you can leave that challenge for later and just explore the world. Not having a quest counter makes this game much better. As people have suggested if you really want to you can get a pen and paper to help you remember characters. Don't complain that this is dumb because you aren't in school anymore. I'm sure you can manage. It makes the game so much more natural. You aren't meant to complete quests perfectly and it Isn't really possible to.  If you miss a character or a part of a quest it may change other npcs stories in doing so. This makes them so organic and unique to you. You have to puzzle together their dialogue and this world in your own way. If you find something too challenging there is always something else you can try in this game. A different sword, a ranged weapon, magic, a summon, bring a friend along!TLDR: This is one hell of a game with rich and vibrant environments with deep lore. With a lot of it written by George R R Martin adding to even more of what we've come to love from Miyazaki. At it's core this game is an epic fantasy open world with great solid combat and it goes beyond that and is so much more as it's elements have been refined over years of FromSoftware experience."
Positive,"I've been playing so many different games since the age of 5...I've reached at the top divisions on them and all I want to say is that this is maybe the best game I have ever played in my entire life! The amount of mechanics combined with insane graphics combined with an open world AND combined with a multiuplayer co op and a duel system....I highly recommend this game,just be careful if it crashes with the steam could sync,thats my only warning,everything else - pure masterpiece!"
Positive,"The best From Software game so far. Really hard, especially the beggining, but once you progress further you'll find out it's more easier for you. Really recommend!"
Positive,one of the best games in the last few years real sunbros know
Positive,"Being a Soulsborne fan, this is clearly my most expected game of this year. Despite having some technical issues (not really a big problem to me), I enjoyed every second of my first playthrough. Elden Ring is truly a fantastic game, and right now this is easily one of my most favorite games of all time. Let’s talk about the gameplay, because we all know that this is the most important part of a Soulsborne game. The gameplay mechanics of Elden Ring is most similar to Dark Souls, though it has some elements from Sekiro as well. If you played Dark Souls or Bloodborne before, you’ll know what to expect. Aside from that, Elden Ring has some new mechanics, like mounting combat, which is easy to learn, but it takes time to master (of course); guard counter, ash of war, spirit summon. All of them made the depth of the gameplay. The sorcery/incantation system is a bit different, and I didn’t use them a lot in the first playthrough, but from what I saw, they’re better than ever and worth a try, if you’re not a mage player. Elden Ring has lots of bosses, and when I say “lots of”, I mean tons of them, maybe 3 or 4 times than the previous games. The interesting thing is, not so many of them are required to finish the game, which means you can choose to find and battle them if you like. I’d recommend it, because some of the hidden and optional bosses are really incredible (yes, and very tough). As you know, Elden Ring is an open world game, but don’t let that term disappoint you yet. I know there are tons of generic open world games out there, with hundreds of copy-and-paste side quests and huge yet soulless world; but Elden Ring is not one of them. I’d say Elden Ring is one of the best open world games in recent years. The world is huge, but you won’t find it filled with pointless side quests and stuffs. Elden Ring still has the unique NPC questline system from Soulsborne, and they’re still good. The world of Elden Ring is now filled with lots of mini dungeons and forts for you to explore, fight and gather materials for your journey. Some of those mini dungeons are really good, almost as good as chalice dungeons from Bloodborne, but the truth is most of them are quite short and not really memorable. Given the fact that there are dozens of them, I’d say this is acceptable. Another cons (probably, depends on your point of view), is the huge open world itself. Now if you’re already familiar with other open world games, you may find it frustrated to be unable to know where to go and what to do. But to me, this is the real open world, speaking of the definition of this term. You’re free to explore wherever you want, do whatever you want. The reward is the exploration itself. You’ll find important items, weapons, armors, magics and other stuffs while exploring the vast open world. You’ll also learn more about the world itself - lore, world building and even the gameplay mechanics. The design of Elden Ring’s open world is heavily inspired by Breath of the Wild, and From Software really did a fine job, not as incredible as Zelda BOTW, but still, a fine job.About the graphics, well you can say that Elden Ring doesn’t have a breathtaking next-gen visual, especially compared to other next-gen games. To me, the graphics is good enough, because what truly magnificent is the art direction of Elden Ring. From Software always know how to make their game incredibly beautiful and thematic. Each region of this game has different art direction, and they worked so well. It’s really hard to describe them by words, all I can say is that you’ll be overwhelmed by the beauty of The Lands Between.About the story/lore/world building, its still vague and kind of hard to understand like the previous games. But deep down, it’s a world with a huge amount of lore, backstory, and you’ll have to figure it out by reading item’s description, listening to NPC dialouge, etc. After all, this is the unique way of storytelling in Soulsborne, is it not? Besides, the lore and world building are created by George RR Martin - the infamous author of A Song of Ice and Fire, so maybe you’ll find it has some similar details, compared to the fantasy world of Martin. The music is good enough. Some of the tracks are incredible and emotional, but really, most of them are just fine. I mean they’re not bad, they works well with the world and the fights, but that’s just it, nothing too fancy. Still, the music are fine. They did their job, some of them are better and clearly one of the best in the entire series, and that’s enough to enjoy.Despite having some minor issues in gameplay mechanics, this is still one of the best games ever made by From Software, and truly a masterpiece. Should you play it? Definitely yes. Highly recommended."
Positive,i have not seen the sun in 50 hours
Positive,Fromsoftware's Magnum Opus Pinnacle of Open World and Souls genre
Positive,"If you are new to the souls genre, this is as accessible as it should get without killing the essence of the series. This game lets you go at your own pace, but you need to persevere. From's works are all about the struggle and maybe even the unfairness (looking at you, Godskin Duo), so if you can't handle failure maybe you shouldn't bother.The PC port is clearly rushed in some aspects. You might remember the vulnerability issues found on DS3 that happened pretty close to this game's launch, so I reckon that affected stability in some manner.All the previous aside, this game is the culmination of From's work, their magnum opus, if you will. The previous games feel like a build-up to get here, and it does them tremendous justice. A must try, I'd like to say, but I'm aware that this genre may not be everyone's cup of tea."
Positive,"DISCLAIMER: There are no spoilers in this review!Elden Ring! It is for sure the pinnacle of the souls-like series of FromSoftware. And although I find the game a masterpiece, it has its problems. But let's get something out of the way: I strongly recommend this game for everyone, even those with the famous phrase ""Souls-like it isn't for me"".You could stop reading there if you like, but for those who want a more in-depth review, I'll talk about every aspect of the game...Gameplay & Game Design: 10/10I chose to start with Gameplay because it is, undoubtedly, what makes this game so good. It's addicting in every way that I can think of, the combat, the exploration, and the puzzles (although there aren't many). I found the game entertaining even when I had to farm for an item or a crafting material.The boss fights and enemy encounters are well-designed. There were times that I just kept watching some enemies fight among themselves, or had to change my approach to conquer a zone, or even had to outsmart a boss. The terrain also plays an important role in how you approach your enemies, using it to your advantage is not only recommended but at many times, necessary.The combat is awesome! You feel good defeating a difficult enemy, or an invader player that played well. Every time that I god invaded some player would present a different challenge for me since the game has so many weapons and they are so different from each other. And although my current build does not use a lot of magic skills, so I can't talk too much about them, I already want to do a skill-based character, like a mage or a cleric. And talking about builds, the amount of builds possible seems huge (I didn't play that much to say that for sure, and only the future meta will tell about the viability of them, but so far they seem pretty vast).So about the Open World, I liked how they incorporated the aspects of it inside a souls-like game, all the mechanics that surround the Open World part were well designed, but the multiplayer (more on that later). The exploration, how you get your ""Estus Flask"", the dungeons, and the world itself is well-designed. Sure there are some dungeons and places that are copied and pasted from each other, but overall they did a great job of creating different challenges. What I found most valuable was how different every area was from each other, not only the color pallet but the enemies and challenges even the insides of some areas, you can tell just by looking at the screen in which area some player is.Multiplayer: 2/10 I saw an article saying that multiplayer is outdated and gimmicks, and sadly, I agree. The souls-like games that came before had similar Multiplayer mechanics, I know. But that doesn't mean that those mechanics are fun nor do they indeed add something to the game, on the contrary, they add unnecessary complexity and a laborious way to play with your friend that does not fit in an Open World game. I'm talking about all the tedious process of summoning your friend every time you kill a boss, or even the game BLOCKING you for exploring certain areas when you have a friend in your world. For me, that is unacceptable in a game where exploration plays a major role in it.With that said I found very few issues when it comes to multiplayer connections, I mainly played with my friend and we had just 2 disconnects with more than 100 summons, and as we are in the first week of the game, so I find it acceptable. One issue that kept occurring to me and my friend though, was the red stains stopped working, they just didn't show how that character died.Music & Sound Effects: 9/10The music is beyond great, they are a masterpiece on their own. Even the menu music awakens your inner fighter and just makes you wanna play more. Something that I enjoyed is how the music seamlessly translates the situations that you are in, for instance, when you start combat with an invader the combat music starts to play, that is so cool! The sound effects are also good, nothing out of this world like the music, but they get the job done in making your immersion more vivid.Graphics: 8/10Elden Ring is not a new-gen game in terms of graphics, don't get me wrong, the landscapes and the scenarios are beautiful, and for an old engine is impressive what FromSoftware did. But still, we have games today that surpass Elden Ring in graphics in so many ways. Again, this isn't a factor that would make you give up on the game, because the graphics are still great, but it's worth saying that there are games with better graphics out there.Open World: -/-I've already talked about it, but I felt it deserves a separate topic to talk about more in-depth. The world is huge! I'm not saying that is huge compared to other games, I'm pretty sure that in a few days someone will do the maths and find out that there are a lot of games that have far more ground than Elden Ring does. But I'm talking about the content inside the world and the density of events that composes it. We have a mount named Torrent to travel the vast world but were very occasionally that I summoned it to travel. Mostly I used it for combat. I didn't summon it a lot, not because the controls are bad, they were pretty good. Not because the mount wasn't fast enough, because it is indeed faster than your character, but because I had so much to explore that staying in the mount, just wasn't worth it. I spent my first 20 hours or so just in the first area of the game (Limgrave), and I still came back to do more stuff that I forgot or even hadn't checked out yet!Story & Characters: 9/10Demon Souls, and the Dark Souls series had their way of telling a story, it's definitively not a conventional way, it has its own weird and ambiguous way to tell what the f*ck is going on. Elden ring shares a lot of that, but it has more ways to tell its story. Now you find documents and paintings that you can read about them in a new menu that adds a lot to the story of characters or the world itself. Talking about the characters... I've always found that those were the main part of the story, all of them are well written and most of them will awaken a strong feeling, either hate or love, even disgust, and sympathy.Overall: 9/10Although the maths gives a score of 7.6/10, I can't use this score just because I hated the multiplayer mechanics, I agree more with the 9/10. This game is by far the best souls-like game made by FromSoftware and I already enjoyed 90 hours of it, I'm pretty sure that I didn't scratch the surface, nor reach a tenth of what the game truly has to offer. Play the game I'm sure you'll enjoy it as much or even more than I am now!"
Positive,This game has made me punch my closet in anger so many times. Would highly recommend 10/10
Positive,"TOO MANY STUFF TO DO, TOO LITTLE TIME I LOVE GAEM"
Positive,"SummaryWelcome to “The Lands Between”! Elden Ring is an open world fantasy action RPG game where there is no holding back on the difficulty. You create your own character, male or female and then choose your class you want to play. There are a few choices and all with its advantages and disadvantages.The game is developed by FromSoftware. Also known for they other games like Armored Core and Souls series, including Bloodborne and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. They got a good history in this genre. And this time they collaborated with fantasy novelist George R. R. Martin who wrote the novels A Song of Ice and Fire, which were adapted into Game of Thrones.Rating 9,6Graphics: 10Audio: 10Story: 10Content: 10Controls: 9Gameplay: 9GraphicsThis game delivers on graphics. The world in general looks amazing! There is much to see. The day and night cycle makes any environment that you go through even more dangerous during night time. The good thing during night time is that you can see materials luminating during this time. Environmental wise there are also spots in the world where there are fireflies. It just makes for a breathtaking view of the world. Rain, mist and even lightning strikes are there to change your environment.Not only topside is the view great but also in the dungeons you encounter. Let it be like a small catacomb or a massive underworld dungeon with deep chasms where you don’t see the bottom anymore.The models of the enemies are done really well. You can see the details of the armor and weapons being used. Even putting on a lantern on your belt looks awesome, because who doesn’t want to run around like a night watch?AudioThe theme song you hear in the main menu, it blew me away. Didn’t want to start the game until I got tired of listening to it …. Still listening to it and had to force myself to start a game. Just in case, here is a link to it if you want to listen to it:Main Menu Theme YoutubeThe audio just works well. You can hear the little beetles with their glowing orbs and hunt them down if you do. Nothing bad so far on my end.StoryThere is a story in the world and there are side quests as well. But you have to look for them, explore. In this world there are spots that are called “grace” and they act like teleport and/or save points. Once interacted with them they will give you a guide where to go to. The main story sends you into a general direction and you, as a player, have to look for a solution to either enter an area to continue this quest or go around it and move on in the world without doing that part of a quest. Either way, you can skip parts if you wish.The world is big and there are a lot of interesting areas to discover. From hidden dungeons, churches, world bosses, challenges, enemy camps, islands, merchants, quest givers and more. It is rewarding to explore; you will always find something.ContentThe content you have access to is mostly crafting. It is a great way to add more support items you’re your inventory to go to war in this world. And in order to get access to all the crafting you will need to have a crafting kit. The cookbooks will learn you all kinds of recipes like darts, food, pots, antidotes and more. Not all cookbooks can be found at a merchant, so if you want to get them all, you have to explore.Co-op mode is nice but you can not loot static placed items as a client in the open world. It is not like Borderlands co-op where the party goes through the story together, only the host will progress through any content done in that session. Here it is more like a mmo, where you or your friends help each other out in a dungeon or with a boss. Only the host of the session will complete that run. So once you do it, your co-op partner didn’t complete it. The clients that join only have half their health potions and can’t summon any ashes. Ashes are companions you can summon. For some a game breaker but it does balance everything out.ControlsI played with a Playstation 5 controller on Steam and have not tried out the keyboard and mouse and therefor I cannot comment on that porting. But playing with a controller just feels so natural for me, coming from the Final Fantasy games.Looking at the options for the game and going through it I must say that I like that you can remap the buttons in this game. Let it be keyboard and mouse (Yes you people complaining about the keys!) and even on the controller. You don’t see that on every port unfortunately. Keeps me from running DS4Windows. A big plus for that.GameplayThis game is all I hoped for and there are so many things I wish to cover, and will, but steam is limited on what I can write. The game runs smooth most of the times. Sometimes my frames drop like a brick on my computer but it is not game breaking for me. The game controller I use and the combat just goes great. I die a lot, you will as well. It is a so rewarding after frustrating for so long until you kill that one boss after failing many times.The A.I. could have been better. I am not talking about the combat but the response in the world. You can have an army in front of you and you hit 1 with a throwing dagger, the others keep on moving and the one you hit pulls out his weapons and comes for you. The other A.I. is like … “why he being hit and drawing weapons … oh well … let’s keep on moving…”I enjoy this game a lot and hope you do as well. This game isn’t for everyone, it won’t get easier. You will die. Git Gud"
Positive,probably the perfection of the dark souls formula.performance issues are annoying but manageable in my experience.
Positive,Fromsoftwares greatest hits the video game. Took everything from previous games and added in a open world that rewards exploration and creativity. One of the best games i have played in the past few years.
Positive,"Elden Ring breathes new life into the Souls-formula by allowing more agressive ways to play. The addition of Sekiro's posture system combined with guard counter and jumping attacks provides more combat options than the infamous R1/RB spam which plagued Dark Souls 3. Most bosses now have a huge moveset that may get in the way of learning patterns, but makes up for more interesting fights.Elden Ring suffers a bit from the Dark Souls 3 problem of having some enemies way faster than you, Bloodborne's quickstep could have helped to balance things out. My biggest gripe with the game is that parry has been made redundant since a lot of enemies delays their attacks, so you have to consider their delay AND your parry animation, imo it's not worth the risk when you can simply guard counter. Maybe a parry system similar to Sekiro would have been better.Music is great. Atmosphere and world design are amazing.This isn't a conventional open world, if you're having trouble with a boss you can always go somewhere else and return later, Elden Ring teaches you this by placing hard enemies at the start. There's no need to grind at any point in the game, as it provides you with a handful of tools to deal with every encounter.Overall, Elden Ring feels like a celebration of every Souls-type game made by FromSoftware so far, with numerous references to previous entries and ideas coming back to be refined.Last, but not least, nerf Malenia."
Positive,"Thank you, Miyazaki, very cool"
Positive,Game is excellent. Annoying as shit bosses here and there but overall an actual masterpiece.
Positive,Its Dark Souls
Positive,It is surreal how good this game is.
Positive,This game makes up for all the terrible and overhyped AAA releases in the past few years.I cannot say enough. This is the magnum opus of Miyazaki & From Software.
Positive,"Best game i've played in a long time, would recommend. FeelsGoodMan"
Positive,"This is one of the first single player games I have reviewed in a very long time. Typically the standard single player open world formula is a BOREFEST. (When I say standard I mean, they tell you where to go and what to do and hold your hand like you are 8 years old.)Elden Ring is the perfect example on how not to conform to any of that mainstream trash open world RPGs. This game will end up being a masterpiece(In everyone's mind). It already is. I cannot believe how much I am enjoying this experience. The world is absolutely breathtaking and the sense of discovery is sky high. My advice to anyone that is looking at this review is to just play the game with a controller (I know a controller on PC blah blah. Trust me I thought the same thing. It's worth it) and don't look at any youtube videos / guides as they all contain spoilers of the types of enemies and bosses you will find in this massive world.10/10 - I don't give single player games(yes I know there is minor multiplayer. Don't count it tho) this high of a score ever.  This is a must buy. Just keep at it and the journey of getting clapped time and time again is all why it is such a compelling experience.Quick edit as of 6/27/24This is the greatest game of all time."
Positive,"An endless open-world with meaningful discoveries and DS3 combat. There is lots of NPC quests, items, skills and equipment to find, and also various different secret locations to discover only to greeted with an another one. Elden Ring has it all. Despite the performance issues in the PC port, I have never feel frustrated because the game's overwhelming positives negates these negatives. I also hope FromSoftware will fix these issues in the near future. Elden Ring is the ultimate open-world game for someone who is looking for challenge when exploring, and likes dark fantasy worlds.10/10 Masterpiece."
Positive,THIS is what a $60 game should be
Positive,"Отличная игра, позволяет отвлечься от войны у меня в стране."
Positive,L + Ratio + Maidenless + Tarnished + Touch Grace
Positive,This dethroned Bloodborne as the best Soulsverse game
Positive,"Its FromSoftware, so what's more to say? Go ahead and try this masterpiece for yourselves. Ye Tarnished, is waiting for you!"
Positive,Best game in the last decade. That's it buy it now.
Positive,"For me, who's a huge souls fan, this game is a true masterpiece.It took elements from dark souls, sekiro and bloodborne, and improved them.World is stunning and beautiful, lots of exploration to be done and many many secrets to discover.Combat feels satisfying and it has a lot of variety.I personally didn't have any issues with game, no bugs, glitches etc. The only problem I've had so far is the frame drops and stutters, it has gotten a bit better, I hope it will be fully fixed soon."
Positive,"10/10. i mean come on. brings all the best things from the dark souls series and puts it into an open map.. for me game of the yearMid end pc on low settings runs perfectly, some stutters but havent had one in a boss fight yet- GTX 950 - i5 6500- 16 GB DDR4"
Positive,"This game takes the best parts about souls games and makes it 100% more approachable.  Top to bottom I have been impressed, the story is fun, the scenery is incredible, and the boss battles continue to impress."
Positive,greatest game of all time.
Positive,Time for pickle.
Positive,this game is truly fromsoftware's magnum opus and one of the best in the souls born series this game deserves game of the year.
Positive,"If you enjoyed Dark Souls 3, this is basically that but modded out.This is by far my favorite souls game ever, I never run out of stuff to do, it's amazing"
Positive,"Ive played every soulsborne game to date, this is by far the best game they have put out. It takes all the great things from previous games and mashes it into an ultimate experience that just feels good all around. The story has been hitting hard and has a lot more dialogue and interactive story for you to have fun with. As well as brings back some relics from past games. All while feeling new and fresh. This game isnt perfect by any means, it has its minor glitches and stutters but nothing I haven't seen worse on any other game, and most of those issues can easily be patched out. Its a game I have already sunk 55 hours into as of writing this review and I have only reached a little over the halfway point in the game with so much more to explore.TLDR: If you enjoy previous FromSoft games you will love how this game feels and plays, if not but are looking for a game that rewards persistence and drive maybe give it a shot. If not it may not be the game for you and thats alright not everything will be. Overall I personally love what Ive seen so far and can't wait to play more"
Positive,"It's a little easy for my taste ,but if you like relaxing games like stardew valley you'll really like this."
Positive,"Yes, I would recommend Elden Ring to anyone who can reasonably use a control pad.It is big, it is beautiful, it is hard- but you can always summon some help"
Positive,"updating my review after having played 259 hours.It was the best 259 of my life , i have never been this invested in a game since skyrim. I think there is a lot of things Elden Ring does best it has a massive open world,u are free to go and do whatever u want which was less possible in prev titles. overall i think the art style lore is not to be underestimated.P.S. also u will die a lot in this game and will be staring at the ""You Died"" screen a lot but don't get discouraged tarnished"
Positive,game is mid
Positive,The culmination of the Soulsborne Series
Positive,attention all gamersthis game is too hard and you shouldn't play it(edit: 92 hours in) this game is unbeatable DO NOT buy it
Positive,"man i love this game so much dood, the magic is insane, the weapons are insane, the spectacle is insane, the bosses are fucking NUTS, the world is INSANE. and it has a giant talking tortoise who doesnt judge you and teaches you many types of magic very pog and wholesome"
Positive,"Builds upon the formula of Dark Souls III with new ways to approach combat such as sneaking, jumping, and mounted combat. The world is huge, with lots of interesting enemies and NPCs to encounter. Replay value will likely be a strong point for this game as there are plenty of new spells and weapons. Some animations and assets have been recycled from previous games, but there is enough new stuff to make it feel like a new experience. Performance can be rough at times, though the team has been rolling out patches to mitigate these issues. Co-op seems to be basically copied from Dark Souls III, except the item used to host a session is much easier to obtain. I'd really like to see them make some design improvements allowing for players to co-op in an area even after the boss has been defeated, similar to the small white soapstone in Dark Souls II. Overall, I've had a lot of fun with the game so far, and expect to experiment with new builds in New Game+ for many hours."
Positive,"Fantastic game! The fact that there is now an actual adventuring element in a Souls game makes it feel like there are two sides to the experience. You have a beautifully crafted wide expanse to explore alone or with friends (BIG ISSUE WITH THIS THOUGH, I WILL ADDRESS THIS LATER) and you also have old school Souls type areas. What do I mean by that last bit? when you are advancing toward a major boss, you will find them located in dungeons reminiscent of older Souls games, it is just they are separated by stretches of explorable area rather than being placed back to back. The new weapon skills system truly opens up customization options for equipment and skill allocation.Pyromancies and prayers have been combined into one magical entity called incantations that helps streamline the efforts of caster builds.The dual wielding mechanic has been pulled right out of DS2, you find two weapons, just equip them in you left and right hand. Summoning ashes adds a new depth and option to the game for those opting to remain at range.This truly is a game that wants you to play it and keep playing. For me it has been quite victorious!Now... the horrifying truth that puts a giant damper on my favorite aspect of the game: if you beat a boss in the overworld, ripe with opportunities to adventure and explore with up to two friends, you can no longer summon in that area. You cannot summon in another area or within a lesser dungeon and cross back to the area you want to explore with them because the overworld has been diced into sections and you can not cross these borders with a pal or leave a dungeon entrance because those are blocked by fog gates (at least you can still summon friends when you are within lesser dungeon). The apologist explanation is ""this is how it has been in every other game"" but From Software has never made a game with a truly addicting adventuring aspect that is magnified by sharing the experience. Plus this is not a Demon Souls, Dark Souls, or Bloodborne game, this is a brand new beast. I had a lot of fun playing and discovering new things with friends, but now the majority of my map is unsommonable ground. I loved sharing cool discoveries with my friends and challenging fearsome world roaming bosses, but now the latter is something we have agreed to forgo indefinitely just to keep the option of playing together in the open world a possibility.As a note to From Software, please please PLEASE change the summoning lock-out in the overworld when a boss is beaten. Multiplayer in this game is a new, entirely different beast with unimaginable potential, I beg of you not to treat it as you had in the much more compartmentalized games that come before it when summons tended to be used as just help on a boss."
Positive,"TL;DR 8.5/10 My favorite souls game to-date, and the one I plan to put the most time into. I have 100% Achievements in DS1 and 3 (only 3 on Steam) and I can confidently say Elden Ring blows both of them out of the water. If you're a souls fan and you somehow haven't already bought Elden Ring, go ahead and buy Elden Ring. Some of my colleagues have been concerned about the open-world nature of the game having a detrimental impact to the Souls-iness of the gameplay; it doesn't. It still feels like a souls game, just a ludicrously massive one, one where your adventure through it really is your own.On the other hand, if you're an open-world gamer who hasn't stepped into souls before, do be aware that Elden Ring is not going to hold your hand in any regard. You will receive quests without quest markers. You will be told to go places with only a rough description of where such places are - and that description may not even make any sense to you at the time. And everything in the game is designed to slay your character. Elden Ring is difficult. Beautifully difficult.I can espouse praise for the game for ages, but at the end of the day, Elden Ring essentially just boils down to ""Dark Souls 4: Gigantic Map Edition"". And for some of us, that's exactly what we wanted.Of course, the game is not without its flaws, and that's why it receives an 8.5/10 from me and not a 10/10. The three flaws are as follows:- 0.5 to its score due to performance. You've probably read about the game's performance problems elsewhere. On a 3080 I maintain generally consistent 60fps but I have dipped down to 30fps on more occasions than I can count. And furthermore, the game is hard-fps locked at 60fps, which just sucks. The console market strikes again, sadly.- 0.5 to its score due to boss design. Now don't get me wrong, there's some really cool freakin bosses in here. But as I've put 50 hours into the game (and will likely double or triple that in time) I've come to learn that *every single boss* has some sort of giant AoE attack. Most bosses have several. Some bosses are entirely AoE-attack-based. I have a lurking suspicion that this came about due to the inclusion of mounted combat. With player mobility higher than ever due to the nature of having a mount, designers probably felt that bosses needed some sort of panic button for their speedy, mounted opponents. Unfortunately, this design seemed to slip into *all* bosses, even those that you cannot mount against, which makes a lot of fights irksome at best or unfun at worst. Again, I genuinely enjoy most boss fights in the game, but these issues do exist. Another irksome note about boss design, however, is that many boss encounters are just gank bosses with mechanics that don't really interact in any meaningful way and are just difficult because there's 2+ what you're fighting against. This isn't exactly new to Elden Ring, but that doesn't mean I can't disparage it regardless. Good gank bosses are Ornstein and Smough. Bad gank bosses are Ruin Sentinels. Elden Ring has a lot of ""Ruin Sentinels."" - 0.5 to its score because the game has Easy Anti-Cheat. At least it isn't Denuvo, but it's likely EAC will have a lasting impact on the potential of modding the game, and some Dark Souls mods (such as Cinders, the legendary mod for DS3) have been truly amazing in the past. It's also likely EAC incurs a performance penalty to the game as well, which loops back to the game's first main problem for me."
Positive,"This game, while built upon foundations and refinements of the previous titles such as the Dark Souls series, gives you a sense of adventure that I've not seen the likes of since Morrowind. I don't know if I feel the same level is there but it's closer than any other I've played.Locations you visit have purpose to them. There's always some sort of item at the end or during the adventure of a new location. It may not be for your build but it is a significant item. Smaller areas can also have this but sometimes it's just crafting materials. Unfortunate but understandable.Many bosses in dungeons are seemingly repeated but there's a catch to this. They aren't simply the same boss but with more health. They'll be a similar boss but with new moves. Sometimes that's just new moves and that's it. Other times, it's new moves with different damage types. One watchdog may be only physical while the next has a new slam attack that does magic damage. One breaths fire as an attack. The variance is welcome as I'm sure designing entirely unique bosses for every one of these locations would be far too much to get done and done well. This is an acceptable compromise to the likes of seeing Smelter Demon getting stat buffs and a new flame color.Do not be mistaken, this game is built on the core foundations of what made Demon's and Dark Souls games. It is not the same game. You can beat any boss with patience and learning. This is not expected though. Sometimes, you should go explore surrounding areas, find more items and merchants, acquire more levels and upgrade your arsenal. The game encourages you to do this. Do not beat your head against the wall if you're not hard headed. Just because the game leads you to the first major boss does not mean you need to be there if you're having trouble. There's probably over a dozen bosses immediately available the second you leave the starting area, most of them will not give you trouble like the major boss the game is telling you about with the Guidances of Grace.This is an open world. This is not a level to level game like previous entries with a maximum of one or two alternative routes you might be able to get sidetracked on. Go on an adventure. If the idea of going on an adventure in a Dark Souls-like game does not appeal to you, then I do not recommend you this game. There is only dead space in between areas to give it a bit more room to breath instead of having non-stop combat. There are tons of hidden bosses. I haven't even beaten all of the bosses in the beginning area and I know I've beaten about 10 or so there before I went on with the main story.The combat has been improved. Jumping, jump attacks, horseback combat, and guard counters have significantly changed how this game plays. Breaking posture is a great mechanic that helps alleviate the spam of light attacks that Dark Souls III suffered from. Heavy attacks, charged heavy attacks, jump attacks, and guard counters all do significant posture damage. Light attacks also add onto posture damage but not as much. There's a trade off here. Attack harder but slower and a bit riskier or attack quickly but lighter with more safety.The PC issues for some have been awful. That is something that should not be ignored. Personally, my only issues have been framerate drops that almost always happen in the open world and outside of combat while on a horse. One time, Easy Anti-Cheat told me I was doing something wrong and kicked me back to the menu. I restarted the game and I was not banned or anything and my progress was not lost either thankfully. Others have had worse issues. There have been a few patches including one released the day of this review. I've heard it helped a lot of issues. Just be warned that this is a possibility.I only liked this game at first and had my concerns about the open world. But after more thoroughly exploring the opening area and then proceeding to the next one, I have fallen in love with this game. If it keeps up this level of quality and sense of adventure, it is truly a masterpiece.A must have for any Souls veteran who wants to roam more in a game of that genre. And a good entry point for newcomers as well due to the plethora of options available to ease your experiences and hardships of fighting enemies."
Positive,bussin but fix performance yo i'm moonwalking
Positive,Best game ever
Positive,"Despite some PC port issues, this is hands down the grandest open-world game I've played. The amount of AAA content here is beyond belief, especially given the quality of games we have become accustomed to these days. I went into this excepting around 30 hours of gameplay but im stitting at 90 hours and still far far away from the end of the game, which speaks volumes. I love how if you really just want to finish the main mandatory questline, you can accomplish it in around 10 hours or so - everything else is completely optional. 60% of the game and entire parts of the map are completely hidden from the player in nooks and crannies of the world, and its borderline impossible to find unless the player consciously goes looking for it. There is no hand-holding, and the game is absolutely unapologetic to the player. It treats the player with respect, and leaves it to the player to go exploring, solve puzzles, and overcome adversity. Its FromSoft through and through. I remember watching gameplay trailers of this game before release, and I remember FromSoft saying something along the lines of ""this is the most approachable game we have made"", and I and many others thought this meant that the game will be easy. haha...... This is definitely approachable, but holy moly this is probably the hardest game FromSoft has put out."
Positive,"Good entry to the souls like games. 8/10 game. Feels like it is Dark souls 3 the sequel. FromSoftware didnt really take too many risks with innovation aside from a free roam map and a new skill system for your weapons this plays exactly like other souls like games. They have learned from some mistakes in their other games but some frustrating issues are still present from other games. The hitboxes in this entry are finally good, you can duck under swings from a sword, jump over attacks its honestly pretty cool but then you still have the same issues that were present in previous games such as enemies being able to hit through walls, AOE projectiles will hit you through floors etc. Performance has also been quite inconsistent. They are still using their really poorly designed (at least imo) summon system. For some bosses if you wish to summon a player but theres not many players currently on that boss (or at least want to be summoned for the boss) then you will see only a small handful of summon signs and by the time you have interacted with them someone else has summoned the player so you missed them. It happens constantly in areas with few summon signs and it is essentially a race to the sign. Summoning your friends has now been made ""easier"" with a password mechanic so only you and your friend can see eachothers summon signs which is fine but if I want me friend to help me with a boss that they have not discovered yet I have to wait for them to get to the area and clear it and get to my location before I can summon. Its just time wasting and it would be so much handier if they could for example just join me through steam to fight the boss and they go back to their own game instead of wasting 30 minutes of both our time. Its an issue iv had with all the souls games I just think the summon mechanic is really bad.Invasions have also been changed in this game to the point where I honestly thought they just got rid of invasions. Instead they have been changed. You can now only be invaded if you are exploring with a coop partner or if you happen to have found and used a specific item that allows players to invade your solo world (why even call it Invasion if you allowing it? Its not really an invasion if you have a choice to be invaded). Most players (or at least among my friend group) do not summon for simple exploration but to fight bosses and seeing as you cannot be invaded mid boss fight we have essentially seen no invasions.The world and dungeons are once again beautifully crafted and if you loved the older games big dungeon design you will feel right at home. The game does suffer however from a few smaller dungeons/caves that are in my opinion poorly designed. You will notice that these smaller dungeons/caves are essentially copy and paste jobs of one another with just a different layout. Some of them are even the exact same layout. There are a few really fun ones that have the most different layouts or require you to do some thinking on how to progress but for the most part the dungeons are quick, easy, and very similar to one another.Enemy and boss designs are once again amazing looking however I still do not understand why they put Margit as one of the first bosses as he is far harder than even some late game bosses.The Horse is fine. It is mostly used for traversal. Mounted combat on horseback is very basic and aside from using the horse to help with fighting the games many Dragons (mostly using it to dodge firebreath attacks when the Dragon flies) it is pretty boring to fight whilst mounted.Overall it is probably one of the best of FromSoftwares games. Is it a masterpiece? No. The devs have improved on nearly every aspect of the series but have taken few risks in innovation and actually doing anything new. I think FromSoftware can do better as this just feels like a souls game but with an open world."
Positive,"very nice, very souls, very ring(to be serious though its a great game and you should definitely play it, I recommend one of the best souls games made)"
Positive,"Great game so far, FromSoft really raised the bar ! 32h while writing this review, i feel i only did 1/3 of the game!There is obviously issues like rare frame drops or no widescreen support but i'm confident it iwll be soon fixed..."
Positive,You simply don't mess with things you don't know :tears:
Positive,I hate loving this game
Positive,"Behold, Greatness.Stuttering issues ahead tarnished one."
Positive,Try fingers but hole
Positive,"Best game ever - Everything's perfect about it. No more words needed. Thank you for another masterpiece, FromSoftware ♥"
Positive,"We all know one of the most difficult and butt-clunching game series of all time is Dark Souls, playing Elden Ring I can confirm that this game is the Dark Souls of the Dark Souls Franchise. Buy It, you wont regret your decision."
Positive,"I've been holding off reviewing Elden Ring because it still has stuttering issues, but I just can't in good conscience not give this game a massive thumbs up. Seriously this might be one of the greatest games I've ever played and that's in spite of its annoying perf issues (that should hopefully get patched some day).I haven't had this much fun exploring an open world in a very long time, perhaps the last game that comes close would be Morrowind many years ago. It's mysterious and rewarding, luring you to every corner with the promise of something new and worthwhile to discover. It also features the pinnacle of Dark Souls combat and RPG mechanics and a challenge level that you should expect from FromSoft by now.It's also a MASSIVE game, and the maintained quality throughout is awe inspiring.Elden Ring sets a new bar for content quantity and quality both.Just please FromSoft, I beg you, fix the stuttering. It'll be a near perfect game if you do this small thing. Do not let it suffer like you left Bloodborne with its loading times and frame pacing problems."
Positive,"this is my first souls game and i am getting my ass beat front, back, left, right, and center but i am having fun. 7/10 until they fix the fps dropsEDIT: 9/10 because fps drops are gone and i am getting the hang of playing this game and i am pretty proud of myself for defeating some bosses at the first try! :DEDIT (2): I am no longer maidenlessEDIT (3): ELDEN RING GAME OF THE YEAR YESSSIRRREDIT (4): Hello again, the DLC is beating my ass front, back, left, right, and center but I am also having lots of fun"
Positive,try finger but hole
Positive,punish me harder daddy
Positive,"No easy mode like assassins creedengine is not UE5no quest log or mini mapno quick time eventsno CGI introthe game is literally unplayable. /sGreatest souls game of all time.  Complete master piece of the genre including elements of DS3 & Sekiro improving and refining.  Its still an old engine but the combat, hit box, timing, animations are next level.Open world and day night cycle easy entry point but hard to master.Id recommend to not reading every boss encounter online and where every item is, enjoy the discovery and learning how to read and react to the bosses first time around; It will greatly increase combat experience and your ability.Minor DX12 Sharder cache issue where it stutters loading a new area.  Apart from that smoothest bug free release of last few years.10/10"
Positive,Fucking hard for a newbie like me but i love it already and plan and getting through the game. Definite Yes game is better than most triple A titles from the last few years in my opinion. Combat is smooth the animations look awesome and for me the style feels very immersive. You can feel that the developers poured there hearts and souls into this project :DUpdate: After completing the game i can say im even more positive about the end result i died a lot but Got Gut in the meantime i freaking love this game.Extra plus point in my opinion * No microtransactions (thank god last few years developers got to gready with that busines model) *Cough Ubisoft Assasins something*Cough* Not to long and not to short if you know what i mean. A fast runthrough is about 30 hours a full playthrough is about 120 - 150 hours * Multiplayer system works Gut in my opinion and you can disable being invaded if you don't want to be. * More than one way to go through Bosses* So many weapons and builds to play with. (love the whips and curved swords)* Melenia Boss fight was super hard but so fullfilling when you kick her fanny* Try Finger But Hole.......... :P
Positive,Mega epic and badass video game. Miyazaki has done it again
Positive,best game i have ever played
Positive,The real Elden ring was the friendships we made along the way
Positive,"This game is definitely my game of the year, this game has huge world and story to tell i think i will need to play more than 100 hours to appreciate it.the PC port is so bad if you have PS5, Xbox Series X buy it there or just wait until they patch things up"
Positive,"Great game, but FPS Drop are real and sometime enemy invisible in front of you.(not the enemy ability).BTW this game is really fun and happy to play."
Positive,"finger but, hole"
Positive,"You don't have the right, O' you don't have the right"
Positive,No Maidens! *Vine Thud*
Positive,"Wonderful game! The graphics are very exceptional and the boss fights are challenging, but not as challenging as dark souls. The open world concept for this game title is a very interesting new look for a dark souls concept. Very well made game, no complaints."
Positive,"So first thing first, yes performance is definitely the big downside currently. Will they fix it and optimize it? Who knows, but I have faith. With that out of the way, asides from the random stutters, I genuinely enjoy the game. I've tried playing other soulsbourne games before, even Demon Souls on the PS5, and the fact is, I can't git gud. I constantly die and having to run through the same area just to die again at the boss was frustrating, enough for me to quit the games and never finish them.What does Elden Ring does different then? Being open world helped a lot. As much as it sounds like a gimmick, it was great that if I was being frustrated with a boss or dungeon, I could just say screw this and progress elsewhere first. That meant I never got tired of playing the game cause I wouldn't be burnt out on the same boss.I've yet to finish the game, it will definitely take a lot more. But am I confident that this will be the first soulsbourne game I ever finish? Yes, I definitely am"
Positive,This game makes me wanna off myself. highly recommend
Positive,You can hug women.
Positive,The open world game she told you to not worry about
Positive,Hieman mukaansa tempaava
Positive,best game since the invention of videogames
Positive,"Elden Rings art style really is something incredible; A feast for my eyes and I can't stop exploring all the unique places in this captivating open world.The combat is extremely satisfying as it offers a large variety of weapons and combat styles - which is why I think it's FromSoftware's most accessible game for Non-Souls players yet.That said, I'm still dying a lot and I absolutely love it. That little spark of joy I feel, after beating the boss which utterly destroyed me the last 50 times, is what keeps me from going hollow."
Positive,"My Pc can't even handle this game but that doesn't stop me to playing this game.Im currently inlove with this game,im a big sucker on soul's game and boy this game just toss me on to the void with artorias. A must buy game despite the current issues on it and if you like getting beaten and exploring vast map with no quest marker. Prithee just buy thy game <3"
Positive,"10/10 Sekiro Soulsborne series game, absolute better than i expected and my expectations were relatively high already.If you enjoy the souls series, you will definitely enjoy this!23NOV2022: Better make sure you vote for Elden Ring >:D"
Positive,No maidens + You don't have the right + Lair ahead + secret path ahead + Try rolling + I can't take this...

Positive,"Amazing game, only issue im having is connection issues when trying to do co op, other than that it's really fun."
Positive,"I like this game,it felt like Among UsIt still feel like Among usAMONG US! AMONG US!"
Positive,"This game is a legitimate 10/10, it is an actual masterpiece and easily my pick for the game of the year.The only hiccups are some performance issues like stuttering, fps drops, inconsistent multiplayer connection and for some players, crashing.These issues have hardly affected MY personal experience and I absolutely recommend it even in its current state."
Positive,It's so good that we always died and come back for more
Positive,honestly not as bad as everyone says it is
Positive,Praise the sun!
Positive,"I played the all of the Soulsborne game, including all of their DLCs as well. While I like the combat, I also appreciate of its somewhat linear gameplay, because it doesn't burden me with choices. Open world games make me nauseate, with so many point of interests on the map that I stopped playing many of them altogether (which includes Assassin's Creed Black Flag, Witcher 3, Ghost of Tsushima). Hence, I prefer games that have few objectives, but we can still explore the branching paths for weapons, equipments, or secret areas.When I first heard that Elden Ring is an open world game, I was truly worried that I won't enjoy it. My fears are:1) lack of direction on where to go so I would be wasting my time wandering around2) too many side quests/points of interest that I will get numb from the myriad of choicesNow that I have played for around 17 hours, all of my fears have disappeared. First of all, From Software made exploring truly rewarding. There aren't checkpoints on your maps, except for Grace (this game's bonfire), the Dungeons, and Ruins. That's it (at least to make it spoiler-free). So your map isn't filled with ""checklist"", but truly genuine spots that you can explore. See a tower from afar? You can go there to enter or climb it. See a ruin that is inaccessible by land? Perhaps there's a way to go there somehow. You see a giant 20 times of your size? Owh yes it will attack you, and you can kill it. Exploring the map is a really fun to do, as you never know what you will encounter. Be it a treasure, a new enemy, a helpful NPC, or a dungeon to explore, there's always something new around the corner. Also, you unlock the double-jumping horse quite early in the game, so you can truly explore anywhere in the map. The only thing that might hinder your progress is the stronger enemy, but most of the time you can just ignore them if you want to explore. The openness of the world makes it easy for newcomers of souls series as well, as if you are stuck with a place or a boss, the game actually encourages you (not directly) to go fight more enemies at other places to level up or getting a better equipment. There are side quests, but there are no indicators of when the quest actually starts or completes. For me, this is good because I don't have to feel bad if I don't do any of the quest. If you are truly a completionist, that it might be good to take note on the side quests that you are currently doing. The combat got more refined, and it seems that the non-melee combatants has more choices for their builds. If you are here for the brutal challenges, do not be worries as it is still there. There are many tools that can make things more manageable as well (not going to spoil it for you, except that coop is always available).For the PC's performances, I didn't have any issues so far. I updated my Geforce driver before starting the game, and it has been relatively smooth all the way (when it does happen, it doesn't hinder my gameplay too much, only minor annoyances). I am using RTX 3060 Ti with Ryzen 7 3700x. There is a lot to talk about Elden Ring, and it is more fun when you have friends that you can share your findings. It is like gaming during childhood all over again. From Software, I truly commend you for making this masterpiece. If you didn't enjoy Soulsborne before, would you enjoy this game now? I truly don't know. But my advice would be, don't be caught up with the hype. Read reviews, watch streams, and then decide on your own. I do feel sad when people complaints that this game is hard. It is! But it also requires your patience do not rush things. The feeling that you get when you triumph over a seemingly impossible boss after dozens of try is something that is hard to explain, but you know when you don't give up.All in all, I would truly recommend trying Elden Ring. Have patience, explore many places, discover exciting things, and leave helpful messages throughout the world. Shoutout to my wife (just got married last October!) for giving me the time and space to enjoy this game. I love you."
Positive,"if you enjoy soulsbourne games, you will love Elden Ring. By far the best game fromsoftware has made yet."
Positive,best game of all time
Positive,"EDIT: after about 40 hours in the game, I would say my earlier gripes are still present but due to the scale and scope of the game otherwise, are far more forgivable and far less foregrounded. A bit of a shame it takes so long to get to that stage but once you do, the game definitely feels better (Story Spoiler Free) So, I’ve played roughly 13 hours altogether and while I’m recommending the game I do have some gripes with it. It’s a good game but it’s not an exceptional game. ProsThe souls formula is done perfectly by FromSoftware as expected. It’s a souls game with a lick of paint, so if you like souls-likes, you’ll like the game. I won’t touch more on this because if you know, you know! The graphics and views are stunning, the areas in which it’s more cramped (souls style) has great world design Co-Op is fun, you can set a password to find a friend and mess around together - it’s been truly fun and doesn’t feel solely dependent on doing boss battles ConsThe open world elements feel tacked on and lazy. I enjoy being able to run away from enemies, but it feels so empty. There are so many parts of the map that are copy and pasted, I’d be sure I had already visited somewhere as I walk in with the same single enemy and same entrance and same boss door mechanic. There are two shacks about 20 seconds away from one another literally copied across. The world has little cohesion, something that sekiro and bloodbourne do well is teleport you somewhere that has a particular feel throughout - a solid vision. Elden Ring is a little mix and match, feeling more like an MMO class system and it not feeling intentional or having any positive bearing on the game. The Co-op element still being gated between sections and still asking to kill the boss of an area doesn’t work in the open world areas. It feels pointless and silly, just make it truly open world Co-op! It would be cooler and a good use of the open world That’s the majority of it and I will add that while I love the rolling sheep, the open world animal enemies feel very MMO also and I can’t decide if I like that LOL"
Positive,"Man I can't say enough, so I'll go in one blast. Game just released, third day playing in a row. Found many things, beat many bosses, got up to some pretty challenging stuff. THIS IS A BLAST. I LOVE IT. Another amazing souls like serie gameWould say more, too busy playing the game"
Positive,"Simply an amazing game. Imagine Dark Souls 3, but a lot better. This isn't a diss at DS3 btw, Elden Ring is just that good."
Positive,"Absolutely stunning game! This is my first souls type game and it has blown my expectations out of the water! I have not experienced any of the frame rate issues that have been discussed but it seems that the issue will be solved promptly for those individuals. Getting back into the content, the best open world game that i have played to date. Not for the faint-hearted, this game will beat you into the dirt if you are not careful. Getting 1 shot by a boss at 1 hp is something that you will become familiar with. That being said, it keeps you on your toes and makes it so much more rewarding when you finally suck the soul out of that boss that you have attempted to vanquish 50 times over. This will be GOTY with no doubt in my mind."

Positive,"With my mid range pc build, I have had no stuttering issues no weird bugs/glitches and a constant 40+ fps at the Max presetmy specs being GTX 1650S and a Ryzen 5 3500 (with 16GB RAM)both GPU and Processor slightly overclockedI personally did see some bugs at my friend's house on his pc where the NPCs and Torrent would disappear, but they were there so when riding torrent it would seem like the character was floating and the hostile NPCs could still attack you but apart from that no other bugs. It's weird to see people complaining about bugs with their RTX 30 series builds because I have had literally ZERO  issues, maybe the game is unstable on newer hardware?I would be very surprised if FromSoftware doesn't fix all of this in the next two weeks or so, sad to see a shaky launch, but still would recommend, this game is amazing and all my expectations were met."
Positive,"NOTE: This game needs a pretty beefy pc at least in its current state, maybe once they optimize it better it will not stutter for those that have a gpu bellow the 2000 series. Review:Besides some bad PC optimization, some stutters which seem to only occur at the worst possible moment, this game is what I would consider a beautiful byproduct had Zelda Breath of the Wild and Dark Souls 3 spent a night in an Inn while it was raining outside. It has both open world, and in this case not the empty EA/Ubisoft kind where exploring will actually reward you. I cant count the number of times I have been to some god forsaken corner of the map and I actually found some hidden loot there. Meanwhile, it also presents the players will challenges like the bosses are significantly harder than those in Dark Souls 3. I am as of right now only 20hrs in and the ending is nowhere in site, honestly I don't even want to see it. This game has been hands down the best game I have played in the last five years. Do note I am a MASSIVE Dark Souls fan boy so I may have some bias because of that. I would definitely recommend it for anyone who love DS and exploration game!"
Positive,this game is absolutely amazing
Positive,in a way it feels like I'm playing OoT again for the first time with how it feels to go exploring and getting my ass kicked. I'm also high and drunk. Lets gooo!
Positive,"Best ""Dark Souls"" style game that FromSoft has put out. Outside of Microstutters loading into each area I havent had any issues. Just make sure you a decently spec'ed PC and it will run fine. Otherwise pick it up on console."
Positive,"--Spoiler Free Review-Going to get the negatives outta the way.This game at the time of this review, has performance issues, stuttering, freezing, stuck on loading screens, etc. For me, stuttering occurs somewhat here and there, but every PC is different so you can across different issues.If you're thinking about buying it, I suggest you wait until they fix the performance issues. But if you do not mind performance issues, you should try this game.This arguably is the best game fromsofrware has made. I am 30 hours in but I have been exploring the open world and theres plenty of things to do. This game very much encourages exploration and rewards you for it, I even just was exploring and just stumbled upon a main boss on accident without even trying to find it. Combat is pretty satisfying as expected from a souls game. If you do not really explore, you can probably beat it in 30 hours, but if you explore like me. It can take a long time to beat, i have not finished it yet."

Positive,"Well, I was wrong. I think this might be the greatest game of all time. I'll leave my former negative review below. I dunno, I guess coming from the previous FS games, I assumed I was supposed to go fight the first major boss in Stormveil and then tool up later. I just had it backwards. Ah well, once I got my head around what I was supposed to do, I see it for the monumental achievement it really is. FORMER NEGATIVE REVIEW: This game is so popular right now I'm going to get shredded and told to git gud. That's fair. See, the thing is, in the first 3 DS games, I had fun gitting gud. Exploring around in the overworld and finding things is really fun, and that's where the game shines. But the bosses, to me, are just not fun to fight and that's what DS has always been about. The horse bosses give a taste of the kite-medicine that we've been dishing out for years. That'd be a neat concept here, except it sucks to play against. The first greater boss was harder to beat for me than ANY DS boss in the first three games. (Did NOT play DLC areas, but did all optionals. I'm lookin' at you, Nameless King). And the first boss sucked to fight against. His second phase has no discernible damage windows that I could find, had to summon ghosts and kind of get lucky to beat at level 22. If that's the first boss, what are the rest like?  Look, I'm sure there are specific ways to play that would help. But all this game did was make me want to reinstall DS3. Listen, flame me all you want, I just didn't have much fun here, and there are too many great games in my backlog to spend any more time on this one."
Positive,This game has very rich content. also has bunch of enhancement from previous Fromsoftware products. I think Elden Ring would be the best game of 2022. I love it. thanks all developers' effort

This game never feels unfair and I love the challenging fights and invasion's.I also love the kind of storytelling presented here, putting together the story myself based on the lore in game was extremely satisfying and fun."
Positive,GAME OF THE YEAR 2022!
Positive,"As a new player to the Souls games, this game was SO FRUSTRATING at the beginning. Until 30-40 hours in i barely enjoyed it. After that point tho i had become really strong and the feeling of RAaPING those bastardsss that killed me and bullied me over n' over was SO satisfying. I became addicted before i knew it. Personally i dont like the whole concept of 'no markers and no instructions'. I mean 90%+ of people will just watch it online so why not just put some basic details in the game about the missions. Actually felt like lazy writing. Also the story felt a bit shallow and there is no reward ending for Saving Melina and removing the curse. This game has WAY too many things that i dislike but it was so beautiful that i couldnt drop it. If you are looking for a chill game dont buy this one. If you have time to spare then this is the game for you."

Positive,John Dark Souls' big day out
Positive,"holy fuck this game is awesome, and ive never even played a souls game"
Positive,its a mastapiece
Positive,"This game is exactly what I EXPECTED IT TO BE! For me atleast, its an absolute masterpiece of a game, and has  me hooked. I dont think I'll play anything else for awhile unless maybe a friend asks to. I do understand that this isnt the case for most people because its ""not very PC compatible"" and theres frame drops but honestly this has not been a problem for me at all (Running game on 1660 super with 50-60 frames) and ive only had to deal with a huge lag spike in a dungeon boss and pvp and a little jittery now and then (probably just my internet) I havent gotten this white screen problem at all and i only know of one friend who has had his game crash but even then it didn't really bother him. I do hope that people will take down the negative reviews for the game once whatever needs to be fixed is fixed because the gameplay and story are absolutley game of the year worthy or even decade unless another company drops some heat."
Positive,"EDIT AFTER BEATING WITH 70HRS:  Review still holds. Amazing game with beautifully written, detailed, and exploratory lore. Bosses felt fresh from previous Souls games and definitely had some bs movesets from time to time, but once you understand and conquer, it is very rewarding. A few bosses are fairly repetitive over the course of the entire game, but it is such a massive world that it is hard to fault From for that. Excited to move onto NG+ and beyond.This is pinnacle gaming. Went into this game blind and it captures the same feelings of awe, wonder, and frustration Dark Souls 1 had on younger me. Beautiful world, great combat, exploration is executed perfectly, customization beyond belief, and much more. I'm very excited to continue exploring the Lands Between.The only negative is the performance issues currently, but they have only occurred during exploration for me and not during any big fights/bosses, so it is a minor gripe at this time. 11/10"
Positive,"Gameplay:It feels like a extended version of DS3, just like you would expect from the trailers. The combat feels just like dark souls 3 with just a few minor changes. It offers so much space to explore, optional bosses and areas, as well as a more balanced version of magic than in the last dark souls games. The bosses I have encountered yet were unique and offered a good mild to good challenge, depending on the type of boss.The RIDING COMBAT feels way better then expected. It fits really great into the whole, makes traveling easier, faster and much more fun.Technical:I was affraid to buy this game at first after I saw so many reviews reporting the game to lag even on high end computers.BUT I didn't encounter a single lag, great frame drop, game crash or what ever during my game. Since I dont even meet the recommended specs I feel like most of the players that reach the minimal requirements will be able to enjoy Elden Ring if they can accept to not always run on 60 FPS and low graphics.My Setup:Ryzen 5 5600GNvidea GTX 1060 6GB16 GB RAM |  213 MHzAnd I play on 2k resolution with medium settings and still run constantly on 50-60 FPS!"
Positive,This game makes me smile :)
Positive,"W + Have Maiden + Chock full of luck + Protagonist + Fully Engaged with the Strength of RunesBeat the game at 89 hours, best Fromsoft game to date for sure."
Positive,"Thank you Miyazaki, mf delivered"
Positive,yeah there are some frame drops but i don't think it will hold back the amazing experience you will have
Positive,"Easily getting 60fps with RX570(which is below the recommended gpu) & Ryzen 5 3600, idk why these clowns are giving negative reviews."
Positive,Try Finger. But Hole
Positive,"I can see the reason why some people are upset about issues with the performance, but for me, as a more casual player, I had no hard feelings towards some slight, milliseconds long framerate drops during my first few hours of playing (reminded me of the original DS on PS3). If you want to be ""the world's first"", yes, I can see how it can be a nuisance, but it's a beautiful and working game with an interesting and compelling world to explore, and no game or immersion breaking issues - for me at least. I bet some are having more intensive problems than me, but I didn't see any reason for such hate myself. It's a great game and despite some issues, most games are a lot more broken at release than this one. I'm having a great time.Keyboard bindings and other such PC related issues could be patched, though. Not a fan of controllers, but had to buy one just for From games ;)"
Positive,This game is Awesome it plays like dark souls but in a open world style. pepole are complaining about stutters but the worse i had was the game crashing once(and if you say its because i have a good pc you would be wrong mine is a $1000 pc and it runs stuff just fine ). and for difficulty its fine i have 60 hours on DS3 and i am still bad at it but in this game it feels a lot easier (besides the main bosses that talk they are hard to fight). if you are having problems with the game check if you have the right stuff to run it. i see people complain its not new player friendly but there are tutorials as you play that are very helpful so just get good. i am looking forward to play more.

Positive,don't get me wrong I love this game but the crashes and random zone stutter is unnaceptable If this doesn't hotfixed oficially I will commit not feeling soo good
Positive,Its still just so good
Positive,"There are no words that can describe the experience of playing this game. If you really want to do or play something amazing, play this. It is excellent in everything."
Positive,"Despite the crippling of my graphics card, it's a really good game despite me being someone who is notoriously bad at souls-like games. The game looks really good right off of the bat and once they fix the frames it's game over for my schedule"
Positive,"performance is a hit or miss, many people are complaining having a good PC and not having good perfomance.I have a RTX 2060 , i7-7700k and 16GB RAM, and the game runs fine on high settings, except for random stutters (which also happens in low settings).Pros:- the size of the world (imo this game is CHEAP for the amount of content and quality it has)- builds- equipment variety and appearance- sightseeing- progression - bosses- combat, maybe like DkS3, but with less R1 spam and more items and weapon skills- lore and quests- feels very familiar compared to Miyazaki's soulsbornes, if you played those, you'll feel at home, while still encountering new challenges and mechanics- respeccing a character is easy and can be redone an infinite amount of times 18 times per NG/playthrough, you can also rename and remake the appearance of the character for free, so you don't have to create another character if you want to change your build- my first playthrough was 270 hours long :^) I explored every area and missed a few NPC questsCons: (mostly nitpicking)- input lag, input buffer and input decision (when you attack and then buffer a ""twohanding"", an attack will come out if you let go of Y button)- there's too many actions for a few buttons in the gamepad, sometimes you may be unable to change shield/weapon because there's 2 interactables at your feet- frequent stutters (likely related to multiplayer)- multiplayer connection is rather unstable- a few enemies are too hard to deal with (yes I'm talking about dragonbarrow's bear) I guess I got gud... a bit- the world is huge but there's a limit of 10 messages per character- missable dialogue options on graces (bonfires), they need to be highlighted, I've went through entire areas without looking at the list of options and have missed important dialogues. (""fixed"" in an update)- recycled bosses, enemies, and dungeon structures (I don't see it as a problem personally, given the size of the game)- lacks PvP arenas (or I haven't unlocked it yet?) (hopefully coming in a DLC) colosseum update lets goooooooooo- there's so much content/quests that you have to note it down so you don't forget what you should do, there should be some kind of note system in the game, or the easier way: quest tracker (yuck).- map needs more and better markers, why is there a limit, and why can't you highlight/search for specific markers? or even name the markers? The npc names update was a step in the right direction- item sorting is a hidden mechanic lol- you can't order your spells, only add and remove them, come on FROM, this is 2022- late game bosses are boring and random, even if you get 60 VIT you can stil get one shot by combos bosses do. It kinda forces you to use Spirit Ashes. I must try another playthrough to use properly the throwable items and buffs, though they are very boring to use that seems to be the necessary edge to get through hard(er) stuff.- dual wielding jump R2 is OP, it deals more damage, staggers more, and recovers faster and uses less stamina than standing R2, why?"
Positive,"I think the game is fantastic. I am a long time Souls fan, and I feel like it has surpassed all of my expectations. I think everyone complaining about small PC issues needs to understand that there are tons of hardware builds and combinations that will bring out unexpected bugs and issues that need attention, and I believe From Soft is working hard on solving every issue that is being criticized. Personally, I have had none of the issues I have been reading about, and I do not have state of the art hardware. All in all, I would still recommend the game for any Dark Souls genre fan. The open world, crouch/sneaking, and jumping mechanics are all awesome additions, not to mention the beautiful fantasy artwork and atmosphere.  I'm loving it!"
Positive,"Truly a beautiful game. The world is so deadly and magnificent all at once. The enemies are all unique, and the fighting styles displayed are eloquent. Every boss is a treat to fight, and the variety in them and the dungeons/areas they reside in are truly a treat to behold. PC launch issues aside, it has lived up to what it was meant to be.The combat is fluent, and the different special abilities you can apply to different weapon types really bring out one's playstyle. Each enemy provides a unique pattern and challenge, while each different area does the same. Some areas feel easy, while others provide frustration in difficulty.On that note, you can always go somewhere else, anywhere else...whenever you want. You find anything from death to beautiful treasure and sometimes both intertwined in a beautiful dance of craftsmanship. I could say more...but just try it yourself.TLDR; Launch issues aside, it's a beautiful game well worth the praise with some wonderful changes to the Souls-Like formula we know and love."
Positive,Great game. Everything I wanted and more!
Positive,Could this be a review?
Positive,Es ist wie jedes andere Souls Like von FromSoftware ein Meisterwerk! Dieses mal ist es sogar noch anspruchsvoller und nerven aufreibender! Ich persönlich finde das dieses Spiel jeden Cent wert war.
Positive,Oh my god... boat guy is back! 10/10
Positive,"Flawless Game!Every aspect of this game is nailed down perfectly, combat, graphics, story, everything!"
Positive,The horse is cute.
Positive,dark souls but open world
Positive,"No other game manages to enchant you into its world quite like Elden Ring.If you're looking for a sense of adventure and discovery, this game does it best.On top of that, you get robust RPG and combat systems that make almost every encounter very rewarding."
Positive,"Game came to correct the few flaws still apparent on ds3, which were not being able to jump or crouch, plus the enormous mob rush you had to do before some bosses with the new marika statues, as well as introducing a whole new world and a shitton new stuff, yes we are aware game is horribly optimized but tbh I streamed it with a gtx 1070 + ryzen 6 3600x (no OC) at 1080p60fps and the game did stutter but it wasnt that much, still, if you need to improve your experience check what could be slowing the overall performance, slower cpu, downgrade or turn off any setting that manages shadows, lightning and reflections, if its the gpu every other setting pretty much, and honestly stop it with the whining, yes it is poorly optimized but the fact you are trying to play on a 750ti honestly is a problem in itself as well (no sht check discussions there are people complaining with these cards and similar)"
Positive,sofrer é bom
Positive,It took me 10 hours to defeat the first boss.but i am having a great time. :)10/10 would recommend it.
Positive,ds3  is easier
Positive,"Compare the difficulty to my life, this game is still too easy."
Positive,"Absolutely unreal. The fantasy game the world has been waiting for, thank you FromSoft <3 <3"
Positive,the ultimate dark souls

Positive,"Game is definitely good and fun, but it suffers from a bit of performance issues. So far I enjoyed the crafting system and the open world aspect to this game, because it's honestly a breathe of fresh for a souls game. Going to dungeons and exploring the environment is very enjoyable. I'm looking forward to 100% this game soon."
Positive,"I left my review at 4.8 hours. My opinion of it has only grown. I love this game, certainly it's one of my favorite I've ever played. At this point, I only have 3 major complaints.1. EAC is garbage and deserves the dumpster.2. Voice acting is very poorly recorded. There's no sense of placement when NPCs speak in Elden Ring, they always sound like they're speaking directly in and next to your ear. When Godfrey phase changes and shouts ""Now I fight as Horah Loux, warrior!"", it's painfully obvious the VA is whisper-yelling; you can hear whisper-yelling from a lot of VAs in Elden Ring. Mohg has a egregiously under-committed VA performance. As these issues persist across many NPCs, I must assume it's a direction problem, not a VA problem. There are many examples of VAs delivering great lines, so they're clearly talented. Someone should have told them to actually yell. Someone else should have made these performances feel like they're in the game world.3. In my first review, I said PvP sucked. I still feel the same. You can't choose whether you're invading a solo or a multiplayer game, and that creates a very toxic system. I haven't tried the colosseum yet, that might have helped."
Positive,"beyond the performance issues which they have already said they are working on fixing, i have very few problems with this game so far.easily the best feeling combat in the entire Soulsbornekiring series, and only 10 hours in i've already seen some of the most breathtaking environments i've ever seen in a game. also unlike the rest of the series you can make a custom character that actually looks human, and you can even re-customize them from scratch whenever you want.edit after 75 hours (not finished yet): boss reuse is disappointing and there is a lot of imbalance in both pvp and pve. but nothing that makes me upset or anything. i'd rather fight the same-ish boss like 8 times than fight it once and have 7 less bosses. game is still stellar and patches have already fixed quite a few problems. performance assuredly still leaves something to be desirededit again much later and after finishing the game: the game runs really well for me now and i agree with everything else i said still"

Positive,"So far has been the perfect blend of difficulty and rewarding play, the npcs really fill up the massive open world  with plenty of quests and stories to do. Although I experienced some fps lag at first, after changing to medium settings it ran perfectly with only few frame drops."
Positive,Too busy playing the game to write a more detailed review but its really good. The game is so good in fact that I don't want to waste any more of my time writing this review and I just want to get back to it. It may just be the game of all time.
Positive,Big dark souls and it's great(not personally experiencing bugs or major frame drops sorry for those who are)
Positive,Send help. Can't stop playing this game.
Positive,"One of the greatest games of all time. A amazing open world game that rewards exploration combined with deep combat mechanics. The most accessible Souls game to date which means more newcomers which is mostly a plus. A great looking game thanks to its art direction. We also now have a dedicated jump button and a mount, and it’s basically open world Dark Souls. Most of the shardbearer boss fights is Fromsoftware at their very best when it comes to bosses but this game's greatest strength is without a doubt is its exploration.This game will make you feel like you are in an adventure in an unforgiving land full of mysteries to discover and interesting characters to meet which is such an amazing experience.Unfortunately, this game is not perfect. At first, I thought that this game was Fromsoft's greatest work yet but after many months of playing this game, my opinion has changed a bit. This game is what I would call a flawed masterpiece, it has a lot of innovation but also a lot problems. In my opinion, Fromsoftware is at their best when they try to experiment with the ""Souls"" formula which is why I still consider Bloodborne and Sekiro as better games than Elden Ring. As an open world game, this is, in my opinion, the best one yet but as a Souls game, it's not my favorite. My opinion might still change after they release the DLC since that's usually the high point of their games. All in all, this is still a great game and my GOTY, I'll give this game a 9.5/10. A flawed masterpiece but a masterpiece nonetheless, this game have set the bar high for open world games to follow. Can’t wait for the DLCsPros:Greatest open world yetRewards explorationFlawless Art DirectionTop-tier Boss fights (mostly the Shardbearers)Great Level DesignGreat AtmosphereInteresting NPCs and Side QuestsGreat Story and LoreGreat Voice ActingGreat SoundtrackAmazing GraphicsDeep Combat mechanics (ashes of war)Probably the best mount in any game ever since it doesn't try to be realistic which makes traversing and fighting with Torrent actually fun.Spirit Ashes (summons)Stakes of Marika (respawn point before a boss or a dangerous area)PVP balancing is still a work in a progress but we are getting to the point where it's fun now.Cons:Balancing issues especially in the late game.The game definitely overstayed its welcome.There are enemies in this game that are too aggressive and gives almost no openings to the point of it becoming annoying and just not fun.Technical issues on launch, being the stuttering and fps drops on PC which has already been fixed from my end at least.A ton of reused bosses (the worst being the duo boss fights).Side dungeons could use a bit more creativity rather than just having bosses at the end all the time.A few bugs at release which is to be expected on an open world game.The final boss (the space slug) is extremely disappointing and just outright annoying which is a surprise since Fromsoft's track record for their final bosses are usually great."

Positive,"This game is a tricky one for me. First of all: I am a big From Software Fan and have played through every game of them multiple times since Dark Souls PTDE. I loved every entry and it's uniqueness, yes even Dark Souls 2 but after putting countless hours into Elden Ring I did not feel the same satisfaction I got from the other From Soft games. It's great don't get me wrong but it's not my favorite, not remotely close. I think the open world style exhausted me in the last years by other publishers. From Soft did great and created the most immersive open world but that's not what I wanted. They did open worlds before (kinda) but they were smaller and every area felt unique and exciting. I didn't get the same satisfaction here. Entering each dungeon was fun and all bosses are great but exploring half of the open world was'nt my thing. I don't even know if my opinion changes over time but right now I am a bit confused to  where to put this game. Surely I will play the DLCs but I would prefer if they didn't do an Elden Ring 2 after this. A new take on the Sekiro or Bloodborne formula or something completely new would be more exciting imo.There were rumors that this game was called Dark Souls 4 early in development and that they changed it after GRRM entered. If that's true I am really glad that they did that because it wouldn't have fitted.All in all this sounds really bad but this game is still better than 99% of games you will see but it's my least favorite From Game with DS2."

Positive,"A marvelously expansive, deep, and satisfying open world dark fantasy RPG. The tone, fleshed out with the help of George R. R. Martin, is very dark indeed. If we compare it to Breath of the Wild, then it's like Hyrule ... but if Ganon won. I've experienced so many moments of awe, delight, and sheer terror.It features an approach and emphasis that is markedly different from other such games in the genre in ways that can be refreshing but also disappointing. Mainly, don't expect epic quests or significant NPC interactions. There are a few side quests but they are obscure, shallow, and very fragile. Forget about progressing through them without a wiki: easily the worst designed quests I have ever experienced in an RPG. The Witcher this is not. The story, likewise, is barely there. But the weakness of quests is eclipsed by the strength of character progression, loot, combat, and magic systems, which are all very deep and reveal an obsessive care for detail and balance that FromSoftware has been iterating on for years.In a way the marginalization of quests can be a good thing. The lack of ""quest objectives"" on the map makes Elden Ring feel like a true sandbox in which you can go in any direction, explore, experiment, and carve your own path. This freedom extends to your character build, loot selection, and even and especially combat strategies. It's not ""cheesing"" when you find a way to use the environment against an enemy's weakness: it's you being clever and one of the intended ways to play the game. Discover your own personal choreography for this challenging dance. In its openness Elden Ring is again more like Breath of the Wild and less like those Ubisoft quest-marker grind-fests.The game is also quite different in how it establishes stakes, i.e. the balance of risk and reward. So much has been said about soulsborne games being extremely difficult, but actually here the exact level of difficulty comes with a lot of wiggle room. Players for the most part don't have to tackle any enemy they don't want to tackle, at least not until they feel ready. There's always so much other stuff to do. In most cases you can ride past any enemy, and anyway the vast majority of them are entirely optional. Look up their loot online and decide for yourself if it's worth the challenge.So, yeah, you famously die a lot. It's intentional, intrinsic to the game loop, and embedded in the lore of the world itself. Death is for you to learn and practice. In fact the game's first major enemy is intentionally way out of your league when you start, quite a shocking way to teach you that lesson. That's not to say that this conceit can't be frustrating. Save points are usually conveniently close to big challenges and reloading is fairly quick, but sometimes they are deliberately distant, an incredibly petty way to punish you for failure. More frustrating is that the price of death can be that you lose your progress because you drop all your accumulated XP when you die. If you can grab it before you die again, great, but this is a game in which a lowly rat can kill a level 100 character and a wrong move and send you falling off a cliff. Strategizing around this risk causes constant anxiety. If you have a lot of XP but not enough to level up, what should you do? Risk losing it all by exploring? Or go ""farm"" XP by grinding easy enemies until you can level up? Of course many level-based RPGs have this problem, but it's very pervasive here.And then it must be said: Elden Ring is a technical disaster, at least on PC. Do you prefer to play single-player, like me? You still need to be online to play (!!!). You are still capped at 60 FPS because of multi-player fairness, even if your PC can do much more (!!!). Only you'll wish it were really 60 FPS because you'll have major frame drops no matter how powerful your PC is (!!!). Those drops are really fun when they happen during a stressful boss fight... not. All of these would be dealbreakers if everything else weren't so awesome. And then there's the usual bugginess that we've come to expect from big titles: enemies that can attack through walls, a camera that sometimes does not cooperate, finicky 3D platforming, etc.My last big complaint is that the game does a miserable job with teaching itself. There's simply no way I could have understood and played it without the help of tutorials and guides from the community, especially as a FromSoftware noob. The convoluted menu UI also doesn't help. This is not an ""install and play"" game. It demands research.But enough complaining! Ride your ghost horse around its faults and Elden Ring is an utterly gripping and vast experience. The superbly designed world begs exploration, which is almost always rewarded (except when your curiosity breaks a quest, like it did for me), and is crammed with diverse content and virtually no filler.It's rare that I want to replay games, especially as big as this one. But I'm just itching to one day try to tackle every enemy again with a different build (I focused on dexterity and basically no magic) and find a new way to dance."

Positive,"Compared to previous titles, Elden Ring is more accessible game with its open world and gameplay variety that appeals to more people. Although it repeats a little after the first 30/40 hours, the glorious and rich content of the open world will make you forget it. Despite the boss designs are not very catchy and sometimes a bit repetitive, there are really great and challenging bosses as well. Once you got the Mimic Tear Ashes you are not in danger, you are the danger! Simple as that. All hail Miyazaki- San."
Positive,"what the hell guys? A dev team finally releases a game properly, better than any have in so many years and you guys are complaining about meaningless stuff? This game is absolutley AMAZING so far, ignore these dumb negative reviews, they've never played a souls game."
Positive,"With 97 hours into the game as of this post (there will be much more to come), and 100% of achievements obtained, I think it's finally time to write a review. This game is amazing, but it's not perfect. I have some very real gripes with the game that I cannot let go of, but they only barely scratch the mountain of great things this game improves on. To avoid being like every other review, I'm gonna start with my gripes.First off, the boss design in this game is hit or miss. Some bosses are cool mechanically and fun to fight, some of them are challenging and feel great to finally overcome. But a few of them are straight up terrible, and the only reason I felt like I finally killed them was because I got lucky. Melania has to be one of the worst designed Soulsgame bosses I've ever fought. Her multi-slash onslaught has no counter except to reset and go again. There's no outrunning it, there's no parrying it, there's no blocking it, there's no dodging it, there's no flinching her out of it. You kill her before she does it, or hope she uses it on your summon. That has to be one of the worst designed mechanics I've ever heard of. Outside of Melania, there's some other bosses I had annoyances with, like Godfrey the Grafted. He's not so bad because you're not meant to fight him being as weak as I was when I fought him, but the fact that some of his attacks have no windup and are guaranteed to stunlock you is kinda silly design, you can get out of this one but to dodge it you have to be out of range before he even starts the attack. It feels bad to be down to your last flask, with a sliver of health, because you know there's no ""just play like a god and I'll get through this"", no, it's just over, die and go again because at any point he'll start that attack and kill you. Some other bosses I felt like had a similar issue but not as badly and not as punishing, like Crucible Knights felt like shit to fight but you can just git gud and adopt different playstyles for a short while to get them out of the way and move on.My next issue is with the story. I actually skipped the story cinematic because I had assumed all of that would be in the game itself, but after beating the game, and reading as many item descriptions as I could to absorb the lore, I still had a ton of questions left. I started reading more online and realized that there was some story that I never found ingame that everybody else seemed to know. My friend then made me aware of the story cinematic, which clarified a lot of questions I had. Which is kinda weird to me, why is there a ton of story info not present in the game at all, and can only be obtained from a pre-release story trailer?After all of that, my only annoyances left are very minor things. Early into the game when I was still playing this game like it was any other Souls game, I kept feeling like individual areas felt very empty. I was used to the way in Dark Souls that every single corner you turned had some kind of item or thing you could discover. But in this game, you turn a corner and find a message from another player going ""could this be an item?"" Lmao. Over time, I adapted and stopped exploring the open areas less and only focused on that kind of exploration when I was in the smaller areas like the cities or castles. There's also the performance issues but I hope those get ironed out over time.Well what did I like about the game? Fuck dude, there's so much as a longtime Soulsgame fan. It feels like there were so many major improvements. Weapon diversity is fucking amazing, and the arts of war was a fantastic addition. The ash summons are awesome, and I could not live without them. Torrent did not feel like it was just an afterthought to make traversing the world better, on the contrary, horseback battles feel amazing and controlling the horse is very smooth, I could do horse parkour for hours. The world is absolutely MASSIVE, and every new area blew my mind. Discovering each new area in the underground actually had me going ""WOW"" for hours. The world is absolutely beautiful and even with my graphics cranked down to medium to save performance, I was sometimes staring at the distance for periods of time just to take in the view. The diversity of each area is insane, which will let me forgive Miyazaki for adding multiple swamps into the game.This game is amazing, and you should play it. Now."
Positive,"As someone who has tried both Dark Souls 1 and 3.. This is the first time I feel as if I can venture forth into the world and try out new things without brutal punishment every single time. If anything, failing against bosses in Elden Ring has made me want to throw myself back at them and try again. I'm not sure what mixed the formula up enough for me, perhaps it's the exploration aspect and the fact I can find something cool to tell my friends about but I definitely recommend it if you're interested in the series but found the previous entries too difficult.Playing a sorcerer build I feel *powerful* and when I team up with companions we get things done. Game looks good, I've experienced a couple of glitches and crashes but honestly, if I'm enjoying the rest of the game this much I just can't imagine docking it and saying it's bad for some minor frustrations. All in all, good fun game. Glad I committed to buying it."
Positive,"Elden ring is a spectacular game, especially the cinematics of the game.Radhan has been nerfed.Malenia is one of the most difficult bosses to defeat and you will have no escape with her.Godfrey is one of the bosses that I liked a lot and if he sees you he makes you pressing catch.Although the optimization of the game is wrong, but I hope they fix it.The game is 10/10"
Positive,Easily best game of the year. My first souls game but i played this non stop until i got all the achievements
Positive,I want to experience this game for the first time again.
Positive,"You wouldn't think open world Dark Souls would work (and it probably wouldn't if anybody but FromSoftware tried to design it), but man. This is how to do an open world game. Basically Dark Souls 4 with hints of Bloodborne sprinkled on top. A lot of the negative reviews are because of terrible PC performance, but the most recent patch made a pretty huge difference."
Positive,"This game is bigger and more incredible than I could have possibly imagined. Sure, there are some technical issues that need to be ironed out, but these issues haven't ruined my experience with the game so far. I highly recommend that you play this game. It was well worth the wait."
Positive,"Officially one of my favorite souls-likes, the gameplay is phenomenal, there are a plethora of builds and endings, and the replay-ability is off the charts! Highly recommend to souls-like lovers. I cannot gush enough about this game, it was one of my first souls-likes and still one of my favorites after playing over a dozen. It is a pretty good starter souls-like as the tutorials were helpful, the game was pretty easy and beginner friendly, and the world fascinating enough to reel you in. Highly recommend!"
Positive,"Dark Souls IV with a new fresh trademark and a lazy fat writer supporting it for promotional purposes. Not a bad game, yet not the epitome of creativity that the first Dark Souls was.It's a vast world the one they give us to explore, sometimes filled with beauty, sometimes tainted by misery and dread. This contrast is nothing new and is perfectly implemented in every From Software software.I'll say that the main drawback is the repeating enemies present in different parts of the world, seems like they ran out of time or manpower to design new ones for such a large world, they just changed the stats of them in order to recycle.With that being said, the Souls hierarchy stays like this:Dark Souls > Dark Souls III > Elden Ring > [Blasphemous | Mortal Shell | Many other good clones] > Dark Souls II"
Positive,"FromSoft hooked me again. I'm over 90 hours into my first playthrough and I can't get enough of this game.  The exploration. The surprises.  The massive world.  The gear. The lore. The pain. The suffering. The frustration. The amazing feeling of completion. This game will eventually be on top of my hours played list.  I have a pretty beefy PC and had very few issues. Almost no glitches and lag on my PC.  I did notice some of the other PCs in my house lag and cause some play issues. Once FromSoft gets a handle on that, it will be a great ride for everyone. I don't pay full price for many games.  Elden Ring has been worth every cent.  This has to be one of my favorite games of all time.  Shocked if this doesn't take home GOTY."
Positive,"Never forget !!! 25/02/2022 !!!Elden Ring is a groundbreaking masterpiece and simply brilliant in more ways than I could have ever expected.10/10 - Combat & GameplayElden Ring nails the hallmark of FromSoftware’s combat, delivering tight, responsive, and brutally satisfying mechanics. Whether you're facing off against hulking bosses or smaller foes, the fluidity of the gameplay keeps you constantly engaged.10/10 - Diversity of Builds and PlaystylesThis is where Elden Ring truly shines. Unlike Sekiro, which I enjoyed but felt constrained by its lack of build variety, Elden Ring offers an incredible range of customization options. The sheer diversity in how you can play, from magic builds to melee-focused characters, adds immense replayability. It’s this flexibility that elevates Elden Ring far beyond Sekiro in terms of personal preference.8/10 - MusicThe soundtrack is nothing short of epic, on par with legendary franchises like Final Fantasy. Every piece of the soundtrack is meticulously crafted to seamlessly complement the different atmospheres and battles. My only gripe is with how the music transitions in certain situations. Sometimes a minor enemy triggers dramatic combat music, creating an unnecessary sense of tension for what is ultimately a trivial encounter. Still, the musical quality itself is stellar.9/10 - StoryFromSoftware’s storytelling has always been subtle, but this time, it’s on a whole new level. While lore was never the primary hook in past titles, Elden Ring pushes its narrative and side quests to new heights. The world-building is rich, and the characters and events are compelling, making it far more engaging than previous FromSoft games.10/10 - Open WorldI was initially worried that Elden Ring would follow the typical open-world formula, but my concerns vanished quickly. This is FromSoftware’s first attempt at an open world, and it’s flawless. The exploration feels like a true adventure, where discovery isn’t handed to you via a cluttered UI or constant markers. The thrill of not knowing what’s around the corner makes every moment feel magical. I usually chase achievements, but during my first playthrough, I was too captivated by the journey itself to care. This world drew me in completely, and it never let go.6/10 - PerformanceUnfortunately, Elden Ring had a rocky start on PC. Stuttering and frame drops plagued certain areas, most notably Stormhill in Limgrave. Even high-end GPUs like the RTX 3080 Ti and 3090 struggled, which frustrated me early on. Despite these issues, the overall experience smoothed out as I progressed, and the technical hiccups became less frequent. Still, it's a shame that performance marred an otherwise perfect game for some players.ConclusionWho would've thought that Hidetaka Miyazaki and FromSoftware could create an open-world Dark Souls without it feeling bloated or repetitive? I’m so relieved they avoided the formulaic trap of Ubisoft-style open worlds. Elden Ring is a masterpiece that stands apart from the annual rehashes of other franchises, offering an experience that feels fresh and expansive.Finally, I’m still in awe of the sheer scope of the game. FromSoftware released Dark Souls III in March 2016, followed by Sekiro in March 2019, and then Elden Ring in 2022. It’s mind-boggling how much content they packed into just three years of development. This game feels like it contains the content of multiple Dark Souls sequels rolled into one. Truly an achievement.Thank you, FromSoftware, for creating this unforgettable experience. I still can't believe how extraordinary Elden Ring is.THX <3"
Positive,"I was on the fence about buying Elden Ring at first purely because of the recent launch issues big hype games have been having. I have played DS1-3 and Sekiro (unfortunately haven't gotten around to Bloodbourne yet) so I was holding this game up to the standards of previous works of art by FromSoftware. Well... this game has not only lived up to my expectations, but has by far exceeded them! This game is a true masterpiece. Adding open world had me concerned at first because I didn't want to run around for hours on end just to get from place to place... but what did they do? They added a mount and fast travel. Then I was concerned that adding things like this would lose the typical FromSoftware dungeony feel... but nope! The mix of open-world and linear path learning like previous DS games is just *chef's kiss* perfect. I hear a lot of people complaining about performance issues on PC and framerate drop. I have a GTX 1060 right now and only experience the VERY minor FPS drop (very minimal and hardly noticeable), but I grew up playing DS3 on day 1 Xbox One so I am used to DS games with like 40 FPS max, so 50-60 is a nice step up for me. All of the people saying ""FPS drops with even with my 3090"" likely don't have the proper CPU to back up the requirements, or are just complaining because it dropped from 60 to 59 FPS when 15 enemies were attacking them at once (boohoo). All in all, two of my all time favourite games are Dark Souls 3 (60+ hrs on Xbox) and The Witcher 3 (127 hrs on PC). Elden Ring is a beautiful mash up of both, and I cannot recommend this game highly enough!"

Positive,Dark Souls 4
Positive,"If you like this game play Bloodborne, or if you don like this game then go play Bloodborne and than come back to this game."
Positive,Unbelievably massive. This game captures that sense of awe and discovery like few games can.
Positive,Thank you my reformed orthodox rabbi Bill Clinton
Positive,Ok I guess
Positive,I'm addicted to getting my ass handed to me in this game I've never felt this way before in my life. All jokes aside this has been a blessing to play thank you fromsoftware
Positive,"They said 'It may never come out'They said ""'Open World' Dark Souls could never live up to the Hype.""They said many things.Elden Ring is still standing, and DAMN is it still as amazing as release day"

Positive,"From maidenless Tarnished to godslaying Elden Lord, Elden Ring does not miss a beat throughout your adventures in the Lands Between.  This new installment in FromSoftware's library of Soulsborne games is the culmination of everything the dev team has learned throughout the years. Taking the best elements from Demon's/Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro; putting it all in an open world reminiscent of Breath of the Wild made for a very fun, challenging, and atmospheric world to conquer. With every turn, there is always some dungeon to explore or an NPC to talk to keeping you busy when traveling between major locations. Saying FromSoftware was generous with content is a massive understatement. Having this game open world also means that if you're stuck on a boss, you can go off and do any of the numerous side activities to get stronger then come back. Elden Ring truly is the perfect Soulsborne game!  Whether you are a Slayer of Demons, Chosen Undead, Bearer of the Curse, Ashen One, Hunter, or Wolf returning for a new Miyazaki adventure; or a new Tarnished looking to brave the Lands Between for the first time, there is something to enjoy in Elden Ring for everyone."
Positive,you already know its the best game ever made you dont need me to tell you
Positive,"The ultimative From Software game. Beautiful, challenging and enormous. Statters will be fixed and it totally will be a 100% GOTY. You should buy it if you are either a fan or a newbie 👍Still good. Waiting for DLC"
Positive,Best way to kill yourself
Positive,Finally a Game that lived up to its Hype
Positive,I did not think I would enjoy it as much as I did.Highly recommended.
Positive,"Started game, find but hole. Smacked a couple of fake walls, depressed. Met a one eyed maiden who lets me down, depressed. Found another depressed maiden in some broken down home, tells me awful story, now we're both depressed. It's like an AA meeting inside a Hot Topic. You're depressed either way you look at it. 10/10 pickles.Can't wait to die again by the grudge monster in the lake."
Positive,"+ PROS +1. Gameplay : the most flexible souls-like genre imo , you could make it super ez or super hard2. Graphic : visually looks good , design from stage , armor , weapon ,enemy all looks great3. Exploration : Its vast and totally freedom to approach4. Audio : Music is epic , voice acting decent- CONS - 1. Story : i don't know who i am , i don't know why i'm here , All i know is that i must kill2. Multiplayers : complicated and compare to seamless co-op mod , the vanilla need to improved3. Stuttering Issue : well its rarely happened , but when it do it could mess your boss fight~ OVERALL ~MASTERPIECE : rating 9/10A must play for Souls-Like veteranA good starting point to try souls-like gametake me as example , i usually don't like souls-like because over the top difficulty and harsh penaltybut this...this put a smile on my face"
Positive,"My previous review harped on the horrid performance of the initial elden ring release (i7 32gb rtx 2080). After Finally coming back for the new DLC with a faster ryzen pc the performance is much better but still shady at times. However, the DLC and it's content make this version of elden ring feel like elden ring 2. The amount of world space alone in shadow of the erdtree is truly mind bending. Get ready for an amazing (yet hardcore) challenge and a host of new worlds to explore with this new dlc. One of the best DLC ever made by any developer! Thank you for the fixes and better content From software!"
Positive,"This is a game I wasn't really excited for. I'm not the biggest souls fan nor do I like the modern open world game (looking at you ubisoft and sony) so I only really wanted to play it if it would be coop with a friend, but after giving it a try due to the incredibly positive reviews by content creators, its become one of my favorite games and I'm so glad I didn't overlook it.The only problem with this game is the stutter which for me happened only in a couple areas on launch, became a consistent issue after a couple days, and now seems to be non-existent with the exception being when a controller is connected. The 60 FPS cap is also disappointing. Launch technical issues aside, the game is near perfect. I've never been the biggest fan of souls-style combat and this hasn't changed that, but its become so refined with so many different playstyles that anyone can find something they like. What really makes the combat shine though is the context in which its in. The game world is huge and every time you think you've seen it all and you're near the end, another massive area shows up. Each of these areas are incredibly dense with interesting content. These areas also don't mark points of interest on your map, you have to find them yourself. Whether that's through being told about a location from an NPC, physically looking on the map for something that seems interesting, or just stumbling across it adds so much to the sense of adventure and exploration. Its not a themepark with a checklist of bases to capture. You're discovering these dungeons yourself and that's meaningful. Sure, there are some things that are reused like the crypts and caves which generally use the same assets, but every one has its own puzzles to figure out, environmental hazards and traps to avoid, and enemy patterns to figure out how to deal with efficiently. Having similar themes also helps to allow players to go to content that will assist their playstyle. Every location has something interesting to get, but not every item works with every build. If you don't want to do spirit summoning, the crypts almost always give a summon as a reward, so you can learn to avoid them.With the absence of a humanity system like in Dark Souls 1, the ability to teleport to any grace site at any time that you're not in a minor dungeon or trapped, the ability to respec fairly early, and the open map design makes the game so much more accessible than the previous souls games. You have so much room to experiment with combat strategies and builds without ever having that feeling of dread that comes with losing all your souls deep in a dungeon and now you have less health to make it through. If anything is too hard, you can come back later, or if its not enough of a challenge, a pretty large amount of the world is open straight from the start. Combat encounters are also balanced around many playstyles. I played a dex/int build and some bosses that were easy to me, seemed to be much harder on friends playing faith or sword and board. Likewise, anything with a shield felt like an uphill battle, but a the strength builds just parry and shield break with heavy attacks. The ability of the devs to make a game that doesn't feel strictly easier based on playstyle is incredible.The addition of jumping as a core mechanic to the souls series is something I also can't overstate how big of a difference it makes. The jumping feels good and using the double jumping on torrent (which admittedly is a little tricky to get used to) you can platform much higher than the devs likely intended, even skipping certain intended paths. Then again, its hard to know what the intended paths are since each gated area has numerous ways to get through. One of the goals that's setup for you for a while is getting to the Altus Plateau and as far as I can tell right now, there are 4 different ways of getting there, all of them equally valid. One is a brute challenge, one is based on exploration, one is part of a questline, and the one I did was completely accidental and surprising. The amount of content you can skip really gets me excited for the speedrunning potential.Aside from the gameplay, all the artistic qualities are equally fantastic. It goes without saying as you can see from the footage, but the game is gorgeous. It makes you want to explore every nook and cranny, especially since you're almost always rewarded. Character creation is weird with how sliders affect more of the face than you would expect, but it is very deep and the outfits you can wear enhance that greatly. The music is great and atmospheric and the sound design works very well when you need to listen for sound queues. The real standout among all of this though, is the story and characters. I'm not gonna pretend there's a ton, but what is there is really good. Interactions feel natural, everyone has their own motivations whether right or wrong, and the lore of the world unfolds to you in a really meaningful way. It is so much more digestible than previous souls games and for the first time I found myself caring about the world I was in and decisions that characters made. The world feels much more real because of this. In previous souls games, it baffled me when you'd find a normal person or a blacksmith in the middle of what is basically a monster-infested hell-hole, but in this game it feels like a real world that people live in. Your choices as a player also matter, whether you know it or not. NPCs also don't give you quest logs or map markers to tell you wear to go. You have to figure it out organically by listening to what they say and exploring where you think they might want you to go. It feels much more natural, especially since story lines intersect and you can cut one short by having a character killed by progressing a different story line. Seeing different story lines out is definitely a big reason to replay the game for me even if I've exhausted every dungeon by that point.Lastly, the multiplayer. Haven't tried the duels since I don't know where the dueling spots are, but everything else has been very fun. Coop is at its best in dungeons where you're fighting through them together. Not quite as good in the overworld since you have to stop at each major map section and neither of you can ride horseback, but the ability to do it at all is great. It is still annoying though that host map progress doesn't count for the assistant as if they die, both players will have to backtrack to the assistant's location. Invasions only happening in coop unless you choose to enable it in singleplayer is a fantastic compromise and is a fun challenge to strategize with a friend. Invading others is an interesting challenge and really puts your knowledge of game mechanics and the map to the test. I've had a great time trying to lure players into bossfights and the like. This is added to by the addition of other people during invasions, whether that be hunters that try to stop you or other invaders that could be from a different invading faction. The only problem is that the rewards aren't that great. Rune arcs are powerful limited items so getting them is nice, but I feel like I have far more than I'll ever need. I'd much rather get an influx of runes since there is no level cap so they'll always be useful.There's so much more I could talk about, the game is so dense with content and systems that you can go an entire playthrough without understanding some of them, but it never feels overwhelming. Everything I've said is all of my minor gripes with the game and there is so much more I could gush about. If Dark Souls is a harder, grittier Ocarina of Time, then Elden Ring is a harder, grittier Breath of the Wild if every inch of the map had something incredibly interesting to fight or collect. This is an amazing game that does everything right and innovates on its genres. What more can you ask for?"
Positive,I like very much :)
Positive,All these noobs complaining just need to get a machine that doesn't SUCK LOL

Positive,"Hello everyone, this is my first game review, I want to share my experiences and feelings for Elden Ring, I hope this review may help you make your decision.   First of all, for those who have never experienced soul-like games. Elden Ring was developed by From Software, the team that created Dark Soul and gave birth to soul-like series such as Bloodborne, Demon Soul and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.What are ""Soul-Like games""?  Click here for more Info  ???Soul-Like??? [gamicus.fandom.com]        Elden Ring will let everyone enter ""The Lands Between"", a sacred land ruled by Queen Marika. And there's the ""Elden Ring"", a great power. And it's the core of the story. But then  great powers has to be extinguished. Like everything. When there was a cause for the Elden Ring to fall apart and follow the great war of those hoping to take power, there was no winner in the war. But when the Ring of Elden broke down, the blessings deteriorated, turning it into a cursed land, and there was a danger throughout the heads, along with the disappearance of Queen Marika. And now we'll play as the ""The Tarnished"", a group of people who were once ousted, but it's finally time for them to save the land. By finding the Elden Ring, restoring sacred powers, and becoming the Elden Lord to determine the world's fate.It's a plot that souls fans should be familiar with, but it's hard to say that there's more to it than it looks, with George R.R. Martin (who gave birth to Game of Thrones) writing the legendary story behind it, making Elden Ring more complicated than ever. Because each location is filled with a lot of secrets, which is magnified by the main plot that once the Elden Ring is broken, What kind of catastrophe follows. These subversive storylines are told through conversations of characters we have encountered, through prophecies, various inscriptions. With these elements, it's still a narrative in the style of Souls, and there's no important Cutscene to give us a straightforward understanding of the storyline, which on the other hand makes it look natural too, because the image is as if we're just a small part, the world doesn't revolve around us, and many of the characters in the story have ""heroes."" In its own way. Elden Ring transformed the Souls series into a large open space, which the team defined as ""Open Field,"" not open world, as many initially understood. What it means is a large area where players can choose what to do first, but there are a lot of limitations that prevent us from having that freedom, maybe it's about too strong enemies or some places that aren't open until we've fulfilled the conditions, like defeating the bosses or collecting some items to unlock the way on.And as an open field of the game, the game will not always be open because there will be dungeons in place, including the sub-dungeons scattered according to the map and the main dungeons according to the storyline, which, if you try to get into these dungeons, will be a map from the Souls family of games that we are used to because of the complex design level, and there are also different mechanisms, including elevators or shortcut doors that are locked to open from the other side only. These are fully worn, mixed with brutal enemies that suddenly show up all the time. On the other hand, The open space zone of the game is so vast that one word is astounding. There's something we can explore all over the place. In addition to dungeons, there are small zones like villages, military camps or monster nests, each of which will be rewarded if we are skilled enough, as important items, new weapons or new skills to upgrade ourselves to better. Which, with so much to explore, is a lot to explore. Therefore, this game is also designed in a way that players do not have to collect at all points. If you're good enough, head straight. Play the main dungeon to the end. You don't have to stop anywhere through the page. To fit into a larger world, it will take a long time to explore. This time, From Software put in a lot stuff to help us, which is an extension of the previous games. Bringing together the advantages of each game to make it a game that seems accessible to many people. (HORSE!!!!)On the gameplay side, This is Dark Souls, the sequel is no more than that, because basically it's also a game where we have to manage Stamina values well to attack or set up, and it's also available for players to press Parry to defend against enemies, having a stab in the back of the enemy as usual. At the same time, many other systems from other games have been put in place, including stealth, jumping, sekiro balancing system that, if we attack repeatedly, will damage the enemy and open up vulnerabilities for us to close violently. The new addition is that in Elden Ring, players will be able to install their favorite skills into the weapon through the ""war ash"" system, which comes in the form of an item that says what weapons they can use, so it makes this game more diverse, and if it is PvP, it will be fun because when you see an enemy with a sword walking in, you will not know what skill he has. Before we know it, we're going to have to start fighting, and these skills are both physical and magical.(Magic is OP!)In terms of graphics To be honest, textures and visual techniques demon's souls remake on PlayStation 5 is alot better, but what compensates for it is the gods' artistic directing. the team has done all the beautiful scenes, which means that's kind of beautiful day and night. The colour scheme is more fantasy than any previous game, plus the shadows are very well tuned. So it must be appreciated that his team has really done their best for a cross-gen game like this.The game used a fair amount of specs, and although it's understandable because of the wide map, the objects in the scene are plentiful. In my opinion Elden Ring optimizes on PC is not good enough, it's probably part of it. The other part is as if the engine itself is not compatible with this game scale. Even if it doesn't even tear up. Revolutionize gameplay from the Souls series as we used to know it. But this is the most complete piece of work for From Software, with a fantasy game rich in spectacular locations and complex stories.Who's yearning for a death experience? Born, circling on a large scale with a magnificent boss fight scene, I suggest Elden Ring won't disappoint you.Score : 9.5 / 10 I haven't been this excited for a long time. Elden Ring has given me that feeling again. A feeling of fear and excitement filled with unpredictable enemies, and a land full of hidden dangers filled with unforgettable beauty."
Positive,"dogwater performance, multiple crashes, painful stutters during certain fights and levels, multiple online connection failures despite having very good internet and being in VOIP without disconnections. still, even as unacceptable at release this is, still is one of the greatest games I've ever played."
Positive,Almost as great as gay sex.(Very Good)
Positive,goddamnitelden ring on salebut i already have it........
Positive,My friend told me to try Elden Ring.I did.Big mistake.Game is 11/10 tho
Positive,"Elden Ring is a game whose release is something we have never witnessed in a LONG time: It's favored by all critics, it's designed for this generation, the developers polished it as much as possible before release (only delayed by one month), and there are no bogus microtransactions. Protect FromSoftware at all costs...they're one of the only gems left in the gaming industry."
Positive,"ELDEN RING™ is just DARK SOULS™ with extra steps, literally, you have to transverse three times as much digital terrain than previous FROMSOFTWARE games (multiply that by two if you're doing co-op, because then you can't use the horsie), much of which is filled with barely anything of worth, many of the starting bosses are later then recycled in evergaols (Godrick equals Godefroy) and you'll see the same mini-bosses or field bosses as the game calls them every two or three Site of Graces, like the death chicken or the ominous bell knight. Limgrave and Liurnia are very pleasing areas to explore and lose yourself in, they break away from the usual gloomy-depression-inducing-dark-fantasy settings From Software is known for and that is a plus, but soon you'll get thrown in Caelid and the dungeons will remember you which series this hails from. The dungeons are all samey, you get in, beat up some small stone imps and deal with the usual firethrower mechanism or the riding chariot of death and then you find a lever and kill a field boss and you're good to go — back to just running around with your horse. The NPCs can move their mouths while talking now, that's something that took them a while — I understand. Despite all these gripes I have, I still had fun in a way I didn't really felt with one of their titles since playing DARK SOULS II: Scholar of the First Sin. So it's got that going for it, which is nice."
Positive,"Elden Ring is an amazing evolution of the Fromsoft formula. Before Elden ring, I have only played the original dark souls and parts of dark souls 2. Elden Ring doesn’t just fix the problems of its predecessors, it evolves them to make a more modern and enjoyable experience.The open world is incredible. The biggest criticism in open world games is that they’re too big for their own good, but I never got this feeling while playing Elden Ring. It may be lacking in npcs but each character is unique and can be encountered multiple times as their story progresses. There’s always something new around every corner as well, like a hidden cave, or even entire secret areas like the Haligtree and the underground sections. My only complaint with the open world is that sometimes it can be too cryptic. I respect the vague storytelling of these games, but some of the coolest areas in the game can be easily missed.The gameplay is just as great as it usually is. Fromsoft is known for their combat systems and Elden ring does not disappoint. There’s a wide variety of weapons and just about anything can be upgraded into a god-slaying weapon with the right stats. There’s a lot more flexibility in the upgrades/leveling system than in past games, so it’s simple to try out new weapons/builds and find out what works best for you. It still could be more flexible, but it’s an improvement for sure over past souls games.The enemies in this game are brutal. Maybe too brutal at times, but the majority of them are enjoyable. Let’s face it, you’re going to die a lot, but a lot of the bosses I really enjoyed. Out of the multitude of bosses in the game, I only think two of them are genuinely unfair fights (Malenia and Godskin duo). These are some of the hardest bosses yet, but it’s much easier to come back later and level up if you’re having trouble, rather then just “getting good”. There’s also a new spirit  summoning system for when you need some backup but don’t want to summon an actual player.I thought the addition of great runes was much better than the humanity system of dark souls. Instead of needing humanity to kindle bonfires, great runes offer buffs to players who are feeling more risky. But for those who are used to dying a lot, it’s completely optional.Overall this game is one of the best I’ve ever played. I’ve never been the most skilled at video games, so it sure feels rewarding to beat each boss and finish the game.This game is definitely a 9.5/10 for me (.5 subtracted because of Malenia alone, fuck that boss.)"
Positive,The literal ''GAME'' of the DECADE.
Positive,I've done nothing but watch the monkeys fight the Godrick soldiers close to the Agheel Lake South grace for more than I'd like to admit.update: convinced seamless coop partners to watch it with me.
Positive,It's a great game
Positive,best game in the world
Positive,"FromSofts first outing into a proper open world game is a huge success bar a few technical hiccups. While the combat might not be as precise and focused as Sekiro, nor as intimate as Bloodborne, it has a range of styles that will fit any player and allow for hours of experimentation.The exploration of the world is at the core of the game, and while the game runs into open world tropes like re-used enemies and assets at times, you never feel like you waste your time fighting a boss or exploring, as you always get something unique as a reward.The world itself is compelling, with a mythos you can sink hours into analysing, multiple side quests and NPCs to follow, secret areas and hidden bosses, all polished with the Fromsoft level design shine.The music is sublime as always, with some truly standout tracks for the bosses and exploration music that isn't overbearing.The game expects a bit more from you than most games, but all you need to make something out of it is here. The Lands Between are worth exploring for anyone who wants to get into Souls games, or who enjoy RPGs in general."
Positive,"This game is easily played on mouse and keyboard, It does have the occasionally studder but nothing game breaking for me at least. Imagen a souls game, but with a vast world like the elder scrolls games, with interesting dungeons and bosses. The game itself, is rather forgiving if you ask me, it isn't really too hard, and the exploring is fun. I feel like there is either a grace or checkpoint around every corner, and the bosses are great. If you can't kill them go explore another area, till you have the right level and equipment. Playing online is rather useful since the messages are rather useful, ofc a lot of them are ""Fort night"" or some other dumb meme, but they can be useful!I did some Invasions, which was a mixed bag, it was fun but also a lot harder than the other souls games. Why is too much of a bother to type.I'm definitly enjoying the game."
Positive,I swear to god I dodged-
Positive,I opened the chest... I want to go home....
Positive,"This game is the most beautiful game ive ever played. Its so good in fact, i got sucked in and played 14 hours a day, to 4 am each night, untill i finished the game, which took me almost 70 hours, and i still have much more to do. The gameplay is like dark souls 3 but on steroids, and the map is absolutely enormous. Every time i entered a new zone the entire map just doubled in size, over and over, i was in shock. The attention to detail makes me want to screenshot everything. However.. After finishing the game once, the exploration aspect felt kind of dull when replaying it. I knew where to go and i wasnt discovering anything much new. But its fun replaying with friends, and trying new builds or playstyles. Theres a few collectibles and some alternate endings."
Positive,not too shabby
Positive,"low fps max is 60 stutters everywhere thumbs down for now. game got fixed, best game ever"
Positive,Godrick the Drafter to Vietnam
Positive,"since they mostly fixed stuttering on PC i can honestly say THIS IS THE MOST COMPLETE, FINISHED, AND GREATEST OPEN WORLD ACTION RPG EVER MADE!!! wish I could have 120 FPS but ehhh you cant have it all...this game being as wholesomely awesome as it is is enough for me GOTY for sure!!"
Positive,"Too many finger...Amazing open world with unique artstyle, many weapon and skill/spell to build everything you want.I'm not really enjoy the combat but I love to mess with weapons and skill (since you can custom it)"
Positive,"Dark Souls: Played a couple of hours, decided it wasn't for meSkipped DS 2, DS 3, Sekiro, & BloodbourneElden Ring: Was peer pressured into buying it. Hated it on principle for the first 10 hours. Struggled against it for about 20 more hours. Around hour 50, I was fully bought into it and I had only just gotten to the Altus Plateau.  Now I've put in more than 100 hours, and haven't even seen any of the map east of Altus Plateau. On the PS5. Now I have it where I can mod it."
Positive,Praise the sun
Positive,I left my wife for Alexander.
Positive,"try fingers, but hole"
Positive,"This is GOTY for me and I bet millions of other players. Elden Ring builds upon what makes Souls games a success, refine the formula, throw in a detailed handcrafted open world, add extra complexity (much wilder sorcery and incantations, much better hit box with the addition of jump, horse combat etc.) while at the same time making the game much more accessible (Spirit Ashes summon, open world allows you to explore without getting stuck at a particular boss blocking your progress). No wonder they sold 12 million copies within the first month for what is a ""niche"" game."
Positive,"One of the best games I've ever played without a doubt had a learning curve at the start but once you get it it's such a different experience than any other game I've played would recommend this game to anyone that want's to play a hardcore open world game with a lot of exploration a lot of dying a lot of figuring shi out and lots of fun, Thank you for such an amazing experience FromSoftware my first play through but not my last for sure :)"
Positive,This Game Got Rid Of My Depression For A Month

Positive,"Super fun, Lore hits so hard. Gameplay is fr perfect 11/10"
Positive,"The seven forms of art have come all together in one thing and it’s name is Elden Ring. It has gone beyond being a video game and has become a poem or a beautiful painting. As you wander through the Lands Between, you can catch yourself philosophizing life and everything. Now you better take a deep breath and sit on the throne, which will make you an Elden Lord, the greatest king."
Positive,haha funy gaem
Positive,I havent beaten it yet :)edit: I have beaten it now :)
Positive,S tier game
Positive,A brilliant game for people looking for challenging gameplay and a rich story experience. I would highly recommend trying this game even if you are not familiar with Souls-like combat and mechanics.
Positive,It is an amazing game. The graphics were amazing. Enjoyed it till the end.
Positive,"Where do i begin...It's hard to have new expectations for games to come after this masterpiece. I love how I always can go back and play a new character, with a new build, and explore new dungeons I didn't even know about before. Especially when you find a new secret boss who rocks you (Dragon with double laser beam?! = new fear unlocked).The only thing I'm excited for these days in the gaming industry, is the DLC.Overall: 10/10 - Masterpiece"
Positive,I have joined the cult of masochism.
Positive,"Masterpiece, one of the best open world games ever made."
Positive,Try fingersbut hole
Positive,"I just finished the DLC, and I finally completed the game after 2 years...And, without a doubt, this is the best gaming experience I’ve had so far. Here is my tribute to this masterpiece.Elden Ring is an experience that you can live in over 300 hours or be completed in 60, and it will reward players in both scenarios.The game will never disappoint you! It surprises you at every corner with its plot twists and intricate details.Anyone who has played this game can see the dedication, time, effort, creativity, and quality that FromSoftware poured into Elden Ring.From the vast range of weapons and spells to the stunning graphics, soundtracks, and dialogues, every aspect is carefully crafted.The game doesn’t construct a linear story or a specific path; instead, it creates a massive, original world with it's history, people, races, stories, nations, heroes, villains, and tales, of which you are just a part of it!Elden Ring gives you the freedom to choose how much you want to interact with its world and also to show your skills in combat.If I could offer one advice to anyone wanting to play this masterpiece, it would be this: try to enjoy every aspect of it. Engage with the story by reading item description and interacting with NPCs, explore the world, Tune in to the background music and themes, and enjoying the combat by utilizing spells, skills, armor, and weapons.Farewell, Elden Ring.10/10"
Positive,imagine not playing this game lol!
Positive,"eu te amo elden ring, eu te amo"
Positive,im now attracted to men
Positive,poopballsand gay sex10/10 game
Positive,"most fulfilling game i've played, makes you struggle for the win and when you finally do win it's the best feeling ever."
Positive,"Had a wonderful time even with the immense complexity. I simply adored everything from beginning to end, especially about the tale they strived to unfold. Might be one of the best games produced by FromSoftware following Bloodborne and the Dark Souls series."
Positive,"I'm glad Elden Ring was my first souls game. I never thought I'd enjoy this type of game (guess why) but here I am in my third play through on a new character (and I just bought all three of the dark souls games). Even with almost 300 hours I still get sh*t on by many of the enemies and bosses. But that's what makes this game great. It forces you to get gud kid.Try fingers,but holealso DLC when?"

Positive,Please play this game. This game changed how I view new releases and my overall look on gaming as a whole. A must buy for any gamer.

Positive,"Anywho, time to retrieve my runes!"
Positive,Certified hood classic💀
Positive,it stirs the poo inside my body for a good price
Positive,"Have you ever used a weapon, armour, fast travel, potions, or opened a world map? I'm sorry to say, but you're playing the game wrong. This game is meant to played level 1 as a wretch, using a single club, no upgrades."
Positive,I LOVE MEN
Positive,"At first I couldnt handle the difficulty, had to play with controller which was... hard at first..It was also my first ""soulslike"" game. After a good 10 hours it was a blast.Each enemy had its own fighting style, combat mechanics that I had to overcome. The world is beautiful, very pleasant to look at. Just alone the satisfaction of FINALLY GETTING RID OF MALENIA was one of the best gaming feelings ever :D10/10"
Positive,"I LOVED it, the weapon designs Plus the Bossfights and the power stance mechanic they added from Dark souls II , The Bossfight Sound tracks was mind blowing, The NPC questlines was perfect and the Character design mmm yummy."

Positive,"Just like in the other Souls titles, Gravity is by far the greatest adversary in the lands between."
Positive,worth for every cent and minute 10/10
Positive,one of the greatest games ever made. 🙏🏻
Positive,kinda held the review off for too long but.. yes 100% recommended if you wanna torture yourself (i love being tortured) i mean what
Positive,"To become something in this world, you need to pass through the difficulties and make hard choices on this path. This is how I see the philosophy of the Souls games, and Elden Ring elevates it to the absolute. You will suffer, overcoming the most difficult bosses in the whole series with their fast movements and reactions, and in the same time you will marvel how large and complex is the game world and how beautiful and detailed is it. It looks like a formalization of your childhood dreaming about middle-age fantasy worlds which were seen in other games, films and books. Elden Ring just dives you into this world and says: ""Bro, welcome to the dark fantasy world where you can do whatever you want. Just kill and try to not go crazy by the amount of opportunities and content here.""To be honest, there will be not enough words to say how I enjoyed this videogame. It is a true masterpiece where each hour spent is the 100% gameplay. Thank you, FromSoftware and especially Miyazaki Hidetaka for this. There will be nothing better and larger, at least in Souls games, than Elden Ring. 10/10."
Positive,"You've probably already heard about this game but if you're still on the fence, I do just want to say this is one of the single best games I've ever played. There's so much to explore and find around every corner with amazing gameplay.Not gonna pretend that I'm in love with games being so difficult that I want to put a hole in my monitor but due to the open world nature of this game you can level to your hearts content and make the game as easy or difficult as you like.The replay value is insane due to the multitude of ways you can play the game through whatever build you want to go for, be that a quick dex user, a crazy strong monkey man wielding two giant hammers, a spectral scholar using magic projectiles or a faithful incantation user conjuring elemental and spiritual powers.So all in all I would 100% recommend this game if you're even thinking about it in the slightest.Also Alexander best girl, sexy ass pot motherfucker"
Positive,OOOOHH ELDEN RING!!!
Positive,i like pot boy
Positive,before i started playing this i was maidenless. i still am
Positive,I love the game but i have a few tiny problems the average gamer should know.its ok to google stuff when you stuck or to find secrets. This game is meant for that but dont ever listen to idiots who say this boss is easy and this boss isnt.get good etc.dark souls elitists basically.play it however you like and try everything yourself dont let random people slow you down
Positive,Crackhead Wizard of Oz
Positive,this gabw was good. not great. fantastic. happy dad day.
Positive,this game bent me over and fucked my asshole hard there for 11/10 would let it fuck my ass anytime
Positive,fromsoftware is truly the kanye west of video game
Positive,"This game is so hard that it made me realize, asking out a girl can't be THAT hard. EDIT: It didn't work"
Positive,Dying is a part of learning
Positive,Honestly a perfect game. There are many different ways to play for different people. There are also ways for new souls fans to play. I am new to souls games and thought it was a challenge but it was very fun. If you are willing to put in the time to play it will be worth it.
Positive,"Great game but not without flaws. Without question, this is the most accessible Fromsoftware game there is. The setting is gorgeous and interesting, the bosses are some of their best ever, and it should go without saying that the gameplay is stellar. I thought the addition of Torrent (mount) was a fun way to make exploration enticing while also adding some depth to certain fights. The game deserves the praise it gets, but I'll be a little more critical since most reviews I've seen have been nothing but praise.Besides the poor performance/crashes, my biggest complaint about the game is how many recycled enemies and bosses there are. I'm not someone who needs to 100% the game, but I do like to try and fight as many of the bosses I can. As I got closer towards the end-game, I got really tired of fighting the same enemies in different contexts or in a combination with a different recycled boss. It felt off flavor of what FS usually does to keep you interested as you progress, and it made me pretty burnt out by the time I got to the end of Elden Ring. Now that I've beat the game, I don't really know I feel. The first half of the game, I thought it was clearly the best fromsoftware game they've made, but now I don't think I would put it above DS 1. When I beat every dark souls game, I had this amazing sense of accomplishment and sadness that it was over. Whereas in Elden Ring, I felt like it was a little abrupt. I'm looking forward to playing more and discovering more about the story, and I'd still recommend this game to anyone, but I think elden ring still would come second to dark souls for me."
Positive,Einfachstam und faris müssen sich das holen!!!!!!!!!!!Achso und ja ist gut.
Positive,pretty easy dude
Positive,This game is my literal online personafingers but hole
Positive,"Killed some guys, got a ring or something. Fun game"
Positive,"The last game I was genuinely* obsessed with was Assassin's Creed Black Flag which came out like 700 years ago and I'm glad that the crown finally gets passed down to this absolute masterpiece. Worth at least 10 replays, and as overwhelming as it may seem in the beginning, the lore ties all the chaos together in a perfect ""Ohhh, that makes sense"" bow. Stellar."
Positive,"good game, just make sure u have everything in this list soo u can fully enjoy it- no friends- no family- no life- money- reddit or youtube- and finally internet if u have everything on this list you'll love the gamesource: trust me bro"
Positive,"SCARIEST HORROR GAME EVERAFTER JOINING MY FRIENDS WORLD WE IMMEDIATELY GOT JUMPED BY A FREAKING NINJA TURTLE!!!!!111111111!https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/u56vdu/me_and_my_friend_freaking_out_after_being/GOOD GAME WOULD BUY AGAIN IF I WASNT SO ASS, MY FRIEND COULD ONLY CARRY SO MUCH LMAO"
Positive,i am so close to touching god i have lost feeling in my nuts. Praise the rump!
Positive,Didn't expect review.
Positive,only when i removed all my armor and refused to heal did i understand what makes this game phenomenalit will let you win when you are ready
Positive,"If you liked ""Kirby: Planet Robobot"" and the movie, ""Minions: Rise of Gru,"" then you will enjoy Elden Ring."
Positive,Precious game ahead....
Positive,By far the best Fromsoftware game in my opinion. No bullshit microtransactions like in most other games. An insanly large world filled with cool stuff and not just a list of places to go to like in other open world games. You actually want to explore it what i cant say about many other open world games for me. Enemie design is also very cool. Definitly a 10/10 and my Favorite Game since Monster Hunter World in 2018 ( and its DLC ) MUST TRY ( and die ) GL
Positive,"After completing multiple playthroughs to get 100% achievements, I can safely say Elden Ring is the BEST game I've ever played, even as a newbie to the Souls genre and FromSoftware titles. The challenge, the narrative, the world-building, the little quests and side characters, the build variety, and yes, the salt, I wish I could forget it all to experience everything again. The only ""con"" is that now other games feel dull compared to Elden Ring."
Positive,"Gigantic game with content for hundreds of hours. Everything about this game is nice and it fixes many problems of its predecessors,The only problems I have with it are:-sometimes the amount of content can be overwhelming-streams can have a whitescreen on discord-It's easy to miss out on cool content like NPC questlines (internet almost required)"
Positive,"My great friend Alex hooked me up with this game. I suck at Souls-type games, but this one is pretty dope. I actually have had a few moments where I'm like ""Ok, I'm gonna goto bed early tonight"" and then end up staying up 2-3 hours later cause I played this. Good stuff! Thanks Alex!!!"
Positive,"One of the best games, if not the best game I have ever played. Everything fromsoft has made has led up to this point, and I feel as if this is their magnum opus. Elden ring has quickly climbed up the ranks of my favorites to be on par with even Red Dead Redemption 2 and Breath of the Wild. All of the best parts of every dark souls games are here... and you can jump too. 10/10"
Positive,Rya > Fia > Millicent > Ranni > Melina > Roderika > Alexander > Rykard kill voiceine)
Positive,plump sort ahead
Positive,"""THIS GAME IS F**KING MASTERPIECE"" thats i all i have to say after playing almost 200 hours . . im hoping to see dlc for this game T_T .sometimes i just hide the hud and walking around the area its really beautifull and heart warming except suddenlly bears approaching u from out of nowhere . . rate for this game 10/10 from software really nailed this game"
Positive,One of the best games of the decade. Solid experience with lots of challenges to overcome and a great sense of achievement. Still needs more optimization for better framerates and less stutter but over all you get more than your money's worth which is a true rarity in this day and age :)
Positive,"My 2nd souls game. My first was Nioh and it was tough, got stucked around the 2nd region. However, Elden Ring is a lot more forgiving and provides alternatives to the linear gameplay of old souls games. Cannot beat Margit? Explore around, perhaps find a better weapon, use a few runes to level up, or find some better armor and return to him. Totally still challenging but alternatives exists and prevents player to be completely stuck."
Positive,"A Masterpiece.Just like Souls is an industry standard for games of the same genre;FromSoftware managed to re-invent the formula into an open-wolrd setting that will also become a standard (no doubt).-A gigantic world to explore with various gorgeous sceneries-Freedom to do so with a nice mount; just go have an adventure in any direction you want-A fantasy setting with the best of many inspirations (one of the obvious ones being Berserk but not limited to)-Tons of armors, weapons, spells to suit your style-Tons of Customizable weapon skills to build a completely unique character and adapt to any situation or fight.-The map always has enough rewards for you to feel interested in exploring a ruin you saw in the distance. So at the very least while travelling you are never really bored as there is always something to look for or note on your map for later.-No one to hold your hand: sure that can scare a lot of people. But know that if you are really lost, you can always find either helpful messages (mostly^^) in game to help guide you, or there is tons of info built by the community to help you online. There is no shame in looking up some help.-About the difficulty: One of the general pre-conceived ideas of Souls is that it's ""too hard"". it's false. It is challenging, but 99% of your problems are caused by you either being too impatient and not having leveled up or you not willing to either learn a bit of the boss patterns or even adapt your way of playing for the fight.Take your time. Try other things. in Souls games I personnaly never finish the game with the weapon I started with or thought I was going to use. Everyone has that one boss that was the hardest for them and in general it's never the same for everyone. There is a reason why. And the game offers you a way of respeccing your stats.Allow yourself to be surprised. Give yourself the time and means to ""Git Gud"" : )-The NPCs are really interesting with personnality and purpose (you can tell that RR Martin worked on at least some of them) which is a nice improvement from the previous games.-The bosses are varied in their styles and behavior and some of them are already becoming fan favorites just by how silly/awesome they are.-There are several endings and the game encourages you to go on additionnal runs (NG+, NG++) to try other things-The soundtrack is incredible and is, at the very least, always adapted to the moment or the place you find yourself in.As I write this I am still not over the shock of how good the whole experience is.I was expecting something OKish that we would jokingly call Dark Souls4I was vastly unprepared. Bravo FromSoftware and everyone who worked on it.A Masterpiece."
Positive,"It's everything anyone could ask for in an adventure. Do yourself a favor and don't read guides, don't watch strategy videos, don't spoil the experience for yourself. This will be a journey and realization unlike anything you've ever played, especially if this is your first souls game (it was my first as well!). You'll be able to get lost in the enchanting environments and discover things about the game that will truly make you feel accomplished, make you feel that you've earned it, make you feel that you are a force to be reckoned with."
Positive,"haha fun game, sword go slash. Im depressed."
Positive,It's Dark Souls III with a large open world and a horse. Exploring the world is fun. Core mechanics are mostly the same so if you liked DS3 you should give Elden Ring a try too.
Positive,"the game is really fun, it sucks that its capped at 60 fps tho"
Positive,Jogo lindo e maravilhoso. Merece GOTY.10/10:)
Positive,Took a boss down to <100 health and accidentally rolled off the map. Broke my controller and had to buy a new one. 10/10 would recommend.
Positive,"Easily one of the best games I've ever played, but I love all the souls so I'm a bit biased.Still, I love every moment of it"
Positive,ELDEN RING ahead.
Positive,We've finally moved on from 10 years of talking about Dark Souls to beginning 10 years of talking about Elden Ring.
Positive,Game of the year.Edit: Called it
Positive,"You know that time when you hit it up with the girl you've known for quite a while and don't see anything out of ordinary, but when it comes to the sweet time, you undress her and all of a sudden she be packing a  dump truck? Well, this game is exactly that, first couple of hours seem quite familiar, it's the good ol' Dark Souls, except for a couple of quirks, but as you move on, you keep discovering and discovering. Ripping off the latest Legend of Zelda was a good move - that, Red Dead Redemption 2 and this are the games that justified having the open world. It's filled with mysteries, secrets, quests, mobs and bosses, secret bosses, too!The combat seems a bit more refined than in the previous installments, you can actually stagger fools this time around. The  power stance  is back! Unfortunately for me, however, I accidentally made an overpowered build, so from mid-game and on, I beat pretty much every boss, except for the final one, on my first try and that's not because I'm good or bosses are easy. With that being said, I immediately started a new run with an entirely different build, and the game remains interesting. Speaking of builds, from what I've seen, there is much variety in what you can do and mage builds seem actually fun, they got rid off of some unnecessary skills, so whenever you level up, you don't get lost in what you need to upgrade.What about story? How has famous author George R.R. Martin influenced the plot, the storytelling, the beats, the set pieces? Well, I don't know, 'cause most players will still have to look up some explanation on YouTube, so I imagine Martin's involvement was almost purely a marketing stunt. Save for some The Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones references, I really didn't get what else he was responsible for. A bonfire? Well, no it's a grace. Souls? Runes is where it's at, baby. Try fingers? But hole. The visual part for me is on par with  Bloodborne. In that you had such a fitting world for the story: the design, music, everything seemed to be meticulously crafted to a dot. In  Elden Ring  it's the world full of variety that mixes and blends together so well, you don't give it a second thought, and it's the world you actually want to explore just to see how it all looks.Speaking of looks, the performance is still pretty bad a month after the release. There is literally no rig in the world right now that could run this game perfectly smooth, so it actually comes down to the optimization and not necessarily your PC. Sometimes it's locked 60 FPS of smooth goodness (though, frame cap is ridiculous), sometimes it's a miserable nightmare of 30-45 frames with huge hiccups, stutters, downright freezes. It's embarrassing that such a great game is held down with the problem that has been plaguing all of FromSoftware games since the original Dark Souls. The only exception being Dark Souls II, it was quite good in that respect.Big mood on this one, big recommendation, big world to explore, big swords, big dudes, big  c o c k s. However, I found the lack of Among Us references to be disappointing, so 2/5."
Positive,9/10-1 for M's flurry and performance issues
Positive,"I was unemployed when I started Elden Ring, after finishing the game I am still unemployed but somewhat happier."
Positive,"Fantastic addition to FromSoft's library. Game runs smooth as butter on my linux install, even with an old video card; the only caveat is the occasional crash, but the auto-save leaves that manageable. A touch disappointed that hexes weren't brought back in some form or another, and the closest thing we got (Death sorceries) seem incredibly underwhelming, but the build variety's leaving me content.For other linux users, if you're having issues getting it to run, ensure you're running the latest version of GE-Proton  (v10 at the time of writing), and the latest version of mesa-git installed (v22 at the time of writing)."
Positive,"To anyone who says the game is too hard or they hate souls games this one is for you.Elden ring is my very first souls game. With that, I decided I was going to kill every boss i come across in the game. Here are some stats to show you how bad i was at the gameI died to tree sentinel 221 times spending 11 hours on it. I did not know you could power stance, summon, or even ask for help. I had no idea that dodging left or right mattered. I had no clue how to do anything. After spending that amount of time on that one fight as level 1 with nothing you end up learning alot. I didnt know how to use summons until Hoorah loux. nor did i know you could upgrade your weapons. If you think you are struggling, I promise you that you are doing better than me. So keep going. I love this game. Super happy I learned the game the way i did even though i was completely stupid and didn't use the game's mechanics. Best game 2022. Mage users are ass. 10/10 would play again. For the people who want to give up or refund the game read this before you do so and try again.1. Do not listen to anyone when it comes to how to play the game. Learn it yourself. I promise you you will get it.2. Have fun till you're tired then try again later.3. take your time. youre in no rush to down bosses.4. Dont give up. Its an amazing game and you deserve to experience its greatness"
Positive,"Man, this game tested my willpower to not bash my controller to oblivion. GOTY."
Positive,Game of the decade nothing more nothing less
Positive,"This will probably be remembered as one of the best games ever made, to be honest. We're going to see an influx of Elden Ring-inspired games in the years to come, I guarantee that much. I don't think I have to tell you anything about this game. You've heard it already from other people. You'll hear it described better. Just know it will live up to whatever you've heard. It really is that good."
Positive,"So I actually have 115 hours on the game but steam didnt track that for some reason?I must start by saying that this game is amazing, and within the two weeks Ive had the game ive managed to explore and go through almost every section of the game, which is almost a pity, Ive seen every area, ive fought nearly every boss, and am closing in on the end of the game.Im not even excited for new game plus, as the area im currently in, Mountain tops of the giants, is just boring as all goddam hell, and in my opinion is the worst area in the entire game, there is not much to do, barely any npcs, no large exploration to do, even considering the space the ice area takes up is huuuge, the majority of that space is taken up by steep sloped hills not actual land you can go on.Another gripe i have, is that there are no actual cities with life, everything feels so absolutely dead and unalive in every way, the only thing inhabiting the lands are lone npcs and enemies, which yes, does indeed add to the lonely experience, but I believe they missed out on a chance to make the player feel small in the grand scheme of things, by having maybe a large city thats just npcs that you can explore and find exclusive items in, but no, every area is barren, dead and riddled with enemies, which at this stage makes areas just feel like a chore now.Of course I am absolutely addicted to this game but it has severely lost majority of its enjoyment the closer ive gotten to the end, which is a big pity for me as the beginning of my journey was absolutely spectacular, and along with that I dont see myself replaying the game as the areas are, yes beautiful, but also in some cases dissapointingly unexplorable.Something I also wish to add is that, the map is Oddly layed out, being the shape of a large c, this personally really didnt give me the feeling of a proper open world game, you cant just hop on your horse and go to wherever you want, you have to take use of portals to get to most places, which almost makes the map feel like sections being just large levels.All bad stuff out of the way, I really do love this game Im just dissapointed having gotten closer to the end, and that there was a lot of area of the map wasted and they lost out on potential to have massive cities that were completely explorable, BUT I do absolutely love the combat in this game, its just,,, satisfying to an unbeliveable and addicting degree, and that is what has made me give this game a thumbs up, out of everything i was dissapointed about, it was dissapointing in an almost amazing way that makes the starting 90 hours of this game insanely good.In final I love this game, but for everything I love, there is a matching amount of things I dont like about the game, and getting to the end of the game everything feels like a chore. So the experience I had at the beginning of the game was unmatched and thus I would recommend this game to anyone who is on the edge about buying it, just dont expect, like myself, to enjoy the game all the way through!"
Positive,"100 Hours in, still enjoying the shit outta of it. That being said ... Shit game, do not recommend."
Positive,Is this what CBT feels like?
Positive,"I wanted to wait until i got 40hrs in this game. as someone who has a very busy work/life/social balance its hard to dive deep into games. i usually play a few hrs of multiple different games just to try to enjoy them. but this game. woah. i cant stop playing this! this is like a breath of fresh air and brings me back to when i was younger and only had a few good games to play and poured hr and hrs after school. its so difficult at first but as you continue to push on. its like the human spirit ( which is ironic lol ) this game will not hold your hand, show you where to go, give you advantages, or give you a break! but once you get the mechanic down, the meta and just the overall understanding it get awesome! to me the highlight of the this game is when you come back to a enemy or a boss that keep kicking your butt over and over and over again and felled them! its such a great feeling that all your rune collecting and practicing and studying the bosses moves carefully pays off! i love the weapons, the combat, the enemy types and bosses. people say this game isnt for everyone. and i this a agree. if you are a true gamer. you will appreciate the heck out of this game. its a instant classic, single player experience. this is what other game devs should always come back to you for inspiration for years and years to come. best game of 2022.. no best game in the last 10 years. thank you for reading! beautiful game. its a 10/10"
Positive,Nice. I tried finger but hole.
Positive,One of the video games of all time.Probably the most video gamey video game that exists outside of Dark Souls 1

Tried many fixes but it didn't work so yikes.Overall:Elden Ring is FromSoftware's most accessible entry into the market and as such they have done a great job at it with the gorgeous graphics, teeth-gritting combat (which is an essential in a soul's like game) and creative enemy designs. If you want a game that gives you enjoyable exploration, combat and interesting lore look no further than Elden Ring."
Positive,"I can call this a masterpiece !Thank you for this entertaining experience.From what i understood, all previous games were iterations that led to this marble.Never was a fan of previous game but this is truly enjoyable and has replayability.It is well worth the price however i hope they will add expanstions/DLCs maybe Elden Ring 2 because this is fun :DI'm mostly a SciFi guy so this is a breath of fresh air for me ( just like Terraria or Noita was).I love the fact that everywhere you go there's something to find either an item, a secret, a path that leads to other paths, a bossfight, or maybe a quest. The quests are a bit complicated to figure out without guides ( for me at least). Tho i think that is an interesting aspect of  the game that they want you to collaborate with the community to figure out the game. I wish the endings had a more noticeable impact on the game (visually and maybe mechanically too).Not much to complain about the game (maybe some disconnects here and there when playing with friends tho after a few attempts it gets better) this is truly a remarkable expirience.Thank you From Software !!!!Keep it up !"
Positive,"This game, this game it tickles my testicles. I love walking in every room only to be grabbed from every direction and violated in every possible manner. I truly know now what the definition of rape is. An experience truly unlike any other."
Positive,"9.5/10  being my GOTY.other than some performance issues , there is nothing negative about elden ringhardest or easiest fromsoft game based on how much you wanna explore and how many of your tools you wanna utilize has some really hard bosses , awesome soundtrack , beautiful but brutal world , and a ton of weapons and armor."
Positive,Try finger but hole
Positive,Elden Ring defines what a video game can deliver. I've never seen such a big world so jam-packed with so many things.
Positive,"Elden Ring is obviously dope. It's a FromSoft game with the same methods of greatness, hard to have a miss there, so lets just get to the flaws to note:- The game stutters too often. This is for everyone, no matter how good or bad your GPU+CPU are. Patches that have claims of removing stuttering seem to do nothing of the sort.- Invasions aren't really a thing unless you go out of your way to make sure you can be invaded. The item used to become invaded is the same item used to have the ability to summon other players to your game. In turn, when you opt to invade someone, it will more than likely be a 2v1 or 3v1. Making someone poo in their pants because they're suddenly being invaded in an already brutal area of the game, yeah that's not a thing anymore. An obvious fix for this would be to make the 'Rune Arc' the way to enable becoming invaded, since the Rune Arc is almost identical in function to 'Humanity' from other Souls' games.- ""Elden Ring has so much content, almost too much!"". I mean, since when do gamers consider copy and pasting assets ""more content""? The game does in fact have plenty of content, but a very nice chunk of it is in fact simply copy and pasted assets, too much even. In reality, you have just as much content here as you do in every other Souls' game. There's got to be a reason I 100%ed the game in just as much time as I did the others. It's identical to other Souls' games, except for the fact that you're covering 3x more ground because it's open-world and you have a mount.- Everyone: ""MAGIC IS SO EZMODE IN SOULS!"" Art of War Mechanic: ""Oh, yeah? Hold my beer.""Even after the nerfs to the prime Arts' of War used by speedrunners, magic is still no where near as strong as utilizing a weapons Art of War. Magic hasn't been OP since DS2. Go on, do a magic run in DS3 or Elden Ring, see how OP you very much aren't.8.5/10- Despite all these complaints, as previously mentioned Elden Ring is a fantastic game. Once you get over the four aforementioned complaints I have, you realize you're just playing Dark Souls 4 with no invasions and actual decent story-telling, where you're FINALLY not forced to draw your own conclusions (THANKS GEORGE R.R!)."

Positive,"Insane game. Dark Souls in its core - but more.Let me tell you that - at first - the open world thing really made me hate it a bit. Then again - in a way Dark Souls has always been, well, a tiny bit open world. You were able to choose your path most of the time and go for a couple of different areas. For the first couple of hours of me playing the game i honestly felt like it's yet another ""forced open world"" empty grasslands game but the more i kept playing, the more i realized that it's actually full of lots of precious content.Sure, some side-bosses felt a little rushed - or a little too easy, and some catacombs felt like they were short and empty. But in the end all of them are rewarding you as a player with interesting items. And don't you be worried - there are very challenging bosses coming up, too. It also greatly depends on your build. Some things just work better for certain bosses.The crafting system was yet another thing i really disliked at the start, but at this point i appreciate the option to just quickly craft my buff items when i need them, instead of painstakingly farming them in certain spots or finding just a couple limited resources before i have to hit NG+.The atmosphere is insane, dark - as always. The ambient-sad-dark-ish music is great and does its job fully immersing you into Elden Rings long lost world.Playing the game with a controller on PC is definitely recommend it for any From Software game. They're just not made for KB+M most of the time. Of course you can get used to it, and in the end its yet another input method people might prefer, but its just not as fleshed out as the controller support.Performance is fine for me, didn't face many issues or stutters (none that ever killed me anyways, never had stutters fighting bosses or any enemies). GPU driver is Up2Date so that might actually help with some of the issues other people are facing.""Why is it always dog?"""
Positive,"Ride horsey, bonk knight. What not to love."
Positive,I became Elden Ring
Positive,"45 hours in and I haven't even completed the second zone, this game is HUGE, and I love it with every bit of my being!This is how you do a ""game"", let's see if the ""AAA"" studios learn something already."
Positive,very scary scribblerats
Positive,"Greatest game ever created, literally a masterpiece in every way. Miyazaki once again proving to us that he is a god amongst men."
Positive,"--- YOU HAVE DIED ---First time I ever tried a souls game, and i must say it is an pain in the ass.Getting lost in this hell-scape is a trip.Ok, now over to the game aspects:The best thing about the game is the world itself.The game rewards you for exploring.Literally everywhere, you can find something that is worth the time you spend exploring and take time to win an boss fight.The First time I had win an boss fight was it like I had an orgasm, so much satisfaction.I had a great gaming experience, which I highly recommend!For me this game deserves a Game Of The Year award."
Positive,its just poggers really
Positive,"Another masterpiece. From software really knows what the audience wants. The open world aspect had me hesitant at first but, my worries were unneeded because the game is packed with POI and a plenty of open word boss fights.The story is amazing too. I cant wait for YT channels to read the details on every item and really sew the lore together. #SEEKERSmultiple play through already completed.10/10"
Positive,"I really didn't expect to like Elden Ring as much as I did, but I actually loved every minute I spent in this game. It actually reminds me of when I played Breath of the Wild for the first time and few other games gave me this feeling. Exploration is fun and rewarding and bosses are challenging and really satisfying once you finally beat them. I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a good open world RPG."
Positive,"""You might be a demi-god, but you will bleed to my Katana all the same"" is the most edgily factual thing I've said."
Positive,So wholesome of them to offer the lock-on system's design role to the office hamster
Positive,Thank you From Software for yet another masterpiece!
Positive,"Loving this game and would recommend to even the non souls game players. Great coop, if were not being disconnected and great solo content. A must play!"
Positive,"Its one of the best games I have ever played, the best souls game in my opinion"
Positive,Best game ive played in a while
Positive,"When a game is created as a labor of love, it shows. I hope that Elden Ring proves to people (specifically other developers) that soulless cash-grabs are NOT simply the way that AAA titles have to be marketed in the current day."
Positive,"Review in progress: Elden Ring is the culmination of FromSoftware and Hidetaka Miyazaki's hard work. It goes without saying that if you're a SoulsBorne fan, this is the game for you. If it is your first entry to a FromSoft Souls-like, this is unlike any other game you have ever played and you must go into it with an open mind. You will die and fail but those exact failures will push you to learn from your mistakes and ultimately reward you with a great sense of accomplishment for overcoming tough challenges. We live in an era in which gamers are used to being spoon-fed but Elden Ring is the exact opposite of what the gaming industry has become."
Positive,Man this game is great. Nuf said.
Positive,"Hidden path ahead!Edit after 100 hours of gameplay and 3 playthroughs:First of all I never played Dark Souls, so I thought this game will be a nice challenge for me. And hell yeah it was, sometimes you sit at one boss for hours and that feeling when you finally beat him is indescribable. This rollercoaster for your feelings is freaking awesome and you should try it too. You should be a patient person though. The world is beautiful as hell and you can discover many locations and secrets. I also liked it when I found some NPCs to talk with. They probably give you a quest so you definitely shouldn't kill them and have to read what they say to you, it isn't a Ubisoft game where you just follow your marker on your mini map. To sum up, if you like...- challenging bosses- nice boss designs- different gameplay than every run-of-the-mill game- a beautiful open world- discover new locations, NPCs or secrets- different endings to discover...you should definitely buy this game and give it a try.I think this game could be a little bit more stable though, sometimes it seems to randomly crash. I witnessed it more often when I tried to play coop with a friend than in solo. Since I played 95% of the time solo it wasn't terrible for me at all. I just wanted to mention the only negative point I have for that masterpiece.In my opinion the best game released in the last years!2nd edit: No more crashes at all"

And now. I have to go back failing to this boss :(

Positive,Im losing my life and my social skills but worth every penny.
Positive,yes very good haha :D :)
Positive,Just fucking get this thing!
Positive,"The ""masterpiece"" wasn't an exaggeration."
Positive,Done 100%The game did not feel that difficult UNTIL I came across you will know who. The first 3/4th of the game is a smooth ride.  The game is not stable and shutters a lot. Graphics is decent but the gameplay is what you play these games for and there is no complaint in that regard.Overall a fantastic experience. GLGOTY.

Positive,"This game has consumed me. In a good way, No microtransactions, no dumb mechanics, just good game."
Positive,Honestly open world souls games is really good buy it if you like souls games maybe pass up on it if they  are not your cup of tea also magic op
Positive,"WOW... holy... $@%!!!! This game is literally one of the greatest accomplishments to be released in I would say many years! I almost can't believe this game is real lol... I have put in 70 hours so far, and it took me some time to learn how these games work in terms of boss fights/mechanics/combat/ etc... The struggle has been real for me, but I cannot stop playing."
Positive,"Elden Ring is FromSoftwares masterpiece, and they've really outdone themselves this time. The reviews don't lie. The game is gorgeous, despite not being a groundbreaking ray tracing experience. There's a few frame drops in certain areas, but I found they stopped happening after awhile, even when I went back to affected areas.  Its world is a massive expanse with many different types of enemies, bosses, puzzles, and people to meet. Like always, the gameplay is phenomenal with a few added touches that really make it stand out (Also helps PVP feel truly unique.) The music, like always, gives you goosebumps and the feeling that you're always fighting something special. The story, like always, is slightly confusing but you come to understand it piece by piece as you explore and do side quests throughout the lands. Elden Ring is something special, and is 100% a 10/10 game. Please buy it, give it your all, don't let it beat you. And remember to take your time, there's a lot to find. Good luck, Tarnished."
Positive,"Good gamewhat the game does right is that it created a world that is very beautiful, and one that is also very intertwined. You will meet multiple npc's who end up becoming indirectly involved with each other, which in turn encourages a lot of exploring. Speaking of, there is SO MUCH to explore in this game, I spent ~110 hours in my first playthrough of this game, and still had a handful of dungeons and bosses i hadn't killed, and many, many, items to collect. There is also incredible replayability, as you can use many different builds you can try, and with mechanics such as ng+ you will always be needing to push yourself a bit more, as well as multiple endings you will definitely want to see. The only issues i would have is still performance issues, while few and far between, there are occasional frame drops, but not enough to say it impacted my experience. What did impact my experience is that some boss designs can appear to be lazy or tedious to fight, particularly in the end of the game. Still a masterpiece in my eyes though9.5/10"
Positive,"I think the best way to describe Elden Ring is Dark Souls Breath of the Wild. The complex combat systems that the Souls series is known for is evidently present within Elden Ring and is, perhaps, at its best. The inclusion of the jumping mechanic, though simple, opens up a new way to approach combat. Jumps attacks are an excellent way of shattering an opponents poise or even just dodging over an attack, made possible by the exceedingly tight hit boxes. The main pull of Elden Ring over previous Souls games is, of course, the open world. Honestly, I was somewhat skeptical that it would be a worthwhile addition and not just a way to pad time. Far too many games use repetitive and shallow systems to pad out game time. However, none of that is present in Elden Ring. The world is jam-packed with mini-dungeons to explore and bosses to fight. Every time I return to an area thinking I'd discovered everything that was in it, I find something else I'd missed. For example, one time I returned to the second area in the game to find an NPC I learned I missed from a friend. A little bit of exploring later and I'm in the middle of a tunnel far underground filled with giant ants that led to the ruins of an ancient city.  It's VERY easy to forget what you're doing and get lost in exploring the beautiful hand-crafted world.While I'm biased, I don't think Hidetaka Miyazaki and the team at From Software have ever produced a bad game, at least not in recent memory. Elden Ring builds on that legacy with what I belief is easily his best game to date. I'd recommend Elden Ring to anyone looking for a fantastic fantasy game to scratch that itch."
Positive,I've never played any Souls games before but I can describe it to being like a hardcore Skyrim. I'm ~65 hours into the game with maybe 50% of the bosses defeated.... Absolutely loving it. LOTS OF CONTENT
Positive,I level up. I find things. I kill things with the things I find. I win. 10/10 best game.
Positive,"This has to be FromSoftware's best game to date. This game doesn't hold your hand, and quite frankly this is a breath of fresh air compared to other current-gen RPGs.They took everything they learned from the Souls series and combined it with the QoL features Sekiro introduced and perfected it. Combined with the massive, massive open world filled with hidden dungeons, items, bosses and more, exploration is a joy instead of a chore. Crafting also is a welcome addition.It might not be as perfect as the reviews make it out to be because there are performance issues with random framedrops or stutters, but besides the Tree Sentinel at the start of the game it runs pretty flawless on my machine.If you enjoyed the Souls series, or are just looking for a great RPG with great combat this is it.Add to cart, G.Edit after 50 hours: The map just keeps getting bigger and bigger man, when will it end?? It's great."

Positive,"I had recently completed the Dark Souls trilogy, and nothing i could find out there could truly scratch the itch that had developed for the Dark Souls franchise. Then I heard about Elden Ring. Got super hyped, set my expectations high, and when it came out a week ago (yes, I know, nearly 100 hours in a week) my already-high-set bar was demolished! This game is beautiful, a true culmination of everything FromSoftware has learned from their other games. There are layers upon layers to this game. I am nearing the end, and rather than go to NG+, I am exploring the secrets of the world, which there are MANY. I still find myself going all over the map to explore areas I was unaware of.  Easily Game of the Year, possibly Game of the Decade. 1000/10. Absolute perfection and super addicting!"
Positive,Incredible game. One of the greatest games ever made. Just need to work on performance and some connection issues and its a straight 10/10. Buy this fucking game.
Positive,"when you play elden thing sometimes you fgeel like the top dog real big guy on campus king of the castle biggest bug on the branch, but other times you feel like the ugliest little bastard a tiny little guy a most insignificant teeny weeny jjokester of a man a real big glob of spit on the face of soemthjing beautiful if you play this game youre hwole heart will explode. i only think they sohuld remove the witches from this game theyr'e long crooked fingers make me scared."
Positive,"Apparently they fixed the multiplayer? Cant really tell by reading the patch notes neither see it mentioned anywhere, but haven't been getting the bug anymore[OLD]It is just amazing how its been 4 to 5 months since the game has been released and the multiplayer is still bottom pit unplayable garbage getting disconnected after 1 minute being summoned. Congratulations From Software, amazing game, d0g shit optimization and multiplayer."

Positive,Cock and Ball Torture
Positive,Except for the performance issues I really enjoyed my time with this game.
Positive,"Easily the magnum opus of FromSoft, they have successfully nailed every single thing from the combat, to the OST and the beautiful visuals.Despite not even being halfway through the year this is hands down the GOTY for 2022.I found myself enthralled in every aspect of the game, just going around exploring the map trying to complete everything took several hours of my time without me even noticing it and I enjoyed every second, the boss fights were amazing and even just regular encounters throughout the dungeons were fun and exciting.Words can't do this masterpiece enough justice, if you haven't already, please do yourself a favor and play the game.[09/12/2022]They actually did it and it couldn't have been more deserved, GOTY for 2022.Here's hoping FromSoft keeps blessing us with these amazing works of art."
Positive,yeah its good
Positive,try fingers but hole
Positive,"For those foreign to the Souls franchise:Do not let yourself be intimidated by its difficulty. In reality, none of the Souls games requires you to be a 'hardcore gamer', instead it requires you to bring patience, a bit of brain and bravery.After 3 years of wait, I can say that I am satisfied and happy with the game.In short, Elden Ring is a better and refined version of Dark Souls, which offers more content, more freedom and has way less tedious and annoying tasks to deal with. Unlike Dark Souls and Sekiro, there is no clear path. It is a true open world game, where you are free to go where ever you want. One of the strong points of Elden Ring is, that it reduces frustration and tedious tasks to a minimum. There is almost always a bonfire (checkpoint) after difficult sections or at least a shortcut to an already visited bonfire. Small but significant adjustments like infusion, changing your weapon art and leveling up are doable at the bonfire. The only time where you are forced to go to your hub, is when you want to upgrade your gear or when you want to learn new skills.Another major point which drastically reduces frustration is, that you don't have to walk all the way back to the boss any longer. There will always be a 'Stake of Marika' (which you don't have to interact with) near the boss room, where you will respawn after dying to the boss.The amount of freedom together with the amount of content you get can be overwhelming to newcomers and Souls-Veteran alike. Thankfully, the bonfires will most of the times, show you the way where you have to go next (to follow the main story) and if you forget something about an important mechanic of the game, you can always look it up in your inventory.The gameplay and combat in Elden Ring is comparable to Dark Souls 3 gameplay. There are no longer any rough or strange feeling gameplay mechanics and the game is now open to sorcerers and melee fighters aswell. The jumping mechanic from Sekiro, Powerstance from Dark Souls 2 and the new horse advances the combat in a new way. None of the new mechanics feel out of place or badly implemented and the world is designed around having these new mechanics.After having a blast with the bosses of Dark Souls 3 and Sekiro, I thought it would go the same way in Elden Ring. Sadly, that was not really the case this time. There are a lot of boss fights in this game, and almost all of the are technically way better than the previous titles, but the fun factor has gone down for me. Bosses are way to agile and most of them are masters of all. That means they can run and move around like crazy regardless if they are a giant stone figure and they can damage you from almost all distances. It is especially frustrating as a Greatsword (or Colossal Weapon) wielder, because as a slow but hard hitting player, you will miss a lot of strikes since they instantly adapt to the situation.That does not mean that there are not great boss fights in this game. For example:  Radahn was a great and creative boss fight, even though the community dislikes it. The second Godfrey boss fight is a great hand-to-hand bossfight. And there are countless more great bossfights in this game, but proportionally the amount of good boss fights have gone down.Last but not least, the optimization... In short, it sucks. There is no excuse for such a bad optimization. Stuttering, 60 FPS lock (even though the game runs perfectly fine at 144 FPS), you name it. After Sekiro's acceptable optimization, I had my hope high, but that was a slap in the face. In short, as a Souls-Veteran, I love this game. There hasn't been another game in years, where I spent so much time with joy and fun. It took me about 77 hours to reach the end and there wasn't a lot of downtime in my playthrough and additionally, I haven't seen everything of this game yet."
Positive,Holy Guacamole its Elden Ring (my bumhole) and its fire (curry)
Positive,Utterly perfect. Took everything that worked with Dark Souls 3 and combined it with fun and adventurous exploration of a deep and soulful world. This is art. This is what gaming should be :)
Positive,I love this game
Positive,"This game is basically a complete and total masterpiece. It's like every from soft game fusing into one, and it's so gorgeous. This game is like no other and will one-hundred percent be the best game of 2022. Though, I am recently having some major bugs of invisible terrain, or it simply not loading. I also have audio cuts. The bugs are obviously a sizable issue, but they can be fixed I have faith in the developers at from soft, given a month or two. Also, if anyone has any tips on how to fix these bugs, I would appreciate the help."
Positive,"This game is a masterpiece but literally nobody is mentioning the sheer amount of reused/recycled bosses, and how similar a lot of the optional areas are.    The bosses themselves are great but expect to fight the same ones over and over and over again, almost every boss you see is used again and again in other locations in the game, just with more health, and if you're lucky maybe they have a different weapon or magic type.     Exploring the world is amazing, especially when you first start playing, but after around 30 or so hours you will learn how the world is structured and it gets somewhat predictable (caves, catacombs, ruins etc) and alot of them are pretty similar.      But with that aside this game is masterfully made, although I think it's a little too big for its own good. It's a perfect balance between letting you figure things out for yourself like Dark Souls but also not being overly cryptic. The graphics are very good with lots of breathtaking locations and there's plenty of new features and gimmicks that make it stand out from other From Software games, which is all this game really needed to be great."
Positive,"An absolute titan of the medium, one of the greatest games of all time, period. You can't talk about gaming without talking about Fromsoftware and their work. They're that good, and that important. They've proved themselves time and time again.Elden Ring is unabashedly a FromSoft title and without a doubt was worth the wait.This game is massive, challenging, fun, and inspires a level of exploration and curiosity that I haven’t felt in an game for a long time.Together With George R.R Martin they have truly set out to make a world brimming with life, emotions and heavy atmosphere as you travel the lands between. Every character has their own motives, ambitions, and the one shining the brightest would be you. The player character, the Tarnished, as you overcome and seek out to become an Elden Lord.   It represents a amazing combination of their previous games and it's elements that all come together to create something fascinating, special, and unforgettable.Even with its few issues, mainly PC performance issues which i'm sure will get fixed. Elden Ring isn’t just the best game this year; it’s one of the best games ever made.10/10 patches is in it"
Positive,"I am so addicted to this game man, damn. HOLLLLLLY MOLLLYY.The performance issues are also being fixed, its a smoother experience now than before.The games GOTY man ggwp. IT HAS EVERYTHING ..WORLD IS MASSIVE. THIS IS A WORK OF ART .ELDEN RING blood runs through my veins."
Positive,"Its a wonderful open world game, one of the very best. There are always new and interesting and memorable places to explore. The boss fights are tedious in this one however. Not even hard just boring and tedious. They have tried some changes that def mix up what the player can do and that is nice but the bosses are just not fun. Buy this game and enjoy the world. Enjoy the side quests and small stories as those are def the best lore in the game."

Positive,"Long Version:Elden Ring is a beautiful designed souls game that is worth the wait. The essence of the souls series is there yet again, but it's much different than before. Say goodbye to the days where you have to explore everything linearly, and say hello to open world souls. I'd be lying if I said I didn't spent most of my time exploring. There is so much to see and so much to discover in this game, which in a way makes it feel like Breath of The Wild levels of exploration. Because it is an open world, I highly recommend you to explore every nook and cranny. The combat that I have experienced is spectacular to say the least. Starting with the combat, it feels so much likes Dark Souls 3. The only difference is that in Elden Ring, there are weapon combos, meaning your attack will not only be just a standard A B attack. Instead, you can have an A B C D attack combo for certain weapons, or an A B C D E attack combo. Weapon Arts are also better in this game. All weapons have their own default weapon arts, but you can now customize it to suit your build, making you have the perfect tool to beat baddies, with the perfect build that you desire.Enemies and Bosses are more unforgiving than ever. This game has got to have the most bosses out of all the souls franchise, even topping Dark Souls 2 bosses I dare say. Not only that, but each boss has their own personality if that make sense. Sure there are bosses that I have met are using the same model and attack, but some are just different. Major Bosses are the ones that catches the eye, as they are very well designed and so difficult that you have to hate it, and love it at the same time. The joy after beating a boss after your 100th time of dying will never get old.The downside of such an incredible game is that it is badly optimized for the PC, as this game was intended for next-gen console it seems. Stuttering, black screens, bugs, long loading times, and FPS drops do tend to happen from time to time. But that's all the cons that I can think of. If you are a fan of the souls series, I highly recommend you playing this game. If you are new to the souls series and are planning to start of with Elden Ring, I suggest you try a at least one souls game at the very least to test your mental strength. An easy 10/10 for me (ignoring the cons).Short Version:Game so hard and well designed it made me c**. Buy it now and play it now."

Positive,"Only soulsborne game I have played is Bloodborne and amount is somewhere around few hours. I never gitgud with it. I eyeballed Sekiro when it released, but I was not convinced to make the effort to learn and really get good with the game.However I know how appraised games fromsoftware has made and this time with open world just seemed tickling my pickle in right way.I hopped in knowing that its not gonna be easy, I fought that first boss encounter full 30 seconds and managed to hit it at least three times.I then found the practice/instruction cave and thought that ""this is fine, not that bad""I opened the door to enter Limgrave, Fought Tree sentinel just to realize this fight is not for me. Atleast not yet.I tried killing every guard in Gatefront but that one with big shield keeps handing my ass over me.This was basicly my first evening with Elden RingI watched some beginner tutorials and tips&tricks to get me started. I followed those and started exploring map and I keep learning and searching more and more about the game. And I must say I really do enjoy it although its not easy. There is challenge but when you do slay bigger enemy or find out of cave alive it feels so damn good. I am still not there to fight Margit or other ""first"" bosses, I'm gonna level up my character, gear and skills first. It feels I'm getting better with every encounter. I'm only 8,8 hrs in so far but I eager to get back with the game.I also love the messages one can left behind. I've actually been laughing for some masterfully placed messages.Now with 23 hrs in I have cleared several caves, found little bit of underground world, fought a few bosses and it feels like I have just scratched a surface. This game is just something else. I really do love it.44hrs in and still not even close to end game. I have several places that I never visited in first couple sections of the map and I do not have all of map opened yet. I have the option to respec my character and I am tempted to go full mage. My character is based on Vagabond and very HP and Strenght heavy but mages in this game seems to be really fun. Think I keep my character as heavy hitting knight for this one playtrough and for next will be completely another.60hrs in and still not full map open, there is so much to do and discover. This game is not only challenging with combat but also with quest lines and following them. There is zero hand holding in any aspect of the game, some part of me loves it, some find it a little tedious. This far I have completed several story bosses but still have a tons to do. Still loving it.78hrs in. I have reached capitol, now my vagabond build is level 100 and some smaller enemies makes no threat. Bigger enemies still gives good challenge, not mentioning boss which some are walk in a park and some keeps oneshotting me multiple times until I give up.117h took my first playtrough as a soulsborne noob and I have to say that this game goes #1 of my all time favorites. I ended up using larvar tear and made bleed build late game. I did runefarming here and there and got me level 197 this far. I'm gonna keep on farming and leveling up until ng+Elden Ring just keeps on giving. There are hundreds of places that I never got to visit on my first playtrough, there is multiple questlines that I never come across. Everything in Elden Ring is so well made. The level of details, combat, atmosphere, bosses and musics. I absolutely love this game and it still has so much more to offer.I forgot to update this review after finishing all of the bosses on first playthrough. I started ng+, I was around level 230, most of enemies were rather easy. I ran trough some quests that I had failed to complete in first playthrough, including Millicent. I had a long break from the game after finishing ng+, I came back at spring after dlc reveal. Last thing i was doing was farming runes, so I kept doing that. Now the dlc is out and I'm a good 15ish hours in, and I am absolutely loving it.Dlc is very challenging, even thou my build is now level 340 at very beginning I was doing nothing to enemies. I found scadutree fragments here and there and they do help.Golden Hippo is currently my worst nightmare, died countless times. I gave Reduvia dagger a change and I slay the beast on my very first try with dagger. God it felt good!I got pretty beefy pc and only minor complaiment is those fps drops when travelling from area to the next.(patched) That and locked 60fps (should have atleast 120 or unlimited).Biggest annoyance comes with controller. I Play with dualsense controller and button prompts are only for xbox controller. Not the end of the world but when there is actual Playstation version of the game why there is not option for dualsense/shock users."

Positive,For anyone that wants to hate themselves more than they already do but enjoy doing so in the process... this is the game for you.Also... Dog.
Positive,Best possible Souls game one could ever ask for.
Positive,this game is the best thing ever
Positive,"I have nearly gotten half way through this game to this point (I think lol). This game deserves the reviews it has received. This game is an absolute masterpiece. My life no longer exists outside of this game. This game has changed the way that I look at open world games, if not games in general. The game is beautiful, creative, exhilarating, challenging, etc. I could go on forever. HOWEVER - The game has some serious issues. It is a rough port. There are some pretty bad stutters in the open areas, my friends have experienced major issues with controllers (one took over an hour to repair the issue on launch), sound glitches, etc. I have high hopes that FromSoft will fix these issues with urgency, as they have already acknowledged these issues. Regardless of the clear performance issues that this game has, it is still one of, if not, the best game I have ever played in my life. This game will forever go down as one of the greatest games in history. FromSoftware has done it again and stepped it up 100 notches. For the beginners to this genre (SoulsBorne games): this game is a FromSoft game and it lives up to that reputation. It is difficult, but forgiving. I really recommend this game, even if you bounced off the other games or avoided them as a whole. If you hit a wall, there are at least 5 other ways to go while getting stronger. There is no feeling like overcoming a difficult boss or area after struggling and learning. Also, there is no scaling in this game. If you hit a wall, go get more powerful elsewhere and come back and smack the boss you are stuck on lol. TL;DR: Game Gud. Git Game. Git Gud."

Positive,try finger but hole
Positive,"Fort, nightGreat game"
Positive,"This game is the culmination of everything that FromSoftware have learned over the last decade. The brilliance of Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, Bloodborne and Sekiro shines truer than ever in Elden Ring. I'm 20 hours in and I haven't even LOOKED at the second main dungeon. I have never felt such awe, such love and such inspiration from a video game's open world and design before now. I knew from the moment that I saw the announcement trailer that this was going to be the game for me. Once the frame stuttering issues smooth out, I will be happy to raise my 10/10 to an 11/10. I am looking forward to playing and replaying this game for years to come, and I cannot wait to see how FromSoft manage to top this incredible effort - and I have no doubt that they will do just that."
Positive,try fingers but hole
Positive,"behold, fingers but hole"
Positive,This game is a must have if you ever wanted to play any kind of souls game. Even if you are a newcomer you should be able to enjoy the game. 10/10. With that being said this game is totally something worth giving a try and really digging your feet in and learning the game. There is so much to this game you can literally get lost on multiple quests as you traverse the open world. Have fun and remember to stay hydrated ;) <3I have played all the classes and honestly they only matter at the start you can spec any class for anything in game that you want to play. its a good game. really.
Positive,pog ring finding simulator pog
Positive,i finally found an illusory wall after 37 hours of hitting random walls with messages on them
Positive,"Well after 185 hours, and getting all achievements in 2 separate full play-throughs I can safely say this game is absolutely GIGANTIC. Every time you feel like you're coming to the end a whole new area opens up, or there's new places you've not discovered before. The sheer scale of this game is immense.The atmosphere and the world itself is a monumental feat, each zone has an extremely unique look and feel and play through vastly differently from one another. The weapon and armour variety is amazing, there's an endless amount of combinations between armour sets, weapons and ashes of war.As soon as I finished my first play-through I immediately dove back into the game for a second round and still discovered tons of things I had missed on the first time. I have very, very few gripes with this game and they are:NPC questlines - you can very easily lock yourself out of some endings or progressing some NPC quests. Even while using the wiki guide for some of them I ended up locking some of them up, not the end of the world but did put a bit of a dampener on some of the items and stories I wished to obtain.Crafting feels a bit tacked on, I've only used it a handful of times during my 185 hours of the game. The crafting isn't really a massive part of the game but I felt like there could've been items in the world to collect in order to craft some major game changing items but these are mostly for temp boosts and other small niche playstyles. My final gripe is the balance. Some places feel like a breeze while others feel like you've been shot into space with a difficulty spike, but for a game in such a scale as this and with the endless amount of things to do and see, you can bypass these spikes purely by over-levelling and dungeoning in the areas you're struggling around.All in all, the best game I've ever had the chance to play, and I cannot wait to see what they do with DLCs and the future of this game and others like it. FROMSOFT has set the new standard for openworld games that do not hold your hand."
Positive,Elden Ring is a mastapiece.
Positive,"It does have performance issues, but this game is fucking worth it. The worst of it is 1-2 second stuttering when going to a new area but other than that runs great and is a great game."
Positive,Game of the year.
Positive,"Pros:-> an actual soulsborne openworld. You will never find any other comparable to this.-> lots, lots and lots of things to do. Discovery, destroy and devote your attention to the breathtaking world.-> cool boss. By cool I mean THE BEST BOSS FIGHTS OF ALL SOULSBORNE.-> a beautiful world. The best world portray in-game I have ever seen in my 15 years of gaming.Cons:-> Optimization. Stutter is constant in early game areas.-> Unclear lead on sidequests. You can miss out from them if you arent in the know already.-> EXTREMELY unbalanced gameplay between classes. You want easy game? go sorcery. You want to dance along with a mountain sized boss for half an hour? go non-ranged class.-> Imbalanced design on enemies, even for a soulsborne game they are unbalanced, especially mid and late game.-> Imbalanced design on bosses. Everybody has healing/buffing detection and lunges at you whenever you do as so. Everybody also has delayed strikes for breakfast and instakilling AOE for lunch. Oh and the AOEs are delayed as well.Overall a 20/10. The best game I have ever played."
Positive,"Pros:Graphics look really good.Areas are beautiful.Music is great.Bosses are mostly great.Voice acting is good.Movement and combat is great, like all the souls games merged into one.Exploration is great.Story is good, nothing crazy but not bad either.Cons:The endgame main bosses are ds2-tier actual hot garbage in my opinion, because there are so many fast attacks that are so annoying to dodge and the gameplay is not fun at all. Bosses I'm talking about are [WARNING: SPOILERS] Radahn, Fire Giant, Godskin Duo, Ragadon and Elden Beast (Who thought fighting two bosses in a row was a good idea? It's not fun in the slightest.)Over half of the bosses are copy-pasted over the world, like literally the exact same boss just with a slightly different name, even some of the actually good bosses are copy-pasted. (This doesn't include main bosses) It just personally seems like a very ""lazy"" decision but I can understand that they had a deadline to fulfill, I still think the game should've been delayed a few months or maybe even a year more for this reason.Music is great but there could be more music in the overworld, as the music gets pretty samey after a while, not a huge issue though.A few microstutters here and there but nothing major to be honest, still I would prefer if there weren't any at all.Dungeons could've had a little bit more, maybe a bit better bosses in some because, quite a lot were forgettable and way too easy in my opinion.Conclusion:Not the worst but it's also definitely not the best souls game I've played. I'm a bit on the fence with this one. Because it has really good aspects but also really bad aspects, kind of like Dark Souls 2. I would still recommend you buy and play it for sure, for all the good content it also has to offer. A welcome installment to the souls-like game genre, but it could've been even better.bruh"
Positive,"Oke so I finished this game. Its good. Its too long. From Software has just updated their formula enough to keep the souls like gameplay interesting. But it's wearing thin by now. After 10 years of playing their games, it is all starting to feel like same old. Even the story purportedly written by George R. R. Martin has clearly been moulded to fit their tired old cliches (gods of blood, thunder dragons, humans that become beasts, lakes of rot, death spewing lizards, leaping hound knights, zombies, scimitar wielding skeletons, sentient dolls, sound familiar?). The parts that are fresh, are excellent (erdtree, haligtree, some parts of Luirnia of the Lakes, Ancestral Followers).The weapon/magic combat and UI have barley evolved in a decade, and I look back now realising how ridiculous that is. If this is your first foray into souls like BUY THIS. It is the apex, the best iteration so far. But for someone who has played these games for so long its a bit disapointing. Its stops being great around 60% through the game (by the time you reach the trees door, if you did every region before that). Because by then you have fought more than 80% of the enemies the game has to offer and you're in for fighting their higher HP versions in more difficult terrain."

Positive,"With Elden Ring potentially being another Game of the Year from Fromsoft, I had no choice but to try it. After playing Elden Ring for some time, I realised this game has one massive flaw.With massive content and world to be explored, I can’t keep getting this out of my head, this game is unplayable. No, no, not because of the performance issues, yes it’s still early and it a bit shit on that part, but I’m having fun for now. The invisible enemies at first I thought it’s a issue with the rendering, in which enemies slightly becomes visible when attacking or something like that, then I realised it’s not the game’s fault but it’s just my character being an aristocratic prophet that’s blind, especially towards the plebians.The said flaw is the TIME itself. Being somewhat busy along with thesis and publication to write, it’s hard for me to find relaxing time to fully enjoy and explore this world. Being limited in time made me consider my life choices, and even considered taking performance enhancing time medicines, but it’s very expensive so I decided not to. One reliable source of a certain coloured panda says that time flies when you’re having fun, so I decided to do something that’s not fun, my thesis, then I realised it’ll just make time move faster towards the deadline. Trying to deflate Rune as a currency to accelerate my progress doesn’t work either because I don’t have a degree in economic. As an engineer in third world country, I had no choice but to methodically plan my steps ahead and clear the area sector by sector, but that’ll take too much time and I’m not a computer solving a numerical problem, so I just decided to take a rest and enjoy the game bit by bit whenever I want and going whereever my interest drag me into.Och det är min erfarenhet.Post 1.04:- Been enjoying the game even more, haven't tested the 1.04 multiplayer.- After some stress tests the enemies still load fast enough.- So far no invisible enemies spotted yet.- FPS ramped up and stable around 35-40ish, which before was around 15-25, completely surprised me honestly and feels unnatural to be running smoothly for me.On the serious note:- Site of Grace very close to boss/challenge area and Stakes of Marika very welcomed no longer having Iron Passage or Frigid Outskirts PTSD.Previous complaints:- The invisible enemies are annoying, both when speeding with Torrent or the game’s rendering just being a massive cunt. Had to quit and re-enter to temporarily fix that. Updated my graphic driver and the invisible enemies still are annoying, especially when storming a castle and stuffs like that.- Minor FPS drop on heavy load (such as in Stormhill) just slightly bothering me especially if the rendering’s cucked after that, other than that I don’t really mind it.- It’s fun and lots of stuffs to do, just slightly annoying to collect EVERYTHING (which I barely can resist to not do) and 100% this. Due to first problem I have trust issues when traveling because at a time I can’t see any entities, especially when taking damage out of “nowhere” from invisible enemies.- Since both of my PS3 controllers absolutely shagged I had no option but to use KBM, compared to PTDE it’s a lot better, probably similar to DS3, but I rarely use KBM for that so I forgot. Never used KBM for DS2/SotFS. Due to more varied control it’s a lot more complicated compared to Sekiro’s godsent KBM control. After slight rebinding, KBM control is very enjoyable.- Bug during Rennala's fight where the minions won't have golden aura meanwhile the one that's meant to have golden aura will emit purple light attempting to cast the books, which when this bug happened non existent, and hitting/killing them won't progress through the fight. Alt+F4 and re-entered fog gate got the bug fixed.EDIT: Additional info and typo fix.EDIT 2: Updated for 1.04."
Positive,"after an initial playthrough, the game is what was promised to us and more. i still have to test out the newly added npcs and the fixed questlines as well as the other endings. gameplay is very dark souls esque but the game pushes you to try out more varied builds as compared to the previous games. if youre not playing this game youre missing out on an absolutely phenomenal world."

Positive,"This is a fantastic game with a beautifully crafted world and story. The gameplay is fun, albeit very imbalanced. Most shortcomings are easily overlooked by all of the positive things this game has to offer. Elden Ring brings forth classic darksouls vibes while expanding massively on the mechanics. Ashes of war are brilliant an add so much utility and possibility to various weapons and builds. Magic actually feels usable this time around, and rolling feels much more balanced compared to DS3The only flaws that aren't passable are the multiplayer functionality, and the crappy netcode. I hope to see balance changes in the near future, as well as better options for pvp entirely.I get disconnected from most of my co-ops and invasions. If I'm not getting disconnected, the host's phantom is getting disconnected mid invasion. Inexcusable considering this games budget.I would give Elden Ring a 9.5 out of 10, but I can't justify a near perfect score with the problems listed above. 8.5 out of 10"
Positive,"I'd say this game deserves a neutral review in its current state. The game itself is amazing. There's a lot to do, tons of bosses to fight, and some pretty cool new mechanics. Honestly one of the best games I've ever played.However, the performance issues are atrocious. Random FPS drops during boss fights feels terrible. Not to mention you're almost unable to explore some parts of the open world because of how bad it can get. Everyone I know has performance issues to some degree, despite their setup. With all that being said, buy at your own risk. The game itself is great, but they really need to work on the performance issues and crashes."
Positive,"I understand that there are currently some performance issues involving the game, which I have experienced a little bit myself (stuttering and frame drops); however, it was not game break, nor did it really ruin my experience. There has already been an update to fix some of the issues with the anti-cheat! Hopefully, another update will help improve the game's stability. The gameplay is incredibly fun and challenging, just like one would expect from a souls game. There is so much to explore, and the world never really feels empty. Bosses are scattered about in dungeons and just roaming. I haven't tried multiple, so I can't say anything about that. One thing I want to add about the reviews for the game. I find it incredibly annoying that there are negative reviews from people who wrote the review one hour preceding to play another 20 hours of the game. I hope that these reviews change, but it is simply unfair to the game and its developers. To clarify, I have no problem with someone simply not enjoying the game and leaving a bad review or if the game is unplayable because of crashing or lag, but to shit on a game then play 20 hours just doesn't make sense. TLDR: Good game should buy!"
Positive,"I have played for 8 hours, just got to the castle, and I am in love with this game. Are there performance issues? Yes. I know that it is going to hit some set ups harder than others. What I always do with all my games is turn off Motion Blur and Depth of Field immediately. This seems to have helped my playtime because while I have seen some slowdowns, I haven't anything like what people are sharing. The game itself is so good, my favorite out of the series. I am not saying that performance doesn't matter, it really really does in a Souls game. What I am saying is that I have played 8 hours and I want to play 100 more hours of this, even with the performance."
Positive,"As a longtime soulsborne fan, I gotta say. This the best work Fromsoft has done yet. The world feels alive, the combat is refreshingly good, the variety of enemies is satisfying and the graphics... Oh lord the graphics are amazing. The only minor problem I had was the stutters at the Tree Sentinel, but they weren't gamebreaking so I didn't complain that much. Other than that the game is smooth asf. It's hard but not frustrating, it's challenging yet rewarding. The dopamine I feel after beating even the weakest fore after being fucked in the ass by it multiple times is breathtaking. They took every good aspect from every Souls game, mashed it all up together and gave you a vast, open world that feels fucking alive. Sneaking and jumping are a huge addition and I'm glad they added those features from Sekiro. The Co-op experience is also so much fun. There is so much more I want to say about this game but I really can't put them into words. Best Soulsborne game yet. As soon as they fix the minor stutter issues(which I believe they will really soon.) There shouldn't be a problem. People are overreacting a bit in my opinion. The other bad reviewers who just call the game dogshit, I have only two impactful and real words that should help out.Git gud."
Positive,"Recommendation: VERY Strongly Recommended.If I have to compare it with any existing games it would be Witcher 3, Breath of the Wild, and Dragon's Dogma (all themselves reminiscent of Skyrim) in Dark Souls. Elden Ring is best of both worlds, open world and metroidvania in dungeons. It's a world where there's always something to do. There's no markers littering the map, exploration is rather encouraged and feels greatly rewarding. No quests markers forcing you to go one way or another, no sense of forced urgency in main story, at least so far. And about dungeons, they're finely crafted large maps, classic souls style, with lore and secrets sprayed along the whole levels.With the vast amount of classes, weapon and magic types there's a huge room for creative play styles and customisation; sessions of multiple people will have different experiences, where you may miss or gain different items according to where or how you explore, and how strong or skilled you are.Now about my pc:GTX 1650RAM 16 GBi7 gen 9Win 11My graphics card surely is lower than minimum requirements, but so far I've been running game on more than 30 FPS with no stutter, and minor franedrops which happen rarely, nothing game breaking. It could've been better, but then it's a big open world with no loading screen.My review: 10/10 it's a must play."

Positive,"Dark Souls in an open, fully explorable environment.Say Less."
Positive,"I feel it needs to be said at least once. In this ill be addressing many of the negative reviews. Scroll down for tldr.Yes, some people do have frame rate issues, but the majority of the negative reviews are from rich kids to egotistical and bloated with their 3080's to turn settings down, wondering why their rtx card cant handle max graphics. I'm playing with the recommended specs (on an old Aurora R7), on high, 0 issues. none. whatsover. yes, there is a 60fps cap, but come on, the game wasn't designed for 4k 240hz. There have also been some issues discussed about crashing. depends on the case, but i've found that spamming alt-tab and turning graphics too high is the reason. There are legitimate issues with framerate and gpu allocation, and there are many guides to help fix - but at least turn your settings down first before posting a negative review.~~Onto another point, yes the anticheat may have been rushed, but to all that complain about not being able to mod the game - would it really be fair with the level of online compatibility Elden Ring has? Sure I understand the want to mod the game, but I could only see it actually working out in an offline-exclusive mode.~~Edit: Modding community is amazing, you should check out the coop modUltra-wide moniters. Mate, just because you have money doesnt mean you get everything you want. Sure i understand some complaints and legitimate reasons, but really? review bombing just because? Just because you are fortunate enough to have a top tier gaming rig, doesn't mean everyone else does. I'm actually impressed by the level of compatibility Elden Ring has, as most AAA Steam releases nowadays require a rtx gpu and a ryzen threadripper just to open. Just deal with the black bars and get over it.tldr: Yes there have been issues with framerate and crashes, but the majority are just people too egotistical to turn settings down. ~~Modding~~ and proper Ultra-wide support should be added, but neither being present actually detract from the game at all."
Positive,is this dog?
Positive,It's... it's incredible. It is truly one of the games ever made.
Positive,"I haven't played much yet, but after one night of playing I know I'm going to grind through this game like my life depends on it. All I need to say. Anyone that enjoyed DarkSould or Sekiro will love this game.In the topic of performance.... Yes the game stutters, yes the game is capped at 60FPS (Sekiro was too and won GOTY), Honestly, neither of these things make the game unplayable. SEVERAL games have been release recently that had FAR worse technical issues than this game on launch. I don't agree with dropping bad day 1 reviews that based on issues that are likely to be repaired soon and don't make the game unplayable."
Positive,They will fight and they will die... in an unending curse !

Positive,"I have had hard fps issues but I so got that issues fix by turning off or too low- Depth of Field- Volumetric Lighting- Global Illumination QualityThese three setting is the main reason the fps in the game is so bad for me and from what I understand I had the same issues with Dying Light 2 and I have an an good ass PC (3070 OC, i7 9700k, 32GB RAM 3600mb, 3TB M.2). The is the Global illumination,and Volumetric Lighting turn these down and you should be good till they patch these setting. I hope this helps if not let me know in the comments and I *MIGHT* be able to help you (Dending on the PC hardware).PS. some of you people need to calm tf down the game just released it sucks that we have these fps problems but other then that the game is 10/10"

Positive,"The good:1-Has the best gameplay in any souls game (You'd say Sekiro, but that's not a souls game).2-Has the best build variety.3-By far has the best scenery and colors.4-Great voice acting and cutscenes.5-The best open world implementation to date for a PvE game. Which doesn't mean the open world in Elden Ring is perfect, it just means that the open world genre is generally weak.The bad:1-Has the worst enemy variety. It kept the same enemy variety as other souls games, but the game scale is now like 10 times bigger. 2nd half of the game has absolutely 0 new enemy types, and reused even some of the main bosses.2-The game is not designed with replayability in mind, definitely a one playthrough experience. NG+ cycles changed absolutely nothing besides the usual more HP, more damage values, and more runes.3-Following the previous point, the legacy dungeons are completely isolated open world landmarks.In my opinion, they should've been interconnected through underground pathways and areas. So once you've reached your first legacy dungeon through the open world, you wouldn't have to go back to the open world again. Of course you have the option to find all of these legacy dungeons in the open world.Note: I understand that the game was designed with a particular vision in mind, and I definitely don't know better than the game designers.But that vision didn't help the replay value at all...4-Boss quality is definitely weaker than Dark Souls 3 (Not including the DLCs). The game heavily relies on boss mobility, spamming attacks, super delayed attacks, duo bosses that have completely independent AI patterns, and in some cases unavoidable damage.Once you've figured out how to deal with these bosses they become super uninteresting to fight again, because they were designed to frustrate you rather than being a fun challenge. Which as a result also impacts the replay value of the game negatively.Part of this issue is the fact that they introduced the spirit ash summoning mechanic, and they had to balance the game around it somehow.5-Sites of Grace spam. The game has like 300 of those. Gone the days when finding a shortcut or a new bonfire had a weight to it.6-To this day, the PC port is still suffering from optimization issues. Let alone the fact that the game is built using an outdated engine."

Positive,Got some maidens
Positive,Play it. Nothing else needs to be said.
Positive,They ruined the  PvP balance with this game. Any shi tter with a half decent weapon art can beat an experienced player.Singleplayer is good though.
Positive,"I've never experienced this much joy playing a souls game. I've also never experienced this much joy playing an ""open world"" game. There are so many nods to FromSoft's past titles. If you've labored over their previous games, you'll likely catch these little tip-of-the-hats as you make your way through the game. I'm absolutely in love. Cheers, and happy exploring"
Positive,"-=EN=-1 out of 10 is just disgusting - the world is not a continuous swamp, and the Torrent does not know how to do rolls (just kidding). By the way, this is still the good old From Software, playing games where you sweat and bleed, but overcoming difficulties you feel “well done” :-) Many varied and exciting bosses, but some of them were too often repeated. PVP is more exciting than ever with only one BUT - you can only invade co-op, waiting for the DLС with the arena. The main thing is a good and complete game without nasty NFTs, gacha mechanics, loot boxes, battle passes and skins. The only thing to be afraid of is DLC, but we have nothing against them :-) Thanks to Miyazaki and the whole From Software company for being human. They don't milk their fans at a time when almost all AAA companies are only thinking about how to make money on players by releasing half-finished games with an in-game store. All that remains to be said is - ladies and gentlemen, we got it ""Game of the Year 2022""!!!"
Positive,"fort, nightTl:DR, new favorite game of all time, has the best aspects of every previous Soulsborne games, gorgeous worlds to explore, awesome combat and boss fights, and adds accessibility while still retaining that difficulty we all know and loveThis game I feel has went beyond my expectations of what exactly was in store for me. Just the fact alone that is has dna of every Soulsborne game + Sekiro alone is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of how incredible this game is - Weapons and especially spells feel great to use, locations are drop dead GORGEOUS HOLY CRAP and the combat feels like a natural evolution to the dark souls formula, even reaching into the moveset pool of certain bosses to give them further identity. Being able to jump somewhat like in Sekiro without that awkward ass running start is something I didnt even think was needed but I'm glad its a thing now. It helps to spice up both the level design and boss encounters. Being able to stealth is also pretty neat, though I didn't use it as much. There are plenty of dungeons and caves that feel hella better than the chalice dungeons in Bloodborne and while they do tend to reuse bosses in the same way, in a game as big as this, this is something I can easily forgive. Also powerstancing is back from DS2! Maybe not in the same exact way since now it requires two of the same weapon types but its still great nonetheless. magic works the same way like in Demon Souls and DS3 but now it is WAAAY more potent than ever before. Even weapon arts are back and some can be customizable while others are unique to a specific weapon.Even the story itself is thematically the opposite of Dark Souls, where instead of a story about the inevitable downfall of everything and trying to hold on to as much of humanity as we can, it's about the ambition of humanity, and how far we can stretch it. It still does have its depressing moments, and times that were just outright unsettling. It's even got probably the funniest moments in any Soulsborne game, too Another incredible aspect about this game is how unbelievably accessible this is in comparison to previous games while simultaneously retaining the difficulty of said games. The only flaws i could really come up with is how optimization was a little funky at times, though it doesn't help that my pc is pretty meh, and pvp is in a funny state where almost everything does a lot of damage. Also damage scaling against you as you progress can be a lil funky at times, which might be a way to encourage players to go and explore more.Overall, I cant recommend this enough to those willing to try the genre - It's got the best aspects of every prior Soulsborne games, it's more accessible than before, and the combat feels incredible as usual. Dare i say - this is becoming my new favorite game of all time. Though pricey, it is totally worth it!"
Positive,Its no Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin but its ok
Positive,"Elden Ring is a good game but not without flaws. Below are my personal thoughts of the gamePros:1. Beautiful, mostly dense open world that continues to be engaging with it's dungeons throughout2. Many different bosses, with a increased amount of depth with applicable ashes of war and jumping within battle3. Some of the most difficult bosses which will challenge old time veterans of the souls series, while still being more accessible to newer players than older games4. Rewards feel rewarding - constantly new spells, weapons, etc (massive variety)5. Quests are easier to follow along, especially with the ability to unfail quests at times and revive npcs6. Many different playstyles you could play. Almost all playstyles are viableCons:1. Many reused bosses. While I do understand that having a massive open world may permit some reuse, seeing not only minibosses, but major bosses reused in the game does overall bring down how ""special"" that boss feels. It is also not fun to see bosses not designed for ganks put together, as well as bosses with their massive hp pool as regular enemies2. Horseback combat boss fights. While fun in the early game, horseback combats with melee builds in the middle to late game become a repetitive process of running in, getting a few hits and repeating, with risk of being oneshot due to the stun of being knocked off, which are just not fun to me personally.3. The crafting system. Yes, the crafting system can be fun for casual play and just going around naturally during a playthrough to make items, but at the end of the game I think it would be so much more convenient for a bell bearing which lets you buy crafting materials/those items because farming materials isn't very fun and takes alot of time. If the implementation of a crafting system means required farming for materials to make items for pvp, then we lose out on potential variety and cool builds that could've been used.4. the (currently) busted pvp. While i have no doubt things will be patched, certain weapons, shields, and spells are just too busted and unfun to play against (rivers of blood, fingerprint shield, stars of ruin spell spam). Backstabs are basically not viable within pvp, due to their low damage compared to simply doing certain attacks, as well as their difficulty to land and long failure animation which leads you extremely vulnerable. Duels are usually more fun, but also have some of the same issues.5.Some areas can feel a bit empty with alot of open space with not much in them.6.Unincentived coop - coop within the open world itself is never incentivised because there are no rewards for doing so. This means majority of open world cooping people will be password summons with friends - and that invaders will just never leave these people alone because of this system where invaders are not aware of this and naturally choose to invade the open world, as you would think to do. This leaves no breaks for the actual cooping friends and isn't very fun. I might have more to say about the game, but currently cannot think of anything else at the moment, but will update the review if i think of anything. Overall, i think the game is an 8/10"
Positive,No issues from my end. Games fucking good.
Positive,"This is the best fromsoft game that you can buy on something that isn't the PS4. Don't be sad that all the enemies are mean to you and keep calling you tarnished, there's a lady in the hub area that will give you a hug."

Positive,"Dark Souls 4, yes good"
Positive,its pretty good
Positive,Loving almost everything so far!! The deaths are well deserved and earned lol.  First time fully playing a souls type of game and very much enjoying it.  Can easily see so much care and detail has gone into the game from the combat mechanics to the variety of enemies and exploring alone.   My only gripe is that the story is not so easy follow along with and you have to read items and such to keep pace with it.  Otherwise so far I give the game a 9/10 for the amount of hrs I have played.  Will update review much further into the game if I get that far lol.
Positive,"forgot to review this back in the daynice game over all but please never make an open world game ever again, just take the good parts of this and replicate it and i swear your next game will be game of the decade"

Positive,"10/10Dark Souls on some next level steroids, takes everything good from there previous titles and builds upon them. The world design is next level and I found myself blown away at every new location. Looking forward to my next play-through and some PVP. Also highly suggest playing through this blind its a good throwback to gaming back in the day when the internet wasn't a thing."
Positive,"Probably the best souls game. Got more content than all the previous Dark Souls games put together(At least in my opinion)For those who say the game is boring, they most likely haven't played souls games before and just say it, cause they get stuck on a boss which is completely normal.I have about 145 hours right now, and I still have not even finished my first playthrough. Lots of content, lots of things to find, lots of bosses to beat up and lots of items to find.If you like exploring and enjoy tough challenges, puzzles and making your own decisions.. then I highly recommend this game. Pros+Big open world+A lot of bosses+Don't need to get laid, cause Elden ring screws you everytime+A lot of items of all sorts to find+Many different weapons+Game doesn't really hold your hand. Therefore you are kind of on your own.Cons- PvP can feel bad when your opponent is from other side of the planet and they start warping and feel like they're impossible to hit, since their hitbox usually is not where their character model is.-Sometimes in Co-op and PvP you get disconnected and thrown back into your own world(Most likely getting fixed in near future)- decent/good faith spells/skills you get around mid-late game so just be vary of this when starting as a faith build."

Positive,"Try finger,but whole."
Positive,"My first Souls game and wow.- The lack of hand holding it terms of nearly aspect of the game is so refreshing in an industry where games go out of their way to have everything given to you and told to you.- The difficulty is what it is, but the sense of accomplishment after winning, after beating that boss is absolute ecstasy.- The art style is dark and aesthetic, and the views of the world are absolutely incredible. From endless night to the endless light of the Erdtree, there is so much to see and so much to appreciate.- The dark art style and difficulty of the world contribute to immersing you in the world and how dangerous it really is. Any enemy can kill you, giving you an almost paranoia for every enemy, as you should. Enemies aren't necessarily considered fodder to keep you busy. They are appropriately placed throughout the world and feel as though they have a reason to be there. Also, the range of types of enemies is great too. True, eventually some early game bosses become late game mobs, but it doesn't feel over used, so I'm okay with it.Look, the game was incredible for me and I simply could not stop playing it, even after completing my first playthrough, hell even after completing my second playthrough and 100% the game. I enjoyed it thoroughly and am eagerly anticipating the time when its made its way out of my system and I can have a fresh playthrough again."
Positive,"I have never come across a game that has so thoroughly convinced me of it's worldbuilding. So easily pulled me into the loop of playing it and not even knowing why. But simultaneously, I do not how I feel about it. This game is very good. Of that I am sure. Not everyone will enjoy it the same way. And that is intentional, as it has always been, and all the Souls games have been before it. But this game specifically has been made to accommodate players from all walks of life, accounting for input and feedback given from the previous games. This game is both a dark souls game, but it is also a traditional open world RPG, above and beyond the extent of anything you expect. And if anything blew my mind, it was the extent to which FromSoftware incorporated the open world aspect into this game. The game is big.Very big. and then bigger again.and then bigger again.I was previously playing because I enjoyed Dark Souls. Now I am playing because I love Elden Ring."
Positive,Solid 20/10. A game that truly lives up to it's hype. It'll be very hard to pick up other games after playing this masterpiece.
Positive,"Attacks chest to make sure it's not a mimic""Ha! You won't get me like that anymore!""gets teleported into a mine""Ah...! Aaahhh SH*T!""10/10 would get spirited away again"
Positive,"Incredibly beautiful, Well put together game, obsessed, first non fps game I’ve enjoyed in a long time! Just needs a update  on co-op then it’s flawless!"
Positive,Loving it. We stan Boc.

Positive,"try finger, but hole"
Positive,10/10 would kill god again
Positive,Best game of the decade
Positive,Best game ever made!
Positive,This game makes me hard
Positive,"Elden Ring is one of the best open world RPGs ever made due to some key differences that ultimately results in more player engagement than other games; ambiguity of mission directions, surprise element every corner and the feeling of progression that oozes through every hour.Feels like you are really in control of the character because the immersion is set high by utilizing very minimal UI and all kinds of special post processing effects. The game is hard but it's balanced by the fact that you can grind and push through any difficult choke point. Good enough variety with weapons, skills and enemy designs that feels complete on most cases. After you finish the game, be sure to do PvP duels as it's probably the most fun I've had in a while.Not for everybody for sure but if you really want that old non-hand holding games that requires some brain power and a long ass game, go for it and enjoy the open world and epitome of visual storytelling."
Positive,"Falling leaves simulator with occasional frustrations in Between...Also, GOTY 2022 :)"
Positive,"Performance could be a bit better (atm), but it's still a great game"

Positive,"FOREFATHERS ONE AND ALL, BEAR WITNESS!!!!"
Positive,"best dlc fromsoft has ever putout, the most fair experience. Dancing lion may have taken me 7 hours, but i loved every single of it. And Radahn...oh my god that phase...when I finally beat it, i screamed and cried...tough but fair imo, 10/10"
Positive,"Elden Ring has quickly become one of my favorite games of all-time. I'm not at all surprised that it won Game of the Year, but I'm very pleased by it.There's really not an adequate way to describe the sense of adventure and discovery that this game inspires in me. Every new area is a treat to explore (yes, even Caelid... terror can be a treat), and every new enemy is a puzzle to solve. The gameplay is so smooth and satisfying. The music is lovely. And the ambiance... the ambiance! It's quite possibly the best in any game I've ever played. Not because of the graphics themselves, per se, though they're certainly good, but the incredible art direction and just... the WORLD they put together.Yes, there have been times where I've wanted to beat my head against a wall because of a boss--but even so my deaths never really felt unfair, as though the game was pointlessly punishing me, but rather there was some mistake that I made, something I needed to improve. Roll here, attack there, run away when the boss does this. This game is challenging, but it's not really difficult. I'm a fairly average gamer, and I've been able to beat most bosses in 1-3 tries, because honestly, this game gives you so many tools to utilize for success. Summons, ashes of war, spells, shields, dual-wielding, stat resets for if you decide you don't like your build... If there's anything you take away from this review, please let it be that this game is really NOT as hard as people make it out to be... you just have to take your time and learn what methods work best for you, and what's effective against the enemies you're fighting.I've played through most of the game solo, but messages are such a great addition that I'm really glad they carried over from the Souls series, because for me, they create a real sense of community, even when you're exploring alone. When you finally beat a tough boss and read somebody's ""I did it!"" or ""First off, well done."" or when you spend ten minutes doing a tricky bit of Torrent-parkour and reach a high peak only to read ""fort, night""... when there's an impassable door and you get the ol' ""You don't have the right, o you don't have the right""... it adds a great touch of camaraderie and humor into what is otherwise a fairly serious game (well, as serious as you can get in a game with bosses like a behemoth of a man wielding gravity magic in order to ride around on his teeny lil horsey). Plus, it's always a blessing when people give you hints of ""trap ahead"", etc.All that being said, this game is certainly not perfect. The storyline is decent, but not incredible. If you care about completing questlines, you'd better be prepared to consult the wiki a lot. There's also still a fair bit of jankiness when it comes to certain quests and the triggers for things where you might have to jump through some hoops to get them to work properly. It's easy to get lost, even with the grace arrows guiding you. Despite having a great many tools to utilize to succeed, there are some important things that are left up to chance or are never really explained, some of which can very well be missed if you happen to skip resting at a site of grace or talking to an NPC. For instance, I beat a good chunk of Limgrave and the Weeping Peninsula before I, totally by chance, sat at the Gatefront Ruins site of grace and was gifted Torrent. And I was halfway through Liurnia before I figured out that there are MAP FRAGMENTS TO COLLECT... lol.All that said, none of these drawbacks put much of a dent in my enjoyment of the game. If this sounds or looks at all like something you might enjoy, I totally recommend it, whether on sale or at full price. It's worth every penny.P.S. When the game first came out I played over 100 hours on a laptop that didn't even meet the minimum specs and had terrible frame drops at random intervals, which made bosses VERY DIFFICULT, but I still couldn't stop playing and I had a blast. Now that I've upgraded my computer, I'm having even more fun, lol."
Positive,Help. I have an addiction.
Positive,best game i've played since owning a pc

Positive,"""Elden Ring is a masterclass in challenging and rewarding gameplay, seamlessly blending Hidetaka Miyazaki's visionary world-building with George R. R. Martin's narrative depth. The vast and beautifully haunting open world is a playground for exploration, filled with intense combat and jaw-dropping visuals. A true epic that sets a new standard for action RPGs."""
Positive,Amazing world and gameplay. If for some reason you dont want to finish the game alone there is an amazing mod named Seamless coop that lets you play the complete game from start to finish with your friends. Either way the experience is a must
Positive,"This game is fantastic, it is my first dark souls type of game and i enjoyed it heavily, the lore was mesmerizing and the graphics were a feast to the eyes. There are a huge number of weapons and spells to use with unique attributes for each. I heavily recommend this game and i am definitely considering to buy a darksouls game later on! Overall,an A*  99/100"
Positive,If this does not win game of the year I am killing someone
Positive,Great game! Very fun and challenging at the same time
Positive,I dont know what is going on but I like it.
Positive,What can i even say? this is easily the best soulsborne game created and possibly the best game ever made.very refreshing
Positive,"Skyrim/WoW on steroids with buckets of atmosphere. I love this game! It's definitely more ideal to controller users, but you can make a working keyboard/mouse bind easy enough to the point it feels like a PC game and not a console port. I'm pretty much used to playing this with keyboard and mouse now, took a few hours to get used to it, but it's fine. My only advice is to just explore everything for yourself, avoid anything on Youtube so the game doesn't get ruined. Definitely the best game I've played in a long while."
Positive,"This game is like wearing one of the most comfortable shoes in the world, but the shoe has a pebble stuck in it that you can't get out.This is an incredible game, full of originality, heaps of content and replayability, tons of player agency and a really fun gameplay loop. However, it is plagued by nonsensical design decisions and bugs that impact my experience of the game every single time I play it.Bugs like the cursor not staying locked to the game window, causing me to click on stuff on my second monitor and tabbing me out of the game and server issues causing frequent disconnects during coop, and design decisions like the incredibly long wait to quit out of the game and popups always automatically hovering on ""no"" instead of ""yes"", forcing me to move my mouse cursor, sometimes mid-combat, to select yes, severely impact my enjoyment of the game. Bringing the game from one of my favourites, to something I always find myself getting frustrated at while playing."
Positive,"Despite the technical issues (stutter, fps drop and pop-in), this game manage to pass and even beyond the expectations.pros:+MASSIVE INTERESTING WORLD+the most casual friendly souls-game (this is the only souls game that i can recommend to everyone)+art-style+enemies variety+no MODERN GAMING MECHANICS (microtransactions, incomplete game, etc)+and everything elsecons:-technical issues (stutter, fps drop, texture pop-in, bug)-sometimes you got cheap death (one hit kill, inconsistent fall damage, etc)No wonder its 10/10.kudos to you fromsoft. what a mastapeace!"
Positive,Yo yo yo. Best game I've played in a while. Actually went from start to completion with no breaks in between.Great atmosphere. Great story. Great combat. Some issues with crashing here and there on PC but nothing to deter me from playing.The game is not for everyone but more than likely its for you. Give it a try.
Positive,this game has taken over my life
Positive,I hate it but it's really good. But I hate it.
Positive,Out of all the games I own this is definitely one of them. Highly recommend
Positive,try finger but whole
Positive,"after 216 hours i can say that this game is worth it goty dare i say this game has been the best thing to happen this year name another game where the main story is about fingers and the fans constantly lie to you by saying ""hidden wall"" (if this game doesnt win goty actually rigged)"
Positive,"First off, I play souls games since darksouls 1. I have played everyone of them except the 2 Demonslayers and sekiro, but I had my time one Darksouls 1, 2 and 3. My favorite game of all time was each game of the serie each time a new one released and Elden Ring is no exception: I LOVE this game so bad I could play this only game for the rest of my life.Like other soul games, this one is hard, but somehow fun. You have a lot of different weapon/playstyle, lots of bosses, coop, pvp, and for the ""first time"" : Open world. Of course I've always considered the first darksouls a little bit ""open world"" since for me it was the one where where you need to go is not obvious but in elden ring, this feature is a master piece.I love the way that +1, +2 talismants (or rings for older games) don't need a NG+ to obtain or so, quest are less easy to ""fail"" like DS 1 and of course, the open world is so rich that every time you think you've found a secret or a ""parkour"" way to somewhere, well, it may just be intended that way from the start...They removed features that were annoying and added nice ""solution"" or better way to make it good etc.For exemple: - You can lvl up everywhere, at any site of grace (bone fire) so you don't have to travel back every time.- There is a map and map markers to keep stuff in mind, very nice tool- The throwable (like the pot) are craftable and quantity limited (like can't hold more then x pot all kind combined)- The Bow and arrow gameplay has more value, more skills, ammunitions and effects- More parryable attack, but they balanced it, The first boss has parryable attacks but you must parry multiples times to ""break their stance"" and inflict a critical attack.- You have a mount. You can jump, and you mount double jump, fall damage adapted.- The talismants (rings) slots are ""unlockable"" like you start with 1 slot and you get 2 after first boss etc.- The ng+ gives more xp than before and you keep everything, a lot like DS serie but I kinda feel like it's better, cause you don't HAVE to make a NG+ to get best talismants etc...- They added ""summons"" not like player summons but mob summons, that can be good or bad for the game, I feel like most of them are balanced and can make a ""support"" build viable.The only ""down side"" from my POV is that, I feel like final bosses are too easy. Maybe it's because I'm experienced, or maybe I had the right build the first time I did it and after I was too high lvl for the build to matter but, I wich their was more FUME KNIGHT(DS2) kind of boss or Manus(DS1) or Ornstein and Smough(DS1) or even Friede(DS3).But for people that play this game as their first soul game, welcome and enjoy the ride, glad to share this experience with you, buy this game if you are hesitating, you are missing out the best game of all time, but that's my opinion do whatever and have fun. :)"
Positive,"First and foremost, Elden Ring is a great ""souls"" game. The very first things my friends and I noticed when getting into it, the Dev Team learned from each of the previous Dark Souls and even Bloodborne and Sekiro games what parts really stood out and worked incredibly well, and worked to include most of these aspects in Elden Ring. This makes the actual gameplay feel incredibly solid and even an upgrade over Dark Souls 3, which at the time, felt like it couldn't be improved. For some quick little highlights, a lot of the basic gameplay comes from DS3 with how weapon and spells are handled, adding on the ability to sneak and freely jump around like Sekiro, the different backstabs from Bloodborne along with the Rally mechanic later in the game if you choose, and power stancing dual weapons like in DS2. Add on an open world feeling similar to Breath of the Wild, but even more in-depth, with a crafting and harvesting system and you get a good feel for the game. It's been nothing short of wonderful to explore and play.The different areas are all incredibly interesting and beautiful to behold, and even if you have to run it on older hardware, they look amazing. With the Erdtree looming over you the whole time you wander, it really brings out this sense of wonder as you get closer and closer to it, digging deeper into the story as a whole. The story is brand new to go with the new title, but in classic FromSoft fashion, there are certainly callbacks to other games as well as George R.R. Martin's own works. I don't want to spoil much of the story, so all I will say is that they did amazing to explain and build a setting and a world that feels alive and well thought through, and it is a joy to read through the tidbits in the classic Souls way.Finally, the Dev Team and Bandai Namco have also been working tirelessly to fix any bugs and issues that have been showing up, and they have been releasing patches fairly quickly after receiving bug reports on the Bandai Namco site. I respect all the time they are putting in to fix these issues in a timely manner, and it really shows that they are taking it seriously to fix the port issues. I recommend the game if any of this sounds good, or if you want more of the Souls style of games and have enjoyed the previous titles. Just know that it will be a challenging game, but one that tries to be incredibly fair to the player!"
Positive,Very good game i want to smash my monitor ever time i go up to a boss and die 100 times then i run around the room like a retard and scream some words that i cant say then i sit back down in my chair try it again remembering its a Multiplayer game and .... oh yea i dont have friends then i go to bed and play tomorrow
Positive,Good to see that Breath of the Wild got a PC port.
Positive,Made me feel bad about being bad at boss battles and even worse about being maidenless... and I loved it
Positive,This game is the pinnacle of 2022.  The visuals and the immense map alone is enough to send your brain spiraling for more.  I would sell my first-born for DLC to come out tomorrow.
Positive,Visions of breaking my monitor
Positive,"This is the best game I've played in a long time. The art style of this game just gives me goose bumps. Graphically impressive, musically outstanding , the game design, even though it has its flaws, It's engaging, rewarding, and over all... FUN!! So , if you havn't play this, you're missing out a huge gem."
Positive,"I am a diehard Souls fan, and yet after playing this game, I don't think I can go back to Dark Souls 3 ever again, as it'll feel like some of the, how shall we say, grace this game has will be missing.The game gives you the tools to truly break the game wide open, and from that this might be the easiest and most accessible one of Fromsoft's adventures yet - if you use all your tools, that is. And you'll have to find them - if you're looking for a game that hands you everything on a platter, sorry, but you'll have to go elsewhere, as Elden Ring is a game about developing your kit as you explore and learn more. If you want to see a game where you turn from a beginner learning the lays of the land into a mighty death knight that can dual wield flaming scythes and summon a clone of yourself that fires lasers formed from the stars, though, then you might find something here!Probably the only thing to note is that you'll have to contend with hostile player invasions if you plan to play this game through with your friends - if you haven't played a Souls game before, I'd recommend looking up what you're getting into regarding that specifically as that's not necessarily for everyone. However if you're going into it single player that isn't something you'll have to worry about.If your PC can run this game, and you don't own it, you're doing yourself a disservice. It's just that simple. Scroll back up and click the button to add it to cart now."
Positive,"TL;DR: 9/10 - This game is great. Go get itOnto the positives:-The combat has been refined, bringing back and upgrading everything from previous games. Free jumping, posture damage, powerstancing, weapon arts being not only fun and useful, but also interchangeable at any time.-The game is just plain beautiful.-The world is MASSIVE. Every time you think you're close to being done, you unlock a new part of the map, be it above or underground.-Cool main bossesNegatives:-The massive world, while I rated it as positive, is riddled of caves, graves and dungeons that feel copypasted. You'll be fighting the same bosses time and time again (tree spirits and magma wyrms between the most annoying, personally, to fight). This might hurt your opinion of the game if you're doing a ""completionist"" first playthrough, but it won't matter if you do a second one (or more, obviously), since you'll know what to get and where to get it, and most of the time can just rush to the place it's in. -The open world really does not work with Fromsoft's NPC questlines. Have fun trying to find the next NPC's location without a guide. You'll constantly find yourself breaking/skipping steps in quests because you progressed too far without even realizing.-Speaking of NPC questlines, some of them are unfinished. They don't have an ending, the NPC will just disappear forever.-Optimization so far is horrible, dropping frames (or god forbid, giving short freezes) as early as THE FIRST BOSS YOU FIND IN THE WILD.Something worth mentioning, the OST in this game feels particularly lackluster. Some really good songs here and there, but are few and far between.edit 22/11/2022: game still good just."
Positive,a game so wide and so expansive it makes every other open world game I've ever played seem terrible. this world is more meticulous and hand-crafted than any I've ever explored in games. i cannot recommend it enough. also there's a big tortoise with a pope hat and I think that's pretty neat.
Positive,"Game of the year of the last 5 years, pure unadulterated gaming pleasure, no towers to climb, no repetitious tasks to complete, no lootboxes to open, no rng to count on, no easy guides to follow, no mobile game UI's that flash at you all the time, just plain and pure creativity thrown at you every step of the way. Yes, it might be stupid difficult at times but you'll get over it!"

Positive,"Very amazing game, as my first game in the souls series I am very surprised to say that I love it. I always thought that souls games were hard and would make me not want to play it due to rage. However I was wrong, this game is far from boring and is a must have. Such a good game being released during this ""amazing"" year was a godsend. Highly recommend."
Positive,"THIS GAME MAKES ME WANT TO COMMIT SUICIDE THE PURE FUCKING PAIN OF GETTING RAPPED BY EVERYTHING IN THE GAME IS DUMB.

Positive,It's Skyrim but Dark Souls.
Positive,"After having some actual gameplay, I think im ready to writte an update: PROS -Gamepla is really good, after you put some time into the game, you get how this plays, combat, mechanics, spells, all come together in a really nice way.-Doesnt actually require too much graphic power or a high end CPU, it runs well since its capped at 60fps, just met the recommended or minimum, will have some good experience.-Actually open world-Good world design CONS -When the game starts you feel a bit lost, no quest, or path to follow, you get it later on, but first hours could be a bit hard to go through.-60fps cap Lock-No UltraWide resolution support (cmon we are in 2022)After 2 patches, I dont see the stuttering really often, it happen from time to time, but completely playable, this game received some hate early on because of PC optimization. Also this game is not for everybody, if you want an easy game, go play Super Mario, this game is challenging, but dont give up, ITS TOTALLY WORTH IT!!!"

Positive,This is definitely one of the games of all time.
Positive,"ranni you will always be famous ♡  this game is everything to me now it's the only thing i think about. thank you fromsoftware for my life. i pre ordered elden ring but i didn't even have a pc that could run it until 2024, and it was SOOO worth the wait. absolutely gorgeous."
Positive,"The stuttering isn't as bad as other reviews would have you say, I honestly have a great time playing. The world is incredible, the gameplay is fantastic, and the open world surprisingly fits the Dark Souls gameplay. I cannot wait to play more."
Positive,"This game is going to be for the 2020s what Skyrim was for the 2010s. That big, massive game that swoops in and sets the standard for what a video game can be, and everyone else will spend the rest of the decade catching up. And Elden Ring really feels like a true successor. If Skyrim revolutionised the open world genre, then Elden Ring perfected itFantastic visuals and music, amazing action combat, easily the best world design I've ever seen, and a beautiful visual style. It's also one of the first open world games in well over a decade to strike that balance between quality and quantity. The world is filled with so much to see and do, but it never really feels like things are being recycled or that I'm seeing the same things over and over. There really is something new to discover around every corner.The only complaints I have is that the game has a lot of the usual Fromsoft BS that really should have been phased out. For example, most of the story and lore being told through item descriptions and vague NPC dialogue. Or sidequests having super specific, arbitrary requirements and are easily missable. Also the PC port isn't the greatest, but it doesn't run too bad if you have good specs.Elden Ring is a strong contender for the best game ever made, and it's really nice how after a decade of empty, lifeless and boring open worlds (BotW, HZD, any Ubisoft game) Fromsoft comes in and reminds everyone how it's done."
Positive,The best game that I've personally played.
Positive,"Yes, genius Miyazaki."

Positive,"Elden Ring is probably the best souls games fromsoft has put out. It has almost everything you could ask for, and then some. As always, there is a wonderful amount of build variety and customization when it comes to how you play the game. The amount of freedom you are given to tackle combat in this game is unparalleled by anything else in the genre. I believe that this is the best jumping off point for anyone who has been on the fence about the series, just because it gives new players so many more options when it comes to combat and exploration. The world and environments in all of their grim details are some of my favorites in dark fantasy, second only to the Witcher 3. That is to say that his game holds up incredibly well under close examination. For example, there was a moment where I was on a bridge near a random merchant, one I had passed by and made purchases from many times before. He was playing some music so I stopped for a while to listen. I then noticed that he moved each individual finger to where it should be on the string, and shook his hand in time with the vibrato of the song. The world is so incredibly detailed that there are minuscule details like this that you will never find unless you really really look for them.Something fromsoft has always done a stellar job at is making sure there are always new things to learn each and every playthrough. Just when you think you've seen it all, an enemy will do a rare attack, or you'll find a new doorway or an item you never saw before. Things like that keep me motivated to keep coming back and doing playthrough after playthrough. In my ~1000 hours across pc and console, I would say I've probably seen about 85% of all the game's content.Personally I am a player that is highly motivated by combat and exploration, and those are the main reasons I like this game, however I have found myself entranced by the lore of this game unlike any other souls game in the past. As always, the lore is not incredibly accessible, but that's a fromsoft staple at this point. Plus, I feel like this game in particular does a good job conveying many of the main story points through boss cutscenes and required progression points that you could pick up on it anyways.If I were to list out some of the things I dislike about the game, they would be mostly superficial, like not having enough character customization options (hairstyles, body types, etc.). However there are a few bigger issues I take with some aspects of the game. Firstly, the performance on pc leaves something to be desired. I have consistent framerates, which is good, but I get regular half second stutters that really took me out of the game at first. I've grown used to them with time, and even found that turning off my mouse seems to help, but its an issue I faced so it felt worth bringing up. Your experience with performance may vary, as many of my friends have had little to no issues. Secondly, the souls series is notorious for having terrible netcode, and unfortunately Elden Ring is no exception. It's not impossible to play around when you get used to it, but for a game released in the last five years, it's pretty embarrassing. PvP has always been optional in fromsoft games, and this is no exception. Fromsoft has made it so that you can no longer be invaded alone unless you specifically ask for it. Overall, it's a good change for the host, but not so much for the invader. I wish that invaders had more choices for who they invaded. Perhaps separate options for 1v1s and 1v2s etc. They've already leaned so far in the direction of accessibility that I feel like that's not a big stretch.As a single player experience the game is wonderful. As a co-op game, I find it to be even better. Some of my best memories in gaming period have been made in Elden Ring. Whether that be simply roaming the lands between with my friends, grinding out a difficult boss with upscaled health, or guiding a new player through their first souls game, I find the cooperative gameplay to be incredibly fulfilling. Unlike previous titles, fromsoft has gone out of their way to make co-op easy to access for everyone. The addition of summoning pools and easily accessible multiplayer items are in my opinion some of the best changes from prior games. Humanities and the like felt so rare and difficult to find compared to erdleaf flowers that I often felt incentivised to not use them. Now, you can just explore for a while, or if you're really desperate, spend two minutes farming flowers and then have enough to summon multiple times. The only thing I wish they would change is the fact that the world is not fully accessible in multiplayer. Things like multiplayer fog walls and getting sent back home after a boss is fine, but resummoning after a fight takes a while. More of a minor inconvenience than anything else, but it felt worth mentioning.To sum things up, Elden Ring is an amazing game that I will never forget, and will likely play with friends and family for the rest of my life. It is one of my favorite games of all time, and I think that everyone can find something to enjoy about this game."
Positive,This is a love letter to everything I've loved about RPG's of the last decade. The hype was WELL WORTH.
Positive,"Game was pretty mid, anyone who gets all the achievements is a loser no cap."
Positive,"One of the greatest RPGs I've ever played. Amazing world, story and beautiful combat, absolutely in love with jump attacks. They took the dark souls formula and made it ascend to godhood."
Positive,"It took me a little while to get into this game, the combat system was pretty new to me as I never played any From Software game before. Also, I was super determined to play this without reading any guides, watching any videos, or anything like that - to get the ""full experience"" without any tips/spoilers.Whilst there is a lot I don't fully understand, especially around magic/incantations I think the game is awesome.I've no idea how far through the game I am, but I'm already planning another play through around magic - as I've not really used it at all with this character (I just defeated Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon after a few tries and am currently at level 27).I feel that the game is massive and has huge replay value - easily the best game I've played for a long time - although it did take me a while to get into it."
Positive,"Elden Ring enthrones itself at the pinnacle of my gaming experiences.Finishing the game with every single achievement is, and will be, my most proud and profound accomplishment in gaming altogether. From Software's established formula and mechanics were elevated to new heights.I wholeheartedly recommend Elden Ring to anyone, even if you are usually turned down by the daunting nature of From Software games, the plentiful options you've never had before present themselves in front of you at every turn of the game, making progressing through the journey a pure rapture. I shall speak little about the game's many brilliant features and wish you'd experience them for yourself."
Positive,Best game ever
Positive,This game kicks my ass. But it's okay because I take it out on my kids! :)
Positive,Finally finished my first playthru. :)
Positive,You don't have the right
Positive,"I am ******* obsessed with this game. It was everything I wanted from you, FromSoft, just work on those stability issuesssss"
Positive,"This is not a game, this is a masterpiece."
Positive,"Fantastic game, would fully recommend it to anyone interested in getting into souls-like games, as it is in my opinion the highest quality and most accessible of them all."
Positive,"This game did not disappoint me at all. So awesome!Btw still not hard enough ^^For people haven't played soul games before, I won't suggest.9/10  First rate at 2.26"
Positive,"A masterpiece, tried DS1 and didn't like the controls, Sekiro was fine but it took lots of tries for combat to click, but Elden Ring just clicked"
Positive,After completing the Game and all it's Achievements all I can say is: try finger but hole.You're just never done. There is always something to discover and you'll never really get punished for trying stuff out since existing in this game is punishing enough.So if you're up for a challenge and are bored of all these modern easy games. Do it. But bring some time.
Positive,"This is a good game, it's hard, very hard. If you have any experience with games like Monster Hunter, Dauntless or any other game where pattern learning is a thing, you will fare better at this than a vast majority of players.There have been a lot of complains about a lack of pointers, quest log among other things, but this forces you as player to pay attention to what is being said, you have to be more active than just ""follow the shiny sign"".You will miss out content, you will not understand what is going on because a lot of those NPCs have their own agenda and you are just a pawn on the chess board. More playthrough will help get a better understanding of the general direction of the story line.I have got lost on so many occasions, I have found myself at places I shouldn't be at my current ""level"" but every time this happened, I have a story to tell, a small memorable moment about it. How many other games quest or even boss do you remember, I mean truely remember. We have to learn the boss pattern, understand how they act and learn a bit more about them as we conquer them and feel absolutely great as you succeed felling them.This is not a game for everyone, this is akin a hot spicy dish, not everyone can stomach it, but eating the dish as the chef intended makes it so much more enjoyable as you can taste all the minute details of the food and the intricacies of all the ingredient used.If you don't like this game, this is fine. It is not meant for you. I dislike Fortnite a lot because I don't like how the game feels/plays and that is also fine.My biggest advice, give it a try but be prepared to hate it and refund it if that is the case."
Positive,"I've only played DS3 and Sekiro (got maybe 2/3s through DS3 killing a lot of option bosses. Got to last boss on Sekiro). What this game does is take some of the best of both of these and improves upon it. The level design has some aspects of Sekiro to it in terms of being a bit more mobile with multiple options more of the time. It has the expansive selection of weaponry I enjoyed in DS3. The open world side works nicely with plenty of opportunity to explore to change the place and seek out grace spots, caves & minibosses. Like Sekiro, there are always multiple paths so if you're stuck on one boss you can just do a load of other stuff and come back. I left margit a bit late in this sense.. I tried once or twice and nope'd out. Returned today 40 levels later and savaged it in 1min flat.The game is challenging. Certain scenarios are frustrating because they are tough. I've particularly struggled with multiple minibosses, especially before finding out what spirits were. There are some scenarios you just have to accept you are dead in. Maybe you got dismounted so these 2-5 skeles you could 1 hit will now stab you to death. Maybe you misjudge the lunge so you took damage when you thought you backed off far enough. Maybe that boss has another part of the combo now he/she/they are below half health. You just have to accept it. You will die. It's not really a big deal in this game so don't stress over it. On the bright side you will find through dumb luck that you'll sometimes be the right height to miss certain swings and attacks so luck can work both ways.There are various levels of cheese to make elements easier depending on what your conscience will allow. Some enemies are too big for doorways. Some obstacles including aforementioned doorways will stop an enemy behind it letting you attack without reply (walls. stairs, some fencing you can see/hit through, etc). You can present yourself to most ranged enemies, move behind cover and this will entice them towards you (much easier that trying to dodge 9000 arrow/bolt/magic projectiles). There are a couple of spots where fighting happens between 2 enemy factions. If you were so inclined you could either basically afk above the fights if you were distracted by a talkshow/podcast/stream/tvshow/etc and get xp or dance through the fight randomly hitting stuff to achieve the same end result but with less guilt.Spirits make some fights so easy they may feel like a cheese - these are infinitely reusable allies you can bring in. They can act as cannon fodder, distract an enemy if you' otherwise fight two. They contribute minimal damage from my experience but I have found if you have an enemy with such bad posture you rock it every hit, these can help you basically stunlock such enemies and evaporate them.I've found you can get to some areas with the horse double-jump that I'm not wholly convinced they intended you to be able to. You can also fight some minibosses out in the world entirely on horse back if you like. That's kind of preference. You take more damage so for some it'll make half the attacks one-hit so if you are using it, you'll need a similar process as you'd use on normal bosses to work out hit animations to try and minimise any hits taken. On more horse thing.. I feel like it's a bug.. I have had many occasions so far where I get hit and staggered but took no damage. Unclear if this was something hitting the horse and not me but it feels like due to bugs you sometimes simply do not take dmg on horseback. I expect this will be fixed in a patch.If you liked DS3 or Sekiro I'd say this is a must play. I'd also recommend it if you like the sound of a tough boss game but haven't tried any of these. Just know you'll have to try bosses multiple times and grind them out to work out move sets and such so it's not a game for everyone. For those who do enjoy it though, I feel like it offers superb payoffs throughout that are pretty much unparalleled elsewhere in gaming.If you pick the wretch you will have a tough start to the game (no shield for a while, slow weak weapon). If I can make it you can but just to say you'll miss not having a shield in some places (although you can buy one fairly early on so it's not too big a deal if you've played this kind of game before)"
Positive,"So far so good. I hear complaints about tech stuff, hope they're fixed, soon though.But on my 3090 and SSD i only get mild stutters when entering a new area. I'm also using an elitev2 controller which seemingly has no issues but i feel for everyone else who has controller issues.Hope those issues are resolved for other people soon, but for me it's been fine. So if you have a 3090 and an xbox elitev2 controller, you should be good."
Positive,"I'll be honest, I really wanted to hate Party Babyz. We as gamers have, after all, been trained for years to be suspicious of mini-game compilations, to ignore products with babies on the cover and to absolutely abhor games using the letter ""z"" in their titles as an indication of a plural. I had all these great jokes lined up, a whole list of witty and sarcastic remarks that would have forced the developers into early retirement and ultimately secured my reputation as one the most scathing and hilarious freelancers the IGN readership had ever seen. That list now sits crumpled at the bottom of my trash bin.Why, you ask? Because, despite one of the worst examples of botched box art marketing I've ever witnessed, Imagine: Party Babyz is one of the finest mini-game compilations to ever grace Nintendo's home console.Party Babyz tells the story – yes, you read that right, Party Babyz tells a story – of a young woman named Katie's first year at The Baby Club, a nursery where she herself attended as a young child. Here, under the tutelage of Headmaster Anna Grames, Katie hopes to learn the ins-and-outs of proper child care and earn her babysitting degree – by ruthlessly pitting the young children against each other in a series of 30 child themed mini-games. The story here doesn't make a whole lot of sense but then again it doesn't really have to considering all it's there for is to provide some extra context and justify a single player story mode.After all, the mini-games are what truly matter, and Party Babyz fortunately offers some of the best bite-sized challenges this side of the original Rayman Raving Rabbids. The game offers 30 wholly unique mini-games (the back of the box claims it offers 40, but this is only true after some creative number stretching) spanning the four seasons of the year. Most of these challenges are appropriately baby themed – including but not limited to counting sheep before bedtime, milk bottle drinking, changing diapers and brushing teeth – but offer much more depth than their setting would imply. A vast majority of the mini-games are multi-layered, tasking players with juggling more than one objective at once and providing a level of strategy and depth unseen in other, similar titles shoveled onto the Wii these past few years.Nothing says compelling gameplay like a nap time mini-game.One mini-game in particular, ""The Mad Dash,"" actually offers three different mini-game control styles rolled into one. Players start out by rocking the Wii Remote to the left and right, then switch a third of the way through to bouncing the controller up and down until the babies reach the final checkpoint, where it becomes a race for who can hit the ""2"" button the fasted to wheel the tricycle past the finish line. Apart, none of these control methods would have been very intriguing but together they create a virtual triathlon much more than the some of its parts. Lazier developers would have split this challenge up into three disparate mini-games to pad numbers, but the fine folks at Visual Impact thankfully chose quality over quantity.The other challenges offer similarly tight controls and solid motion detection. There were a couple of instances where I felt the game wasn't tracking my movements accurately, but a majority of the challenges reacted exactly as they should have. Providing accurate controls seems like it should be a given for any title, but I've played my fair share of mini-game compilations these past few weeks and I can ensure you that Party Babyz is one of the best in this particular area of design.Winning these mini-games nets players both the opportunity to unlock further challenges as well as customizable outfits for the babies, adorably referred to as ""fancy dresses"" throughout the game proper. Normally, netting these sorts of prizes means very little to me, but for some reason the fancy dresses really grew on me. I found myself replaying earlier mini-games by myself – a practice I normally try to avoid – just to unlock the final costumes simply because they're so quirky and well designed. There are 40 fancy dresses in all so it would be foolish to list them all, but some of the standouts include costumes designed after a knight, pirate, Viking, caveman, gladiator, alien and even a little red devil. These unlockable costumes would normally be a throwaway feature save for two other defining features of Imagine: Party Babyz, the great art style and deep customization options.Frankly put, Imagine: Party Babyz' art style is amazingly appealing. It reminds me a bit of EA's MySims titles, except less blocky and more defined. While not technically impressive by any means, the game's graphics are remarkably charming, creating a unique visual world that remains consistent throughout. Unfortunately, I feel the simple, childish art style will also prove to be one of the pieces of overall design that keeps most gamers from ever giving Party Babyz a second glance. Gamers willing to get over established visual prejudices, however, will find a very attractive, crisp engine oozing with charm and personality.Party Babyz also offers a robust amount of customization options so gamers can mold each of the four babies how they see fit. The system is surprisingly versatile, offering a nearly Mii-caliber virtual avatar creator for use across both single and multi-player modes. You won't get the facial options like you do with the Mii Channel, but the clothing selection more than makes up for that fact. After all, my bleached mullet-quaffed baby adorned in chicken legs and sumo torso could take your pitiful Mii any day of the week.What's more, these custom creations can be used in any of the multiplayer games, allowing friends to each have their own personal baby to compete with. Let me tell you, there is very little in life worth watching more than a tiny, armor-laden Red Riding Hood duke it out with a devil-horned pharaoh over possession of the daycare's only down comforter. It's pretty telling that, in a recently conducted democratic polling of ten college students, Imagine: Party Babyz was elected over Rock Band 2 to provide the primary source of virtual entertainment for the night.VerdictYes, Imagine: Party Babyz features dancing toddlers on the cover. Get over it. Even on a console as mini-game saturated as the Nintendo Wii, Party Babyz manages to distinguish itself in every possible category. The challenges are fun and diverse, the controls are solid and varied and the art direction is simple and appealing. Its gameplay is definitely not intended for the toddlers it features on the box, but gamers old enough to grasp the depth and strategy within will have a great time. The game doesn't do anything entirely unique and probably won't convert devout haters of the genre, but gamers looking for a solid new mini-game compilation need look no further.7,5/10"
Positive,Game is solid and so pretty! playing on max settings with a 3070. Bless the CPU rng gods no crashes no fps drops even while streaming to discord
Positive,"I expected big dark souls.I received humongous dark souls. Zero Complaints on gameplay, all the complaints on optimization which was announced to get fixed."
Positive,"game of the year? no its game of the decadei wish everyone played throughprice is absolutely justified, if u thinking about buying - go for it"
Positive,I suck ass at this game.
Positive,"Probably the best game I've played since Witcher 3.Games this good only come around once in a blue moon, do yourself a favor and buy the game.Sure it's difficult at times, but there has never been a more approachable FromSoft game than this one. Stuck on a boss? Then leave, and go explore, and come back 4 hours later after you've found a new weapon and stomp his ass. The gameplay loop is insanely addictive."
Positive,"I became Mushroom. I wear only mushrooms. My touch is poison. My manners are bold. I invade and give free mushrooms. Should you accept my gifts and blessings, I shall depart, giving charges to your flasks and runes. But should you turn dwon my generous offer... thy body shall feed the mushrooms...the DLC gave me 2 new mushrooms and the ability to buy mushrooms. Very nice.9/10 would spread my spores again."
Positive,"I want to firstly address that Elden Ring was my personal Game of the Year in 2022. I've been meaning to finally give this game a well deserved review before the DLC releases later in 2024.If you've managed to play any From Software games in the past such as Dark Souls, BloodBourne and Sekiro, you may be surprised and even overwhelmed at the sheer size of Elden Ring's map, as it covers a wide density of areas above and below the depths of the surface. The more you continue to play, the more you are exposed to the sprawling amount of content at your feet, even right at the beginning of your journey.Unfamiliar to the other entries of the game, Elden Ring will allow you to have the pure freedom to begin pacing throughout the game at your own leisure. Whether it be collecting resources for armor and potions, or jumping head first into a boss fight you're completely under leveled for, this game certainly doesn't hold your hand. It promotes exploration and allows you to always come back to specific zones whenever you feel more comfortable to tackle those challenges that await you. When it comes to Dungeons and catacombs, the design and layout of each dark and claustrophobic space is packed with monsters awaiting your every turn, and levers or mini puzzles for you to solve before you can then progress to fight the boss which occupies the area. Whilst the sheer amount of these catacombs have plenty to offer, as you progress you may start to notice some repetition in the way certain creatures are presented to you as the final challenge. This is one slight nitpick, but by all means doesn't take away from the full experience of Elden Ring.The world of Elden Ring presents a beautiful soundtrack, which also brings along some truly breathtaking graphics as you may find yourself atop of a mountain, yearning to take a screenshot as soon as you can to capture what's in front of you. The OST massively compliments each boss fight, as you continue to find ways to bring down the mighty foe, your ears are continuously blessed with some fantastic instrumentals in the background.Touching upon boss fights, Elden Ring keeps the challenge high for newer players to the genre, and even Souls Like veterans. You can choose to fight solo, co-op with your friends, summon other players across the world, and even bring out your bell to summon Spirit Ashes you continually collect throughout your playthrough. These Ashes vary in their ability to deal damage and attract attention to the creature you're fighting, so always use them to your advantage to understand how the boss attacks, and to find the most appropriately timed opportunities to land your hits. Each main boss is presented very strongly, some more so than others, with their look and aesthetics of character design truly being something that stands out to be taken in and appreciated by the player.Something that works so well in Elden Ring is the freedom to mix and match different armor sets and weapons. The game incorporates magic, range and melee attacks, with even more damage type abilities ready to be implemented in the new DLC. It is incredibly satisfying to level up a weapon you love and see it deal a tremendous amount of damage to an enemy on its initial landing. As with other Souls games, you navigate through levelling your core attributes such as Vigor, Endurance, Strength and Dexterity, and this grants you many different ways to focus your build around, as the replayability of Elden Ring is truly on another level if you're someone who loves to create new builds and characters.I understand and stress that this game won't be for everyone, especially if you like games with quest markers and a traditional way of telling you what/where to go next. But, if you do end up giving Elden Ring a try, please remember to take your time and soak in the first experience to its true potential as nothing can beat that initial immersive playthrough."

Positive,"Easily the best game I've played in my life and that's coming from a guy who couldn't get to a major boss in Dark Souls 1. If you think you won't enjoy this game because of difficulty, I PROMISE you will be able to find a playstyle that works for you. Stick with it, and rise!"
Positive,"Another amazing game by From Software. As for Graphics, we got a significant noticeable upgrade - way better lighting, shadows, texture quality, facial details and many more. They finally added powerstancing from Dark Souls II which many people wanted to see in Dark Souls III. You can expect to have a blast playing through this game. The areas are perfectly designed, soundtrack is amazing as well as dialogues and cutscenes. This game offers a huge repertoire of Weapons, armors, spells and items. The only thing that I couldn't stand is the performance. Huge frame-drops and stuttering on a RTX3060+Ryzen 7 5800. Considering their ancient engine and more-or-less first try at a true Open World game I will let that slide but I think that they had quite a bit of time to optimize the game. My second negative are few of the dungeons and their bosses. Some dungeons are basically copy paste or they're just too easy. As a Dark Souls veteran, I can see that FS lowered the difficulty quite a bit to appeal to way more people. But the main bosses are very good. Malenia totally roasted me, but after 2 hours I finally somehow managed to beat her. To sum up these are my pros, cons and final rating.PROS:Art DirectionRich storySoundtrackAmazing Main BossesWell designed locations,armors,weaponsVery good timings on boss's attacksHuge build varietyCONS:Very Bad performance at launchcopy paste dungeonslower difficulty (few bosses/enemies exception) compared to DS2 / DS3OVERALL RATING: 10/10But I still think that no game this year can even remotely touch this excluding God of War.If you've got the money, buy this game, you're not going to regret buying it.I've had a blast playing this game and finished the game 5 times and will continue many more times in the future.Collecting all achievements is very easy compared to tedious covenant levelling as in DS2,3 or titanite collecting in DS1.Thanks and have a nice day.If you have any questions, ask me in the comments."

Positive,"This game made me religious, because now I can hope that whoever came up with the scissorleg birds will go to hell."
Positive,If you want it put a ring on it.
Positive,This is the best game of all time.
Positive,"To me Elden Ring is tailored around the notion of discovery and exploring. If this is something you find appealing i'd say this game is a good fit for you.The atmosphere, music, colors, motifs and the mood they all create, makes playing this game a very memorable experience.When it comes to difficulty, I like the liberty the game gives you. It's up to you to decide if you want it to be somewhat easy or a bit more of a challenging experience. Just to give some examples:- considering how open the game is, you can go straight for strong items early on or just by playing you can decide to out level the content. Both of these will make the game easier for you.-on the other spectrum you can decide not to go for strong items early on, not to out level content, you also have the liberty to start with harder fights or zones and make it a much more challenging experience."

Positive,one of the greatest if not the greatest game out there
Positive,"Buy the game and play the game! Thats it. No dlc, no micro transaction. The world is so huuuge and there are sooo many secrets to discover. Bit hard here and there, but you can easily go do 1000 different things to level up and come back later. This game is a masterpiece"
Positive,"After completing the game's main story in circa 80 hours, I wholeheartedly believe that this might be my favourite game of all time. Being one of the lucky few to have suffered from only the smallest amount of performance issues, I enjoyed this game over the course of a week. Combat is excellent as is to be expected from FromSoftware. The art direction is also stellar, and most certainly conveys the myriad atmospheres the game presents throughout its wonderfully rich and full open world. Music is another outstanding part of this game's presentation, with incredible songs accompanying every (boss)fight! The story, while of course told through the usual FromSoft methods, truly sprung out at me this time, and it has to be my favourite plotline yet. (Cutscenes are definitely a highlight for me in this one!)I have many words, but none of them describe how much I love this game. Please, please, please, if you like Soulslike games, try this one! I have nothing but good words for the game, and I pray they fix performance issues so others may enjoy this game in its full glory!12/10 would recommend instantly to anyone and everyone that will listen to my spiel about it!Update: Many, many hours later and the game is still fun. Very excited for the DLC!"
Positive,"This game was made just for me... There are some complaints to be spoken about, but for the beginning I will say 10 out of 10.  This feels like a perfect game if they are able to fix some of issues we are all having at the moment.  For perspective, I am about 45 hours in on my first playthrough.A dark fantasy world where the best word to describe it would be Epic!  The sense of scale is something that will really make you stare open jawed that they were able to make something so awesome.  The geometry of the world is weird... if you could see the world from the side the amount of verticality would most likely be amazing.  It reminds of the sense of being dwarfed like in Shadow of the Colossus.  There is so much to do, the game really opens up like a flower... the more you explore the more you find stuff to do.  This world puts an elder scrolls game to shame, they wish they could have this much to do.  The only thing I can think about regarding this is I cannot imagine FromSoft being able to top this game(it would be a mighty tall order to do). The controls are tight just like a 2D fighter game.  The more I play the more the combat makes me think of Devil May Cry games.  The controls are very precise and they demand you to be as well.  Like any ""Souls"" games  there is a lot of difficulty here to get frustrated about.  There is no shortage of bosses to fight.  The way that you can build your character makes different ways to fight the bosses.  I cannot wait to play this a second time(and more) and see how different it feels.The cons are few, but they are there.  The game has issues with stuttering due to the game loading shaders.  This will cause the game to freeze on screen for split seconds at times but the game will continue which will cause you get hit by all sorts of attacks or spells or whatever.  There are also some UI elements that could use the be changed or optionally removed.  Such as the game popping up an are you sure window when you attempt to revive Torrent when they die in combat which can be possibly be dangerous if you are in combat and you need to move.  These things could be changed so this paragraph might be removed later(hopefully) as things get updated.This is the best iteration of the Souls game formula and I was worried how it would all turn out at attempting an open world game... It came out better than could have been hoped for!  I love everything about this game... I did not think it could be improved upon... but thankfully I was wrong in that regard.  If you can stomach the endless dying that will occur throughout a playthrough you will really find something special here."
Positive,wicked sort ahead
Positive,Better than fortnite
Positive,If I could have sex with one game. This would be it.
Positive,"This is the best game of all time.EDIT : This isnt the best game of all time, but it's a pretty damn good game."
Positive,This game is exactly what you get if you combined the best parts of Dark Souls 3 with Breath of the Wild. I'm 12 hours in and very impressed so far.
Positive,"Worthy follow up to the souls series. Absolute massive map with plenty of diverse areas to explore and enjoy. You will feel right at home with the castles, knights and movesets and it will still catch you off guard (Margit gud). So far it has been the promised Heir. Will update when i have more hours.So far 10/10 would try finger, but hole again"
Positive,"Sekiro got me into Souls. Won't lie, but this game far exceeded my expectations. Was planning to write the review after 20-25 hours but man whole day today at the office, i was impatiently waiting to go home and play this. I dont remember when was the last time i was this excited to  play a game. Made me remember those good old childhood days,"
Positive,"I can't sanely recommend a Soulsborne game to anyone. That being said, I lost my sanity on the first boss fight so, stop reading reviews and buy it. It's a beautiful blend of Breath of the Wild and Dark Souls.Update: Elden Ring is what open world RPGs should aspire to.With Shadow of the Erdtree DLC fast approaching, now's the time to get it if you haven't."
Positive,"This game is my favorite souls like game I've played. Its open world aspect and world design is astonishing. Even though there are some frame drops here and there it still runs basically perfectly. The bosses and hidden secrets in this game are so good and well thought out. Even the lore in this game has been taken up a notch with its intriguing quests and story telling, Everything in this game is honestly superb."
Positive,Don't get scared by crybabys cause of the fps cap. This game is a Masterpiece.
Positive,Got a hug for the first time in years. 10/10 never leaving the stronghold.
Positive,"Lets start with the obligatory warning. A lot of people have said that they have massive frame rate issues. I have had some but nothing major in like 21 hours. A friend suggested i try turning the online off and after that i have had BACICLY 0 FPS drops. So Im assuming the online affects the FPS somehow. Im on a 1070 grapichs card BTW.OK now that that is out of the way I can get into it: I feel like this is the best ""Souls"" game to date. There are a lot of things added and just as many things borrowed from the previous games. I ofcource have not completed the game yet and at the moment I am a bit lost on where i need to go (as one is often in from games). The few bosses i have played have been challengeing and fun. I still refuse to say that any specific game is perfect, because there is always something to improve. How ever I do think that this game is 100% worth playing. If you are worried about the performance issues you could wait a while as right now the game has been out for 26 hours. So i would assume that they would fix some of the performance issues as soon as they can. And if you want to try it now and happen to have performance issues. Try going offline in the game and ofcource optimizing settings.edit [1] [80 hours] So after the first blind playthrough i can 100% recommend the game still Last time I had like 22 hours of playtime I believe now according ot steam im at 80ish. Ofcource no game is perfect and this game seems to have some of the what i call ""Dark souls 2 syndrome"" so some places have a bit too many enemies. I still have some exploring to do after (im watching the credits as I'm typing this) assuming I get to keep playing in NG. A great game recommended. I'll probably update this after a couple of more playthroughs and getting all the achivements.edit [2] [192 hours] So now that I have gotten all the achivements. So the game is 100% worth buying. The game is absolutely massive and i have still so many things to do. AFAIK there are a bunch of endings that don't have achivements related to them still not done. Next playthrough ill probably go for a quality build with no status effects and only melee all bosses."
Positive,The first note I saw when I started the game was Try fingers but hole.

Positive,I always do Forts at Night.
Positive,It is good.
Positive,good ass game..
Positive,This is the best game i've ever played Edit: It got betterEdit2: Beat the game it got even better
Positive,Probably the most incredible game I've ever experienced. You've just gotta get over the upfront frustration and occasional issues you encounter during any given fight. I think it's safe to say people will put 1000s of hours into this game and world to fully experience it all. It's a no brainer for my recommendation.
Positive,"This game reminds me of the time I went to my great step-grandmother's place for the first time. We were on a car trip for approximately 5.64 hours until we saw a small insect just completely and obnoxiously blocking the road. We obviously had to leave the car and bring our microwaves with us to remove the bug but then we saw a red baby inside of a small crack in the road. As soon as it saw my pet camel it immediately just scoffed it down like a birthday cake. So we had no other option but to burn it off the face of the Earth. However, despite this, the bug was still there and was on a phone call with the cops. He had recorded everything. Luckily we just killed the bug and it's family back at home. It turns out the bug was holding out a ""Stop"" sign because that was his job. Oh well, nothing we can do about it now. As for the cops we got arrested and were sent to prison, which I thought was very cool, because that's where step-grandma would be! But no, it turns out she was arrested for ""cardiac"" or something, which means she doesn't go to prison for some dumb reason. She's so lucky. The end."
Positive,"I was very apprehensive about trying Elden Ring for a long time as I hold the rest of the Souls series quite close to my heart and I did not want to get disappointed. Despite being a new IP and having a reasonably different feel to it, this manages to capture the magic of playing through a Souls game for the first time. I am not very far in and I have had my arse handed to me a fair share lol but with the right company (and the seamless co-op mod) and right attitude this proves to be one of the best RPGs/soulslikes/whatever people call them now released in quite a long time (at least since dark souls 3 !)"
Positive,"10/10, super easy game, love it."
Positive,idk where the elden ring guy is and cant sex the maiden L. :(BUT based. lost HP from hugging woman.
Positive,One of the best games ever made.
Positive,"One of the best games ever, FromSoftware is the best 💪"
Positive,I swung a big sword at a dragon and got killed by a goat. 10/10
Positive,"Well... what can I say? I've never played a game from this developer before, so no, I've never played a Dark Souls before this. I've always heard about how hard these games are and tbh, it sort of turned me away. After all the hype about how good this game is, I decided to give it a shot. MAN AM I GLAD! This game is by far up there with some of the best open world RPGs in the business. Yeah, it's sort of a dying simulator but it's so addicting, fun, different, and interesting that I don't care that I died about 20 times to the sword-wielding dog/cat boss-thing in one of the beginning dungeons. No quest markers or quest journals, no hand holding. Just good old fashion brainpower to get through both combat and to understand what you're supposed to be doing. It is absolutely refreshing to be playing a game like this. This literally feels like how gaming used to be back in the 90s. I have a newfound hope for the gaming industry if this game can become the standard in which other games follow. No microtransactions, no pay to win, no live service, no political correctness, or SJW BS. A game that is a pure art form meant to be entertaining. Simply perfection."
Positive,Epic game. Very cool
Positive,"Before Elden Ring, From Software was the only developer who still deserved to have 60€ for a game on pre order. After Elden Ring, they are still the only developer worthy of that title.I do not say this lightly especially for a 60€ game, but: recommended at full price."
Positive,"I didn't really know what to expect going into Elden Ring. I've dabbled in the Souls games before but never beat one, heck I'm 70 hours in and still haven't finished Elden RIng since I don't gave as much as I used too. But I will wholeheartedly say that this is the most fun I've had with a open world game in a long time. I usually get very worn out of open world games even for franchises i love such as Halo, or I even had some issues with Breath of the Wild, but Elden Ring makes exploration so fun and breathtaking. Often when I play open world video games or even video games in general I have a guide up because I'm simply trying to beat the game ASAP due to not having a lot of time to play video games.I can see how going into the game dark with no guides, no tips or anything but my friends advise made the experience all that much better because it was my journey, I found the build that worked and was fun to me. Everything I did was my choice and every death was also no ones fault but my own as I rarely ever thought that I had a cheap death. (Some fights and deaths can be BS though too)I am almost there my dear Ranni. Can't wait for the Golden Week Steam sale so I can buy the rest of the Souls franchise and see what I was missing out all those years before.  I often don't and can't make time for these types of games but spending a few hours every couple of days made it so I had a adventure every night of the week and I can't wait to Finish the Fight. <3 Definitely and more than likely my Game of the Year for 2022.I hope the DLC comes out soon because I desperately want to go back to the worlds between :("
Positive,"Wait a month or longer, because this game has some major issues. (Unless you are playing offline). Co-op with two people does not work well and three player co-op is far worse. When you get invaded during co-op it will break even more. Such as having the invader fly off into the sky never to return, which will be followed by your cooperator. I can not recommend this game in this state.This is my updated review - The game is fantastic and they have fixed most of the issues. Most reviews on here will show that now. On a side note, modding. Not that I would condone modding this game. But... if I did approve of modding, which I dont, try seemless coop. Of course I dont l condone modding. Enjoy!"
Positive,"Elden Ring on PC has a lot of performance issues. If you want details, watch Digital Foundry's analysis video. That said, the issues do not entirely ruin the experience even if you have a budget rig like me. Running the game on custom settings @1080p, it runs fine most of the time with some freezes and stutters. I got used to it over time but it's not happening 24/7. Nothing that you can't look past atm. The game itself is fun and you'll have to play it yourself to experience it. Does the game have issues? Yes. Does it ruin the game? No. Is it bad that it has issues? Yes. Should you buy the game? Decide for yourself. There's an 11/10 game here if you can adjust and look past the issues for now. They'll fix it eventually but it is what it is. PC gaming comes with bad ports and launch experiences so yea"
Positive,"60 FPS locks is something I can accept, but please support ultra wide screensIt's 2022 now and there is no reason to not support 21:9 screens"
Positive,Performance issues is bad....but great game.
Positive,Where do I go? What am I supposed to do? - The GameAlso nominated it for Steam GOTY because of course
Positive,This was the first and last time I'll ever receive a woman's touch.
Positive,elden ring is the game that truly made me feel like a gamer and a streamer - i love this game and i am so glad i got to experience it.
Positive,7.7/10. Please return to quality over quantity formula.
Positive,"Before this game I could only think about suicide. Now, after playing it, I can't stand dying anymore. Thank you FromSoftware"
Positive,"Aside from the horrible appalling performance on PC, resulting in my constantly tampering with my configurations despite having all the tech requirements, the game is great. I just wish that the immersion wasn't constantly broken by stuttering and frame dips."
Positive,"No tortoises, only dogs."
Positive,errrrm... this game is wittewaly so frickin hard and i cant beat the first flippin boss1/10 game >:c
Positive,Better than Sekiro. Highly recommended
Positive,i paid for pain
Positive,Probably one of the best games I have ever played. Merges Soulsborne with a game like the Witcher 3 flawlessly. Don't take any notice of the people review bombing because their $200 pc can't run it
Positive,Seek strong foe
Positive,"I'm still just aimlessly wandering around, good times."
Positive,I don't think there is much I can say that all the other positive reviews haven't already said.  It is almost everyone's 2022 GOTY for a reason.  Simply amazing!
Positive,This game made my erectile dysfunction go away 👍
Positive,"Elden ring is one of the games that have ever been created by FromSoftware. That said, as much as I love FromSoft games, this game may not be the best experience for all Soulsborne enjoyers. The open-world structure of Elden Ring would then mean that there are many other options and places to go to. If you are more accustomed to the more linear structure of previous Soulsborne games, the vast map and things to do in Elden Ring will be overwhelming. Even after 70 hours of gameplay and nearing/already in end-game content, I think I've only done 40% of all the dungeons.In terms of content, Elden Ring has the most bosses I've ever encountered and has endless caves and catacombs to explore. Though most of the time you would be over-leveled when you decide to turn back and explore them.This review seems pretty shit but the game is a must try 10/10."
Positive,"Allow me to preface this review with the fact that I am a fromsoft nerd, and I've loved everything that they've put out in the entire soulsborne series. I had high hopes for this game, and spent many months letting that anticipation build. For me, it has not disappointed whatsoever. My expectations were ridiculously high, and this game has still managed to surpass them. 20 hours into my journey, I've defeated one ""major"" boss and spent a ton of time admiring landscapes and trying different weapons on a variety of mobs throughout the open world system. I have noticed frame drops during certain boss fights, but nothing noticeable outside of that, and I am not running on the newest of hardware (1080ti+8086k if that says anything). There is a lot of good to say about this game, and I can only describe it as a logical progression in this series of games from FromSoft. Just enough odes to old games to keep a loyal playerbase entertained, but not too many to seem gimmicky and unoriginal. I would 100% recommend this to any fan of soulsborne games, as it is a totally different adventure which somehow feels right at home. As for newer players, beware. I feel as if the open world concept may take away from the aspects of the game which were built upon by previous games such as combat mechanics. Best of luck!"
Positive,"This game annihilates me but for some reason I still like like it, 11/10 would recommend."
Positive,Time to git gud
Positive,يعني شي شي اللعبة مدري شقول
Positive,"I'm already suffering, thanks Miyazaki."
Positive,I like Ranni's feet 💙
Positive,"I hate Dark Souls, I really do. For many reasons.But I love this game. If you're thinking ""I may not like this game because I don't like Dark Souls"", give it a chance. It is far more fun, less grindy, less repetitive and more forgiving. It still lacks accessibility options, unfortunately, but it is, by far, the most inclusive From Software game. They really hitted it this time."
Positive,"UPDATED REVIEW: This could be the best game I've ever played. There's nothing like your first time experience Dark Souls...Until now. Elden Ring is everything I loved about the original Dark Souls, filled with so much more wonder. It's the culmination of a decade's worth of game design, splashed with devious surprises that ask you to discard what you thought you knew about the franchise. By leaving the ""Dark Souls"" name behind, Elden Ring is free to build new lore and present a wholly unique dark fantasy world. Despite this, the state of the PC port is still unacceptable. I've never had a game run so poorly on my system, with regular frame drops, controller issues, and hitching every time I discover a new area. The game is playable for me, but only barely. It took a lot of work on my end, tinkering with various settings in and out of the game (Nvidea control panel, CPU processes etc.) to see Elden Ring running anywhere close to 60FPS. It's not quite as bad as Bloodborne on PS4 in terms of performance, but it's certainly my closest comparison. Be warned. PREVIOUS REVIEW: This game suffers from terrible stuttering and poor performance. I should be used to sloppy PC ports by now, but genuinely thought From would have nailed this one. I have no doubt the game is fantastic, but the performance is so inconsistent that I do not recommend buying this for PC in it's current state."
Positive,"its good. dont listen to people that hate on a certain playstyle or summoning or whatever. you bought the whole game, use the whole game"
Positive,"You don’t have the right, o, you don’t have the right, you don’t have the right o, you don’t have the right"
Positive,DO I EVEN HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING AT THIS POINT. JUST GO AND PLAY IT. GAME OF THE DECADE !!!
Positive,Once you know the mechanics = You can beat all of them!!
Positive,"TL;DRPROS: -Really fun with friends-Great memories-Battles feel very worth while and make you appreciate your skill-Nice challenge-I got spooked a lot which made it more fun-Nice having to work hard in a game instead of just spam and win-Bragging rightsCONS:- Not that fun solo-NO HUG EMOTE..yet-Wish there was more dynamic music instead of background noise-Boring open world-Level design not as impressive as past souls games-many enemies are copy paste -dungeons are extremely short-Bad camera-HORRIBLE collisions. Enemies can attack you through walls but you cant attack them back through said wall. -Enemies can attack you from outside boss room-Easy to get stuck on everything because they use 1999 styled BOX COLLISIONS???? (DUMB)- Bosses are too big for their areas so they are sticking outside the map majority of the time- Really dont care for its style of story telling. And even then, theres not much story- Bosses feel flat and arent very impressive. I didnt feel the impact of the characters( that you should be feeling) based off their lore because the story telling is so lacking.- Some of the magic particle effects dont impress. They just dont look good- Even at highest graphics, the game still looks extremely dated. This doesnt matter that much to me, but to some it does.-cutscenes are like 2 seconds long and disappointing Do I like souls games? No. Do I play them? Yes. The level design in dark souls 3 was absolutely inspirational. I hated the game, but I played it anyways. I did not purchase this for myself, I had been watching some cool people play it, and one of them bought it for me so I could take part.( via the multi-player mod.) The open-world aspect is pretty empty. SADLY. I expected more because I have always been a big fan of this series-level designs. It has inspired my own work.  I was on chemotherapy when I played dark souls 3. It sucked, but I just HAD to see what the next area's theme was. It was just so cool.  Probably not the best game to play while suffering so much, but I could not help myself. It was like exploring a museum. Open World is one of my fav game genres... but it's extremely hard to pull off. Extremely.I would never play this game myself, but I had amazing people to play this with, so? I..."" endured"" this game for them. I ended up being forced to play with an extremely broken Xbox 360 controller with a 1-2 second input lag. That definitely made the game SOOO much harder, but after like 30 hours I started getting used to it. I ended up enjoying fighting enemies and bosses. So much so, that I would rush over to any strong enemy I saw, just for practice. Listen, I'm not a racist.....BUT.... if I see a tree sentinel or a giant? I'ma pull-up. I had hoped to 100% the entire game with each ending. I have to find someone to do this with now, but this game will >FOREVER< have an >INCREDIBLE< spot in my heart, because of the warmest memories that come with it. Bittersweet truly. But so worth it.This is an amazing game to play with FRIENDS via multi-player mod. I don't think you should play this game by yourself, it's just not the same.Many of the boss arenas are too small, so the bosses tend to stick outside of the map walls, making it harder to tell what attack is about to land. Which also makes the camera have a stroke. So ...that's interesting.The camera isn't great  in general either. Sometimes focusing on enemies, the large ones, will get you killed faster than if you were unfocused. Weird. I think they need to really iron that out. Regardless if it's intentional. I feel the game does things like this on purpose to make the experience harder, but it does not cook well in the end.My other complaints? There should be an attack cancel. Every. other. boss. fight. game. has one. I understand they're trying to make the game hard, but there should be some sort of cancel system in place, within reason. obviously.The collisions! MY GOSH the collisions! Why does this game give you a box collision? That's so archaic. Who even makes games with box collisions anymore? That's like a huge nono? There should be a fitted collision for a game that requires this much focus and accuracy. It's weird because not all the enemies have a box collision but most do. INCLUDING THEIR ATTACKS. INCLUDING YOU! So you can just get stuck on random small props in areas when trying to dodge and.... well! SPLAT.I will say some of the attack collisions are spot-on for some enemies/bosses. BUT.......It's such an easy fix to add fitted collision. Really. I  dont understand why they don't have it.If you dont like dying a lot then don't play this game. If you don't have patience? Dont.  But it gets so much easier once you practice. Dying is just funny most of the time.If you have level headed friends ? PLAY IT RIGHT NOW WITH THEM!I mean c'mon. I killed malenia on my 3rd try. No damage. No summons. No magic.I killed fire giant new game +  first try. Only got hit twice-ish , no  magic, no summons! Barely on torrent. I'm just that epic.I killed lightning dragon second try, No magic, no summons. Easiest boss in the game.I think I will forever be a Souls fan after this experience. One  I was very blessed to be given with this game. And I dont even like the game. It just shows you that friends can really change the perspective of a negative experience. And that's why i love this game and absolutely recommend it.Enjoy the laughs that you will share .Ignore my grammar. Ive gotten 8 hours of sleep in 3 days. Thank you to whoever made seamless co-op a thing. Best 150-ish hours ive ever had in a game."

Positive,"this game has a turtle pope, enough said"
Positive,"Amazing views and a great deal of challanges throughout the entierty of the game. From simple hack and slash to preperations and strategical encounters. A great game for anyone that wakes up and picks violence. Play, enjoy, get frustrated, rage quit just to repeat it all again a few hours later!"

Positive,"It's pretty good, took me 92 hours to finish once and i didn't even do everything.Makes you loose track of time."
Positive,Before Elden Ring I found the idea of a Souls-like to be incredibly daunting.After Elden Ring I've finished the entire Dark Souls series & cannot stop playing the genre.Conclusion:Elden Ring is a highly addictive gateway drug to Souls-like games.
Positive,"I've never played a Souls game before. I very rarely pay full price for games that aren't from publishers that I know and trust like Bethesda, Rockstar, etc. Having said that, I've only played Elden Ring for about 9 hours at this point, but it is AWESOME! I didn't realize I would enjoy such a punishing game so much. I usually like to explore lore and enjoy the story of games while playing on easy or normal game modes so I can really pay attention to what the writers of the story wanted me to experience. This game does a fantastic job of making the narrative mysterious enough to keep me pushing forward even though the odds are severely against me. So far there isn't much farming because I'm gaining levels as I explore every corner of the starting area. I've managed to take down the golden tree knight guy and one of the big shambling skeleton dudes so far, as well as some giant crabs. I got stuck in a transporter trap to the crystal caves which sucked for a while, and I don't think I'm going the right way ever, but I feel like the game will make sure I don't get too far in the wrong direction. Well worth the money and time so far! I'm adding FromSoftware to my list of favorite game developers/publishers."
Positive,"The greatest hits of dopamine you will ever have, when I say hit I mean like a Freight train slamming down with such force that you will feel like you got blasted to outer space and you're on top of the world. What I am referring to is once you go from being 1 shot by most little dudes to being able to solo some of the most aggressive jumping bosses you will know what I am talking about. This game takes all the features that was great from Sekiro, Dark Souls, Demon Souls and merges it into this wonderful masterpiece. The game subtle in its own way teaches you that you don't have to take on every single boss that appears in your path sometimes it's best to go back farm up some materials to upgrade your weapons and return to finish the job. This game out of all the games I've played I can proudly say will definitely be a contender for Game of the Year."
Positive,"To know I did not suffer such denigration for nothing ... Even in this darkest of nights, I see the moonlight. Ahh! My guiding moonlight. My darkmoon queen Ranni. Thoust will be an order not of gold, but the stars and moon of the chill night. Come forth our age of the stars."
Positive,"This is very good game even for those that have not played Dark Souls due to Open World it allows users to have flexible choices. You can grind-up to face opponents or fight them earlier-on for more challenge. It is essentially a big sand-box game with few major quests and lots of grinding.Performance is not perfect for PC but a lot better than other games in big platforms. For comparison this game requires more graphics than Warhammer 3, but Elden Ring runs a lot better and has very little bugs."
Positive,"""I doubt you could even imagine it. That which commanded the sales charts, giving gamers its fullest brilliance. The Elden Ring, oh Elden Ring, created by someone...or something. Don’t tell me you don’t play it. Boot up the PC. It rocks.""I love it! DLC when?"
Positive,"Let's start with the Cons first. Starting off, not friendly at all to PC users, Keybindings take a while to get setup and used to, and you might have to re-learn some odd controls in order to play on PC. That being said... Elden Ring is one of the best games of the year so far, fantastic and huge openworld, brutal and challenging gameplay, Unique and exceptional Monsters and Bosses. 100's of hours of story and progression, many directions you can take with your character. Absolutely a 10/10 for me."
Positive,"If you like Dark Souls, you'll love this. Simple as that. 10/10"
Positive,literally the best game of all time
Positive,you can get huggies from a women 10/10 game
Positive,"Афигено! Первая игра для меня, в которой реально интересено исследовать мир, ведь нет надоедливых вопросиков. Если нежалко нервов, то обязательно надо поиграть.-"
Positive,"As someone who is a big fan of the soulsborne games, this is by far the greatest game to come from From Software. The fighting mechanics feel so refined, the way bosses work are most definitely refined, and for a open world game there's so much to do in between bosses. I also love the fact that the game has a very Lord of the Rings feel to it, and all the NPCs feel different and unique from one another. This game is a culmination of everything good about all the past souls games meshed into one. 10/10 game good"
Positive,"Elden Ring is an absolutely amazing game that you will discover something different as you progress in the game. There are hundreds of places to discover with a lot of mysteries to solve. The concept of the game is as interesting as its mechanics, certain enemies look rather unusual and mysterious. As for the difficulty, it is very unforgiving for certain situations. While this might be negative for some players, I find it extremely motivational and couraging for competitive players. There are a little bit of issues with optimization when it comes to the performance however, the game itself still worths playing."
Positive,"I came into this not having played a single Dark Souls game. I didn't really know what to expect, but lately my standards for a game that hooks me have only been growing. Yet this still managed to do it. Between fun and engaging combat mechanics, the low death penalty that enables infinitely retrying encounters, and a fruitful world to explore, Elden Ring really is a great game :)"
Positive,Try fingers but hole
Positive,Best souls game so far!
Positive,"Beautiful, fun, challenging, freedom to explore, crafting doesn't feel tedious nor does it feel easily to exploit.Would recommend to almost anyone.Since everyone seems to compare this to a ""Dark Souls Breath of The Wild"" I'd like to say this game lacks some things Dark Souls has. But in a good way. The ability to go back to areas you've played before and still have fun is a positive.You're able to skip pretty much anything if you want and it isn't too difficult to run past on your horse. However, you'll be wanting to go back and explore those areas since there is good stuff hidden everywhere.I would say they did an open world better than Breath of The Wild (granted that game is already five years old)The combat feels smooth and can be challenging. Which you can skip most of that. You can even farm items to sell for your levels if you are having a difficult time.The combat feels like the right step forward coming from their past games.People complaining about FPS stutters are likely on potatoes. If you have a mid tier modern PC you'll likely be fine. (Also, stop calling this a port.)"
Positive,"I do not recommend this game simply because every other future game will be a let down in comparison. Probably the only game thats met and excelled the hype. No mans Sky may have EVENTUALLY gotten good, and i think Cyberpunk is getting there. But this game meets and destroys your expectations as much as it destroys you in game.Definitly the easiest Souls game From has made due to all the tools you can use to break the game. But since theyre all optional and you need to discover them its a great way to combat difficulty when you can just say:""Yes I played the whole game maidenless and unbound jump how could you tell?"""
Positive,"it's the game that john darksoul is from, good game"
Positive,"This game is a masterpiece on a stack.if u rly want to become the sigma you desire to be,then this is the game for you."

Positive,"This is a very good game, but you shouldn't buy it yet.The bugs and exploits are fun and all, but the fact so many people are abusing them in multiplayer really drags this game down. On top of that, you will reach a point where you realize no matter how much you level vigor, every enemy will two or three shot you, because late game the enemies do more damage than NG+7 bosses from any previous souls title. I love this game, and have thoroughly enjoyed my time (up until the very last areas, which feel like a complete slog), but they absolutely need to retune the damage and fix the bugs that players are unfortunately taking advantage of to ruin other people's games.This game was meant to be played with people, and while I can excuse either horrible community or terribly balanced gameplay, both makes this game grind to a halt enjoyment-wise. Sure, it's easy to just run past all the enemies that do 800 damage on nigh-undodgeable ranged attacks and gather all the items you want then never look back, but it really takes all the fun out of a souls title when you feel like you're fighting something you have no chance to learn against and have to simply out-statstick. And there's a LOT of enemies in this game that feel like a pure stat check.In short, wait for the script kiddies to get kicked off or wait for From to remember that stats don't make a challenge, or if you must play this game play online and take advantage of every cheesy strategy you can. Since they nerfed a midgame boss that I honestly thought was easier than some basic enemies in late game areas, I highly suspect in one to two months there will be broad sweeps of nerfs that'll drastically improve the pacing of the game, and I'd highly encourage you to wait till then, If you must play, make ample use of great shields and bloodhound's step lmao"
Positive,By far the most addicting game I have had the pleasure to play in many many years! Not for the weak-hearted though!! 100/100
Positive,i opened a chest and it sent me straight to hell  10/10
Positive,"It's a great game, there's no doubt about that. If that's all you want to know, now you do lol. But let me extend a little bit more. It's the culmination of  From Soft work. Everything they learned, everything that worked well, everything that made the Souls series the cult success that it was, has been refined, improved and assembled into a magnificent experience. The attention to detail, the environments, the combat, and most of all, the scale of it all  supersedes by large the predecessors Souls games.  They could have easily called this DS4 and it would fit like a glove.  But the name change did indeed give them a bit more freedom to experiment with the imagery and lore. Fans of the Souls franchise of course, will feel right at home. There are, here and there a few recicled enemies and animations from previous iterations that veterans will recognize, but it doesnt hinder the experience in any way, as it's not overly done. And then again, if it works well, why change just for the sake of it?Major difference is that Elden Ring is much more an open world game. It's got a completely different map structure from the Souls games. It's a giant open outdoors map, with several caves and dungeons you can explore, each with a final Boss. Enemies also roam or lurk in the open world, not just in the dungeons, they are everywhere. From lowly mobs to giant bosses. Overall, while it's by no means an easy game, it's easier than it's predecessors. It comes with the territory, I guess, of being a much more open world. It's fairly easy to lure the largest bosses and enemies against the weakling mobs, for some quick farming, for example. To try to prevent this, enemies have an invisible area where they are suposed to be contained. If they wander too far from it while following you, they may simply disapear and respawn at their initial location. Everything has been streamlined to help the player. Just a couple of  examples, you no longer spend your stamina while sprinting, unless you're in batle. If you're just moving or traveling, you can sprint all you want. You have more options to customize your weapons, armors and their skills, than ever before.  And I think I already mentioned this, but the world is massive. Some things could be better though. It also keeps the From Soft tradition in bugs, like shooting arrows to the ground at your feet when trying to aim down sights to a lower floor. Or enemies not taking damage when they are on the floor after a critical hit.The anti-alliasing will turn itself ON again, at each game restart for some reason. And also, the slowdowns that were prevalent at launch and in the subsequent weeks have been ironed out for the most part. Some areas of the map are more demanding than others   for the hardware, increasing the chance of CTD in those areas, but nothing excessive. All in all, in 400 hours i had maybe 10 crashes, most of them in the same area, the capital city underground tunels. The sheer scale of the map, the optimization, the amazing gamplay and intrincate character customization, the many hidden bosses, everything is top. Best souls game to date."
Positive,"The story of Elden Ring makes you crave more if you're a lore seeker. I believe many things are up for interpretation, making the game more exciting. Upon completing the game, especially if you attempt 100% of every location possible, you feel exhilarated yet wonder if there's still more to Elden Ring.Combat is clunky with the auto-aim camera style, especially if you are a caster, as there is no reticle system, but it is a game mechanic that needs getting used to. Otherwise, the combat is very satisfying, especially after you beat up a challenging encounter. Without the currently pointless Ray Tracing implementation, the game is graphically gorgeous, and each environment you encounter is immersive.The biggest downside of Elden Ring would be the 60 FPS lock. This game is undoubtedly made for controllers, but I managed through and through with a keyboard + mouse. For those who have an UltraWide monitor, as of this review, FromSoftware has yet to implement support for it.Seamless Co-Op Mod is life-changing. Game recommends high-end GPUs but advises 1080p resolution with an FPS lock. No upscaling. RTAO and RT Shadows only. No GI and no reflections.I won't hold my breath, but here's hoping FromSoftware unlocks the FPS, implements all that Ray Tracing offers, UltraWide support and upscaling.Elden Ring is worth the full price for the amount of content you get."
Positive,"This is quite simply the best game I've ever played. It's everything good about Dark Souls, and everything good about Breath of the Wild, and none of the bad. The world is rich, and every corner you explore is accompanied by ""what the hell is that thing!?"" followed by ""I'mma kill it.""I know some people have been having performance issues, but I haven't experienced very much of it. A few stutters here and there, but it's easy to forget they're there when the game is this good.Edit: I wrote this at 11 hours of play. 170 hours later, this opinion has only gotten stronger. Don't skip this one."
Positive,"i was sceptical at first since in the past 2-3 years every AAA game to get released has been extremely overhyped and ended up being bad or just ok however this game is just amazing, first of all havent experienced any stutters at all while playing this game and my pc isnt even that good (rx 570 and ryzen 5 3600)the combat 10/10, animations/visuals 10/10, farming system feels very rewarding and is fun to do, character customisation 10/10, always something to do and explore, bosses are all very unique and challenging as hell causing extreme rage and also extreme dopamine release when you finally beat them.highly recommend."
Positive,"after the latest update the performance is awful literally unplayable freezes every couple of seconds, before update worked fineedit: well now it works great so i love the dlc get it if you want"
Positive,2022 Best Game
Positive,Definitively the heir to the souls series albeith a somewhat shaky launch day. Once all ennemies stop being invisible this game will definitively be my top 10
Positive,babe plz play it unu
Positive,Try fingersBut hole!
Positive,Praise the Sun....errr ring
Positive,"First the good stuff :+ The game doesn't hold your hand and isn't worried or afraid if you miss something, it gives you a vague direction on the map with the shards (bonfires) you discover as to where the next closest main boss is but that's it, you don't need to follow it and often it's better to do side content first before heading to go through the main legacy dungeons of the game.+Packed with a ton of content that'll be impossible to experience in one go and is for the most part well made apart from an issue I'll mention later which is how much it re-uses bosses as you approach the end of the game. Even when you think you found and saw everything in an area, there's always something else you might've missed in some place even when going through that place in your 3rd or 4th play-through.+Best diversity of builds we've ever had, almost everything works well and is enjoyable to use and experiment with and it'll keep bringing you back to make new characters or re-spec your main one to experience the game differently. Though an issue exists along side this benefit, which is how incredibly easy it is to break the game with many different characters builds and set ups even as a casual player. There's not that much risk involved when you know where everything is in the game to become overpowered.+Beautiful art direction and some of the best use of colours I've ever seen in games, every region has its own special look and feel that feels unique and atmospheric. When you think of red and orange you'll think of the rot fields of Gael, when you think of blue misty lakes and green cliff sides you'll think of Liurina. It's easy to find yourself lost just starring at the game's beautifully crafted world and even taking snap shots for your steam's screen shot library.+Incredibly easy to get sucked into the game's world, lore, characters and gameplay, often i found myself saying ""just one more hour or 30 minutes""  just to then spend another 4 or 5 hours playing and missing a meal or going to bed at 5am+Incredibly well done voice acting while pulling voice actors you usually don't ever hear in other games as is Fromsoft's tradition at this point, you won't hear Troy Baker voicing half the cast in this game or some random goons with the voice of Steve Blum trying to stab you.+Pretty much most of the new characters you get to meet are all fantastically done, some do feel like they ran out of time to flesh out more such as a nice archer lady with a wolf, but with most they've done a good job considering the sheer amount characters there is.+NPC quest lines finally don't break if you miss some character in one area just once, a big flaw that always plagued these games in the past is how if you miss one lil' chit chat with an NPC in one specific place and time it would break their whole quest and require NG+ or a backed up save to re-do and fix. Granted there's still some quests that might fail to some extend if you miss some things for too long but nothing on the levels as before thankfully but you'll still need probably a wiki to find some of the locations some characters are at.Problems the game has are the following :-Poor optimization, can't hold 60 fps and stutters and hangs when traveling in the game a lot. It's also prone to crashing, especially in MP where I've had a total of 10 crashes in my 180 hours of playtime.-Re-uses a lot of boss fights for its side content, there's a pool of side content bosses that are used for side dungeons and exploration out of which all will be re-used at the very least 3 or 4 times through out the game. So expect to fight the same side-boss like 3,4 or even 5 times as you fully try to 100% explore the game's regions. This isn't an issue regarding the main bosses which are all unique and some of which are rather memorable such as the Radahn fight.-Some bosses can be rather annoying to fight as they have a tendency to fly, teleport or jump away a million miles from you which then requires you to run or ride to them for a good while just to hit them 1 or 2 times maybe and for them to once again do the same thing over and over, turning some boss fights into wild goose chases (*cough* ASTEL *cough*) , extra bad if you're trying to fight one of those while somewhat under level where you ain't doing all that much damage.-The most broken SoulsBorne game in history, due to it being open world you can break this game in less than an hour if you know what you're doing, this is both a plus and a minus, since it's fun to break it and go off and do a very different path of progression that messes up any sense of balancing but this can make the game incredibly trivial and easy and you might even do it by accident honestly, it doesn't take following some youtube guide that has memes green screened in constantly to end up breaking this game's system really.-Invasions are now only on for people with co-op partners, unlike in past games where you could invade solo people or in DS3's case where it would favor putting you in matches where someone has a partner but it wouldn't be 100% of the time , now however it is so and this is causing issues for both co-op people and Invader people. Invaders now are getting ganked hard most of the time, this means it's now all about using the most powerful and cheesy stuff to win against a 3 man gank team  while co-op people are now basically forced to always be fighting against many invasions over and over cause they are the soul targets the game aims at for invasions and no one else. Combined with the fact it's so incredibly easy to twink in this game (getting late game gear at low level starts) it has made easily the worst invasion pvp experience out of all their games for both the invader and invaded. Like there's still fun to be had in it, it's kind of a fun mess but at the same time it's beyond busted, especially with how invasions work in the open world where people are not allowed to use horses when in MP and sometimes invaders get put incredibly far away from their target which leads to a lot of running to find each other.-A lot of re-used animations,models and sounds. It's nothing too new for them to do this but Elden Ring has easily taken the crown for most re-use of old assets I've seen from their games. From enemy models, animations,sounds or AI behaviors we've seen all the way back to Dark Souls 1 till' now but just with a few tweaks and some new moves perhaps. Not saying there isn't new stuff, there is but anyone who has been a big fan of their games for years and years will so easily spot how much they just simply re-used. Like for an example the annoying little rock imps you find in many catacomb dungeons are re-skinned from the little jester guys from Dark Souls 3 though with a few new moves and a tendency to be more dodge happy but most animations and behaviors are the same from DS3 on them. You even have this tree demon side boss that gets repeated 4 times that's basically the asylum demon's model from DS1 but without its head, though with these ones they did give it a lot of new different moves and made it feel rather very different to fight.-No covenants, be it pvp or coop or whatever which is really a shame. Fantastic game, i love it but its problems and flaws must be noted."
Positive,Runs fine for me :^)
Positive,i have 300 hours on ps4 prior to getting elden ring on steam.it's definitely been game of the year for me.
Positive,Game looks great and combat is the best it's been in a Fromsoft game.
Positive,its only good when you win 10/10
Positive,"The looooong way to git gud has never been better!P.S. Runs perfectly, without any stutter, on my Linux PC at the highest settings. And unexpectedly is a fantastic experience on my new Steam Deck; at lower settings but looks still great with constant 30 fps . <3"
Positive,"THE GOODThis game has been on my most anticipated list for a long long time.  I am happy to say the wait was worth it!  If you are familiar with Fromsoft, you know that their games are very difficult; that being said, this game is very very fun yet I am very very bad at these games, haha.There is so much to explore in this game, it's like Breath of the Wild on turbo steroids.  Every time I hit a firm roadblock I can go find other things that I can handle and come back later, able to overcome those roadblocks.The amount of versatility in builds is phenomenal and the enemy and environment variety is great.  Currently playing a spellblade character and I don't feel weak or overpowered, I feel strong but often get ahead of myself and get proven wrong by the games enemies, haha.NO MICROTRASACTIONS!!!  Boy, this day in age, I feel I can never praise the exclusion of microtransactions enough.  It feels like more and more AAA games contain them, it feels great to know I can obtain everything strictly through playing the game.THE BADOther people might have more bad to talk about, but for my personal tastes in games, the only thing I felt FromSoft has done bad on is the freezing issue on this PC port.  Man this issue has lead to so many deaths for me.  There are fixes you can look up that will help, but not take it completely away at this time.  I'm really, really hoping they patch this soon.OVERALLThis game is a dream game for me and deserving of a 10/10, but until they fix the freezing, I will leave it at a 9/10.  The game, with the freeze workaround, is more than playable, but every hour or so, expect a 2 second freeze then jump ahead.Yes, I still recommend the game because the gameplay is just that good for me.  If you like dark fantasy RPG games, get this one.  FromSoft has done a very good here."
Positive,"The game's story and atmosphere and content are all amazing. Recommending it to anyone who is into dark souls type games.However there are yes, performance problems. This will not be an issue though because FromSoftware will fix these in about a few months, so I will give it a recommendation from my side. Lots and lots and LOTS of stuff to do in this game!"
Positive,Best SoulLike i have ever played.Amazing world to explore but dont bother looking for loot in destroyable objects.
Positive,"Game good, Turtle like & recommend"
Positive,"I've come to make an announcement: Shadow the Hedgehog's a bitch-ass motherfucker. He pissed on my fucking wife. That's right. He took his hedgehog fuckin' quilly dick out and he pissed on my FUCKING wife, and he said his dick was THIS BIG, and I said that's disgusting. So I'm making a callout post on my Twitter.com. Shadow the Hedgehog, you got a small dick. It's the size of this walnut except WAY smaller. And guess what? Here's what my dong looks like. That's right, baby. Tall points, no quills, no pillows, look at that, it looks like two balls and a bong. He fucked my wife, so guess what, I'm gonna fuck the earth. That's right, this is what you get! My SUPER LASER PISS! Except I'm not gonna piss on the earth. I'm gonna go higher. I'm pissing on the MOOOON! How do you like that, OBAMA? I PISSED ON THE MOON, YOU IDIOT! You have twenty-three hours before the piss DROPLETS hit the fucking earth, now get out of my fucking sight before I piss on you too!"
Positive,"9/10 - Absolutely amazing game Pros: -Endless fun, lots of of reasons to replay the game -Amazing graphics and art design -The music is a masterpiece -Most of the game is very well balanced -Boss design is to die for -Honestly I could list like a 1000 more pros but this should convince you to buy the game alreadyCons: -Some parts of the game do seem unbalanced due to the open world and access to areas new players might find themselves in very early on -A lot of the bosses/minibosses are repeated which isn't a big deal but can be a little underwhelming when you fight your way through a long, difficult dungeon and you end up fighting the same boss you saw 4 times already for very little reward Play it c: and don't you dare go hollow"
Positive,"260ish hours between PC and PS5 now, but I can safely say that this is undoubtedly GOTY 2022.  This is a legendary game that has awoken what I like to call ""playground talk"" aka talking with people back in recess at schools where you talk about your experience with a game with others and nobody has an identical experience and inevitably people will say ""you had a WHAT? I didn't find that in my playthough!"".  This game is so massive it's very unlikely two people will have the same experience and it's also unlikely that they will find every single possible thing on their first go, which leads to some insane replayability after you have finished the game once.  You have so many options to play with in this game and the amount of gear you can obtain is unreal, lots of weapons have unique movesets or traits that can lend their hand to a completely different playstyle.  This very well may be one of the most massive games I have ever played in my life, and if you want $60 to last you more than a dozen hours or so, this game will EASILY give you the playtime that $60 can buy.  Whenever this game ever goes on sale if you have any remote interest in it, just straight up buy it.  Buy it at full price.  You want a game that will let you get wholy consumed in it's universe and lore?  This game will fit the bill like a glove."
Positive,Messmer is very nice and easy boss :)
Positive,"What an amazing achievement by From Software. Not only is Elden Ring a ""big Dark Souls"", it seems they finally managed to make the Soulsborne style of play accessible to the masses. There's not that much to say about it that is negative, the early bugs are the only objective complaint I have. Subjectively though, the amount of freedom and choices can be a little paralyzing compared to other Souls games..but I guess that is like complaining about candy being too good. Also, there are balance issues and they might never completely go away, but that is unavoidable in a game this size. And to be honest, even though I never really co-op in PvE, I would rather they made co-op viable everywhere rather than make multiplayer activity enable invasions. It seems people drop summon signs only at bosses now because everywhere else it means an invasion every 15 minutes and I can see how that's not for everybody.The world is beyond massive, feels alive and is full of distractions and side adventures. I can't remember any other game offering so much content for the price. Just as long as you understand what Souls games are..difficult is not the right term to describe them, they are challenging and punish mistakes but that is the reason they feel so rewarding. Your skill is far more important than any shortcuts you can take in most RPGs, such as over leveling or buying some advantage. You might spend even hours on a difficult boss, but the feeling you eventually get after succeeding is so worth it.That said, I don't see this game being a waste of money for anyone."
Positive,I LOVE COCK AND THE BALLS TOO UWU *shits pants* OOPSY WOOPSY
Positive,"One of the best games I've ever played. Definitely a little hard to ""100%"" i.e. find everything, complete every character's quest, know where to go etc. (I doubt I've managed to do that myself, though I've definitely finished the vast majority of the content). Quest design is also not necessarily linear, depending on which regions you clear first (some character's will show up in different regions in different orders, making it difficult to ""fully clear"" one region at a time). All that aside, the sheer magnitude and scale of the game is incredible. So much to do and explore. An awe-inspiring accomplishment. First experience is nearly guaranteed to be one of your most enjoyable gaming experiences. Enemies and bosses are rich and diverse, challenging but not overly so (will obviously vary person to person). The lore and world is also incredible - starkly contrasting regions and storylines make the entire journey feel fresh throughout, and you never get tired of continuing exploring or progressing the story. For the most part the game never feels tedious or repetitive (not really many tedious encounters or activities). The big, sprawling castles and large dungeons/areas are incredible to explore, especially with added aspects of verticality and parkour. However, smaller dungeon design can also get a bit repetitive (particularly catacombs and caves). Some the coolest gear/spells/weapons in terms of power and look are usually locked behind late-game areas, making it difficult to experience them fully and play with them in one playthrough. Although that is not the case for all things, and there are plenty of amazing things you can pick up in the early regions. Switching builds is also made extremely easy and convenient through the addition of a certain item. Adds a lot of potential for switching up your playstyle mid play-through to experiment with new gear you find, meaning you don't have to lock yourself into one 'build' per playthrough. Really welcome feature. Overall, an incredible and beautiful game that will stun you with its sheer scale and scope. Super ambitious and manages to pay off brilliantly."
Positive,Greatest open world ActionRPG ever made.

I decided to go in blind and thought I was doing great until I realized that I had just finished the tutorial. 13 hours in and I have just completed the first boss, but I'm loving the exploration and the thrill of finally defeating a tough enemy. Be warned that you'll have to know some things coming in, as it wasn't until my 8th hour that I figured out how to level up."

Positive,I am not good at this game.
Positive,game of the year
Positive,"ELDEN RING 2, WHEN?!"
Positive,praise my review
Positive,"Beautiful game, but there's fps issues. Highly recommended though"
Positive,"Main Game:One of the best games ever made.I killed all 165 bosses. Almost all NPC invaders. Every inch of this game is detailed, hard-labored and beautifully created.I made an INT/DEX build with Moonveil katana. I played mostly melee (moonveil's weapon skill) and close combat. Yet it was fun to cast some spells time to time. My side gear was Blood Uchigatana and Cold Rapier.- No summon.- No spirit ashes.- No over-leveling etc.Nevermind. I was a try-hard 'm saying. Main game was kinda felt easy even though my play style was kinda rough.But there is one thing. Some of the bosses felt unfair.This is not a git gud thing you know. After DS2, I feel like boss designers took a different route to create new bosses.They needed it too. To keep creating soulslike genre alive.Their solutions was;-> Bosses,- with big big health bar.- endless combos. - almost impossible to escape wide sweep attacks. - No matter what level (or build) you are in, some bosses hit like a truck. - Ridiculous random grab attacks etc. etc.Overall I loved Elden Ring bosses. So many ideas, so many. So much fun.But as I mentioned above there were some bosses that doesn't give you the ""Mission Accomplished Feeling"" after killing it.You just say ""Oh its finally over."". So repetitive, so dull. Why?It doesn't make the boss HARD. It just makes it more tedious.Best game ever. 95/100. Then there was Shadow of the Erdtree DLC.Damn.I sincerely apologize to the main game. You were good brother, you were fair at least.Again I killed all main-optional bosses and invaders. Again mostly melee (moonveil is a beuty).Brothers and sisters, I'm literally glad this DLC's over.Let's start with the positive sides.- I loved all the optional bosses. They were so creative and fun to explore and fight.- I loved all the new areas, visually astonishing, just perfect.- New weapons, new armors etc. they did a great job.- Scadutree scaling was a fine idea either.But..Main bosses.. Wow.Lellana was good. Really. Romina was easy. Hippos and Lions were meeh, alright. But Messmer? Radahn?What? They were unfair, bad hit box, 20-25 hit combos ending with wide area attacks, tons of health, different phases, huge amount of damage.... Again I'm saying I don't think it's related to the git-gud thing. I'm not having fun.. Dodge, dodge, dodge, run, dodge, Dodge, dodge, dodge, run, dodge -hit 1- and repeat. To me,It's bad design idea. Cutting corners. Easy way out.It is hard to create a ""Fair Boss"". Not these. It is so easy to make Consort Radahn type of boss. Just code him all the things I wrote above and you have a so called -hard- boss.I mean only boss I called player-summons was Radahn. I just he didn't feel like worth the trouble. I know myself, I could've killed it in a few days of studying him or just using some broken build on the internet. I just didn't want it, you know. Through the end, so bored, so tired of the DLC.I played all Dark Souls series, Sekiro, many soulslike platformer like Hollow Knight.Radahn is by far, the most lazily designed, no brainer, terrible boss I've ever witnessed. (Honorable mentions, Sekiro - Demon of Hatred and maybe Isshin (mostly fair but way too long fight).Neverming I complained too much. Here is my score to the DLC. 80/100.  (sometimes up to 85 maybe).-------In a nutshell,Elden Ring and the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion,Don't mind me complaining all long.Buy it, play it. It's great. Perfect. Astonishing. One of the best ever."
Positive,"Even in a world touched by rot and destruction, there is such tender beauty at every step of the journey. Peace in melancholy. Respect in defeat. Grace at falling and raising yet again, forever striving, forever yearning.It's a beautiful game. Definitely worth the experience."

Positive,"Elden Ring was the game I was excited about the most this year. And while I do have several critcisms about it, I can definitely recommend it to Souls veterans, but also new players, as it's a really good game on it's own despite it's flaws. So let's start with the biggest change in the game in regard to Dark Souls series. The open world. The world of the game is created beautifully, From Software strikes us again with their amazing art style and level design. The latter is also heavily expanded towards not only horizontal, but also vertical exploration with player's new ability to jump at will. There's a ton of places to explore in Lands Between, and pretty much like Breath of The Wild: majority of it is entirely optional, but you'll definitely skip some awesome stuff if you decide to just ignore the open world aspect and go straight for the story. So the world is beatiful, but how's the content? Well here's when the quality roller coaster begins. At the very fist 20 hours I was really excited to explore every single dungeon/cave/mine I found. These are more or less hidden across the whole world, always end with bosses and reward you for completing them. The thing is, after said 20 hours I've noticed how much of the stuff gets recycled over and over again, making dungeon exploration very repetitive towards lategame, and I often found myself completing them not for curiosity, but for the sake of it and hope for some cool reward. I really can't tell you the diffrence between some of the dungeons because most of them look, sound and feel the same. And no. This game is not by any means an ugly game. Now let's take a look at the thing that's always the first thing coming to your mind when you hear Dark Souls. The difficulty. The open world aspect definitely brings back the memories of Dark Souls 1, where you could just ignore some tough boss for now, so you can return stronger and kick his butt later in the game. And that really works in this game, which is a very good thing to have, especially for newcomers. You also have the new spirit ashes system, which allows you to summon an actual enemy to fight for you, and help you! The problem starts with the endgame areas, where game becomes a bit more linear, and the difficulty drastically goes up. But I wouldn't say in a good way. There will be lot of situations where you will be killed in one or two hits from very regular enemy, that you probably encountered many times in the game already, regardless of your stats. It also applies to bosses, which have the potential to one shot you with certain attacks, while also being incredibly agile or resistant. I feel like the difficulty in the late/endgame areas is very artifical at times, and the quality of SOME bosses also drops past certain point. My biggest issue with the game is probably the amount of recycled content that you'll see more and more the further you are in the game. There's nothing wrong with reusing some stuff, but who on earth thought that taking a special and unique boss that's related to one of the most important questlines of the game, and placing him AGAIN in some random mine is a good idea? That's right, you won't face only miniboss/regular enemy reusage, but also important story bosses in some totally random areas! And if we're talking about minibosses, if you decide to explore everything the game has to offer, you'll encounter some of them even 5-7 times, with either no changes to the fight at all, or pairing it with another enemy just to make things harder, which...doesn't always work well.The combat system is for me the biggest improvement in this game. Developers took the best mechanics from Dark Souls 2 and 3 and combined them into this magnificent combat! That's right bois and girls, the power stancing is back! And so are the weapon arts, although here they're referred to as ""Ashes of war"", and for me work way better than they used to in DS3. The weapon variety is way more unique than in third Dark Souls game, and since you can actually choose which Ash of War would belong to your weapon of choice, it gives you a ton of fun build possibilities!So, just to sum things up:  Elden Ring is a great game, and for sure biggest From Software project yet. It's mechanics aren't revolutionary, but they are a HUGE improvement of what's already good in the Souls series. The biggest flaws of the game would be repetitive dungeons and minibosses the further you are in the game, and poor endgame balance, but I do believe the latter one can be patched. Fort,Night"
Positive,i didn't touch grass or a shower since the release
Positive,Insulted and called an incel by the first npc. 10/10
Positive,"This game has revitalized a sense of child-like wonder and discovery.  It is massive, and its scope has depth to match.  Discovering the various ways all the games systems work together becomes a part of the game itself.  I think this one raised the bar, and I genuinely doubt that playing games will ever feel the same now that I have this game to compare every other game to.But also, Fire Giant is the worst and I hate this game."
Positive,"I was there fighting Gwyn, The Lord of Cinder I was there fighting Nashandra i was there fighting Soul of Cinder Dear Hidetaka Miyazaki and the rest FROMSOFTWARE team THANK YOU for this experience,i still cant believe this huge work behind ELDEN RING and how you improved so much the style of our beloved series,i bet some DLCS are on the way too.....!We will talk for years about this masterpiece...Thanks, A Tarnished one"
Positive,"after almost 300 hours, I can finally come to conclusion that this is my favorite game of all time, and I still have a few achievements to get, I am indeed very slow, but I like it like thatI have a lot of games that means a lot to me, that includes most of the other fromsoftware games out there, Bloodborne used to be my favorite game of all time, along with devil may cry 5, I never thought that, one day, a new game would take the throne, despite how amazing a lot of games that I have played are, both on PC and console, there will always be flaws, no games are perfect, and I am talking gameplay wise, not performance wise, performance is another thing, and I won't be talking about that because it is different for every single one of us. elden ring is the only game, for me, that just has no flaws at all, I can't find one, I have tried, but I can't, it's just undoable, I have enjoyed every second I have spent on this game, and there is a lot more to come, I will be playing this game for over a thousand of hours that is a sure thing, I won't be able to get enough of it.fromsoftware never had the best graphics in the industry, but they always manage to make the game look so beautiful every single time, the scenery, the level designs, the enemy and boss designs, these are just amazing, have I mentioned the soundtracks? goosebump generators... the variety this game has is absolutely insane, when you start the game you're like ""oh this looks beautiful and peace, nice trees and wildlife hopping around with a castle in the background and a big tree"".. [SPOILERS] yeah and then you end up taking an elevator to find yourself in a whole underground city filled up with aimbot archers that shoots you from 600 feet away, think that's it? wait till you get inside literal hogwarts itself with burger king looking sorcerers spamming you from across the room, that ends with the best looking boss fight i've ever seen, want more? just go north west for a beautiful manor based on a volcano with weird ass elastic lizards with a fatty boss that rolls over you,, and now you're thinking how could this game get any better, well my friend, remember anor londo? for those who played dark souls definitely knows what i'm talking about, that place looked so huge and pretty right? and we always wanted to explore every corner of it, well elden ring let you do that, the royal capital is the best city in any video game ive ever played, it is so massive, filled up with knights and snowmen shooting bubbles at you, guess what, there's an entire area right below that place, which is the complete opposite of the glorious city, creepy, dark, and unsettling sewers, with rats and fatties, that just make you go deeper and deeper as you progress.. I won't be mentioning every single area of this game but this is barely 30% of it.. [SPOILERS END] just be sure that you won't be seeing the same kind of place twice.now I see a lot of people saying that elden ring isn't a game for everyone, because of how ""hard"" it is, or, how there's no questlog, no minimap, no who cares because what even is the point of all of these things, it wouldn't be a fromsoft game if they had a stupid minimap or questlog like who gives a f about that, the game is open world for a reason, areas that you must not go to, are all blocked by a boss or something similar, everything else, just go over dude, if they throw you in it just like that, it's because that's just how it is, you go wherever you want, go get yourself beat up by some mf's down some random catacombs, just have fun, get some good gear, there's a LOT of weapons, armor, talisman, spells, and other things in early game areas that can make your game so much easier, you just need to explore, if you don't wanna do that then don't play the game, the game isn't ""not for you"" it's you who makes it like that, you're too stubborn to get into something new, just play the damn game, don't give up after 30 minutes saying oH tHE gAmE sUckS iTS ToO harD, well yeah ofc if you reach the first main boss without exploring anything we got a problem here, don't rush it, you're the one who makes the easy mode, this can be the easiest game of all time as much as it can be literally impossible, forget the handholding from other games and try something new, now after a few hours, if you don't like it, completely fine, not everyone will like it, but don't quit after 30 minutes because ""you dont know where to go or what to do"" thats the thing, you go wherever the hell you want, and for what to do? if you explore like i say, you'll find out, as simple as that. 11/10 gamebtw tree sentinel is optional"
Positive,"After 250hrs completely immersed in my Elden Ring experience, I can confidently say that this is the second best Soulsborne game. Now port Bloodborne already."
Positive,"Wow this game just about blew my socks off! I love the incoherent story line and the long pauses when npcs talk, its almost like they are thinking. This game should have an easy mode no doubt if your one of the reddit mongoloids who disagree you are simply wrong partner. Play the game on loser difficulty and let the normal people enjoy the horrible dialog their way. Also go ahead and dumb down the skill menu. I'm thinking some sort of Skyrim skill tree. Also part two there should be house building, what open world don't got no home building. Did I mention the dialog is cringe, I think Cocomelon has more clear and cohesive characters than this game. I mean real talk why I got to talk to the npc three times to get the quest I will forget after getting killed by a dog five times. Im not finna keep an IRL notebook of the quests, no thanks i'm a 600 pound man I already cant get any gamer girls and keeping a notebook of game quests is not gonna help on that front. game is so good though 10/10 something in the ways."
Positive,"You like FromSoftware?Their early work was a little too new wave for my tastes,but when Dark Souls came out in 2011, I think theyreally came into their own, commercially and artistically.The whole setting has dark but crisp atmosphere, anda new sheen of consummate professionalism that reallygives the game a big boost. Miyazaki has beencompared to Hideo Kojima, but I think Miyazaki hasa far more bitter, dark sense of humor.I think their undisputed masterpiece is Bloodborne.A game so thrilling most people probably don't even payattention to the story. But they should! Because it's notjust a tale of power hungry maniacs accidentallyunleashing a nightmare of Eldritch proportions upona doomed population, and the importance of humility inthe presence of forces beyond our understanding, it'salso a personal statement about Miyazaki himself!"
Positive,A Masterpiece from Fromsoftware. Elden Ring combines all best features and elements from all of the previous Soulsbourne games and delivered them into one single package. Just buy it. 10/10.
Positive,Shout Out To Bill Clinton For Making The GOTY
Positive,"The base game made me get good, the DLC made me get great10 out of 10"
Positive,Dark Souls but open world and slightly faster combat. The improved stealth system is pretty good and with the extra space you can approach a group of enemies in a different way. The only downside is there are no more 1v1 invasions but you get invaded during co-op
Positive,clapped the mans they couldnt handle the smoke cause they some pussys fr fr i aint maidenless cause i built diff
Positive,Top GameMany hours of fun. Didn't expect such a nice designed world. For RPG fans a must have
Positive,Ahh… Masterpieceone of the games ever made and i’ve played
Positive,I have bitches i swear !
Positive,"If you like Dark Souls and want to see how to do an open world game properly. Then just buy this dang game, it is beyond amazing in all senses of the word."
Positive,try fingersbut hole
Positive,"The second souls like game i ever played, and it was amazing, with how open world it was, bosses were hard as always, though some might been much easier than other, though the scenery and ost amazing as always, and in Elden Ring there are even more weapons and armor stuff (i think, im not sure), though magic is too op xd bosses are also amazing and different, the design is always just amazing ( I will maybe update this review when i have 100% on this game)."
Positive,"""I am Malenia, Blade of Miquella. I am Malenia, Blade of Miquella. I am Malenia, Blade of Miquella. I am Malenia, Blade of Miquella. I am Malenia, Blade of Miquella. I am Malenia, Blade of Miquella. I am Malenia, Blade of Miquella. I am Malenia...""10/10 would get waterfowl'd again"
Positive,"Probably the best open world environment i've played in. It never feels empty and there's almost always a secret behind every corner. The game-play is amazing like most Souls Borne games. Only complaint is PC optimisation, experiencing micro stutters and frame drops. But otherwise I highly recommend this game for all people."
Positive,"Absolutely in love with everything here! Hope this game takes Soulsborne games in a new direction! My favorite weapons so far are the Mace, Halberd, and the Lordsworn's Greatsword!"
Positive,"*Grace points to a direction""Okay I'll go anywhere but that direction"""
Positive,Finally a game that lives up to it's hype

Positive,"If you're a fan of Fromsoft games, or even just Co-op Medieval fantasy. This is the game for you. I have 50 hours in it currently and I haven't even scratched the surface. Incredibly well done huge handcrafted map with something interesting always around the corner. 10/10 The only issue I have is worrying about how are they going to top this in the future"
Positive,"Nothing better than traveling the Lands Between, fighting demons, goons, monsters, and being told by everyone that I've got zero maidens. George RRRRR Martin and Miyazaki have done it! They've made a game that's fun AND exponentially raises my blood pressure. 10/10 I swear to God, we're gonna get you some maidens bro.For my DLC People: Just explore. If youre mad its too hard, you are a) underleveled b) not looking for blessings c) not summoning d) bad at the game and refuse to do better (victim mentality)"
Positive,"Elden Ring sometimes makes me think of Scrooge McDuck because he is so wealthy and has an estate on Rainier, but he is really quite modest. This is what makes Elden Ring so surprising, as you engage the enemies of Elden Ring, you're engaging the enemies of yourself.Elden Ring does not send you into the world with any gear you need to succeed. Your character is empowered to defeat the bad guy because Elden Ring gives you a talent, a skill. By playing the game and learning these talents, you become more powerful.Even though Elden Ring is one of the best gifts that FromSoftware has ever given the PC world, I have heard that a lot of people are not going to accept it. They aren't going to believe that they can be the best or that the game will reflect the best in them.By doing research about RPGs, I found that the majority of people who make them have no clue what they are doing. They have no clue what they are doing with their life and they make these terrible games. I asked the men and women who were making Elden Ring if they believed that they could make a game that was better than the great games that they played. It was a resounding no. Most of them had never made a game before and they were just making this game on the side for fun and it was the only game that they could make. They had no clue what they were doing.We're human.Despite the fact that most of these men and women are not good at making games, they keep going because they are determined to make the best RPG in the world. They believe that it's not the direction of their characters that matters, it's the direction of the game. For them, it's about the experience of their characters and they want to give the player the best character experience they can.Elden Ring is only a small example of the things FromSoftware has given to the world of RPGs. We have seen some other great examples in the past and we will see more great examples in the future.FromSoftware was creating the high art of RPGs long before they were sure that they could do it. They are producing games that give people the experiences that they want. If you know that you want to play a game that is hard, punishing and filled with characters that you can empathize with, then play Elden Ring!"
Positive,hmhm yes DOG
Positive,The performance = unacceptable. The game = extraordinary. Wait for an update if you're smart.Buy and play this minute if you're a troglodyte.
Positive,The people who would give positive reviews are too busy playing the game.
Positive,"Try finger, but holestill Try finger, but hole"
Positive,"finally, I can finish my first ever Souls-like game:) still, there is a lot I need to learn about souls games:)"
Positive,This game has easily become one of my favorites of all time
Positive,Can wear octopus on the head and hug a woman. 10/10
Positive,Absolutely incredible game
Positive,"Elden ring is better than a 4.0 gpa , right?"
Positive,I wonder if Rannis breast milk is blue
Positive,"Oh, yes... Gamer, are we?Come to the Steam Store for the Elden Ring, hmm?Of course you have. No shame in it.Unfortunately for you, however, you are maidenless."
Positive,i suck at the game
Positive,"I have played this game as a duo with a friend, co-op'ing when needed/wanted and solo'ing while in chat at other times, fully exploring and enjoying regions as we go through and trying to explore every nook and crevice. At 256.8 hours (time of review) I have still not beaten the game and have the majority of 3 regions to still explore.There has been a lot of build testing, experimenting, pvping, and farming, but 90% of this time has been exploring and doing 100% (where we notice hidden doors and such) of each dungeon we do and just thoroughly enjoying our time doing so.We're not the best but we're not the worst either and most bosses except a few (looking at you Fire Giant....) have only taken about 2-3 tries and when there was the feeling of a hard wall preventing progress, looking at it from another point of view or strategy usually opened the way. In a PVE sense there is an answer for every build (usually involving bleed damage in some way) but it is possible at nearly all skill levels with the right tools.I'm making the review NOW before finishing the game because Dark Souls 3, the previous Souls-like that I played I beat the story of 6 times on one character before losing it to wiping my pc to restore it and losing my character file because it doesn't have cloud storage for character files (Elden Ring DOES) and losing interest in starting from nothing BUT the point being, I spent 250ish hours doing that in DS3. I have reached that point in Elden Ring and am still enjoying it, still exploring it, and there are roughly 6 DIFFERENT endings from what I've read/heard. There is so much content in this game that if you have the time/skill/patience/courage. You could definitely get ATLEAST 1 hour per dollar spent on this game for one playthrough (unless you rush through mind you).This game has some of the most beautiful scenery I have seen in a game in a good long while and the cut scenes are usually just as epic. When all is said and done, the game will not be for everyone but it is one of the best games I've played and will continue playing for a long LONG time.Will edit this review once completing the game my first time.EDIT: I have beaten the game and taken a bit of a break. My final notes on the ending? Mine was a bit lack luster, I had meant to do the Ranni ending but failed to notice her summon sign by the end option chooser and thus, decided to just pick the classic ending of becoming Elden Lord aaaaaand.....  It's me sitting in a chair while a narrator says ""It will be remembered as an age of fracture""...  That was kind of... Anti-climacticHowever I have seen some of the other endings and boy are they some fantastic cutscenes, so while I believe the vanilla core ending was bad, I think this is by design. You hear a friend say their  Ranni or Dung Eater or Fia   ending was phenomenal and you're like ""dude... That wasn't mine... I wanna see that..."" and so you play again, then once you have 2 of the 4-6 you're like ""well... I might as well go for broke and get those achievements!"" Thus getting you to play again, and again, keeping the game alive and forcing you to do another full completion which you can get some side quests you miss or kill some npcs to finish them early or kill all of the merchants and create a Walmart at the Roundtable Hold.All in all, it is a game you could sink countless hours into."
Positive,Very elden indeed.
Positive,This is my first fromsoftware game and I have to say I can't believe it's taken me this long to get into them. I'm having a ton of fun and yes the frame drops get annoying but I can't help but love the game.
Positive,"Yeah, it's pretty good, like, real good. Game of the year hands down. No way it's getting topped. Great combat, cool world, immersive story, a world that is as wide as an ocean and as deep as one, and everything else you could want from a fromsoft game times 10. A modern masterpiece. Literally couldn't be better besides the slight performance issues that are being fixed."
Positive,"UPDATEI decided to change my review to recommended.  I have been playing with the latest official and non official fixes for fps and ultrawide and find the game amazing. Its unfortunate i have to skip the multiplayer aspect for the game due to using the ultrawide fix, but once i looked at i at 21:9 could not go back, it really shines in 21:9 aspect ratio. I blends together elements from great games into the Souls saga. Still i wish it had more modern graphics (technically, art its amazing as always) and i hope developers put more care for their releases on the pc platform.ORIGINALI never buy a game pre release. I am big fan of souls series and have played them all.  With the success of the series has had on this platform (pc community begging for a Bloodborne port)  and the latest quality port releases such as God of war, Horizon Zero Dawn,  Days Gone. I would hope  the experience and mistakes FromSoftware  had with their previous games releases on pc, would make them put little more effort on Elden Ring. So i went ahead on bought it 2 days before release. What could go wrong?First thing I notice, the game does not support ultrawide resolutions, ok i  guess the ""niche"" excuse applies, even all major games now support 21:9 resolution (even some old, very old games) isn't 4k also niche?  i guess i will have to wait again for the holy modders to do their craft.. Then as soon as i start playing i realize graphics are not that impressive, its like i am continuing playing dark souls 3, (not talking about art style) the game does not look next gen. Well its fine, its not all about graphics, seems From Software its more about concept, art style, gameplay and not technical development. Still constant 60 fps its fine for me... until i head into the wild and i face the boss that is mounted in the horse, then frame drops and stuttering makes the fight impossible to enjoy. Then i have a stuttering, average looking game with black bars on the sides and all i can think is like i´m trying to emulate a game which i paid full price for.  What surprises me the most its all the positive reviews from media and youtubers, even some their opinion I respect. Were they are all playing on consoles, none of them had any issue whatsoever with the game? Just by chance i quit playing one minute before the 2 hour limit for refund.Now i have been left with this options:1.- Wait for a fix (which it may never be fully developed)2.- Refund and maybe try on ps53.- Use the one day fixes modders were able to make for fps and ultrawide that From Software is too lazy to work on before release but get BANNED because anticheat (which by now should be called anti-improve.)I really want to play this game but I´m so tired this developers getting comfy with the pc community doing their job. And all fanboys making excuses for the game performance. Maybe its the masterpiece everybody claims to be. But it´s just dismal pc release in my opinion."
Positive,Worst game ever made tbh
Positive,- No Ultra wide support.- FPS Caps on 60 (2022 btw).- Stuttering.but the game is still one the best games i have played lately.
Positive,"Arise, Ye Tarnished!PC Exceeds specs and have only crashed once in 18 hours.These reviews....Why is it always potato?"
Positive,fromsoft magnum opus. insanely fun. game of the year
Positive,"game of the year, thanks bill clinton"
Positive,"This game is so good that it literally made it so that every other game I play I constantly compare the quality of them to this one, then get discouraged cause it can't compare, then come back to this. It's a lifestyle maybe but I think if you haven't played this game or even heard of it are you really a gamer? Get it right now."
Positive,"Verily, in the realm of Elden Ring, one findeth a world most wondrous and perilous, where every step is fraught with challenge and each corner teems with secrets untold. Thee shall wander through landscapes most fair and treacherous—be it the misty forests, the forsaken castles, or the sun-kissed plains—all crafted with a beauty that doth steal the very breath from thy lungs. The paths are many and winding, yet ne’er doth it feel aimless, for the land is imbued with a sense of purpose and history, calling to the brave of heart to unravel its mysteries.Thee shall find no shortage of arms to wield nor foes to vanquish, from the humble blade to the arcane staff, each weapon bearing its own tale and power. Thee shall face beasts of might and terror, each more fearsome than the last, their forms a testament to the dark imagination of their creators. Yet, 'tis not mere strength that shall see thee through, but wisdom and skill, for the depth of combat is as profound as the lore that binds this world. Aye, the tale that unfolds is one of sorrow and grandeur, a story woven with care, drawing thee ever deeper into its embrace. In sooth, Elden Ring is a masterpiece that doth challenge the mind, quicken the pulse, and captivate the soul."
Positive,"Let me get the bad things out of the way. The game still has some of the weird and strange UI choices of prior games. The game still has shader compilation stutters and streaming stutters which From promised to fix since launch, but alas they still haven't so I would not hold my breath anymore. The good news, well, the good news is everything else.  The game is absolutely phenomenal. A Masterpiece in lore, world building and open world design. I was hooked since the day it was launched and today, I finally, confidentally, close the chapter of Elden Ring. Over 220 hours played, it was joyous, scary and triumphant. What a game, forget game of the year, this is my game of the decade. Chills having finished it, my life feels empty again now...Thank you From, now please fix the lingering issues and make it the perfect game it has every right to be."
Positive,"Elden Ring’s engrossing scope and excellent progression systems make it the most intricate FromSoftware RPG yet. And although it has quite a few repetitive moments, the game’s grandiose open world and electrifying spectacle usually make up for it."
Positive,"(THIS GAME DOES HAVE SOME FRAMERATE PROBLEMS BUT THEY WILL MOST LIKELY BE FIXED IN THE FUTURE BUT I THINK THE GAME IS STILL IN A PLAYABLE STATE WITH ME NEVER GETTING UNDER 30 FRAMES WHICH JUST REMINDS ME OF BLOODBORNE (I have GTX 1070, Ryzen 7 3700x and 32gb RAM and it's downloaded on an HDD)Elden RIng is the perfect successor to Dark Souls. The open-world element opens up for a lot of exploring and finding cool stuff. There are a BUNCH of bosses to fight, or you can choose to only kill the main bosses and proceed. You can choose the pace of the game. If a boss is too hard for you. You can return later and kill the boss then. It's most likely going to be very easy to kill if you've proceeded a bit in the game. Same as Dark Souls it has a wide variety from weapons you can use and play with. Every weapon in the game is dual-wield-able and you can create some very interesting weapon combos. Same as Dark Souls you do have different types of damage and different ""schools"" of magic. The combat of the game is very much like Dark Souls 3. A lot of the weapon animations are the same but they're more refined than they were in Dark Souls. The pace of the combat is just perfect and the addition to horseback combat opens a whole new way of fighting. I still think the game is very much playable and it's also incredibly fun."
Positive,"Outstanding game.To start a bit on the bad part, there were some performance and stability issues at launch but some, if not most of them got fixed with patches. And there was a bit of enemies assets reuse, but still there are a lot of unique enemies if you end up exploring it.Graphics. A lot better than on previous titles developed by From Software, and with a much more variety due to the map size.Map. By how the map works in-game you would think that the map is small at the beginning, but as soon as you found another location the map keeps on growing until you reach the end game and end up with a huge map. When you take in consideration that most of surface has also an underground area beneath, even more surprises awaits.Combat. A lot of different weapons, weapon arts, statuses, items, spells and prayers that can make a great variety of builds. The bad part is that the items with which you can reset your status points are limited in a given playthrough. And for PvE specifically there are also the spirit summons that can be a great help against bosses.Sound. Great overall sounds, but peaking on boss fights."

Positive,"Elden Ring is neither a step forward nor backward for the famed developer, but rather a shift to the side, a different kind of FromSoftware game that mixes stampeding mounted combat, endless discovery, excitement, and danger in a vast open world, but it’s not my favorite FromSoftware game to date.I'll admit, I'm a sucker for the ""main theme plays during the final confrontation"" trope and I got goosebumps there."

Positive,I got a hug. 10/10
Positive,"Another great From Software game, totally recommended if you like the previous games or just the action-rpg genre. As the time this review is being written (APR-2022) , the game has some technical problems (stuttering, invisible enemies, non-stable frame rate), and some connectivity issues while playing with other people."
Positive,"The game is amazing,The map design is incredible, you actually have to learn how to use a map, and don't get dragged on by hand by the game.There is so much to do, you'll get lost and it will be amazing. For example: you'll want to reach from point A to point B but, between these points you find some weapons, fights, a new quest, NPC dragons and who knows what more. Then you realise 5 hours already past and you didn't reach point B, but you had hell of a timeBoss fights are something else, really fun and challengingReally fun experience, if you like fromsoftware previous games, you probably going to like this one."
Positive,"Quick note about tech/launch issues before getting to the actually interesting stuff: I don't want to downplay the issues other people are having, but here's my experience fwiw: I'm playing on a machine that has a i7-6700K cpu and two 1080s, and my game runs very well, with only the occasional momentary slowdown as it loads any large new area. I haven't even had to lower any settings to get it to work, and I'm running it at 21:9 on an ultrawide. I know other people have had problems, and that sucks, but my six-year-old machine hasn't had any, so...idk. It might be hard to say whether someone will have problems or not. Now that that's out of the way:The game is incredible.Every few minutes I'm discovering something weird and intriguing, unexpected and new. I haven't felt this sense of mystified wonder whilst playing a game in a very long time. Miyazaki's habit of slowly drip-feeding you enticing but baffling pieces of lore is really at its best here, where the landscape is sprawling and varied, and there are handfuls of weird, unique encounters scattered across the map. The unique joys of discovering strange, inexplicable things are here in spades. I think the experience of roaming through mysterious places and trying to figure out where the things you've seen might fit into the handful of puzzle pieces of lore you've managed to scrounge up might be one of my favorite things in gaming.All of the old familiar things are here, and some things have been tweaked for quality of life. There are vastly more checkpoints -- not fires here, or lanterns, but 'sites of grace' -- and you can fast travel to all of them at any time from the map (!!!) you will uncover. If you find yourself bashing your head against a particularly difficult boss, you have more options now than you did in prior games; you can choose to come back later, setting off on a journey to explore, or tackle one of the countless other things you'll have effortlessly unearthed.I don't think it makes sense to go into granular details here about builds, equipment, etc. Just know that, if you love these games, Elden Ring is a refinement of all of the things you've loved about them. If you're like me, it's going to make you feel that same eerie, atmospheric sense of wonder and fascination that the first Dark Souls did -- maybe even more than the first Dark Souls did, and that's not a thing I say lightly.Don't let anyone spoil a single thing for you. Go in as blind as possible and let the game surprise you at every turn. It'll be worth it."
Positive,"the game is great, its fun, the environment is beautiful and diverse. the abundance of enemies is also great. the only 3 issues i have is the 60 fps lock.but it is what it is. But also after a while of playing my ps5 controller starts to have ""lag"" and will stay hard turning sometimes which requires a game restart. Then there is really no sense of direction, at least i have not been able to understand or put 2 and 2 together. i have just been finding the main story path by meandering about.for stutters, i had everything on maximum and turned to high and it got rid of stutters. VERY seldom does my frames drop below 55.msi ventus 3090 32 gigs of 4200 and 10900k. (i see people claiming to have similar setups complaining i find it hard to believe but whatever)but overall the game is great, starting out is a little rough for leveling because you dont get a lot from killing normal mobs. im at the main city as a astrologist and im only level 54. so i am very underwhelming to certain points. Some stuff i murder, other stuff murders me (go figure right?) I like the spells, they have added new ideas and its great, again i love the game, guess im just a fanboybut the aesthetic is beautiful, its a souls game and i know its a souls game. i got over 7k hours assorted through all souls games and i still get my stuff pushed in and i love it because its addictive.im confused why people would think this would be something completely new and fresh. they took everything that worked from prior games and added to it. crafting is really dull if youre a caster, unless i havent really found anything useful yet. but i recommend the game, this game is getting hate for all the wrong reasons. if you have legit complaints, understandable but people on here giving bad reviews. 90% of them would complain about their ice cream getting cold.there are issues with the game, but nothing game breaking. i have over 24 hours streamed on my twitch of content,deaths, game play, and never had anything crazy like some people are claiming. either im really lucky or these are some rage reviews because they are dying.if you are under 5 hours played and youre complaining,you havent even really started playing yet. i have 3 pcs and all run just fine, i think people had 1 or 2 stutters during a boss fight, died and rage reviewed the game LOL. update your drivers. i cant imagine my pcs are special to where they have no issues compared to others. since the little aptches here and there i dont think i have even noticed anymore stutters with everything maxed on 1440. the only issue i had was yesterday my controller was having serious input lag during their scheduled maintenance and havent had an issue today.Buy it, you want to, youll love it, most do. its great, fun, souls, we waited forever, dont lie to yourself, buy it. once you get the game add me, and we will OWN THESE BOSSES!!!"
Positive,"after shadow of the erdtree this game feels completed.i didn't really like the base game but everything is so tied together by this dlc and its AMAZING, every boss is amazingly fun and the areas are top tier. some of the best fromsoft has ever done."
Positive,this one has a jump button in it
Positive,"TL;DRTasty Souls-borne soup stretched by adding a huge open world hub.Gameplay is every bit as good as a Souls' fan would expect: the combat animations and the platforming sequences are all going to feel very familiar. The difficulty is uneven and deeply dependent upon the character's build; some sections of the game (namely, bosses) can become downright excruciating if you have the wrong build or don't want to break role play and adopt unorthodox strategies: it's not a matter of skill, it's a matter of balance. Some traditional builds (pure STR, pure DEX or quality) are basically no longer as viable as hybrid builds, and you might even respec multiple times in order to face a specific boss. All of these factors negatively affect replay value, which, despite the huge amount of content you get in this game, is always something to look for in a Souls-borne entry.Exploration isn't generally very rewarding in terms of loot and runes (read: souls) and it's basically riding towards the next site of grace (read:  bonfire). Although very atmospheric, the huge world hub is functionally detrimental to FromSoft's distinctive level design with interconnective structural segments; also the fact that several rooms and bosses throughout the world are reused detracts from the overall experience.Lore and atmosphere is arguably the aspect where Elden Ring outshines previous entries in the Souls-borne franchise, and the bleak atmosphere and cryptic narrative do not differ from previous titles; several optional side quest lines that may or may not affect one of the game endings.The dark medieval art style isn't ultra-realistic, but beautiful and highly detailed.The orchestral soundtrack is remarkable and fits the game world and is also really well cued.Performance isn't optimal. EAC (Easy Anti Cheat) significantly reduces performance and prevents you from using third party tools or mods in online games. There are useful tools and mods that unlock the frame rate, fix the frame time and disable chromatic aberration and vignette effects, so basically the game looks and performs best while EAC is disabled: here's why you won't find anything about multiplayer in this review.As of November 2022, there's no RT nor DLSS/FSR.To my taste, this new recipe of the Souls-borne soup is palatable, but the open world hub makes it a bit watery; not every spice is complementary and can only really be enjoyed alone with a specific set of spoons."
Positive,Penultimate Miyazaki experience
Positive,big dark souls :>

Positive,"Anyone who gives elden ring a negative review cuz their pc cant run it is an idiot, it's a masterpiece and beautiful outlier in the souls franchise and runs fine for a 2022 game. It's not optimized perfectly but if you have a modern PC you'll have no issues holding more than 50 fps. Sorry that your 2015 Lenovo ThinkPad can't run it but that's not a problem that justifies a negative review."
Positive,amazing game. Wife left me but it was worth it
Positive,oh yar. I like this game
Positive,really good game
Positive,It's Big Poggers
Positive,eat shit and die simulator
Positive,"Elden ring its a very good Souls like game i really love it the graphics is just beyond gorgeous and the bosses are very amazing, im looking for more DLC's and more, +forward improvements with the new weapons and more armor and Story Lore"
Positive,Just buy it. Its a damn masterpiece. Almost every complaint (Besides godskin duo or Twin gargoyles) is just them being bad at the game. I not only have this game here. But on my xbox. Thats roughly 800 hours of playtime on this amazing game. Please if you have 60$ to spare. Use it on this game
Positive,"So I have tried to get into souls games multiple times. Demons Souls PS3, Dark Souls, and Sekiro. I've never enjoyed them in any way. Elden Ring changed that almost immediately upon getting to the open world. I hope you'll give this ridiculously fantastic game a shot even if you aren't a fan of souls games."
Positive,KILL KILL KILL KILL THERE ARE BUGS IN YOUR SKIN KILL KILL KILL KILL
Positive,one of the best games i've ever played
Positive,"Buy it if you want to, it's your money."
Positive,"Lots of reused bosses/areas/assets, first boss is unnecessarily harsh on beginners to the series and really bad PVP/invasion system but otherwise an excellent game that rejuvenated my love for modern games again"
Positive,i have maidens as you can clearly tell
Positive,Try tongue but hole
Positive,drink irl and kill people on a horse in-game it's fun
Positive,"very good game very very hard please dont use guide, game is very fun to explore for yourself9.5/10 would recommend"

Positive,"First Souls game, loved it. Some technical problems but far and few between."
Positive,"The game itself is awesome, but PLEASE DEVS: WE NEED ULTRAWIDE SUPPORT!!!!!!111"
Positive,this game helped me remember what it's like to be happy
Positive,"This is as big a mechanical and technological leap over Dark Souls 3 as Demon's Souls was over Shadow Tower: Abyss on the PS2. Absolutely staggering. Prettiest open world I've seen to date. Very, very dense, tons and tons of enemy variety, SO many bosses. I played it 10 hours straight two days in a row, and I just finished a 4-hour session on day 3. I only have 3 out of 42 achievements, even though I've beaten like ten bosses that were all quite different, none felt like repeats/reskins of the others.I haven't beaten Elden Ring yet, but oh my gosh, it's so good. I can't recommend it highly enough, best game I've played since Doom Eternal hit in 2020. I don't like most open-world games, but this is more like Breath of the Wild instead of Ubisoft titles like Assassin's Creed or Far Cry. Might be From Software's best game yet, but I'm reserving judgement until I beat it; I'm quite partial to Demon's Souls PS3. It feels like From is trying to make the best game ever made, they're quite ambitious but it feels like they may've actually delivered.As for performance issues, they're very real but I've gotten used to them, kinda like the framerate drops of Souls games on PS3. Really hoping they issue a patch to improve performance, but expect to potentially run into big framerate drops. I'm rocking a 6800 XT, a 5900X and 32GB of RAM, and the game periodically dips to 22FPS at 1440p max settings, similar 22FPS-dip issue at high but not as often. Game's limited to a maximum of 60FPS and I've heard it doesn't support ultrawide. Runs at like 30-40FPS on the Steam Deck without messing too much with settings, solid 60FPS seems likely with FSR. A friend who uses Linux didn't experience any performance issues at all.Edit: I have the game installed on a speedy PCIE 4.0 NVME drive. They released a small patch on day three, and the framerate dips are significantly less common but they still occur. I'm pretty sure we'll get more patches like this soon, should be smooth as heck in no time."
Positive,i named the horse bumbus.
Positive,Elven ring is one of the best platformers
Positive,"BUEN JUEGO. QUE ME CHUPEN LA PIJA. SI NO PODES JUGAR A 2 FPS JODETE SEGURO SOS UN YANKEE CHETO DE MIERDAUpdate seria: Al estar a un NG+ de conseguir todos los logros puedo decir que este juego es la mejor manera de meterse al mundo de los souls. Existen herramientas en el juego las cuales hacen su dificultad mas amena, esto hace que jugadores nuevos y los cuales no sean muy avanzados con las mecánicas de los souls puedan disfrutar del juego a la dificultad que deseen. Como tambien jugadores veteranos pueden limitarse a usar estas cosas (las cuales sin una guía no son fáciles de encontrar o son cosas obvias como summons) para enfretarse a un reto.Si no es un 10/10, pega en el paloupdate 2: Ya conseguí todos los logros pero quedan tantas cosas mas que no hice y questlines que no termine ni empecé que no puedo dejar de jugarlo aunque este al 100% aiofbaoeuibfuoiaoIBIOGFB"
Positive,"Everything I could have ever wanted, and more. In a stagnating AAA industry of copy paste third person action adventure open world games, Elden Ring is simply built different. Most notably with its revolutionary open world design philosophy of actually having interesting stuff in it, as opposed to a massive yet effectively empty space, with the same content spanning the entire map. Granted, now that iv'e had more time with the game I am willing to critique it. I enjoy the small dungeons throughout the map but the bosses did begin to repeat a fair bit more then id like, and dungeon rewards can be useless depending on the build ya run. I also began to notice that most enemys one or two shot ya later on, which was a bit wacky, and despite the massive amount of weapons you can only really effectively use a select few due to the upgrade system. Still these complaints are r e l a t i v e l y  minor."
Positive,"wow... miyazaki-san has outdone himself once again, i don't know how this man keeps doing this.... if only I could be so grossly incandescent."
Positive,10/10 Would try finger but hole again.
Positive,buy it now
Positive,Can play as Guts
Positive,i think my friend Harrison should play this gamehe'd really like it
Positive,"A true Masterpiece from Hidetaka Miyazaki and George RR Martin. Even after 100% I still want more.FromSoftware took everything from their past games to the next level * Amazing Lore* Amazing OST* Amazing Open world* More Weapons, Armors, talismans,sorceries and incantations* More challenging than their past games- Game Is running smooth, but there are some stutters, but not a game breaking.Thanks For this Masterpiece FromSoftware, why you still reading reviews ? Go buy the game."
Positive,"7.5/10(In the second week after game's release)9.5/10 (After 300H playthrough)A must buy masterpiece for souls fans. A huge fantasy open world with massive contents.After few months updates, Elden Ring is overall well polished. Many issues we got during the game's early release period like performance, stability, balance problems and glitches are improved(Those are reasons why I was so angry and gave 7.5). Some unfinished NPC storylines are also fixed. Why -0.5: MOUNTAINTOPS OF THE GIANTS and FORBIDDEN LANDS seem to be rushed contents and are so unbalanced. There're so many reskin enemies with overly powerful stats. The enemies are stacked too unfairly which reminds me my terrible experience in Dark Souls 2. PvP glitches are annoying. Multiplayer experience is still unstable due to FromSoftware's bad multiplayer framework codes from Dark Souls series and servers. FEEL FREE TO GO OFF AND DIE IN A DITCH SOMEWHERE"
Positive,"The jittery framerate negative reviews feel so ""her elbows are too pointy"" compared to how incredible the game is.  I'm playing on a 4.5 video card that I bought for $300, at 2560 x 1600 on high while I do bullshit on my other screen.  You'll be fine with your GTX 61,000,070 or whatever kids are getting bilked on buying from crypto miners.  Just buy this fucking thing, they'll fix the optimization.It's really a masterpiece that draws from 15 years of Souls game development.  I don't like open world games, I quit Breath of the Wild after maybe 60 hours getting bored. I was the most skeptical person when it came to moving the game away from ""castlevania your way up and down the evil spire."" And I've already put in 2/3 of that in Elden Souls just in the first few areas.  The horseback stuff is fun, the bosses are awesome.  I didn't pre-order, I was ready to refund it like so many AAA games.  And I'm ready to buy the season's pass."

Positive,"I have played Elden Ring (ER) for 1k hours so I feel like I have a pretty strong idea of what Im talking about now when I describe ER as a ""big sloppy cheese burger.""ER is fun, but messy. Much like a big sloppy cheeseburger it is pure indulgence, but needs cleaning up.ER's map is gigantic. It's a game that makes you go ""good lord there is still more???"" Some would say the map is too big. There is a lot repeat dungeons/bosses that feel like they could've been cut from the game for a more concise experience.ER's combat is pure spectacle. The best way to have fun in this game is get really overpowered and blast your opponents into specks of dust. If Dark Souls 1-3 was about Dodge roll + R1, ER is about Dodge Roll + L2 (Ash of War special attack). Many encounters can be overcome by simply overwhelming your opponent with pure force before they can start fighting back.ER has pushed the dodge roll to it's peak. You have bosses throwing planet destroying lasers and 100 hit combo attacks, and still the player's primary defensive tool to fight back is ...tuck and roll. It's just getting silly looking now. Sekiro has shown that FROM's combat can be so much more than this.ER is a game that gives and gives, to a point of feeling over-bloated with content, much of it feeling over-stuffed and spilling on the floor. Despite everything I just said, I still love it. ER is FROM's most experimental and excessive game in their roster yet. Sometimes you just wanna eat a big sloppy cheeseburger.ER is a game that is overly indulgent, messy and probably gives you heart disease, but I wouldn't have it any other way.May the next FROM game be a more refined experience, but Im glad this game exists. Im gonna play it for another 1k hrs now."
Positive,this game is epic
Positive,this is one of the games ever made
Positive,"Does a lot right, also does a lot wrong.is much better with friends and the wonderful multiplayer mod"
Positive,best game of all time
Positive,not as good as skyrim but it's alright for what it is
Positive,simply one of the best games of the decade.
Positive,Finally Elden Ring
Positive,"It definitely does start to get a little lame towards the end, but doesn't everything? Still lovely enough."
Positive,this is miyazaki's magnum opus because it has both multiple poison swamps and multiple characters with bare feet10/10 millicent is best girl
Positive,"Really great game, but the PC port woes really sullies an otherwise great package. Even after a bunch of updates, the game still has a 60FPS lock, questionable optimization, keyboard and mouse controls needing to be tweaked (Also with secondary bindings and shortcuts), lack of framegen support, no PlayStation button prompts option, no support for arbitrary aspect ratios (ultrawide, 16:10, etc) even if the game technically already supports it properly and just puts black bar UI elements over what it wants to hide.If you're fine playing offline or with Seamless Co-op[www.nexusmods.com] (Because the game's built-in co-op system is quite flawed), just use er-patcher[github.com] and PureDark's Elden Ring Upscaler mod for FSR 3/DLSS 3 Frame Generation[www.patreon.com]. With that, I went from like 70-80FPS with the game at 3440x1440 high settings on a 6900XT and i5-13600K to going about 140-170FPS, On the Steam Deck, with the framegen mod, it gets pretty close to locking to 50-60FPS. ER-Patcher also doesn't require anything constantly running in the background (like Flawless Widescreen for example), while also handling skipping the EAC launcher and setting up Seamless Co-op for you (If you use that).As for stuff that technically modifies game assets and how the game controls, I would recommend these mods:ModEngine2[github.com]Fix The Camera[www.nexusmods.com]PS5/PS4 Controller UI (Requires ModEngine2)[www.nexusmods.com]Regarding the game, I don't feel like I would say anything that hasn't already been said about it, but I figured I'd highlight some mods that help improve the game while still (mostly, outside of Seamless Co-op) retaining the game's original creative vision."
Positive,try fingersbut hole
Positive,"I think some developers might take the wrong lessons from Elden Ring. They'll think ""We have to make our games hard too"" but what they really ought to do is give a double jump to their horses."
Positive,killed margrit thatcher whom guards the bridge to the castle
Positive,Game is fantastic. Stuttering in places but this is a bug related to directx12 and not a performance issue. While annoying it doesn't negate the rest of the game. I would heavily recommend.
Positive,finally beat the first boss

Positive,"Pretty fun if you aren't afraid of dying in a video game. For me and a lot of my friends, the game was running on 60 fps smoothly all the time (even with an almost minimum system requirements PC) until one or two sudden lag spikes appear (around every 1-10 minutes depending on which area in the game you are in at the moment and wether or not you are fighting a boss) and that was the only part of the game that pissed me off. It's a little frustrating to die for a reason like that in a game where dying means as much as it does in Elden Ring. If you know how to fix it, please let me know.As for the story/lore, it's subtle but it is definitely there. You just need to look for it.If you find yourself not knowing what to do or overwhelmed by how much there is to do, just do anything. You can't go wrong, I promise you will have fun if you aren't too conditioned from games that only allow you to progress through quests etc.Although it has issues, IMO it's worth a chance. You will enjoy it if you don't expect to play Kratos in God Of War 3. I had a blast playing this game and I'm someone who quit DS3 after dying to Dancer about 90 times. Definitely not perfect but still the best game I've played in a very long time."
Positive,"Update2:I surrender, when I'm not playing I want to be playing....enough said, time to die :)Update:Have played and enjoyed the game some more, not too bothered by issues listed below after tweaking settings + setting up gaming mouse for most multi-button actions (use pouch items, hard attack, use skill, mount horse). Menu navigation still sucks, but it's functional.Comments below are still valid, I've just out-nerded the issues for now. But sincerely, From Software, plz fix your otherwise wonderful mf game for regular PC users.Leaving review as 'not recommended' until at least PC performance is improved. Ideally, some UI improvements (better customization of keybinds, menu navigation) are also included in future patches.Previous review:Beautiful game, super hard as expexted - however, super clumsy default mouse+keyboard keybindings, have to be worked around with mousebindings (if possible), plus odd and slow menu navigation. Performance on PC can be improved with various settings, but the game still stutters and has low fps at times on a new rtx3070 gaming rig.In total, this game shipped without concern for PC ui or performance. At this price point, that's just shitty business practice."
Positive,"The culmination of one studio's quest to perfect a genre. Elden Ring brings an open world to the soulsborne franchise. It works sometimes and breaks the progression in other times. I completely ruined some encounters for myself by tackling Caelid's content very early on in my playthrough, which sucked. On the other hand, the freedom to find a high level area and painstakingly progress there, finding your comfort zone, fleshing out your build, was an experience I will never forget... and rivaled the best moments Dark Souls 1, 2 and Bloodborne gave me. Elden Ring is the best of From's games and yet it must be mentioned that it makes some of the franchise's elements worse.. it's definitely a game I will not be able to keep coming back to, I do not look forward to the prospects of grinding out the open world again. Whereas, I've completely Dark Souls 3 an uncountable amount of times. But I am so excited for the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion that I forget the last time I counted the days to a game's release. So there's that.I am conflicted about this game, it's one of highs and lows. Elden Ring is definitely Fromsoftware's best made game, and maybe even the best designed game to date, even though I think some aspects that made their previous game's great, were lost along the way. You simply cannot find an action RPG set in such a atmospheric world that is this well made and has design so cohesive. Every cornerstone, every design decision serves to further its central vision. A vision of ruin, decay, and a Tarnished that's given the freedom to choose how to reshape this stagnating world if they grow powerful enough to do so. An action RPG classic."
Positive,almost as good as the witcher 3

Positive,"EDIT - POST REVIEW @ 94 Hours of gametime.As of 94 hours into the game, i finally finished the game, this included ALOT of side content.Its really scary how addictive and fun this game is. I really would reccomend any new and old souls enjoyer to try this game for sure, its both enjoyable for new and old players as you can kindof control the difficulty as how much side content you do and such.

I personally only experienced it at my first hour at the game once or twice at the Tree Sentinel.Gr8!!!"
Positive,"The Good  Incredible world to explore. The open world is chock FULL of secrets and interesting locations. I genuinely couldn't believe how big this game was. When the map expanded for the 3rd or 4th time, I was genuinely in awe. Riveting fights and bosses, as well as a great variety of them. For the most part. incredible amount of things to do. This game took me 120 hours to fully complete my first playthrough. Every time I thought I was done, that I had everything, I found another dungeon or tower with more loot. The game's art direction is incredible and the game is absolutely beautiful to look at. Lots of varied areas with beautiful color palates and design choices. Although, some textures are GARISHLY shitty and low-res. However, this does not occur often. It's more good Souls content. While this is also partially a downside, those of you who are looking for more of the same will be very satisfied with Elden Ring alongside it's improvements. The Bad  Inexcusable PC performance and archaic options. The game stutters like hell and runs suprisingly poorly for having a mandatory 60fps lock, even though modders have cracked it and proven the game does not encounter any issues at higher refresh rates. Additionally, there is no ultrawide support, in a 2022 title. Just like the FPS lock, Ultrawide ""WORKS"" as some users report the game functiong in 21:9 or higher for a few seconds when they boot the game up, but black bars are then OVERLAYED on top for no practical reason. Modders have gotten Ultrawide to work, but to do so you must disable Easy Anti-Cheat and are forced into offline mode. If modders can do it in a day or two, I'm sure the professional dev team can figure it out. You can't even choose which damn monitor the game runs on. At the time of this review, a VERY questionable balance in the game. Every boss has every possible move and way to punish you, which feels incredibly cheesy and takes away from their uniqueness. Bosses hit INCREDIBLY hard, and even at ~40 vig with heavy armor you can get two or three shot by bosses in their 9-hit chains. Bosses can rotate 90 degrees in midair to hit you with their attacks. I cannot imagine what higher NG+'s are like. For being a new IP, FromSoft didn't necessarily try THAT much new with this title. It's basically Dark Souls 4, but you can jump and you have a horse. There is a lot of recycled content, animations, sounds, etc. from the Souls series. While you'd expect this for a sequel in the franchise, Elden Ring is a  New IP  and frankly I expected better. Do NOT buy this game expecting a genuinely different gameplay experience like Sekiro. It is not. EAC (Easy Anti-Cheat) cannot be turned off. While this is good for helping PVP with cheat engine cheaters, that's about it. This game will not have any sort of a modding scene like previous Souls games ala The Convergence for DS3.While Elden Ring is another great foray into the Souls series with plenty of bosses to fight, cool loot to find, and locations to explore, FromSoft are technological dinosaurs and the engine's age is starting to show. The myriad of issues this game faces technologically, including those that will likely never get fixed due to laziness, show that FromSoft doesn't really care that much about their PC audience despite it being one of their largest. (I was genuinely SHOCKED to see an actual Borderless option in ER, only a decade and some behind everyone else guys!) They are content with pushing out another broken PC port, as long as it gets them that cheddar. Can always fix it later, I guess.Despite these downsides, I would still reccomend Elden Ring if you enjoyed previous Souls games or, hell, even if you didn't. This is the best-selling Soulslike of all time and has brought a lot of newcomers to the franchise as a result. I've seen a lot of ""I didn't like Dark Souls, but I like Elden Ring"" comments lately.However, do NOT buy Elden Ring if you have an Ultrawide monitor or if you are expecting it to be a genuinely different experience due to the new IP, you will be disappointed."

Positive,"I've got stuttering issues with an RTX3070-Laptop and I can still recommend this game through and through.The atmosphere they create is unmatched as its just one of those games that makes you want to sit down and just take in the environment for a little while.Sorry University work... you're gonna have to take one for the team this week.*Don't be discouraged by the first boss fight as a lower levelled player, just take a few steps back (teleport to the start) and have an adventure in a different direction, level up naturally, and go back when you feel like it (~level 20 is a good point if you're new). From there, you'll understand what this games all about. I'm only saying this as it seems a lot of people are expecting a linear progression when in reality to enjoy the game how it was made to be played you must go off path. Its why its called 'Elden Ring', not 'Dark Souls 4'... Its a new style of gameplay some will come to hate, but many will adore - just like myself. p.s. if you loved Witcher 3 just like me, go ahead and buy it already. Cannot recommend it enough."
Positive,"Dive into the enchanting world of Elden Ring, where every step is a journey and every battle is an epic saga. FromSoftware's masterful blend of intricate lore, breathtaking landscapes, and challenging gameplay creates an unparalleled gaming experience. Unleash your inner adventurer as you explore the vast open world, confront colossal foes, and uncover the mysteries that lie within the shattered realms. Elden Ring is a magnum opus that seamlessly weaves together stunning visuals, gripping storytelling, and exhilarating combat, solidifying its place as a must-play title for fans of action RPGs. Brace yourself for a gaming odyssey that transcends boundaries and sets a new standard for the genre."""

Positive,"I was among the many who signed the petition to port the first Dark Souls to the PC platform. I can't imagine all the good gaming memories without games from FromSoftware. Sincere thanks to master Miyazaki, the entire team at FromSoftware and Namco Bandai Games for all the past and future titles we will get on the PC platform.""I do feel apologetic toward anyone who feels there's just too much to overcome in my games... I just want as many players as possible to experience the joy that comes from overcoming hardship.""- Hidetaka Miyazaki"

Positive,"The hardware requirements have been out for two years, shut the fuck up about performance. It runs fine on a decent rig, yes the frames drop ever so slightly in certain areas but other than that, it's usually a steady framerate. Stop down-voting because your 1050ti couldn't run the game."
Positive,"Short answer: In 35 years of gaming, easily the best game I have ever played and quite possibly will ever play. One of those games that keeps you thinking about it when you're not playing and planning your next approaches to it the next time you turn it back on. If you haven't already check out VaatiVidya YouTube channel to get a more detailed understanding of the story behind the game as it is not so easy to understand just playing through the game and gives another layer of depth to the already deep game. Not sure it is really healthy to love this game so much. Expect to loose all your free time, social life and sleep as a detailed run is easily more than 100 hours. Try to go into the game as  blind as possible without too many spoilers. If you are finding it difficult there are so many ways to make it easier for you either by having random strangers or NPC's join to help you or researching particular bosses to find gaps in their armour. Hopefully other developers take note of its success and we see similar games come out in the near future. THANKS FROMSOFT!"

Positive,"Alright, lets talk about Elden Ring and about the things I liked and the things I didn't like.I have played almost all other souls games before (DS1,DS2,DS3,BB,Sekiro) for hundreds of hours, so I can confidently say I know how to play these games (not a game journalist lmao).In short, I can say Elden Ring is a near perfect game with some flaws, and I thoroughly enjoyed my time playing it. But like every game, there are also problems in the game. So let's talk about the bad things first:- Enemy-Recycling: This is one of my biggest problems with the game. While there are amazing bosses in the game, there are also many trash bosses. You often see normal mobs that you encountered before in the world reappear as a boss - nearly the same move-set but with a boss-HP bar. From other souls games, bosses for the most part were exciting and every boss encounter was exciting. I think Elden Ring would have been better if there would only be ~20 boss fights in total in the entire game, and all of them with challenging very different bosses, instead of the 83(?) bosses that are in the game right now, where a lot of them are just junk. Many of these recycled bosses in Elden Ring were more of an annoyance than anything else. Especially when they are not only recycled but also repeated in pairs, which bring me to my next point ...- Gank Fights: All other souls games had gank fights, and I personally have usually never been a fan of them. The same applies in Elden Ring. There are many gank fights that are simply copy and paste for the sake of more content, and they have significantly lower quality, and it shows. Gank fights can work sometimes if their move-sets and abilities complement each other nicely (e.g. Ornstein and Smough from DS1). But just repeating the same mobs is just annoying. It does show that Fromsoft went with quantity over quality here sometimes, which is a shame.- Dungeons: A great idea, but not executed that well. They should be interesting to explore with great treasure at the end, or a boss fight. However, many of them either have a trash boss at the end, that we have seen multiple times by now, or the dungeons are super similar to each other. I feel like not every dungeon needed a boss - sometimes a treasure would have been enough. Also maybe some different puzzles would be nice, since essentially they mostly all have the same traps etc.- Artificial Difficulty Scaling: That is a really big problem of the game. Souls games have always been difficult, especially the boss fights. And thats good. However, in Elden Ring, the difficulty scaling seems off. Some bosses are just difficult because almost every attack from them 1-shots or 2-shots. (Radhan is a good example here, but the same applies to many bosses). Just increasing damage and HP pools is a lame way of making things difficult. I would prefer fast and advanced move-sets from enemies, instead of having them one shot the player all the time. That being said, the game does have these challenging and fair bosses - but not always. Even the damage from normal mobs in later areas seems absurd. Which leads to the next problem:- Equipment Balancing: Most of the time, armor makes very little difference in fights, because you still get 2-shot most of the time, either way. I would prefer it if armor would be more effective, and the player has to switch armour throughout the game, depending of what type of enemies he has to deal with. - Build Balancing: Magic is not balanced properly. If you play as a sorcerer, the starter spell (Glintstone Pebble) is the best for a long time. New spells that you get aren't very good, so you are basically stuck for a long time with the starter spell. And the spells that are actually decent have very high stat requirements so that you can only use them much much further in the game. Bleed builds are totally busted in this game and need to be nerfed.- Technical Problems: The game is still buggy, and people who disagree with that, aren't being honest. The game stutters badly in certain areas (Although that has been improved a bit already since the latest patch). Sometimes, the game freezes and then crashes randomly, which is really annoying. The servers seem unstable/overloaded, - when trying coop, often the connection was lost randomly. The horse summoning is very very buggy. Sometimes you whistle to call for the horse and nothing happens, this is EXTREMLY frustrating when you are in combat, and you rely on the horse appearing to reposition or dodge an attack. In certain cases it took over 10 whistles till the horse appeared.Now lets talk about the good things:- World: The world is very very fun to explore and looks gorgeous, its also fairly large - I would say its probably one of the best open world game worlds I have ever seen. This makes the game immersive and also super enjoyable to explore. Especially the legacy dungeons are outstanding. Stormveil Castle, Haligtree, Lyndell and Crumbling Farum Azula have some of the best level design I have ever seen in a game. They are very intricate, look stunning and are extremely enjoyable to explore.- Bosses: While Elden Ring has a lot of trash bosses, it also has some of the best boss fights Fromsoft has ever made. Examples are: Godrick, Margott, Godwyn, Maliketh, Astel Naturalborn of the Void, Radagon, Malenia and some others. They are not only challenging, but also have amazing music, great arenas, good movesets, superb visuals etc. - Quest-lines: The quest lines in Elden Ring are really good, especially Ranni questline is excellent. In general, the entire story of the game is very captivating.- Variety: The variety of weapons and armor seems good in Elden Ring. (Thats smth that was lacking a bit in Bloodborne)- Crafting: I really like the idea of crafting, I think its well executed and it encourages exploring the map more. Its not bothersome by any means.So, in short: The good: Amazing world, some amazing bosses, a good story lots of QoL improvements over other souls games.The bad: Bugs, especially with the horse, lots of trash bosses due to recycling, magic unbalanced, armor unbalanced, broken difficulty scaling, dungeons are kinda lame.Overall: 9/10, probably the best Fromsoft game I have ever played, and I can definitely recommend this game!"

Positive,"Game is super easy, very relaxing to play. Would suggest if you're into meditation and calming activities."
Positive,"I was worried, but after reading into the reviews I realized something I simply forgot about our PC community. Its filled with toxic snobs who will invest upwards of $5,000 in a rig and buy into 8k chungus ultrafart 500 hz monitors to experience a game that wouldnt really work like that to begin with.EVERY fromsoft game to DATE has been capped at 60 FPS and has never really supported anything too crazy like ultrawide and 4k, its a souls-like, its frame based to begin with. Wait for mods if you wanna have your snobby placebos and wastes of cash to work.I dont care if you have a 3090 and youre experiencing microstutters, its easy to fix, go to settings and turn off motion blur and depth of field, grass and volumetric settings. And as for keyboard and mouse support? This game is a very raw console game period. Runs fantastic and looks beautiful on PC DO NOT get me wrong but, the game is really supposed to be best played with a controller... So DO NOT come at me saying how badly you want decent K+M support.Sekiro was a GOTY and suffered from the same 'problems' at launch... These issues are so first world and so absurd... Thanks for reminding me how snobby and toxic this chunglord, reddit, grease filled, basement dwelling community is... if you're mad about something, be mad about how EPIC is causing an exclusivity crisis in PC gaming, that's something you should really be crying about.THIS GAME DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE REVIEW BOMBED ON STEAM.

Positive,"What is Elden Ring ?After taking years to get into Dark Souls 1 and loving it, skipping Dark Souls 2 cuz it sux and then playing 3 and it becoming one of my favorite games of all time, of course I was hyped for Elden Ring, took me some time to finally get it here on steam due to external circumstances and playing for 100+ hours, now I can lay my thoughts below, i'll be brief.While I still think DS3 is the best souls from has ever made (never played BB, pc port when ?), maybe because I'm kind of tired of open world games and I also prefer more linear, direct games, I overall felt like DS3 offered a perfect balance of difficult, fairness and epic setpieces especially with its bosses and overall soundtrack followed by the great worldbuilding and atmosphere that it had, which was also backed by the previous games, ER is a new game, therefore its laying a new groundwork, its not part of a trilogy, which mean some comparisons wouldn't be fair but man even tho I still think DS3 is my favorite, ER comes close second due to how good it is, its open world design is one of the best the genre has ever got and despite not being a fan of the genre I tried to explore every corner due to how beautiful the world of the Lands Between was.In terms of soundtrack this one is great but I think from has done better in the past, worldbuilding and lore are all amazing here as well, altho I prefer the one in DS better, I feel like this one has more memorable characters, they play huge roles in the story as a whole which means they were better used than anything in past games, combat wise, controls and everything are all improved here and we now get a jump button which is very addicting to use, but not everything is perfect, FROM had the perfect idea that in order to make ER harder after players mastered DS3/Sekiro, was to level up the ammount of bullshit a player has to deal with minor enemies and bosses, I don't think I can say to anyone with a straight face that ER is a fair game difficult wise and while you have multiple tools to deal with the difficult especially with the ash of war ""pet"" system, all of them feel like duct-taped additions that kinda feels off to use, compared to dark souls which left me a huge sense of satisfaction when I defeated a boss that was kicking me, here I don't feel the same because the bosses felt very unfair and whenever I used an ash of war, I felt like I was cheating even tho I wasn't, the game recommended me to use it, so I feel it doesnt balance all of its systems and difficult properly, FROM has done better in this department in the past, plus with the size of the game, the huge open world and scope, dealing with something like this for so long will definitely make you go crazy, it just feels too much, so ER is the type of game which Ill classify as a difficult one to replay because its a game that induces fatigue and feel draining to play.Despite the points above, there isnt much I can saw about the negatives of the game, because there isn't many, the game is simply that good, theres a reason it won game of the year when it released, despite the unbalanced bs the combat has in a few areas and I guess the unnecessarily convoluted multiplayer mode which is something they definitely should change in the next game, the  game simply offers so many qualities of a masterpiece of a game, the world you explore is beautiful with jaw-dropping level design, graphics are amazing with an artstyle that puts many other games to shame, theres a decent ammount of worldbuilding and lore to keep your interested even tho FROM still struggles to give us a satisfying ending, besides the unbalance the combat still feels great and energetic to play, theres so much content here that I spent over 100 hours in a single playthrough to do everything I wanted I didn't even go 100%, plus theres new game+ modes that raises the difficult which isn't for me because I felt like one playthrough was enough for the upcoming years, also I really hope FROM goes back to the boss design of the DS3 and not the bullshit spamming, aoe-ridden bs we got here, otherwise it may be pretty much my last from soulslike game. because  this game has really managed to introduce a really strong fatigue on me against the souls subgenre, but still Elden Ring is one of the best entries the RPG genre has ever got, it may have a huge barrier of entry for some players, especially newcommers because of its difficult and some bs unfairness with the balance of its mechanics, but more patient players who are willing to take their time to appreciate the game and learn how it works, slowly, they will discover an experience of a lifetime here."

Positive,"Review from someone who has 240 hours in Dark Souls III punching my way through the game, DLCs, and NG+ with only a Caestus using M/KB.Pros:Open world: It isn't linear like previous souls games. The game encourages exploration. Exploration yields hidden gems and treasures. Its a good feeling. Atmosphere: It's dark. Not fluffy, or bright. You get sucked into the dreariness.Graphics: Spells art is incredible. Some of the dragon breath/flame spells art animation is crazy.Combat: Impact to hits and spells. You feel the weight of combat.Story line: is immersive. The characters you meet come to life.Travel system: is immersive unlike skyrim. You have bonfires/waypoints that allow you to travel. In skyrim you can travel anytime anywhere just by access the map. Its little but makes a difference. You also get a horse immediately.Anti-Cheat: If you experienced DS pvp you know what I am talking about. I am so thankful for having anti-cheat.Character customization and theory crafting: ton of builds and options. Game doesn’t differ from DS much. DS build guides apply. Theory crafting options are impressive. Cons:PC performance: There are things you need to do outside game to get it functioning properly. Shouldn't have to do this. I have a RTX3080 and was getting bad screen tearing and stuttering. Had to enable VSYNC in settings and exclude directx 12 from exploit protection in windows 10/11. Whats you tweak it works 98% of the time with minor hiccups.Difficulty: Maybe a CON. for first timers not used to a souls game. There is little tutorial or in game way to prepare newcomers for the frustration, anger and pain to soften the blow. Ramp up in difficulty for new comers might be a bit too quick without the feeling of progression and easing into it as your character develops. However, in my opinion The game isn't difficult per say, People are rushing boss content and then complaining its too hard. People need to slow down and level grind first and collect gear that helps in boss fights. Many People trying to solo Margit at level 13 with no gear and complaining its too hard.M/KB Optimization: I was hoping that this version would be optimized for M/KB. It wasn't. Same janky M/KB problems.COOP: Same issues as other DS games. If you help someone defeat a boss you may not get bossed killed credit. I haven't tested this fully. However, I helped someone recently and it zoned me out before I could get the bonefire for myself. Ended up having to kill Margit myself to get credit.Invasions: In COOP if your someone who doesn't like them. Overall, I give it a 9/10 due to out of the game performance problems. Otherwise 10/10. My advice to new players is dont rush content. Take your time and explore. Level up. Try out weapons, spells, talismans, NPC summons (jelly fish), etc. Find what works for you.AND GIT GOOD!"
Positive,i liked ranni but hole
Positive,Two thumbs up.
Positive,"This is a really good game. I rate 8.5/10 hats.The combat is stellar and the landscape is beautiful with excellent (not perfect, but excellent) verticality... I've had a couple performance issues, janky hit-boxes for attacks (which is only noticeable because of otherwise flawless hit-boxes) and a few crashes but nothing major. Enemy attack timings feel very fair, and there always feels like there are multiple ways to tackle fights, in no small part due to the massive customisation options, from weapons to weapon arts to spells and equipment. Downside is the scaling, which can get a bit weird due to the mid-late game area very close to the starting area - I've found myself badly failing at some areas and bosses very suddenly due to the level gap, and sometimes I explore an entire dungeon killing things in one hit, bosses included.I also didn't activate a certain mission and missed out on a plot hook which was very annoying as it locked me out of progressing until I searched for the result but otherwise the NPCs have the usual Dark Souls vagueness and hinting at where to next find them which feels very smooth."
Positive,"After completing this game to 100% I can truly say it's the best game I've ever played, and you get more than your money's worth. There is so much to do and you are constantly amazed at the vastness of the areas and the open world mechanics. Bosses are unique and challenging, the art is astounding, and you find yourself never knowing if you're really the 'good guy' or 'bad guy' which strays from a normal story formula that game developers tend to use. The lore is mysterious, but you understand enough to know it's in depth and more than you realize."

Positive,"Are you a contrarian like me who loved Dark Souls 2 the most out of the Dark Souls Trilogy due to its open world aspects and fun, interesting levels at the cost of interesting bosses and strange gameplay quirks? Did you like Dark Souls 3's amazing gameplay but found yourself bored by the gray dead world which, while granted IS the entire theme of the game, but still might not have clicked with you personally? Do you just really need an NPC you can hug after losing 30,000 souls to a boss you choked on at the last second?Sit down, shut up, play Elden Ring. Everything Dark Souls 2 did to make it my personal favorite of the souls games, Elden Ring does better, adds the amazing combat from DS3 AND improves it 10 fold. The world is beautiful and filled with wildlife, the bosses are breathtaking and will make you cry with how hard they can be, there's TONS of replay value because you simply CANNOT experience every single possible combat mechanic with just one build, nor try every weapon you find, and there's a waifu NPC you can hug to make your pain go away for free and as many times as you like who has... Disturbingly detailed panties? I dunno why they added that since you'd never see them unless clipped through her dress, but it sure as hell there and DAMN she got some taste.Only issue I've had?... Eh, multiplayer is kinda lukewarm. No real covenants to keep it spicy, invasions are almost always 1v2's, and this is EXTREMELY petty but it's a bummer there's no ""Small White Soapstone"" equivalent so you can just help allies with a small part of a map and pimp out with a small paycheck when your time is up. I loved that soapstone in 2, shame it just has not gotten any sort of return yet but it's not really a big deal.That's it really, it's just... It's a beautiful game. 100% worth the wait, no serious bugs that I've seen, if your computer can run it and you're fine with getting your ass kicked a few times going in, go for it! You won't regret it."

Positive,"I am a 50 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently started elden ring and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So i decided to make a Steam account and download this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, looked at the menu, but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
Positive,"Not often does a game grab me as much as Elden Ring has. From the moment you boot it up and start exploring, you are thrust into a beautiful, if brutally unforgiving, world. I've spent over 60 hours in this game already and I haven't even hit the half-way mark in terms of exploration; there is simply just so much to do, see, and experience. FromSoftware continues to deliver incredibly satisfying narrative experiences without an ounce of block-text-style monologues, forced lore, or any other outdated or lazy forms of storytelling. You get exactly as much out of the game's narrative as you'd like. This game blends incredible visual design, amazing voice acting and music, a gripping narrative, and the traditional tough challenge of a souls-borne game with an open world, which is enough to make me forgive the occasional screen-freeze or framerate drop. This game is easily one of my favorite games I've ever played. 10/10"

Positive,"As I search for redemption, I realize there is no escape from the mistake that was made. I am bound to it, and so is all that exists. It is as if what was borrowed must be returned, and the only way to do so is to converge all into a resplendent totality. My path is of convictions ablaze all consuming.

Positive,"As a first time souls like player, It's extremely frustrating at times and almost monitor punching level of rage inducing, BUT..... It is also very addicting and rewarding when you get the win. I've been playing this more than I played Dying Light 2 and i waited for that for years so that's saying something. Overall i love it a lot more than I ever thought i would, definitely suggest trying it out and sticking with it for a few hours and you'll love it if it at all interests you"
Positive,"Elden Ring is Dark Souls 2 if it was given proper love and attention ;(You can't go wrong with this game. Alot of content (first playthrough took about 130 hours to do almost all the content), it looks GORGEOUS, the music is amazing, and the gameplay is tip top. Highly recommended."
Positive,"They fixed the controller issue so it's a 10/10 game now. It also performs well, except for being limited to 60 fps and sometimes dipping below it when loading into a new area.As for gameplay, it feels a bit less like dark souls but it's more fun and forgiving. It is a bit more generic in some areas since side dungeons reuse tilesets and sometimes even bosses (one boss in particular was the exact same, except in the 2nd variation it had some adds too) and their arenas. Horse riding is fun, open world means you can go in any direction and power up if you're stuck on a boss. It makes it even more addicting since if you're stuck on something, you can just go do something else.Still, tons (and really tons) of fun, engaging diverse content, items to collect and enemies to fight. An amazing open world to enjoy and each new region will blow your mind a bit."
Positive,"A game truly worthy of no lifeing. 9/10Cucks Triple AAA games that are 100 GB. Elden ring has 10x more content for half the size. The game bosses are easy, its the mobs that are fucking aids. You have George R. R. Martin, an author known for killing off his characters in the most brutal fashion, and Miyazaki, a sadistic level designer who makes the most ASS CANCER mobs to FUCK with players. With the two of these sadistic muther fuckers combined you have the most AIDS and infuriating parts of the game. There is literally a mob thats just HANDS. Not only that mobs go ULTRA INSTINCT and SPIN THE FUCK HELICOPTER HELICOPTER a gajillion times holy FUCK. Each time me and my friend ran into a mob that GOES FUCKING AWOL HELICOPTER HELICOPTER we are both like, GODDAMNIT MIYAZAKI. I recommend this game if you enjoy getting brutalled by GRRM and Miyazaki."

Positive,"Elden Ring is a challenging Souls-game RPG game.I will preface this review by mentioning I've actually played the game solely using keyboard & mouse, so yes I will definitely mention that the controls and attacks were very wonky at times. The learning curve of the game is very high, the game has so many mechanics, attacks and items to use that it quickly becomes overwhelming. It is a progressive experience where you first learn the basics, then slowly integrate more strategies as time goes on. Thankfully, all you  lose on death are runes, so you can spend your runes on level ups and equipment without being penalised by dying repetitively to an hard enemy or an hard boss.Elden Ring has a ton of main quests and side quests alike, with a cast of interesting characters and bosses. Everything follows the same theme, but each of them are very unique nonetheless. The monster design of Elden Ring is THE BEST I've ever seen in any games ever, considering I love grim and terrifying-looking creatures. The story is pretty good, but while it is probably an unpopular opinion, I think it could've been better. I felt attached to some of the characters and some parts are very intense, but I did feel detached to the story as a whole for some reason.My favorite thing about Elden Ring is the everlasting feeling of constant progression whenever you unlock a new site of grace (fast travel waypoints) and after beating major encounters you have to work hard for to learn the mechanics of the bosses. My second favorite thing about Elden Ring is the hundreds of different weapons, armors, spells, incantations and different builds you can come up with.The graphics are amongst the best of any games I've ever played, the cutscenes are super well made and the background are even more beautiful. Some of the animations while moving are a bit wonky, but the scenery is a breathtaking experience every single times. The spell effects are also top notch and the variety of backgrounds/dungeons/castles/shacks/etc is simply put crazy.The soundtrack of this game is absolutely amazing, but it's mostly atmospheric or intense. It doesn't really have any memorable songs from what I could tell, but it is a very pleasurable auditory experience.As far as the controls and overall mechanics of the game, I obviously think that a ton of things are overtuned or wonky. The platforming is very bad in some parts of the game and some bosses really feel like they hit outside of their hitbox. It also happened to me a countless amount of time I swing my weapon an inch too far from the boss and then get punished by almost dying due to missing my hit and trying to recover from it. That made most of the gameplay super frustrating and I definitely loss a ton of time to bosses and certain enemies due to that.Also, the requirements for this game are quite high. Yes, the graphics are amazing, but my 2070 struggled with a lot of the game on the highest settings. I had only 1 crash thankfully, but I had hundreds of slowdowns when there are big explosions or a lot of smoke or whatever.As for the expected playtime, it really is honestly almost endless. If you go for different builds, different routes, different choices, collecting everything and going up to NG+7 (or higher), you will have a few hundreds of hours in this game easily.Overall, if you are willing to put a ton of efforts into learning a deep, complex and hard game, it is worth and it is worth the full price. Just keep in mind it is a really hard game and unless you use summons and the best setups, you will need a lot of practice to beat the first few bosses and even more to beat the harder bosses."
Positive,"Sad to see gamers are being robbed again. This is the last time I spend 60 dollars on a game. Im tired of these developers treating gamers like beta testers. I cant even launch the game. Tired of spending hours trying to get new release games to run. They are going to keep doing this until gamers say no more. We won't pay for games that weren't even tested. They're full of it if they claim this game ran smooth on any PC before launch. I could play cyberpunk smoother than this at launch. Thats how bad this is. Even getting past the fact the game doesn't even work for so many of us PC gamers. It doesn't even include basic things like ultra wide support or uncapped framerate. Didn't adopt DLSS either. Just no effort to make the PC version more than an alpha state port of the console versions. Plenty of other games to play this year. Guess ill ask for a refund and buy this a year from now for peanuts instead.amendment: Eventually got the game to launch by obscure means. I then was bombarded like 90 percent of other people playing this game by disgusting performance issues. I have now scoured every corner of the internet to make this game playable (albeit it is still in a bad state). I had to modify 5 different settings in nvidia control panel, disable hyperthreading, change very obscure settings in Windows, disable things in device manager. On and on all to make this game halfway playable on an RTX 3090 with a Zen 2 Threadripper on a Samsung 980 Pro (yes in a 4.0 full bandwidth slot). Hardware isn't the problem. My will to get this game running isn't the problem. The developers clearly prioritize the consoles and lazily threw this unfinished port out the door. The camera reeks like it was tuned for consoles and lags to the responsiveness of a mouse. The controls default to a controller whether you actually have one or not. They don't let you bind items individually instead having to scroll through hot menus to get to the item you want to equip. Even the things you can bind they don't allow you to bind many keys on the keyboard. It's extremely sloppy. I am currently running the game offline with a hack to unlock the FPS. Been playing at over 60 FPS no issues with physics so FromSoft just decides to lock it for no reason apparently and because I want the game to be responsive and not slog I can't play online because the anti-cheat will flip out about the FPS hack.If you are willing to spend hours upon hours troubleshooting this game. It is an awesome game that should've been a masterpiece if not ruined by shoddy coding and design flaws on the PC. I am hooked but next time I will wait for a sale on a FromSoft release. Couldn't return this copy because I didn't buy direct through steam. How anyone gave this game a 10/10 for the PC version is beyond me. Clearly people that are on the take.Ammendment June 2024I've come back to this game for another playthrough with the DLC. 2 years later this game still has performance issues on pinnacle hardware. I have since upgraded my hardware since my last ammendment to this review. I have a 4090 and a 7950x3d. Im not sure what else I'm supposed to do. Maybe I can check with NASA and see if they have something better for me to use. The game looks good especially with the added Ray Tracing but it doesn't look nextgen. This looks ported out of a PS4. Thats fine but that also means the game should run very easily on a PC like mine. The game itself is my favorite game I think. The performance issues are alot improved and no longer bother hacking it to get better performance. I just play at the disappointingly capped 60 fps with likely performance sucking anti-cheat thing enabled. I wanted to experience online since I did not my first playthrough due to the FPS hack turning off v-sync etc. I stay pegged at 60fps with everything turned to the max besides grass which I leave at high. I noticed with grass at max I was seeing bad fps dips even on this rig in grassy areas.The game periodically freezes and im not the only one reporting this. My assumption is the stupid anti-cheat doing something periodically perhaps. The freezing can be mid boss fight which is very aggravating but admittedly the freezes are pretty seldom so I'll hold off going back to disabling the anti-cheat again. Some people are reporting CTDs. I havent had a CTD yet since picking this game back up but I havent played a ton since the DLC launch yet. The game is great. Im not going to lay it all out. Everyone and their mom knows its amazing. It just suffers from technical issues at times. I hope for their next title that fromsoft perhaps uses more efficient coding methods or maybe a different engine that works better for PC.  Also better support for keyboard and mouse would be nice. Its there but its minimalistic. I've made it work but it could be better. Not a controller fan and alot of PC players are not. Please Fromsoft, improve this but most of all keep making more Eldenring games! This review sounds negative but the game is a masterpiece and I changed it to a recommend despite the shortcomings. Just be aware the game may run like crap on a lower end system because it doesn't even run that great on the best gaming rig money can buy."
Positive,"Great game, but the Dark Souls trilogy is beyond clear."
Positive,"I've only played 40 hours of this game, and none of it being afk which I did end up doing some of that in the Dark Souls series. But good god man, this game is beautiful, it's got some good pacing in my opinion. And the bosses all feel so nice to fight. Only thing that got me bummed is the random frame stuttering and complete drops from time to time but other than that this game is amazing, it was well worth the wait and I am so excited to see more of what this game has to offer.Edit. Get the Seamless co op mod, it optimizes the game and allows you to play the game with friends how it should be. P.S Alexander gonna make me act up one of these days"
Positive,Takes the best things from all the other souls games and makes it the best it can be. I have not felt this good about a game in a long time. I have as of writing this review done two play through's and expect to do many more.sure there are some bosses i like more then others and some seem to be poorly made but its such a small amount that it can be ignored.And paying full price for this game was worth. I LOVE THIS GAME.Except Imps. Imps suck.

Positive,"Im pretty sure I'm not even halfway through and already have 30 hours lined up. When I think its done showing me insane things it keeps surprising me again and again. Every fight feels like I barely made it through. The atmosphere reminds me of the good old days of souls games and they really managed to capture the insignificance and insurmountable odds that seem to be in front of you.I keep telling myself this game is probably going to be the one that beats me, but its so addicting I can't help but exploring a little more.The only real gripe I have it sometimes it feels like I constantly lost/wondering if I supposed to be in the area Im at at the time. Often Ill get destroyed by a boss and barely win, and then the thing I fight after may as well have been a random mobBut thats just nitpicky 10/10 Only issue is there is too much to do"

Positive,"Elden Ring is a brilliant but deeply flawed game. If the fundamental gameplay experience of the Dark Souls trilogy appeals to you, you should play it even despite the flaws mentioned below, because it’s basically Dark Souls 4 (and inherits the same level of weird nonsense and jank as its predecessors). As someone with way too many hours in the Dark Souls games, this review is naturally geared towards someone who has also played them, though if you’re new to the series there’s no better place to start than here (for one thing, Elden Ring actually has a proper tutorial).Pros:- The world is really, really good overall. There’s a lot to explore and discover and a good variety of environments and distribution of points of interest. The only problem is it’s so ridiculously huge that it spaces out time between the major dungeons.- The major ‘legacy’ dungeons are the absolute high point of the game, without exception. They’re large, complex and satisfying to explore, and the level design is much better paced than DS3’s. The same goes for certain more enclosed overworld areas.- For all the hate the bosses in this game get from the internet, they are largely either perfectly fine or really fun (with a few caveats for the late-game fights). There’s nothing on the level of the majority of DS3’s endgame bosses, but there are still plenty of great fights.- The new Ash of War system is great. Weapon arts and elemental infusions are now actually useful in PvE, and you can easily rearrange and customise your build to meet new challenges without needing to spend souls and rare resources. There’s a strong case to be made that weapon arts are now slightly too good, but given how DS1 and 3 are equally if not more biased in favour of R1s I’m willing to just call this the game’s equivalent.- Linked to the above, respecs are now dime a dozen after you reach a certain point in the early-ish game, which makes optimisation or even totally changing your build mid-playthrough much friendlier than it was in any of the Souls games.- The combat feels great and controls really well. It’s not as messy as DS3’s, which is a good thing in my opinion, and the faster speed feels more natural and well-implemented. R1 spam is also finally dead; using more obscure parts of your moveset feels more incentivised overall.- The lore is great, though I feel like it really needs extension to realise its full potential (DLC when?). The atmosphere is also on point; Elden Ring is much brighter and more vivid than the later Souls games and I think this is a really interesting aesthetic when combined with the often rather disturbing lore. The story is still a fragmented mess told through item descriptions and there’s only like 7 mandatory cutscenes in the whole game, so clearly Miyazaki still understands what makes his games good.- The game is really flexible in the order than you can tackle challenges. If you're having trouble with something, going somewhere else to find new tools is now very much incentivised. This is the essence of why the first Dark Souls is genius in my opinion and it's good to see it back at the centre of the design philosophy.Cons:- The minor dungeons can get really same-y and a lot of them are very frustrating to get through. Thankfully none of them have major bosses so on repeat playthroughs you can skip any that don’t have stuff for your build without missing much.- The difficulty of the late game goes through the roof even for the mandatory fights, let alone superbosses. In my opinion, provided you are exploring a decent amount, using the tools available to you and making a reasonable effort to create a functional and coherent build, this isn’t a problem on a first playthrough. However, this makes the last third or so of the game really unfriendly to meme builds and challenge runs and potentially quite painful even for stronger builds if you’re skipping content and going faster on a repeat playthrough. In this game more than any other Souls game you really shouldn’t be afraid to use powerful stuff, because the late game will still bite back for better or worse.- The weapon upgrade system is totally dysfunctional. Standard weapons both cost literally 10x the resources as special weapons, and are on the whole also a lot worse in terms of power especially for the aforementioned late game BS. This isn’t a hard and fast rule (I did the whole game with my beloved Claymore without issue), but in general the balance is way in favour of special weapons, which is unfortunate because those can’t benefit from infusions or the new Ash of War system. This might be optimistic, but I unironically think that smithing stone costs should be cut in half; this wouldn’t make the game any easier give how busted somber upgrades are, but it would cut down the tedious grind to be able to use standard weapons and make the two upgrade types slightly more balanced. On the bright side, the upgrade system is at least comprehensible without a guide, which more than can be said of the original Dark Souls.- I’m not a big online player, but Elden Ring’s online functionality is copied directly from Dark Souls and it really doesn’t work for the game. PvP seems miserable compared to DS3 and co-op is practically non-functional because of the open world style. While the Seamless Co-op mod gets a lot of flak for not having invasion support, it’s pretty much the only way to play co-op in an enjoyable way, so if you want to play with friends just ignore the PvP community’s whining and use it for the sake of your sanity (and lament that it’s not in vanilla, because it’s a way better co-op experience). I wish that the classical Dark Souls co-op mechanics had been more thoughtfully adapted to the game as much as the next guy, but the fact of the matter is that they haven't.- Elden Ring really likes to repeat content. There’s usually some new tricks or mechanics to vary it up but if seeing the same enemy/boss more than once triggers you don’t go anywhere near this game (unlike most problems, this also really falls away on a repeat playthrough unless you try to full clear the game again for some reason).Overall, despite the flaws, Elden Ring is well worth playing if you enjoy the Souls formula or are interested by the gameplay experience it presents. It’s also worth saying that Fromsoftware have a record of putting their best content in DLCs, so if and when that comes this game will probably only get better."
Positive,"ER is a game that accumulates best things of Souls series and makes them better, more polished, with lots of new and slight gameplay changes that gives this series new breath. One of the few games where fighting and gameplay is actually fun and not something that was castrated to please wider audience of casual gamers. Arise now, ye Tarnished ! The call of long-lost grace speaks to us allCross the fog , to the Lands BetweenTo stand before the Elden Ring."
Positive,"In an industry weighed down by its own greed and lack of self-respect,  Elden Ring  stands as a shining example of what video games can accomplish when placed in the right hands, and has somewhat revitalized the hope that many consumers had lost in this industry a long time ago. That is not to say the game is without flaws, and that FromSoftware's treatment of their workers is not to be scrutinized. However, these are criticisms which ultimately do not effect the level of enjoyment you will find yourself having while playing the game in any meaningful way.To say that ""Elden Ring is basically Skyrim... but good"" is an obnoxiously simple take that completely misunderstands what  Elden Ring  has accomplished, because it is so much more than just a good open world game; it's a bold statement to the entire industry that video game franchises can be innovative while maintaining the soul of their original concepts, that they can be made accessible to larger audiences in creative ways that don't disrespect the intelligence of their players, and that they don't need to be infested with micro-transactions to make a lot of money.All of that to say,  Elden Ring  is a modern classic that will be seen as the make-or-break moment in a once rapidly crumbling industry. It is an extraordinary journey through a hallucinatory netherworld that is both merciless and unforgiving, but is so damn good that you will keep coming back for more, even through gritted teeth and teary eyes."
Positive,try finger but hole
Positive,"Good game, would recommend."
Positive,"Haven't finished the game yet, however I am close, but this game is a blast, it's literally the Dark Souls formula in an open world, and it was done really well! In fact, the open world feels a like BOTW to some degree while also having a Fallout New Vegas vibe in how you constantly know where you want to go as there is always an enormous amount of land marks in your view, and even know this makes the game world really dense that density makes it feel huge, and quite frankly it is, even with that said density of content. Overall this game has already become one of my all-time favourites, it is a bit easier that your average Dark Souls game because of the wide variety of combat styles, but I could care less, difficulty does not determine how much I enjoy a game, and it still provides a relatively high level of challenge for a garbage player like me, the stuff that makes me love the game has nothing to do with difficulty anyway. And unlike your average souls game, I enjoyed the world, enemies, characters, etc, a lot more, considering there is about the same amount of content in this game as there is in all Dark Souls games combined when taking into account the numerous full-on secret areas and places you will never go to but will provide hours of enjoyment and content, it's insane how high quality that content is, and during my play, I was genuinely feeling overwhelmed with stuff to do, wanting to do every inch of it. Honestly I don't know how people are finding it hard to know what to do in the world, while yes it doesn't completely show you were to go, it gives you a pretty clear picture, and everything else you see is ALSO something to do, so why not do that? The optional content is literally just as good if not better than the main content and about 90% of the game is said optional!Edit: Just finished the game and it's fucking fantastic, going back in for a second go as there was some side content I missed that I rather do on a new save where I 100% the game."

Thank you, Miyazaki.Edit: The game still crashes a bunch and is still more fun than I've had in almost any game. Best game ever. Playing through this game will actually resurrect the dead and heal the dying. I mean, probably, I don't know."
Positive,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in ""Blood Money.""] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is."

Positive,i hate this game
Positive,"Finally they handed over that thing,the Elden Ring."
Positive,"a beautiful game, so much to do, praise the sun! Praise till you hollow!"
Positive,"No lover required aheadtherefore, seek Elden Ring"
Positive,I have never had more fun being trash at a game. 5/5 Godricks
Positive,"Game is nuts, pretty much dark souls with complete freedom, you can fight whatever, whenever, level whenever, however. Game is sick, could recommend to anyone, sound design is fucking fantastic, combat style is as dark souls as it'll ever be. Perfect Dark Souls game, and we call it Elden Ring :)"
Positive,"Challenging TriumphThis game presents a formidable challenge that's both gratifying and immersive. Despite its difficulty, I was compelled to explore every corner of its beautifully crafted world. The combat system demands strategy and skill, making every victory feel earned."
Positive,"I initially didn't recommend the game, since the poor performance stopped me from playing. I ended up playing more and honestly, it's everything I wanted. I love this game already, despite the stuttering and frame rate issues. I really hope they do get it fixed soon though, as some boss fights are damn near impossible due to the game slowing down whenever they attack."
Positive,"I don't think I've ever heard anything negative about this game. It's like dark souls, but more. I'm gonna judge you a little if you're downvoting it honestly, there's so little not to love"
Positive,"Try fingers,But hole"

Positive,"Well, 400+ hours later, still playing. Beaten the game and every boss, platinum'ed the game.Tried several mods now, and the potential for mods is incredibly high. Easy 10/10."
Positive,"Much better than Darksouls, on god. Sekiro and Elden Ring are goated no kizzap."
Positive,Better than God of walking
Positive,Good game well worth the price.
Positive,Imagine a game being so hyped up so much and for so long that you doubt it could meet expectations and then it proceeds to exceed those expectations. That is this game
Positive,"This is a rare 10/10 game. Perfect in almost all aspects. Here are some key features of Elden Ring to consider:Difficult Yet RewardingIt's not an easy game, like any other Souls game.It makes you learn enemy patterns, boss mechanics and most importantly what your character is capable of. Each boss is designed to punish certain player behaviors (one boss will punish for playing melee only, another boss will punish for constant movement, and so on). Some of the mobs are tougher than bosses. Environment will often be dangerous too.Yet it will greatly reward you for overcoming those challenges and reaching a certain goal.Open-World ReinventedAre you tired of other open-world games published recently, such as latest Assassin's Creed or Horizon or Far Cry? Where it feels like enemy camps were just copy-pasted all over the world just to artificially prolong the playtime?Well this game is different. Each area is unique, mobs are different, not just visually but also have different mechanics. The exploration is real in Elden Ring, you might revisit a low level area later in the game and find something new, something useful.This is probably the biggest achievement of Elden Ring and I hope other game studios will take a note here, because this is the future of open-world games.ArtWhile graphics are not the best (UE5 is better), this is one of the most beautiful games i've ever played.The art team has made an incredible job. All these epic models, various biomes, beautiful sky, ambient music, and so on and so forth. You can tell that this game was created by people who actually care for the game. Every small detail was considered.It's hard to pass the feeling when you go underground and find a peaceful river with artificial stars on top of it, or when you descent to burning lava cave or reaching the top of snowy mountains with giants.LoreGRRM did a great job here. It's not that Dark Souls series had bad stories. But Elden Ring is on a completely different level. I wish he puts the same amount of effort in finishing Winds of Winter.And it's not just lore, but also the way the story is being told, it doesn't just push cinematics or walls of text over your face. But rather each NPC gives out portions of the story over time. Sometimes you won't even pay attention to what this NPC said but later will figure out how important that small piece of information was.UIThis is another aspect I have to mention. Most of the time there's little to no interface on your screen. You're actually playing a 3D game without tons of 2D elements/text on your screen. In combat it'll show minimum amount of information necessary for the fight. You don't have a special journal with arrows and map markers for your quests, but rather have to rely on your memory and decide on your own where to head next.It really helps with the immersion, i think FromSoftware has proven that this approach of minimalistic UI is more than functional in an open-world game.Cons- Some minor things like the confirmation popup to summon dead horse while fighting a deadly dragon... this popup needs to be removed.- Controls are not easy to learn for newcomers.Overall, it's a masterpiece. Don't think about it, just try it, you won't regret!"
Positive,Beat it no summons as it should be. Extra hard mode feelsgoodman
Positive,"If you don't like this game ur gayIncredible open world game that going in blind, gives you a world to discover"
Positive,Amazing game btw Putin is a fascist.
Positive,"Well,what can I say,this game has its ups and downs,but overall at the end of the day I can say that its deserving the GOTY title,its a huge world with lots of bosses,u have a lot of options when it comes to combat and character builds,a lot of exploration,and the lore its kinda nice BUT its not for everbody,u need a lot of pacience too,and to have some nerves and neurons to throw away because u die a lot,i mean,a LOT in this game and sometime u need to play with wiki or youtube in front of you because the game doesnt tell u shit about almost anything,u are on your own when it comes to story progress or quests"
Positive,"After 2 somewhat disappointing years of gaming, finally we got a good game.Truly one of the best games I have ever played in my life.So massive yet not boring.So challenging yet not unfair.So rewarding and addicting. I wish this game would never end."
Positive,+:1. Story is amazing2. Boss battles are actually fun3. The soundtracks are amazing4. Pretty firekeeper lady-:1. Stuttering issues2. as per any souls game sometime weird hitbox3. there is this bug when you call torrent then immediately diedNote:1. My processor cant run this game so im tanking on <50 fps to 20 fps but its all good
Positive,I haven’t been so impressed with a game in a long time. It’s damn good. The world/map exploration is the best I’ve experienced in ages. Game of the Year and it’s only February. Haven’t run into stuttering or dropped frames on my end. Hopefully they patch that for people who have experienced it.
Positive,"What a big, ambitious, crazy project of a game. I can't emphasize enough that Elden Ring and its world are absolutely HUGE, and its lore is equally gigantic and deep. Even with the combined efforts of a huge community, people are still piecing together mysteries in the plot and background lore.I know Fromsoft games have a reputation of being brutal and punishing, and while Elden Ring is no walk in the park, I think the reputation is a bit overblown here. If something is too difficult, you can just leave and do something else, and come back to it later with new skills, new gear, more levels, etc. The summons system also gives a variety of NPC assists or even allows you to bring in other players to help. If that sort of thing dilutes the ever-important challenge, you can simply avoid those systems. But it's a helpful hand to people willing to leverage every tool to overcome some of the meaty challenges.Elden Ring isn't perfect. It's deliberately obscure, some systems don't really pull their weight (like crafting and weapon upgrading), and lots of the math is more or less invisible to the player and left for the community to figure out. But it's good. My god it's good. And there's so damn much of it. At 281 hours, I've done two playthroughs and I'll probably come back for a third when there's DLC."

Positive,"It's okay, don't know if i'll finish it so leaving a review now, if I ever finish then i'll update this. I like the game but I don't feel the same level of enthuism others do for it, I find myself wanting to return to other souls titles the more I play. Just been having such a drop in my desire to play/explore, was fun at first but now I find myself not wanting to look at the map and trying to just go boss to boss as fast as possible."
Positive,"This game is cool. I have a friend who is on the Autisim Spectrum and he is enjoying the game as well. He just runs and dies to the tree sentinel in the starting area, however he is still having a lot of fun. Thank you from software for catering to the Autists."
Positive,"One of the best games ive ever played, never played any of the games from this publisher but i love this game. The game is difficult and fun at the same time, im having a blast in the dangerous world and learning how to become a Lord. This game is not recommended for the weak hearted. Cya in game tarnished"

Positive,"FPS Problems/Stuttering can’t stop me from playing the outstanding art piece of a game this is, and neither should it stop you. But they aren’t just something to not mention. However…Even with those problems, I can’t stress enough on how beautiful the content of this game is. And the amount of love and labor they put into this is incredible and deserves to be known.The in game day time/Night time mechanics is incredibly interesting and brings new things to discover in game. ***hint hint***The way most bosses and mini bosses alike can be encountered in elden ring creates a refreshing change of pace at times, it never gets old for me. Even after 30 hours.The music just reminds me of all the souls games I played for my first time and ended up seeing to the end. The eargasms you’ll be having are to die for. I promise you.And of courseJUMPINGGenuinely, if you can ignore the technical problems till they get patched, this game is worthy of GOTY and I recommend getting your hands on it ASAP. It gets a 10/10 best game Ive gotten to play in years."
Positive,"Fallen leaves tell a story :2016butterfly:From the moment I began Elden Ring, I was entranced. Its world, filled with stunning landscapes, mysterious NPCs, and unforgettable bosses, pulled me in completely. But what truly elevates this game is its music—epic, immersive, and emotional. I now find myself listening to boss themes in everyday life, facing real challenges as if they were in Elden Ring.The game’s vast open world is a masterpiece of design, constantly rewarding exploration and curiosity. The bosses, with their intricate patterns and designs, are both brutal and deeply satisfying to conquer. Each encounter leaves a lasting impact, pushing me to improve with every failure.Simply put, Elden Ring isn’t just a game—it’s an experience that lingers long after you’ve put it down. I’ve fallen in love with every piece of it, and it has changed the way I view both virtual and real worlds. If you’re looking for a game that challenges and inspires, Elden Ring is the one."

Positive,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pieDirections:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
Positive,Yo??? I don't understand all the bad rates ??? THE GAME IS PERFECT. Im currently playing with the max graphics with a GTX 970 and i5 6600k so the game is well optimised.. If its not working well for you just update your drivers or try to reboot your computer. Good bye.5/5 for adventure5/5 for rage5/5 for epicness5/5 for the game design10000/5 for the goats that rolls
Positive,"I love this series, I love From Software, I love the idea of getting to play this game. I have been able to play 1.2 hours before they patched the game, now that they have patched it I can't get into it. Every time the Namco Bandai logo flashes the white screens starts to pulse and then the game crashes. I was getting 45-55 frames on high settings before so its not a performance issue for me. I would have gladly played the game like that. Will change my negative review to a positive as soon as they find a fix that lets me get back into the lands in between. :(Edit 5/1/2022Elden Ring works it sometimes crashes at main menu but other than that they definitely fixed this game into a sparkling pile of washed and cut stones, instead of the raw ore they laid out with the beginning of the game's release. Multiplayer has some glitches like the coop summon not being able to deal any damage to invaders or npcs. This is a rare glitch though and its only happened to me and my friend twice so far.Other than this the game is deep and complex and rewarding. Go out there and beat some bosses!"
Positive,Best game ever

Positive,The game of the gods has now graced us with its existence on this mortal realm. May your enemies die swiftly.
Positive,"Whoever says this game is bad, is the type of people you shouldn't listen to when trying to find a game you like.Literally game of the century, slight very rare stutters and all."
Positive,"After 2 full 100% runs  and a NG+1 i can state that this game is a true gem. Best thing is, after 3 runs i'm only getting started. The absolute share amount of different builds that i want to try out in this game is unreal.I really hope Miyazaki continues to bring such absolute top of the line souls games.The share size and atmosphere of the zones is something absolutely incredible. How everything is connected from on point to the other makes this an absolute masterpiece. If only the game was really well optmize  and i would definitely rate this 10/10, instead, is a 9.5."
Positive,"O Elden Ring. After much anticipation, somehow this game has surpassed all my expectations. Although my Xbox controller didn't work initially, and the game's frame rate dropped during some fights and weather effects, these issues do not detract from the overwhelmingly beautiful and deep experience that this game offers players.This game is just as challenging as previous From Software titles such as Dark Souls or Sekiro, but in Elden Ring you have many options. When faced with a tough boss, they are no longer an obsticle, instead they can be a postponed objective, or summon a friend or spirit to help.There are no invisible walls. nothing to stop you from walking directly into a late-game fungal infected nightmarish hellscape (I'm looking at you, Caelid). Every ruined shack, dank cave, and castle has something unique and special to find.Combat in engaging. Axe swings are heavy and magic is a force to be reckoned with. There are also new fun build options to customize your weapon's special moves (Ashes of War) and even a customizable potion that resets when you rest at a checkpoint.If you like to be a detective, the story offers a grand puzzle to piece together through observation, character alliances, item descriptions.The joy of exploring, crafting to get an upper hand in a battle, calling of spirits to help you, and discovering the secrets that this game world is a joy. The experience that this game offers tenacious players is simply breath taking. I'm looking forward to spending hundreds, if not thousands of hours in The Lands Between."
Positive,"It's VERY hard if you aren't patient. Literally is making me a better gamer in general because I have been playing a lot of games (most games) that are very loose and hack and slashy and etc when in this you gotta be smart, reserved, reflexes on high alert and sometimes you gotta just admit defeat and go level up. It doesn't hurt to be lucky, either...Sometimes I feel like there is delay or mushiness with controls but not too often and most of the time it is probably my fault."

Positive,"okay, i'll admit, i downloaded the cracked version first, since i never play soulborne series before, in my mind i was just curious about the world building and the hype surrounding the game, and i thought it'll be a waste of money if i buy the game then drop the game halfway or maybe early since everyone says souls games are hard and unforgiving..played for hours...then.. 80 hours into the game, i finished the game, defeat malenia, got the age of star ending..that's it right? i mean, i finished the game, why should i buy the game?? but No.... THIS GAME IS A MASTERPIECEBOUGHT THE GAME after i finished playing the cracked version, yes.. that shows how much this game worth, i deleted the cracked version and Proudly owned the Steam one!judge me all you want for trying the cracked version, but i redeemed myself with this purchase even i already completed the whole game!VERY VERY RECOMMENDED, dont be like me, just buy the game, if it's too hard for you, then grind, level up, upgrade your weapons, remember what i said, i never play soulborne series before but i managed to finish the game"

Apparently it is.11- Y'all got any more of them stonesword keys?12- ""Try finger but hole"", ""fort, night"", ""is this a dog?"", ""oh you dont have the right o you dont have the right""13- Kill a lot of epic bosses and mini-bosses. Except the Bulls, fuck those guys.14- Oh, and Radahn. Fuck that guy too.15- ""Oh my God, dude, the Cat Talisman DOESN'T FUCKING work!""16- The game is STILL going omg now there's an underground area inside this city's underground area. 17- Reach Malenia. Stop playing after having reached Malenia.18- Alexa, how to dodge Malenia's flurry of blows and kill this fucking bitch?19- Kill Malenia. Thank Alexa.20- Finish the game. Be sad that every other game won't be as good as this and still 3+ years until FROM blesses us mortals again."
Positive,Kinda mid 4/10
Positive,"Elden Ring is indeed the culmination of the FromSoft souls/borne genre. Taking the best from most of them and laying it all out in a gigantic open world. It was really interesting how well the mixture worked. Which at first glance might sound too formulaic.It's best feature is still exploration and level design. That is something I can still not get enough of. Wish I could say the same about boss fights. While they've generally been good to great, the sheer volume and numbers of them has really taken its toll on me. Especially at the levels of anxiety and stress I generally get when I'm in the thick of it. I don't want to say the game is too big, since I'm generally of the opinion you can never get enough, even if you have to enjoy it in chunks; but towards the very end of the main campaign it really started to weigh on me. So much that, for a good few of the enemy boss fights towards the end I just refused to force myself to get through them solo. I got through a lot of them alone, but I think starting with Mohg, the Omen, I just gave in and used mimics. Then came Borealis, the ice dragon, Theodorix the Magma Wyrm, and others; but finally the one I was really dreading, Malenia. I'm not ashamed to say my mimic carried me considerably. And even so it took around 10 attempts to take her down. And interestingly the mimic alone could not keep up with her, especially across 2 stages. So I was forced to shoulder some of that aggro. But in the end we got it done.Back to the level design and exploration, definitely my most enjoyable part of the game. Especially given the level of danger. It made every little inch you conquer very enjoyable. And while the level design has been very solid, I do sort of miss the absolute focus on dense intertwining levels, most often defying any laws of physics. In that department the game is considerably more reserved, compared to their previous ones. But the scope of it all will make up for it. And a few of the legacy dungeons, that try to mimic some of the labyrinthine places of past, are actually quite large. But still, they feel too grounded. Gone are the absolutely physically impossible locations of past, which is a little shame. Actually, come to think of it, maybe I'm romanticizing how many of those there actually were. But there were definitely more than in Elden Ring. And not necessarily locations that are unrealistic. More like locations that are physically impossible. Like Dark Souls 2's famous, taking an elevator from the top of a huge decrepit windmill up to a medieval castle inside a volcano. Those sorts of nonsensical but still very enjoyable locations.Also on level design, every now and then I noticed is how much less impactful shortcuts you open up along the way Feel. There are exceptions of course, but these used to feel like a mainstay since they would often cut considerable walking sections. It definitely feels like less impactful and you use them less often. Or maybe it's just me. Or maybe it's the fact that due to the open world you're no longer constrained while previously that shortcut was the only chance of reducing your risk of dying while trying to progress further.While the levels aren't as wildly nonsensical as in previous games, what cannot be taken away is how absolutely gorgeous most of the locations look and feel. Absolutely masterwork in the visuals and atmosphere department. Such a beautiful mix of high fantasy with gloomy moody locations.And the scale of it all, absolutely unique in how small you feel in this world they built. The game just keeps going on for what feels like forever. With hidden area tucked away in the most secretive corners of the world. It really boggles the mind at how exactly they managed to build all of this. The negative worth mentioning is the wrap-up of the game is a bit deflating. I didn't find the last few fights on the main trail any entertaining or sufficiently rewarding (probably also to do with the fact that I was drawing to a close in terms of having gas in the tank to put up with the huge amounts of stress and anxiety, which is why I just used mimics for a lot of them, making most of them trivial). And the actual endings of the game, which I went through the trouble of setting things up for all 6 of them, have been quite unimpressive. Especially given the huge amount of work and effort put into everything else up until that point. It's quite staggering if you compare the scope of everything else in the game, compared to how little effort was put into the actual endings. Most of which are almost identical to one of them. And another 2 of them slightly better and unique. Which is probably why I can't give it a clean 10/10, which it could've gained. To conclude, overall a great experience. If maybe a little bit too much. Now I should take a break before embarking on Shadow of the Erdtree, but I feel its claws in me, even though I should take a brief break from the stress and anxiety.A 9.5/10 from me. An extremely impressive work of art.!!!SPOILER!!!I want to keep track of the boss fights I didn't solo just in case I sometimes feel bored or in need of more stress and anxiety:Astel Stars of DarknessGreat Wyrm TheodorixBorealis of the Freezing FogLoretta Knight of the HaligtreeMalenia Blade of MiquellaMohg Lord of BloodGodskin DuoDragonlord PlacidusaxMaliketh, the Black BladeMohg, the OmenGodfrey, First Elden Lord / Hoarah LouxRadagon/Elden Beast"

Positive,"My first review is now null and void.This game is simply amazing, and im hooked. Now it runs like a gem, and its the most gorgeous game i have ever seen...Best soulsborne game so far (minus Sekiros combat, which is simply genius). Who cares about the reskin enemies, theres a lot more variety here than most other games could ever dream of even with the reskinned enemies.I love it.EDIT: Okay, they ruined the end game. Mountaintop of the Giants just turns the game to s**t. And everything afterwards. End game sucks. The only souls game im quitting before i complete. Im just simply not having fun anymore. Should have ended at Morgott, and just put more resources into the rest of the game prior to the city. Ill leave the recommend, but yeah.... im a souls vet through and through, and im just simply over it."
Positive,"I may decide to add more later, but for starters, this game is a master piece. It's easily the best souls game and I'm not anywhere close to beating it. It's got amazing visuals, amazing sound and music, amazing combat, amazing characters and lore, and so much more. If you did not like this game, then you don't like any of the souls games and this game just isn't for you. This game, unlike previous titles, has plenty of guidance in the forms of pop-up tutorials, helpful npcs, the trails of light from sites of grace which also appear on the map, notes sold by merchants with hints on how certain enemies work and more. This doesn't make the game easy, which a souls game is never supposed to be, but it can help ease new players into it a little better than older titles. But Elden Ring also trusts the player to figure some things for themselves. It's a game that says ""hey, you're smart and determined! You can do it without me holding your hand the whole way.""  So keep that in mind. It's supposed to be hard, but you can overcome through trial and error, through learning mechanics, and through jolly cooperation with friends and strangers playing the game with you."

Positive,"To say this game is addictive is quite a severe understatement. This is the first time I've played a 'souls' type game, and getting used to the intense, cruel battle system was quite a trial, however, it's all the more gratifying when you defeat an enemy you've faced countless times. So far I've played around 80 hours, and I feel I haven't even scratched the surface - the sheer magnitude of this game is astounding, in the best way possible. It draws you in and keeps you there, I found that I had ran around a certain area multiple times, but still kept finding something new every single time I would go back. A piece of advice: if you like quest logs, i.e. Skyrim-esque, take to writing things in a notebook. I've found this to be quite helpful in remembering what I'm doing, questlines I'm currently on, and also who I've spoken to/where they were. In short, the game is fantastic, phenomenal even. It's beautiful and fun, as a lover of fantasy (big LOTR fan over here) it's right up my alley. It's merciless in it's style, but it makes it all the more enjoyable."

Positive,"I was not a From software fan before this game nor had any soulsborne experience before this game and i can confidently say THIS GAME FUCKS, AND IT FUCKS HARD.This game was 93 hours of pure joy and dark medieval fantasy insanity and i loved every fucking second of it. I recommend this as a wonderful starting point to get into the series if your interested and if your not its just a very nicely made game with many hours of intrigue and exploration that i absolutely think everyone should play.The combat is fun and the exploration always rewards the most dedicated while also being more than accessible enough that its not going to overwhelm you. I should however mention that one should play this game entirely blind and to play it as you see fit, there is this weird pissing contest from software fans like to do where they critique every way you play this game for no reason and it gets old fast. Use summons and easily cheesable builds or dont and play it the ""pure"" way they want whatever will get you the most enjoyment out of this game and its going to be a 10/10 experience"

Positive,"yo did I install a mod to make all the enemies invisible? *checks files* nope, no mods here, is this a default hard mode difficulty?!? *continues to play*My review is now positive because they've fixed pretty much every issue I had."
Positive,"First of all, it seems I got lucky - my RX 5600XT 6 GB / Ryzen 3700X / 32 GB RAM is managing this game quite well in 1080p@60 fps (without major slowdowns) and even 1440p@~60fps - only in open spaces I am getting stutters. In both cases I am using HIGH settings without bothering to change any setting.However stutterings are still happening, however not to the point to unplayability. Actually, around 95% of my playtime was stutter-free and maybe once in my 11 hours of playtime it actually caused me to die.Only complaint from my side is that game for some reason changes my screen resolution when running, and takes some time to change it back after turning game off. And black screen during some cutscenes for some bizzare reason.Thats for technical details, now some points (both good and bad) I want to mention:- It's easier than any of the Souls game, at least when you are getting any ranged character; I died maybe 10 times, only half of which were during boss fights and I am not that good in those games- This freaking open world is gorgeous and full of stuff to explore- However ""standard"" dungeons have the same recipe used many times (at least from my experience) which gets me back to Oblivion/Skyrim, however not to the point of actual repetition- Bosses in above dungeons are sometimes quite timid, to the point I got a kill on 2 of them by keeping my distance and firing spells one after the other- Spells are waaay more satisfying to use than in Souls, though I only managed to get my hands on 2 (including one from the start) that seems to be worth something- Horseback melee when using short weapons is clunky, but firing spells is quite good- Upgradeability of weapons is something else completely - whish it was done in previous games- Small, but still nice QoL improvement - naming of crafting items to upgrade items is... well, way better (just add a number at the end to generic name, to mark a tier of an item)- 60 fps lock is bad, but isn't dealbreaker for me; if I want fast-pace action that uses high framerate I would rather play DOOM 2016 / Eternal than Elden RingOverall this is easy 8/10 with current state. With optimization, technical and network improvements that lets hope will happen - 9-9,5/10"
Positive,"I agree with the popular sentiment -- this game is a masterpiece, and truly lives up to the hype.It feels like a combination of the best 'Souls' game to-date with the best Elder Scrolls game to-date. The fact that From was able to accomplish this with their first excursion into the open world RPG format is inspiring to say the least.It seems like I have an ""oh my god this game is amazing"" moment every hour, from being introduced to gorgeous landscapes, to mindblowing boss encounters, to jumping from roof to roof discovering secrets in level design reminiscent of Dark Souls 1. Despite some sporadic performance issues, most notable in early game locations and upon launching the application for the first time, the rest of the game has been almost completely issue free for me. I've only encountered one or two notable bugs, and comparing that other open world games, that is a feat in itself.Elden Ring has given this gamer hope for the future of gaming. We needed Elden Ring, not just for the journey it provides, but to elevate players' and developers' expectations of the gaming platform. Here's hoping we see more games crafted with the love and skill evident in Elden Ring."
Positive,"Ever wanted to get into a souls game? Like the idea of a JRPG, but not the moment-to-moment play of menu navigation? Elden Ring is by far the most accessible souls-style game; for the first time you can simply double jump over a massive roadblock using your special horse. The world of Elden Ring is not just huge, but actually populated with a variety of enemies, structures and dungeons. You have more options in combat than ever, and some incredibly hideous and strange things to fight. Even the Big Knights that are traditional in souls games are the best they've ever been.Absolutely grab this if you like souls games, or want to figure out how to like them and want a gigantic RPG on top of that"

Positive,Miyazaki lied. It is in fact not just 30HRS.
Positive,FromSoft have outdone themselves... the open world experience here is second only to Zelda's Tears of the Kingdom. I can't remember the last time a game filled me with child-like wonder and awe the way that Elden Ring has. I wish I could explore this world again for the first time. 10/10

Positive,"FromSoftware released a game that surpassed all its hype expectations, something seemingly not common from large studio releases in recent years. Great gameplay overall, although it gets somewhat repetitive in the middle. It is a game designed to be replayed, not to be completed all at once."

Positive,"My first ""souls"" experience was Demon's Souls on the PS3. I loved the idea that it could have been an open world, but seeing this actually come to light with a higher budget is a wonderful payoff. I get a little salty when the tagline for a souls game is something like ""prepare to die"" and the reason I feel that way is because I believe that games are honestly meant to challenge you and be a difficult and rewarding experience. The reason why most Souls games are great? it's because people never really grew up with a SNES or the feeling like their progress was earned. Most games come with too generous a save and not enough of a challenge to make you feel like you are achieving anything. In which case: we may as well be watching a movie, or playing a script. Is this bad? Not necessarily, and everyone enjoys different modes of play, but it is an interesting topic and I think more ""games"" could be far less forgiving in favor of challenge. (added difficulties give the player power to experience the game how they want to, and that is always welcome too) Either way, that's why people compare games with even mild difficulty to souls... it's because that challenge isn't something that is present or apparent in our current library. Souls games give you the gift of trial and error, of learning, conquering, and triumph through your own tools, and that battle, and struggle, are in Elden Ring perhaps most of all.Elden Ring has exceeded every expectation and defines the souls' genre even further offering more atmosphere and exploration to a series that was initially somewhat linear even if not entirely. The best part is that you are rewarded for almost everything that you do. Traveling around this beautiful world full of all kinds of bizarre intrigue and mystery, finding a weapon or spell that speaks to you, collecting an arsenal, and playing with builds never felt better. After 160 hours of exploration and conquering every single piece of land available, I feel I got the most out of my first playthrough... and I would love to go back through just to test builds, find things I missed, and see other endings.Something that stood out to me during my first run was how pretty the game is. Generally not super big on graphics, I can't help but appreciate the visuals here. You can make it to any castle in the distance or daunting landscape and find yourself looking down to where you were. The tones and colors of each zones themes are on point. Humble green beginnings signal the coming storm in Limgrave, a red sky to reflect the putrid Scarlet Rot in Caelid, and even the holy land of Altus and its golden reflections, are all complemented by the benevolent Erdtree towering over the world. Elden Ring is very much encased in beauty with a haunting mixture of monsters and demi-humans. It makes traveling in such a massive world worth it every time.When it comes to games like this, you know that you can experience the joy that comes from overcoming hardship. This is something of a direct quote from Miyazaki himself. Let's just hope he has a desire to one-up this game in the future, and if he does I'm here for it!Once again, Thank you for this game."
Positive,"Short review:  Get it.  It lived up to the unbelievable amount of hype.Mid review(if you know dark souls what is different)Easier overall.Open World with very well done horseback riding mechanic.Better multiplayer mechanics(group codes to get priorities with friend groups, summon pools, opt in multiplayer)Summons- You gain summons that can you can use at certain points which vary wildly in strength but are extremely helpful.  (Note: Can't be used in multiplayer so be aware.  Some require more FP to summon so be aware of your mind stat)Customizable weapon skills- You can add skills to certain weapons so you can pretty much always use your favorite weapons.New interesting lore that is familiar yet different and deep.Teleport everywhere almost whenever you want.Clear indications of grace locations(like bonfires).Long Review(if you don't know these games at all)From Software makes difficult third person rpg adventure games with very unique mechanics and cryptic worlds.  Their difficulty often comes from rushing or not properly identifying an ambush.  Most fights can be overcome with proper spacing, rolling mechanics(iframes), and sufficient damage/stance breaking.   If you die, you lose your currency/xp and have to reach your body to get them back.  If you die a second time you lose them permanently. This creates a sense of loss and desperation which causes people to make mistakes and they weigh their value too heavily(soul procurement goes up as you continue playing making lost souls a non-issue). Aside from that, the game is huge, immersive, super mysterious, and has a medival kinda theme.  It has slow methodical combat, and numerous in depth and satisfying game systems to keep you absorbed for a long time."
Positive,"Everything I loved about Dark Souls but with a Breath of the Wild freedom in the open world. Pick a spot on your map and go towards it... kill things on the way, kill things once you get there. The bosses are not nearly as challenging as Dark Souls 1 or 3 (so far) but the quantity of bosses and non-linear nature make it quite a bit more fun in a different way. Some of the mobs are just re-hashes from old games... and I'm ok with that, but the new mobs and world building is still really interesting and keeps it fresh. Overall I'd say the game has a home in anyone's library who loves soulsborne games or wanted to like them but thought they were too hard before -- it's worth jumping in here, even though there is a bit of a learning curve with some of the Soulsborne tropes and systems."
Positive,Did absolutely nothing but play this game for one week straight anytime I wasn't working or sleeping -- and I'd do it again. 10/10
Positive,Praise the Elden Ring!
Positive,"Without a doubt, the best Soulsborne game yet. Absolutely incredible design and key improvements in places previous games had faults.Its not perfect by any stretch, but I would definitely give it a 10/10 rating, and my definitive top contender for GOTY. It will be incredibly hard for any other game this year to top this."
Positive,"I've never been played before in soulslike games. i hate almost all roguelike games BUT this i fall in love in this awesome, badass game!!! This is truly adventure which grip doesn't loosen within it until end. Awesome open world it doesnt' empty and wanna discover it each corner. Definitely this game of the year and my personal favorite."
Positive,"Game is very crisp and as polished as can be in my opinion. My only gripes is the fact that late game enemies deal so much damage that the margin for error is very small that it may discourage new players to this genre.Pros: -Stat Build Freedom -Exploration is satisfying -Combat System is good despite the difficulty -Well-written lore but may be subjective to some Cons: -Progression may surprise new players of this game format -Late game fights are very, very dangerous which may discourage inexperienced players from finishing the game. -Bleed is broken lmao -No quest tracker but knowing this is FromSoft, that's a given."
Positive,"My feelings on this game are a little complicated, but as i'm recommending the game in this review, I want to be clear: this game is fun as hell. I am very experienced with the current era of Fromsoft games, you can check my profile if you need proof. - I have 147 hours, 2 completed save files, and one that is partway through the game. I have played with various playstyles and tools, and completed different content on each run. This game is unbelievably open. I was shocked at the amount of content you can access without fighting a single boss, and by only fighting one boss you can access 7 separate distinct areas. There is also an ungodly amount of things in said areas, more than I have been able to fully explore across 3 characters and 147 hours. I found myself spreading out quest lines and areas across multiple characters because I truly felt overwhelmed at the sheer amount of stuff and things that I could get and do. - The game is gorgeous. When I saw real and diverse colors in a fromsoft game I was somewhat stunned. They began to experiment with color palates in Sekiro, but this game has such a distinct style that it can feel sometimes as if you are playing a painting.- Exploration can be a real joy. There always feels as though there is something around every corner. Rewards are often generous and most things you can find are useful and interesting (with the exception of the fucking mushrooms). So many diverse enemies, locales, and methods of dispatching them.My gripes with this game are fairly focused, but I feel they are pretty significant.- I am honestly fairly disappointed in many of the character story lines in this game. This is something I attribute to the massive scale and ""non-linear"" nature of elden ring. Quests are your classic obscure nonsense, but no longer does the work you have to do to progress quests bring you closer to the characters involved. Many quests in elden ring feel like a checklist of locations to visit, and then someone dies. This is not universally true: Iron Fist Alexander, Ranni and her cohort, Gideon Ofnir, Hewg, and Rodericka are all fairly well realized characters, with lengthy and interesting character arcs that you can pursue fairly organically. Of course this point is heavily subjective, but my tether to the stories of ""Soulsborne"" games has always been the characters, and many of them feel directionless, forgettable, and have no real end point of growth. Some of the quest lines still feel bugged, and if they are not then I am fucking baffled that they conclude the way they do. Fromsoft has put out a patch wherein they completed certain broken quests, and I am hoping they put out another soon.- Many bosses no longer feel like a puzzle, where you are rewarded for learning enemy patterns with windows of time to exploit them. This is my most unfortunate issue, many boss fights feel like a check to see how many times you can survive trading hits with your foe, because punish windows are relegated to 1-2 moves, and or are too small to get more than a single quick hit off. They don't necessarily feel more or less challenging than previous games, but the rhythm of combat feels off. This is the first time I have actively taken advantage of cheesing bosses whenever I could because I felt no drive to ""git gud"". This is an issue that only applies to Bosses and certain minibosses, the combat rhythm has been maintained almost perfectly in normal enemies, which is frankly bizarre to me. - Now that I have completed multiple play through, both with very very different paths of progression, I can safely say that after Leyendell the game begins to feel like a slog. I am not sure why this is exactly, but I have twice now felt the same sort of dread when I reach a certain point in the game where I feel as though progression is a chore.- Multiplayer is only halfway functional, and the direction they have taken with it deeply saddens me. The removal of covenants and the simplification of the multiplayer experience into ""red man bad, gold man good"" is really disappointing. The constant connection issues and multiplayer glitches are of course, immensely frustrating,  but I truly find myself more sad at the fact that the most unique multiplayer systems in any game I have come across have been so thoroughly gutted. I understand the reasons for removing solo invasions, even though I heavily disagree with them and wish they would allow for solo invasions in legacy dungeons at the bare minimum. The removal of the covenant system though simply confuses me, ***SPOILERS AHEAD, TURN BACK NOW*** I have no idea why the bosses Fia's Champions are not other players, and the same goes for the npc invaders the defenders of the great jar. Having a jar covenant that allows players to enter the great jar's service and judge the worth of other players sounds absolutely amazing, and of course if none are available then NPC invaders should be provided. Fromsoft has already accomplished this same feat via Area based covenants like the defenders of the bell, or farron watchdogs, or aldrich's faithful. The rewards for invasions on both sides are also incredibly disappointing. No covenants means that your rewards for engaging in multiplayer are 1. A pittance of runes 2. A furlcalling finger remedy and 3. (only for invaders) a rune arc. No more weapons, spells, or anything linked to your performance. I am just so sad and confused by this sweeping changeAll in all, this game is really a unique experience, and one I am glad to have. If you like dark souls 2, you will love this game, if you like 1 and 3 you will probably like this game. If you were a Aldrich faithful pvp grinder, this may not be the game for you. It's hard not to recommend this game, because if you like the dodge and hit based combat of the dark souls series, and exploration and adventure, this game will probably speak to you"
Positive,"The perfect game for those who like to spend their evenings getting repeatedly pummeled into submission. If you're into BDSM, then this game will have you moaning.From the very beginning, Elden Ring will whip you into shape, throwing you into a world full of sadistiic enemies and punishing gameplay. Every corner you turn is like a new level of torture, a new level of submission to your gaming overlords.But don't worry because the pain is worth it. There's nothing more satisfying than finally defeating that boss that's been spanking you for hours. And when you do, you'll feel likea real badass!Elden Ring is also full of surprises, just like a good dominatrix. You never know what's coming next, and every new challenge is like a new way to be punished.The graphics are gorgeous, and the soundtrack will have you begging for more. But let's be honest, you're not here for the aesthetics. You're here to be put in your place, to be dominated by a game that knows no mercy.It's no wonder that Elden Ring has been hailed as the game of the year. It's a true work of sadomasochistic art. The unforgiving difficulty, the punishing combat, the unpredictable challenges - it all comes together in a way that's truly amazing.Sure, you'll rage and scream and maybe even throw your controller across the room a few times. But in the end, you'll be left with a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment that few other games can provide.So if you're a true glutton for punishment, Elden Ring is the game for you. It's totally worth a buy, and it might just leave you begging for more."
Positive,"My favorite Souls game. I love it so much I threw my PS5 controller numerous times, cried like a baby and got depressed af.After platinum trophy in PS5, bought it for Steam to get the pain again!I'm masochist and I want to feel the agony again and again and satisfaction feeling when you get 100%.Must get platinum for PS4 after this torture round. 10/10 Is this a dog?"
Positive,Amazing open world and attention to details. Cleared pretty much all of the first area. On a pirated copy since license does not launch *shrug*Update: Reinstalling Steam fixed the issue. Tech support is shit though.

Positive,Ginger wolf brings grown man close to tears. 10/10.
Positive,nice game elden ring best game open world thx from software
Positive,They fixed the performance issues! I had tons off fun! Good game :)
Positive,"The best ""Souls"" game. Can't add any words. The exploration alone makes it so entertaining and drives you to find every single item and secret, mixed with the unexpected boss-slaying encounters while free-roaming. The environment is so beautiful, i cant stop myself using screenshot button :)PVP do have some problems that i hate, since it's literally copy of the Dark Souls III PVP system, which i personally not a big fan of. Its completely optional though, but just to mention."
Positive,"The hours alone should be enough to tell you what's up, but there's no denying that Elden Ring is one of the finest games that's come out this generation. Taking everything that From has learned since Dark Souls, they have diluted the formula to it's purest essence to give us something truly remarkable."
Positive,"Surprisingly enjoyable for open world Dark Souls, gameplay is a straight up improvement on previous souls games and the level design for individual locations is just as strong as previous games. I can see why some people would dislike the more open map but there's plenty to see and do hidden around if you bother looking for it. I'm convinced the only people who dislike it are people who's favela laptops can't run it or people who take HRT."
Positive,"fantastic early on while the game is still open world, but after a certain point it just devolves into a drawn out boss rush in the final quarter. Too many bossfights are re-used, and the godskin duo in particular are by far the worst bossfight ever designed in fromsoft history. However, even the genre shift at the end isn't a deal breaker, it's pretty much just the team designing what they're used to. It's a shame though that what makes elden ring unique among souls games ends with the fire giant.But at the end of the day Elden Ring is just more dark souls. People might complain that they copy-pasted some assets from older games, but that is also exactly what we dark souls fans were asking for."
Positive,Try finger but hole
Positive,"Try Finger, but whole. 10/10"
Positive,"This game is fantastic, few hiccups here and there, frame rate is very choppy in the first segment however it clears up massively afterwards. The game is absolutely gorgeous maxed out on 1440p."
Positive,Praise the Elden Ring!but Be wary of FPS drop
Positive,I try. I die. I cry.Great game.
Positive,"beautiful game inside and out that got me hooked immediately with complete immersion. Difficult fights with great hitbox detection, and the open world aspect allows you to leave a boss you are have difficulty with and come back later"
Positive,"Hello fellow Tarnished! it's time for another review and well, it's time for an Elden Ring review and it will contain heavy spoilers for the bosses. i've wanted to write this review for a very long time but i just didn't because i was pretty tired of going back to Elden Ring after i repurchased it on steam pretty much. Now for the people that didn't know, i got the physical copy of Elden Ring for the Xbox and i did put a lot of hours in that version of the game, i pretty much go as far as New Game +4 which is where i stopped playing Elden Ring. But! everything changed when i got the game on pc like a year ago, i did play like a little bit i just didn't have the strength to grind for everything i've already gotten before but i changed my mind. About one week ago i started playing again on this new save, i had a friend help me with some bosses so i could just get further in the game and then i started having fun again after a very long time. I got to Maliketh which is imo the coolest boss in the game and i told myself, ""if you wanna have fun again either git gud or leave"" and i got gud again after a year.Who Made This Masterpiece: Well this game is developed by a studio called FromSoftware which also have made all of the other souls games and are the ones that made souls game to what they are today by release Dark Souls etc. The games story which is imo amazing was written by the amazing George R.R. Martin, and the amazing open world by the incredible Hidetaka Miyazaki, i'm just gonna say that the open world in this game might be the most well made and stunning looking than any other game i've played, and this is just my opinion so don't get mad just git gud...The Bosses: Where do i even start with the bosses? first off we got the Tree Sentinel, which is legit then first thing you see when you get into the open world after seeing The grafted scion and White Mask Vare. He made so many players quit the game before they even got to play it which most of them were streamers so it was pretty damn funny to watch (*Me being stuck on margit for three days after i got the game*) Anyways the next major boss is Margit The Fell Omen, which is the false identity of a later boss you meet called Morgott the Omen King who also is the sibling of the 3rd major story boss Godrick The Grafted who you can beat in the Stormveil castle after you kill Margit.I wont be naming every single boss cause steam does have a word count of 8000 per review so let's keep going, after you beat Godrick you wont meet really strong bosses until you put some time into the game and reach Caelid where you can try to defeat Starscourge Radahn who is a story boss but is also optional so he ain't a must to kill but i recommend you try to kill him atleast on your first playthough and if you wanna get the Age of the Stars ending by following Ranni's the Witch questline. by any means are there any bosses that are easy in this game, Elden Ring was perfectly made to put you in a test where you would either try and try to proove the game wrong and tell yourself that you can do this, or simply give up. But there's no point into giving up even if life, if you don't try something how are you supposed to know that you wont succeed later.One boss though that was critisized for being the hardest boss in all of Elden Ring is without a doubt, Malenia Blade of Miquella, which is also one of my favorite bosses but not like Malekith, imo Malenia is one of the best bosses of all time in the history of gaming, she is just so sick and her entire boss is just so aesthetically pleasing which i just can't explain. Her difficulty is just different but at the time of writing this i still did manage to defeat her first try after a year still with no summons, just me.Game of The Year: Well the are a lot of reasons why Elden Ring beat God of War: Ragnarök for the GOTY award, sure GoW is an excellent game and franchise but it's limitation by only being on the Playstation and after 2 years coming to PC just puts it to risk of losing, Elden Ring doesn't really have a direct story that you need to follow no! you can level up and explore how much you'd like without the game telling you ""Meet Hanako at Embers"" after beating the game for the 99th time. Elden Ring is just a more indepth game with it's characters and open world while GoW might have next gen graphics but it still has the same mechanics as GoW 2018 so yeah, Elden Ring was just better and you know why? because FromSoftware actually showed us a product and delivered something that was even better than the advertisement itself.Verdict: Now since i played this game on Xbox before i was pretty limited to say the least when it comes to performance and quality, with the game lookin like 900p on 1440p monitor and running on 30fps. But now when i'm on PC i can atleast enjoy Elden Rings amazing graphics with Maxed out settings and capped 60fps because the game is capped at 60fps.Elden Ring Released on the 25th of February 2022 by FromSoftware Studio and developed and written by George R.R Martin and Hidetaka Miyazaki gets from me an incredible 10/10 which in other words means that it's a masterpiece of a game.Elden Ring: 10/10Shadow of the Erdtree 10/10"
Positive,"Played a bit, still struggling at Margit, The Fell Omen. Any tips?On a more serious note, the breakdown of this game from my perspective would go like this:- The game follows, now, a traditional souls formula, with a twist, like all predecessors before it, and see what ""sticks"" for the next iteration of their games. Which, I am excited and concerned at the same time. In a vacuum, Elden Ring is 8/10, maybe even 9/10, but, since we are overwhelmed with games made in a different style from this where they are catering maybe too much to the laziness of people in general and making games that require little to no effort on a players part to play the game, these kinds of games are held dear as they represent diamond in a rough. In the vast majority of the aforementioned games, everything is exposed and narrated to you, you have an objective and a big ""GO HERE FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN"", and, spoon-feeding is off the carts, you just follow directions and commands. Don't get me wrong, sometimes spoon-feeding is needed when you just want to unwind and be entertained for a while, but when a vast majority of games are like excel sheets and/or checklists, it becomes pretty tedious, pretty quickly. In relation to these mentioned things, this is a 9.5/10 game easily. Its style is different and people seem to enjoy these kinds of games more and more as the time passes and that makes me happy since these games remind me of games of old, like ""Super Mario Bros"" or ""The Legend of Kage"" for the experience they gave me a kid. And we need more games like this.- There are a lot of good things in this game, mentioned too many times over, and I MOSTLY agree with them, so I would like to focus on things I've seen people comment, on that I disagree with and/or, have my own take:1. Reuse of bosses (Erdtree avatar, in particular, Crucible Knights, sometimes even Astel), animations, mechanics from older games (Complaints from people for Beast Clergyman reused in Maliketh, the Black Blade, and similar fights I won't even mention as people complaining about it didn't pay attention)My take: Reusing of bosses is fine by me if done sparingly and for the most part, that is the case, but Erdtree Avatars are mentioned several times as well as Crucible Knights. To me, Knights are supposed to be in that number for lore reasons. If I remember correctly, there were 16 knights with Godfrey. That's it. and I don't think all are in the base game. Regarding avatars. They are supposed to be around minor Erdtrees. It makes sense. Why would you use anything else, just for the sake of it? That would be more out of place. Astel found in a random cave is a bit off, but I guess VatiVidya will explain the reason. Otherwise, I didn't mind. I really enjoy fights with him. And there are only two fully grown (the rest hanging from the ceiling are still developing I guess, so again, makes sense) I would ask for more of them personally. Animation reusing is fine, I honestly don't believe there are enough ways for the solder to swing a sword to make it unique for each game, and still be fun and sensible implement. The things I agree with are Tree Spirits bosses, and some of the other optional bosses, I was never excited to face them. But then again, they are optional, and I guess the logic was, we are not gonna find them all, but completions in us faced every single one, and on that part, I kinda agree. Also, the Margit repeating 3 times and Godefroy the Grafted in Golden Lineage Evergaol did not sit right with me. But if they are there for lore/story reasons, I'm willing to let it slide. Kind off. The ones I agree with are the imps, reused Thralls/Hollow Slaves from DS3. There could be a much more imaginative way to animate those, but we have to have the most hated enemies from previous games in ER (besides dogs, ofc) 2. Usage of double bosses (Godskin duo, in particular, Gargoyles and maybe even double knights )My take: I mentioned above that there are a lot of optional bosses and there is a chance you never see them if you don't explore (unlikely, but possible) but the way it's executed is a bit lackluster. So far, most of the duo bosses had a certain tempo to them (O&S from DS1, Sister Friede from DS3, Demon prince comes to mind) and are a real joy to fight. Godskin duo is some crossbreed between 4 kings and O&S and maybe even Abyss watches, poorly mashed together and is not a fun fight. This, however, is invalidated when you discover sleep pots/arrows or long sword. It makes the fight trivial, but still, it's not about how difficult they are, it's how they are executed. Execution complaint is the same for knights, because3. Input readingMy take: There was always input reading in souls games, but this one is just a bit too much. A small delay would maybe make this acceptable, but as is of now, it makes some enemies really annoying (using pots in Godskin and Crucible knight fights seems off by 0.5 seconds to 1 second, as the enemy is doing the ""counter"" to your move immediately before the animation starts properly) If the ""lag"" is increased it would be fine, as the enemy ""sees"" your action and acts accordingly. Regarding the extra move in the enemies' attack chain, I agree with that one completely, it's way too random and punishing without the player actually doing ""a mistake"".Things I personally didn't like are all side dungeons. The sheer number of them AND them being pretty much the same content-wise and ascetically make them a bit too much for my taste. If they are conjoined into one ""legacy dungeon"" and removed from all places, I would not mind at all. Besides that, I'm conflicted about the open world. It's a nice take and you have Torrent (best name for a horse, as a meta-joke for searching ""Elden Ring torrent"") to help you out but on the other hand, if it didn't have it, I don't think the game would lose much if anything at all in value (a majority of open-world, not torrent). but maybe it is the 3rd play-through that got me thinking this way. Other than that, stealth is clunky in a way that enemies don't notice you when they should, and sometimes completely ignores you even if you use abilities next to them. Its possible could be patched but it's a complaint at the time of writing this. My take on improving things:1. In the future would take a closer look at magic casting animations and the variety (casting a ""support"" spells like Carian Phalanx and ""offensive"" like Stars of Ruin should have different move sets, etc as well as new types of items for casting magic/incantations to complement that), 2. Maybe look at bows as something to not only complement hand-to-hand combat but to be it's equal in terms of power/usability.3. Invasions and player interactions. So far formula is kill or be killed. Adding an objective to sabotage/place traps would be an interesting approach. Don't know how well that would translate into gank squads waiting for invasion but food for thought. Gravelording with extra steps. (Spy vs. Spy game comes to mind)TL:DR : Great game, a diamond in the rough,  8.5/10"

Positive,"Öncelikle oyundaki bosslar çok fazla tekrar ediyor, bu olay beklediğim bir şeydi diğer tüm Fromsoftware oyunlarında zaten sıkça karşılaştığımız durum bu oyunda boku çıkarılmış biraz fakat çeşitlilik diğer souls oyunlarından daha fazla olduğundan dolayı beni açıkcası pek rahatsız etmedi. Unique bossları ortalama üstü, bazıları serideki en iyi bosslardan özellike Malenia tam bir orospu evladı gibi tasarlanmış ama muazzam iyi bir boss (artık o kadar fazla öldüm ki Malenia boss fightında kulağımda çınlıyor ""I am Malenia. Blade of Miquella""). Onun harici genel olarak belirttiğim gibi spesifik bir kaç boss hariç bossları bir tık ds3'ün dlclerinden aşağıda kalıyor fakat bu durumu oyun mekan tasarımlarıyla kurtarıyor. En sevdiğim kısma geldik mekan tasarımları. Oyunun mekan tasarımları muazzam tanıdığım bir kaç kişi ya oyunun mekan tasarımlarının verdiği gazla bitirdi veya bu olay sayesinde oynamaya başladı, mekan tasarımları tam fantazi dünyalarımızı süsleyecek cinste muazzam oyunun son kısımları ve Ranni kısımlarındaki Cosmos teması o kadar çok hoşuma gidiyor ki yerimde boşalıyorum. Ansel River'ın alt kısımlarındaki gökyüzündeki renk paleti adeta bana ""oooooooohhhhhhh elden ring"" dedirtiyor. Zorluk olarak ise oyun diğer souls oyunlarından yer yer daha zor fakat genel olarak daha kolay hissettiriyor özellikle Mimic Spirit ile. Özetlemek gerekirse oyunu aşırı fazla beğendim mekan tasarımları ve temaları o kadar gözümü boyadı ki sikimde değil insanların oyun hakkında overrated demeleri yarramı yiyebilirler teşekkürler.

Positive,"Amazing game, my first From Software, Souls-like game and its awesome. The difficulty is there, but sometimes its best to just move on, or just power through it, lots of guides out there, helped a ton.The aesthetics are supreme with some awesome artwork and vibes all around.Music, is positively smashing,The graphics are very good, game is very good."
Positive,Best game to play while waiting for Silksong
Positive,"I will exclusively be comparing this game to other From Software games, since many are comparing it to other open world games and I find that to be a somewhat fruitless comparison. I have played and beaten every From games since DeS, so I'd like to think I'm a veteran of the series.Improvements over past From games:- Lots of QoL features (stamina doesn't drain unless you're in combat, boss runs have been eliminated, change weapon affinities at any time for free, etc). Removes the more tedious parts of past games.- Not counting Sekiro since that was a totally different combat model, the Souls combat is at its best here. Feels much like DS3 in terms of your character movements, but with many more options.- Brought back power stancing- Ridiculous amount of unique weapons, weapon arts, spells, etc, making tons of fun builds- Legacy dungeons and lots of optional areas are really cool and can have fantastic level design.- Questing is the best the series has ever had. Still cryptic, but you can generally figure it out without a wiki and the quest lines have major investment.- Brings something new to the table with ideas such as Flask of Wondrous Physick and Ashes of War.Things that are worse than past From games:- IMO, the open world is much too large and empty. Yes, there are lots of items to find scattered everywhere, but most of the world is kinda empty and you just ride your horse and press Y to gather all items and move on. I spent way more time riding my horse than I would have liked. I'm confident that they could have shrunk the overworld parts of the game by 50% and the game would have been a tighter experience, without spreading the really good content too far apart. NOTE: I know there are lots of ruins, caves, and catacombs to find, but....- Copy-paste. All the ruins are copy-paste, the catacombs are very copy-paste, the caves are very copy-paste...all the bosses within those mentioned areas are copy-paste. Again, this seems to be an issue with the scale of the game, and if these areas were reduced by 50%, the game would have been a tighter experience. At one point, you fight the same two bosses for the third time, but you fight them twice in a row. That's just lazy.- Enemy behavior and damage are whack. Lots of end-game bosses move as if you're playing Sekiro or Bloodborne, endless stamina with no pauses, one-hit kills attacks and endless AOE spam. From games always felt fair because you abode by the same rules as the boss, but not in this game. Lots of enemies actually read your inputs, making for super frustrating fights since again, you can't literally read the enemy's mind but they can do it to you. If the game let you move and attack faster, it might feel more balanced, but the ridiculous amount of damage late-game bosses do is unreasonable. Like, 45 Vigor, full Dung Eater armor, Dragoncrest Greatshield talisman, still getting two shot by most boss attacks. It's a bit much and makes certain builds all but impossible to use late game.I believe this issue exists because the game expects you to use....- Summons. Summons are a cool addition to the game but unfortunately they are WAY too strong. The balance of certain fights is so skewed in the bosses favor that you will pull your hair out if you don't summon. Summons are so strong however, that using the summon takes the fight from extreme difficulty to almost no challenge. I feel this really killed a lot of the thrill of the game for me. I don't have a lot of time to play, else maybe I would've tried to do a no-summon run like I did for all other From games, but this seems to be an issue many have with the summons. It's either get whooped by a boss that doesn't abide by the same rules as you, or use a summons and slash their back till their dead. For this reason, I think summons should be nerfed a ton to help give you an upper hand for a few minutes tops, not infinitely. Some summons are literally stronger and tankier than summoning another human player. Yes, I know I don't have to use them, but again it's a tool the game gives you and is literally balanced around in many cases. I could also play the game as level 1 naked if I wanted, doesn't mean it will be fun.- Not a huge deal, but weapon balancing is kinda bad right now, and spell balancing is even worse. Starting spell is one of the best spells in the game, so playing as a sorcerer is wholly unexciting as you discover new spells are very weak. Some weapon arts are a bit too strong, making a lot of the game a cheesecake. Again, not a big deal, since there's tons of variety and other viable options, but they should take a pass at sorcery balancing at least to keep it interesting.That's it. Even with flaws, still a great game."
Positive,"I'll summarize it:It's good.Yeah, that's about it."
Positive,Never had so much fun exploring
Positive,"Elden Ring is FROM's latest culmination of all their past works. Short ds2 levels scattered across the map, Sekiro's sneaking and posture mechanics, Ds3's beautiful scenery and bosses, Bloodborne's weapon creativity, its all there and it works. Aside from the issues of optimization and stuttering in the horrid PC port, Elden Ring will surely live up to all the hype everyone was been waiting so long for."
Positive,One of the best games i've ever played.
Positive,final boss likely dog 10/10

Positive,"Starting this review by saying: DO NOT BUY THE DELUXE EDITION. IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY (Extra $20 for a soundtrack that you can listen to for free). If you want to support the devs, buy the older souls games, they're amazing games even without the servers for multiplayer. This is easily the most accessible, and oddly the most challenging souls game made.I got into the series a little after Dark Souls released and was *playable* on PC. I fell in love with the gameplay and the unique way of telling a story only through item descriptions and out of the way dialogue. From the moment I picked up the game I was hooked. I played all 3 of the souls games and bloodbourne, but I was never able to get my hands on demon souls or Sekiro. Either way I think its fair to say I've played enough to know what I like and dislike about the series.Elden ring starts off with a small tutorial fight, which you will probably lose and move on into the proper tutorial. After this- the game just does regular souls things. No railroad, no clear location in mind. If you like a challenge the critical path is a brutal, but fair, journey into an amazing world. If you, on the other hand, dont want to be stuck or feel like you're ""slamming your head into the wall"" then you can explore, and just completely ignore the critical path. There are so many things to do- dungeons, over-world bosses, Night-time only bosses, Mini 1 room boss ""dungeons"" called evergaols. There is so much to do, and its all so accessible from the start, it can feel overwhelming deciding where to begin and where to end up. Ultimately, no matter which path you take, you get to just experience the world that Miyazaki and George R.R. Martin collectively created. This of course, does not mean the game doesn't have flaws.A staple in souls games is, sadly, garbage multiplayer and bugs that get fixed by the community. Its never this bad, but from launch there are connection errors frequently, multiple crashes and or freezes, a capped framerate (At least this time its capped at 60 and not 30) and many issues that really should have been handled with their beta tests and stress tests. Despite this, the game does run very well IF you adjust your settings.Ultimately, for me, the games pros heavily outweigh the few cons (which only really affect multiplayer 95% of the time). I hope that as this games lifecycle continues, they iron out the rough edges and bugs, and I already can not wait to see what they will bring with the DLC content.As a final note, if you never enjoyed any of the previous souls games- then this game probably isnt for you. Nothing has changed in the core formula. If you want this game to be something else, then just buy something else."
Positive,"I suck at this game but this is my first souls-like game ever( unless you want to count Jedi Fallen Order) and I am liking it so far. Leveling up is key and unless you're some sort of god, explore the world before taking on bosses."
Positive,"Even while working on Sekiro as a side-project, FromSoft's A-team (Miyazaki and crew) have somehow delivered Dark Souls 4, 5 and 6 all in one staggeringly enormous game.Thirty hours in and I've completed one region. Out of at least six that I'm aware of, and that's with minimal deaths."

Positive,"I had a wonderful time and it's probably one of the best adventure game out there. Good content, gameplay and atmosphere, and with the build has a lot of replay value.It's not without flaws though :- Obvious intense asset reuse with bosses. Can also lead to some silly situations.- Lack of reward after a while in the overworld dungeons. Doing a whole dungeon to find a new ash summon is getting old.- A bit too long for its own sake due to above issues. I had kind of a ""It's finally over"" feeling when finishing it. I had very much of my fill of the game, and by the time you leave a certain place, the game pretty much already offered everything it had in stock.- Quest tracking is pretty much non-existent, but I'm very sure that's by design."

Positive,"With more than a thousand hours across all souls titles on all platforms this is unquestionably the best title Fromsoft has ever released.Keeping myself blind to any marketing and online spoilers from the community i didn't know what to expect from this game except that it was a ""souls"" game that i was excited for. After putting in more than fifty hours of play I've come to realize that it would be an insult to consider this a souls game as the scope and ambition far exceeds any of which I've played previously. The First notable change was that it was a true open world unlike the segmented areas of the previous games which was amazing to me and also a bit worrying, worries of a lack luster open world with only sparse content strewn about. My worries were unfounded as everywhere i looked there was Groups of enemies to fight, npcs to talk to and receive quests from, ruins to explore, items to gather, items to collect, unique dungeons to explore, and one of a kind bosses to challenge. All this open world content to experience coupled with a beautiful weather system and day and night cycle. Though i cannot i speak much for the story as I've not experienced everything the main story has to offer and i feel sure I'm not even close to finished, from what i have experienced its just as intriguing and mysterious as the games before if not more so with just enough fed to you to keep you hooked. The Gameplay Is Just as tight as ever with alot of the foundation still there that veterans will remember  With mechanics that are taken from all of the previous titles that are blended seamlessly together with a level of polish that really raises the bar for combat in soulslike games. On top of all this there is a host of new mechanics such as the flask of wonderous physick that lets you create your own consumable that can have any combination of buff, healing or offensive capability. With the addition of another new mechanic that is summons you can call spirits to fight for you if you play alone if you need that extra bit to help you through a hard situation which can range from from wolves, soldiers, knights, archers, and eagles just to name a few. to give this game a rating and how it appears to me i would give a 11/10 as it truly blew me away and of course has my recommendation. i urge that everyone that is hesitating from the harsh criticism that the game received to give it a try as you will find that it is in my opinion overplayed and the game truly deserving of your time and money."
Positive,dark souls 3 but open world
Positive,fight the first guy you see with the flowers and get wrecked.
Positive,I also dedicate this review to my orthodox rabbi Bill Clinton!
Positive,"50 hours in, and i finally realized how to summon my spirit ashes.10/10Goty"
Positive,"All achievements, but still....No maidens"
Positive,"I am absolutely convinced, this game is a masterpiece of art and belongs in the list of the seven digital world wonders."
Positive,"First off, Elden Ring!"
Positive,I want malenia to sit on my face
Positive,Dont give up! Skeleton!
Positive,"For fans of the Dark Souls franchise, this is truly a nice game. Boss fights are amazing, scenery is great and even the lore is interesting. Controls feel very natural, even for somebody like me thats always been using keyboard and mouse - I do recommend using a controller for this game. It's still a console port after all.Personally, it's not for me after giving it some tries. But that doesn't mean I won't recommend the game or complain that it is too difficult - because its not a difficult game if you put either enough time in it, or are amazing at analyzing the patterns. I've seen friends do amazing things, run around with a level 1 wretched and taking down bosses as if they didn't even matter.If you like that kind of challenge, it seems everything is possible - go give it a try!But if you want to buy the game for the story and don't want to spend hours on trying to gather materials, fight bosses and keep trying until you succeed -- if you don't get that rush of endorphins after finally defeating the boss and are left with a feeling of frustration, this is not your game."
Positive,"YOU KNOW THE DOOT DOOT DOOTDOO PART IN FLY LIKE AN EAGLE WELL YOU CAN DO THAT WITH AN ATTACK AND IT HAS RAINBOW BUBBLES, WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT"
Positive,Best game of all time. 4 out of 5 stars
Positive,Easy GOTY 2022Edit: Still GOTY 2022
Positive,i like black men
Positive,It's a good game with plenty of viable combat options.
Positive,"What a great game, if you like Soulslike games you will like this game. I just beat it after 80+ hours but I am ready for my next playthrough."
Positive,"I'll try to make it short -> The PVE part of this game is nothing less than a masterpiece. Even though i dont agree with every change they made to the souls-series to get new people in. So if you like those games, or want to finally get into them -> go ahead, it's great.That being said....the PVP part needs some serious work. - The game is full of REALLY powerful weapon arts and spells. having some things overtuned and fighting people who are stricktly sticking to the meta is nothing new, but this time it feels worse than ever before.- Phantom-scaling feels close to non existent. I'm constantly fighting golden phantoms that are lvl 100+ if not 200+ (they tank 10 hits of a collossal greatsword while being able to take 60-80% of the invaders life with one attack even at 40 vigor on lvl 60 for example)- i wondered why i didnt get invaded once during my first playthrough. its because you can only invade coop players now. And thats bad for everyone. (taunters tongue is not an option because it creates an endless stream of invaders and no natural environment of random encounters - so it's more of a dueling item)(I like being invaded, but no one can invade me /// people who summon phantoms because they need help, don't like to get invaded, but they are getting invaded instantly)- all the above results in invaders having to fight 1v3 vs 100+ levels higher metaslaves most of the timeSo if you are like me and love the series because of pvp....you're likely already putting hours upon hours into this game, but if not ....well.....you might want to wait for some big patches. I'm sure they'll fix it, but pvp is in a very bad place right now, even though the fundamentals of the combat are so much greater than ever before."
Positive,Game is built on what makes the souls series stand out. Its nicely adapted to an open world setting that is refreshing. 10/10
Positive,"Oh, I played for 69 hours.  Time to thumbs-up I guess.This game is an open world game to end open world games.  Puts western AAA titles to shame.  You're not running a ring around an island to clear out enemy camps or collect things, you're just picking a direction and reacting to the actual content FromSoftware put in that nook of the map.People have been saying ""oh this is just Dark Souls with jumping and open world.""  They wouldn't be wrong, but the way the concept has been implemented is anything but lazy.  All the typical trappings of a FromSoft title are here.  You get a brief tutorial that teaches you the basics, and then immediately get dumped into a world that is fully prepared to suckerpunch you for getting complacent.  That being said, the difficult is truly adjustable in a way that is more wholesome and integrated than some kind of menu setting.  If a fight is more difficult, you can choose to either persevere or come back when you're stronger.I have been playing this game for a long time, and while I may have uncovered a little more than half of the map (by my estimation), I doubt I've experienced even half of the content crammed into the world.  The critical path can be very short if you're doing a speed run, however Elden Ring is a game meant to be savored, and for once the devs have put in the effort to make it an consistently enjoyable experience instead of a grind."
Positive,What a masterpiece!
Positive,You may notice some bloodstains around the world. Those are from me.
Positive,"Better than all of the others so far. Very very highly recommended!*There are performance issues right now, but they are sure to be fixed sooner or later."
Positive,"Elden Ring: It's not just a game, it's a lifestyle. A lifestyle of dying repeatedly, but with a smile on your face (and tears in your eyes)."
Positive,"One of the best games I've ever played, such a great game and a modern classic. I feel this game will be talked about for years to come. From Soft once again has done a fantastic job and this is their best game yet."
Positive,Easily one of the greatest games i have ever played. Im trying to forget it so i can experience it all over again. GOTY 2022 hand's down.
Positive,"If you love dark souls, you'll fit right in.  There is nothing entirely unexpected from this game.I understand people expect a game like this to be perfect when it comes out in terms of performance.  I haven't had any crashes, I haven't had any lagging or frame drops at all and I don't even have a monster PC.  Not sure what all the 'mixed' fuss is about."

Positive,"This was not a game, it was an EXPERIENCE."
Positive,"I'm a slimy little goblin baby and since this game makes you fight a similar enemy sometimes I'm giving it a negative reviewdouble u tee ef FromSoft, you dirty measly nerds, you need a lien on your homes and forced castration for creating this video gameBosses with endless repeatable combos that kill you? Really? Don't you know your audience? We're a bunch of depressed gamer's who need instant gratification and something completely novel from every game we've ever played or else our land lord comes into our apartment and slaps us roughly on the taint reminding us of our unfulfilled potential EVERY SINGLE TIMEalso there were some stuttering issues that caused me to die once and it immediately triggered memories of how I love eating feces10/10 can't stop playing"
Positive,"Beautiful, immersive, frustrating, and gratifying. The first AAA title I've purchased in years that feels like it's actually worth the AAA price tag. This is my first experience playing a From Software game, and if you're in the same boat I recommend looking into the types of games they make. You will be riding high from an achievement in this game only to get immediately (and brutally) smacked down again. It can be frustrating, but the game rewards patience. The multiplayer is an absolute blast, although definitely a bit janky. Sometimes the control and camera can bit a bit clunky as well, but overall these are minor issues compared to how much I'm enjoying this game. There are many, many hours of gameplay here."
Positive,big pp game
Positive,I like it a lot
Positive,so far the game is amazing except... the potential memory leakage and locked to 60fps
Positive,Ohhhhh. Elden Ring.
Positive,"Try fingers, but hole"
Positive,Open world Souls with extremely dense and detailed world.Essential to anyone's collection.9.1/10
Positive,Like life? After this game you wont.
Positive,"fingers, but hole"
Positive,"try, fingersbut, hole."
Positive,"After all Elden Ring didn't pass replayability check. That said, Dark Souls 3 remains the best Soulsborne game.I wrote 10 000 characters long review of this game, but Steam doesn't allow me posting such a long review."
Positive,if you use mimic tear i hope your family succumbs to scarlet rot
Positive,BUY THIS FUCKING GAME NOW
Positive,"Release week has lots of performance issues partially due to it being a direct console port, lots of settings that you are unable to turn off that I would really enjoy turning off like vsync.Easy anti cheat causes lots of issues that I hope they can fix.Actual game is really enjoyable, despite the open world base, item crafting doesn't feel super annoying yet and there's a dense enough population of enemies  (honestly could be more dense) that there is usually something you want to do.This review was done at 7 hrs of gameplay"
Positive,This is my first souls-like game and I'm absolutely loving it. I was intimidated by the unforgiving nature of it at the start (that first mounted NPC is ridiculous). But once I realized the amount of optionality I have during play it completely freed up the game for me. Combat is incredible - level design is top notch - narrative writing and VO is incredible. One of the best games I've ever played.
Positive,The only souls game i've actually been able to commit myself to.  I appreciate that if you run into a boss or fight that's too difficult you can just leave and farm somewhere else until you're stronger.
Positive,haven't felt this absorbed into a game since oblivion
Positive,Elder Souls of the Wild10/10
Positive,"This is the second platform i have bought this game for, ITS THAT GOODThe first time i played this game was when i got this for Christmas and the only thing i knew was that it won game of the year. (I didn't even know it was a soulslike lol) I went in completely blind and for anyone who still doesnt know anything about this game, PLEASE DONT LOOK ANYTHING UP JUST TRUST ME ON THIS. This game is one of the best journeys i went through, and even though the game kicked my ass multiple times there will be no feeling better than finally killing the hard boss you have been stuck on for a long time.TL;DRI can't recommend this masterpiece of an game enough and nothing will feel better than finally overcoming the challenge you have been struggling with for hours. This game is a MUST PLAY."
Positive,"Even with all the hype train going on.. Exceeded expectations.Combat is fun and rewarding.Exploration is fun and rewarding.The game remains challenging even as you gain a lot of power and progress through the story. You'll reach a point you think you're getting very powerful and go to a new area and get humbled pretty quickly.My only complaint is that gear or spell progression for some classes does not feel as rewarding as other ones. Some classes don't really get any gear or spells worth swapping out your starter stuff out for for quite a while.Other than that thumbs up. Easily 8-9/10, best game I've played in years."
Positive,"I have... alot to say about this game.I feel as if it's definetly front loaded with content. This meaning all the good crap will be in your first 10-20 hours.It then takes a steep nose dive around mid to late game. bosses start getting reused. (Even as special enemies in areas), they start input reading alot more, you face constant ""giant"" bosses whose moves you can hardly read as they're hard off screen..it says alot when almost every enemy in game is weak to ""blood loss"" one of the most OP status effects in game.This game has... made me rage alot.IT's made me laugh alotit's brought me alot of excitement and joy..but the endgame definetly gave me alot of moments that robbed me of that and frustrated me to the point of calling in co-op partners or just wanting it done, rather than doing it 200+ times over and being satisfied finally winning, as a souls like should be.However, i appreciate the start of my journey. the first experience of calied.. the rages fails and successes.and for being the first souls like i took seriously that now has got me addicted to the genre.should you play it? yes. definetly. just be aware, that enemies start to get reused, areas start having less ""relevant"" new enemies. and bosses are rused.. way more than they should be.it however is a good open world game for making a plan, getting distracted by an event or other sights you find and wasting your days away.It just isnt... a masterpiece as everyone makes it out to be."
Positive,Hidden wallThrusting required
Positive,first souls like game ever. spent 200+ on playstation before double dipping on pc. The game is absolutely great
Positive,"easiest game of my life, 10/10"
Positive,Before I played this game I was gay and liked men. Nothing has changed but this game is good.
Positive,Best Game OAT!
Positive,There is a severe lack of rings in this game. I counted like 4. I am only recommending it because there are a lot of old and homeless people in the game.
Positive,There is no reason to downvote this game for any reason other than you’re bad at it.
Positive,"This game is a masterpiece af, but it has one major drawback. Even in this game I'm maidenless"
Positive,I smashed my PC because of this game. That means I can finaly go out and touch some grass. Masterpiece.
Positive,- Start game- View customization options - Debate on whether to make a genuinely good looking character or a monstrous monstrosity- Finish making character an hour later- Get called maidenless by a rando
Positive,oh my god
Positive,"I had this review set to negative due to no ultrawide support, but, it just feels wrong to let this masterpiece stay as a negative review.I've been playing video games for the past 25 years, so I have a few hundred games under my belt.I can safely say, without a shadow of a doubt, that Elden Ring is, for me, the best game of all time, no other video game ever came this close, I laughed, I cried and above all I had a lot of fun, my first playthrough took me 130 hours exploring as much as I could without googling anything.Thank you Fromsoftware."
Positive,Transverse the dangerous and poisonous lands of a desolated place. Where monstrosities lay around every corner and technology has regressed to medieval times and magic flows. Brace the mists of fate and enter the unforgiving lands of Ohio.

Positive,is so good
Positive,"Run around, kill, die, repeat."
Positive,"""Yeah I'm just finishing up here and going to bed soon, for sure. It's pretty dang late.""*cut to closing the game 2 hours later*"
Positive,"Its a great game. Mechanically better than any souls game and has a far wider range of possible play styles. While the open world is nice, it does wear thin at times due to the near obsessive combing players will undertake to find all the goodies. While the open world does have its moments with grand zones, a lot of it can feel samey and a chore."
Positive,"I'm not a open world game person, but damn I enjoyed exploring every bit of Elden Ring's world. It's very beautiful, thrilling, exciting and immersive experience. For the first half of the game, it's perfect. On the second half, I felt a little bit overwhelmed and tired, just wanted to end the game. But still, it's 10/10 game of the year material, experience."
Positive,"Incredible game but terrible PC port as of review.60fps capNo UW supportConstant stutteringI know I shouldve expected this much from FROMSOFT, but I was hoping they would take care of their massive PC audience finally. It's 2022 and we should expect more.Review Edit: I will be changing my No to a Yes. While these things remain true at the time of my update, this game is incredible and if you're ok with doing fan fixes for these issues and suffering some performance issues, please get the game. Or at least look for an update/sale."
Positive,"This is quite possibly the best single-player game I've played in the past decade. People calling it the next Skyrim is truly an understatement. I'm already planning my second character while doing my first run ""this dagger will be good when I start as a bandit, but..."" and of course one game i have to start as a wretch!The first major dungeon is SO hugely epicly massively gigantic that I can't even put it into words (see, I tried, all those adjectives, didn't work). I've never seen anything like it in ANY game before. Granted, this is my first Souls game, but if this is what Souls games are like, then I've been missing out!So take my opinion with a grain of slat. There are hundreds (thousands?) of opinions here. Not sure anyone will read or care about mine, but if you do, buy this damn game, throw your money at the devs because they worked HARD to make this thing a freakin masterpiece.No game has made me feel this rush of adrenaline, sense of accomplishment, and constant anticipation in a long, long, long, time and i'm 33 years old, been gaming for over 20 years. I literally can't even type anymore right now, gotta get back to the game..."
Positive,"I hate this game, I love this game.After my mega souls-fan of a wife got me to beat DS3 & Bloodborne, I found a new respect for From Soft games. Yet still was on the fence & wasn’t for me. That is until I truly sat down for good with my crackhead mentality & experienced ELDEN RING & “tried finger but-hole.”Seriously this game is the definition of EPIC! My wife, friends, & I are having such a blast. We now can’t hangout daily or events without someone uttering something Elden Ring-related. Even our cats are taken aback by Elden Ring in the household. From the bosses to the nostalgic Elder Scrolls & Zelda-like open world had me hooked blended the perfected mesh of all previous games they’ve done. This isn’t just a game. It’s the next step in the evolution of making games."

Positive,When the Ring is Elden.
Positive,"Fun unga bunga simulator that allows you to shoot spells or swing a katana for a little bit, until you devolve back into a caveman because big hammer make brain happy"
Positive,"This game is like Dark Souls 4, 5, and 6 ""rolled"" (pun pun pun) into one. If you like Souls games and open world, you will love Elden Ring."
Positive,still the best game ever made
Positive,I like it.
Positive,"Squeezed, smeared and flicked, dripped and encrusted, blurred, jabbed and stippled, oleaginously liquid, scraped back to the dry canvas – sometimes all in one work – the gestural effects are always openly declared. George R. R. Martin and Hidetaka Miyazaki are designers of excess. They take the soulsborne genre, morph, distort and cannibalise its elements, push it to the limits, politicise it, but always create a beautiful game. 10/10"
Positive,"I know a lot of people are having issues but I for one have had little to no problems and I have a Ryzen 5 3600 and a GTX 1660 super. I’m not sure if people are nitpicking frame drops from 60 to 40? Maybe it doesn’t really bother me and I’m used to it. PC users would rate Bloodborne negative if they could. I got used to playing my souls games at 30 fps. I’ve had a few stutters but nothing that isn’t normal for a new open world game. The people freaking out, I truly don’t understand why you would give a negative review unless it is something unbearable. But whatever. My review… The greatest game of all time. 30 hours spent in just Limgrave alone. On to Raya Lucaria. I have never loved a game so much."
Positive,"Best open world game I've played, period. Combines that hard-as-nails Dark Souls experience with an open world that keeps on giving you surprises and options every moment, in every direction. You rarely feel 'stuck' or forced to keep banging your head on some wall, relieving one of the biggest pain points of a frustrating genre. Tons of tools available to help players find their own 'easy mode' if things are too tough to just play it straightforward.The variety is staggering, everything's shockingly well put together, aside from some performance issues it's frankly a masterpiece. This is a game I'd recommend even to someone who might not think they can stomach the difficulty. Dark Souls made a lot of converts over the years, and Elden Ring makes that formula more accessible, fun and inviting than ever. I couldn't put it down for the 100+ hours it took to complete (being somewhat thorough, not really beelining for the end), and if I let myself indulge further, I'm sure there's another 50+ hours of new content in there, easily. And none of it ever felt rote, or truly predictable."
Positive,"After rolling credits I have only one question, how is this game even possible? I mean, how did the director go to the publisher and say “I want to make a game 5 times bigger than Dark Souls 3, and not charge a cent more for the product.” What genius had the foresight to know this was going to be a great idea, and become a huge blockbuster? Buy it now before they realize what they've done!Nominated for 2022 GOTY!"

Positive,"My first game from FromSoftware and it was 10 out of 10 for the whole time playing for a little over 200 hours. Quest system is garbage though. > Artstyle is excellent and creates beautiful immersive world that drives you in, to explore every square meter.> You get to fight epic and memorable enemies. Crucible Knight — one love.> Combat is challenging and feels rewarding once you are victorious. With many opportunities for your own creativity and play style. Some enemies are easier to beat with specific equipment, but you always can adapt to use what you have and like.> Many opportunities to adjust your character. After all you feel attached to your creation and interested to beat the game your way.> You get opportunities to create your own exploits and experiments.> FASHIONSOULS. You don’t need the best stats, but you are obliged by your own mind to look gorgeous.UI and key bindings (for mouse and keyboard) could have been better. Maybe that was an intentional decision to create a specific experience. But you explore one of the best looking game worlds today and as soon as you have to interact with any UI you are immediately teleported to medieval times of interface design. Think of driving Rolls-Royce but with pedals."
Positive,"I wanted to give this game a negative review in 2022. I was one of the unlucky owners of a 3090, who was forced to play on PS5 because the game did nothing but stutter (even after applying fixes and following advice from the community). Alas, it's 2023 and I upgraded my GPU to a 4080. The game no longer stutters. Maybe there was a patch that fixed it between playthroughs, maybe it was the GPU. Who knows, who cares; water under the bridge.The game is a lot of fun. Hmmm, a strange concept for a game, no? Allow me to explain: This is the very first open world game where I've wanted to explore EVERYTHING and have actively tried to do so. The bosses are challenging, or outright evil if you're under-leveled. It's just fun to run around, kill enemies, bosses, randoms, etc.The mechanics of the game took me a while to get used to, coming from playing Dark Souls: Remastered. However, the game's mechanics came into their own once I stopped trying to force Elden Ring to be Dark Souls. Jumping made sense. Stealth made sense. It's all well implemented and very fun! The one thing I'm still struggling with is parrying.When I say graphics, I don't mean how realistic it looks. Rather, I'm talking about the lighting, shadowing, and colors used. It's very bright and beautiful.My current playthrough has been mostly co-op. I bought the game for a friend so I could have someone to game with. That was a super great decision. We've both been addicted to the game and are almost ready for NG+! When you're playing co-op, you're forced into lobbies available to be invaded by other players. At first we found this to be annoying, but now we can't wait to be invaded. We laugh super hard at the crazy interactions we have with people.""Liar ahead."" Well, no- the community has been quite on point. Even the people invading have been very graceful when they have beaten us. The messages left for us to read have been incredibly helpful and have only enhanced the gameplay experience.My initial review was a 9.5 out of 10. So, the bads can't be that bad, right? Eh.Even though the experience playing with people is great, the crashes are not. I've crashed multiple times when joining players or them trying to join me.I get this is open world and all, but my very first playthrough had me completely lost. Moreover, I've been using a guide to get me from A to B the entire way. Some things just aren't intuitive.Get this game. Play it. But more importantly, play it with friends. It only becomes more fun when playing with friends. That isn't to say you shouldn't play the game if you don't have friends, because you can ask randos to play with you -- and they will! Everyone has been super excellent and a joy to play with. Again, don't question the full price: It's worth every penny."

Positive,"Open world Dark Souls. PROS:- Perfect gameplay- Great, deep lore- Huge enemy/boss variety- Tons of content- Gorgeous graphics- Extremely original & cool designs- Lovely music- Tons of different builds- Fun multiplayer (both coop and pvp)- I doubt you could even imagine it...CONS:- Game isn't well-optimized. On 3700x Ryzen and gtx1070 I get occasional frame drops when in open world that last a couple of seconds, but nothing drastic.TLDR: The game is everything you hoped for if you're a Dark Souls fan. If you're not, go play Ass Creed or some other piece of garbage and F off."

Positive,"I played about 60 hours of the normal game and made no progress. Not really gud at soul like games, but the lore and story of this game had me wanting to keep playing. With the Seemless mod this game is so much more fun and manageable to play. I am thoroughly enjoying the game now and able to take down bosses with friends. I very much recommend giving it a try. The characters and exploration of the world are captivating and intriguing . I am sorry if this goes against the hard core soul gamers but I really am happy I can get to experience this world."

Positive,"Was exploring and found a corpse with a message at the rear that said ""Rump ahead Time for fingers""10/10"
Positive,"Try fingerbut wholeThis game somehow nails the good aspect of open world and combines it with the soulsbornes mechanics and style of play.The lack of a simple journal to let the player track which NPC quest is where or at least a general sense of where to go. If you don't enjoy souls games, at least try Elden Ring with the open world aspectIf you enjoy souls games, I don't need to tell you why this game is amazing"
Positive,"This was my first souls-like game and I was a complete noob. Now after 6 months of playing it, slaying all bosses that were available I really feel proud and a little sad since this period of my life is now over. It was really hard, I never had such a challenge in my gaming career, around 300 tries on Malenia, and multiple hundreds on the late game friends. I don't regret playing the biggest part of the game using sward damage without magic or summoning spirits/npc. The feeling you get after slaying late game bosses with your bear hands (sword), after multiple hours of trying, this feeling is something I've never experienced before and I thank the developers of this game for that. It was a really hard journey, but it was worth it"
Positive,Beat the game in 200 hours and also I helped some people defeat radagon and the Elden beast. recommend if you have played souls games. Some people have been giving shitty reviews ignore em they don’t know what they are talking about :D
Positive,"This game runs in a GTX1050ti just fine.This is my current graphics card, a Gtx 1050 ti oc, and I can play the game at a playable level, it runs just as expected with all the new modern games.Currently I am playing in medium settings and having consistent 40-50fps in exteriors and 60 fps interiors. This is my third souls like games but I never had played one from the OG from software, right now Im loving it. It is so entretaining."
Positive,its definitely the best from software game till date!
Positive,Do you like the frustrations of dying much? Then this game is for you!!32 hours played at time of review... still not past the first stronghold :-D

Positive,giant lobsters in a lake 10/10
Positive,"I honestly believe this is Game Of The Decade, not withstanding new FromSoftware titles there won't be anything close to an experience like this for years to come. and they did it all without subscriptions or ""live-service"" models. this game will be playable and the experience will be uncompromised even if/when the servers eventually turn off. TLDR; This game and it's DLC are worth buying at full price and I don't say that lightly."
Positive,"TL:DR Review:1st Playthrough: 100 HoursRating 9.6/10+Incredible World Scale and Design+Beautiful Graphics and Art Direction+Vast and Full Open-World full of Life and Treasure+Enemy, Boss, and NPC Designs Bold and Creative+Visceral Combat that rewards Skill, Strategy, and Teamwork.+Incredible Array of Powerful Play Styles-PvP weapons and skill trees currently unbalanced.-Lack of diverse PvP Covenants/Factions with meaningful progression.-PvE Damage and Health in late game areas not balanced well.-Final Bossfight frustrating and lackluster.-Majority of the Endings underwhelming and too similar.The only way to describe Elden Ring is simply: Jaw-Dropping. There is no other game that consistently ups the ante in all regards for the player as they progress through their journey. Countless times the sheer scale of the world, the difficult challenge of the enemies, the ingenious masochism of the developers ceaselessly stuns the player over and over again, up until the ending. This world is massive, beautiful, and full and complex. The enemies are unique, horrifying, and dangerous. The weapons, spells, and armor, are powerful, interesting, and very very cool. There is not a single aspect of this game that is not absolutely filled to the brim with fascinating things. As the player progresses through Elden Ring, they are greeted endlessly with cascading thrills of adventure every session. From Software has done nothing but improved upon its already perfect formula, Elden Ring is truly a love letter to all Souls Fans."

Positive,"I am a 68 year old single father of five children except all of my kids died also my wife died also my whole family died in a terrible car accident and I also have stage 4 cancer and also my parents and grandparents died also I have osteoporosis and I actually just got out of jail for a crime I didn't commit and also my birthday is tomorrow which means I will be 69 years old but the doctor said I only have one day to live so I probably won't make it due to my testicular cancer which is stage 4 also I'm malding and have no wife and kids because they all died. Did I mention that Elden Ring is the only game that helped me overcome my whole entire family's death and even my testicular cancer? I would like to thank FromSoft and papa Zaki for curing my cancer and bringing my family back to life like they just clutched the shit outta the gulag.Anyway, Elden Ring is a good game. Would recommend."
Positive,"Most of the negative reviews here is because of optimization issues and not the game itself. I've only run into one instance where I noticed a drop on my 3080ti/Ryzen 9, but other than that nothing. So it seems this varies a lot.This game is my wet dream as a soulsborne enthusiast, and even with my expectations sky high it still blows my mind. It is a culmination of everything From Soft has done over the years in one insanely huge package. The sheer size of the game is insane, and even then nothing feels like a traditional open world. The sense of adventure and wonder is through the roof. The visuals (including character creator) is stunning beyond belief and it will leave you in awe.Make no mistake: This game is an 11/10 and if you even remotely love the soulsborne series you should buy it right now"
Positive,"UPDATE FOR DLC - THE  DLC hitboxes are insane !!If FromSoft game difficulty concept is based on insane hit-boxes and never ending combos (again with insane hit-boxes), then the future of Souls series is not going to be good.At even high level, normal enemies can one shot or two shot you in most mid to late game areas, forget about the bosses. This is not how FromSoft designed Souls Series. The game is very unbalanced. Although I am glad that Health and Magic Potions are re-fillable at certain points.This is the first ever Souls game where I had to change my build in my first play through. I always always go for Melee first, then Ranged (mage/faith etc.) but the spike in difficulty towards the end game levels are insane. According to me, Dark Souls 3 is by far the best Souls like game they ever made. They could have improved the run-up to the bosses, by making it slightly easier, but apart from that, I don't think Elden Ring can match the boss quality that Dark Souls 3 has. Bloodborne comes close, but its non-refillable Health Drinks make it second compared to Dark Souls 3"
Positive,I'm trapped in hell
Positive,Good gam make me abit angy
Positive,Praise the sun \o/
Positive,Very Good. One of the few games I got all of the achievements for. Would definitely buy dlc should there ever be any
Positive,"Definitely game of the year material. Brutal but rewarding difficulty, beautiful and elaborate vistas, an enthralling adventure through and through; I can easily say this has quickly become one of my favorite games of all time. The lore is very deep; par for the course of FromSoft games where the lore may not be blatant but can easily be uncovered by items and from some of the best 'show not tell' environmental queues I've experienced. If you enjoy open world games that do not hold your hand, are challenging, and you can easily get lost in, definitely pick this up."

Positive,"Now that I've played... 112 more hours past my initial review, I feel it's time to give the review an update. For the sake of continuity I left the old review (which was a Not Recommended review) at the bottom.So. This is a huge game. Way more game than anyone ever expected, to be honest. In many ways this is extremely good: so much to do, so much to see, so many characters to interact with. So many ways to play the game, with all of them viable. It's a game that we'll be exploring for years to come, and that's not taking into account the inevitable DLC.However, this does come with drawbacks. It's pretty clear that this game had bug testing that still needed to be done, and quite frankly should have been shipped two months or more later than when it came out. The 1.03 patch is emblematic of this issue, where entire NPC quest chains were added because they were not functioning correctly in the original game. It also shows in the PC version performance, where crashes were common and expected. Now, the game crashes less often and by the time I neared my play through I only encountered two crashes within the last two days of playing (one of them the entire computer crashed).That said, you can look at the number of hours and take a guess as to how much I enjoyed this game. I had an absolute blast even with the performance issues, and the playtime is as ""low"" as it is mostly because I was getting exhausted and had to continue with my life. I look forward to returning to the Lands Between when the DLC comes out and go for a 100% completion run.(Old Review at 20.9 Hours) To be frank I do enjoy playing this game, it's a good refinement on the Souls formula with the addition of fun exploration. However, due to the instability of the PC version I can't recommend it on this platform. I have a brand new computer with modern specs and I have seen frequent crashes of the game, to the point that my entire computer crashes. I would revisit this game's review later when the issues are resolved, but if you are able then I recommend you play the PS5 version instead."
Positive,Go ahead and download the seamless coop mod and play the game through with your friends
Positive,lots of really cool dogs!
Positive,One of the best games ever made!
Positive,"Amazing game with an amazing expansion, highly recommended!"
Positive,"Game start is a little easier and more smooth sailing than traditional dark souls games which i appreciate.  Then the game scales into be obscenely difficult which is the sought after attraction. The open world makes it feel like an mmorpg, but with much darker themes."
Positive,"Having now reached the 100 hour mark in this game, I have finally found a single negative factor for this game, which is that for all the hoopla about this being a new IP and no longer Dark Souls, it really is Dark Souls 3 plus open world level designs, and more importantly the ambiance and theme doesn't change one bit from the 3 Souls games, and the issue I have with it after playing for so many hours is that it is simply depressing and dour.  I was truly hoping that with a new IP FromSoftware would perhaps lighten the mood and make Elden Ring more fantasy than horror, but unfortunately the more into the game you get, the more you realize it's the same horror theme.  All of the bosses remain slithery inhuman mutations with odd growths and appendages.  None of this overshadows the fact that gameplay-wise, Elden Ring is the best video game I've played, or at least tied for that accolade.  Initial articles also said that you can rush through this game in 30 hours, but I highly doubt that for new or average players, due to the fact that it's easy to get lost as to what to do to progress the game at times and certain quests are still quite ambiguous with you having to memorize something you did days ago at a faraway location.  It is nice though, that FromSoft not only ties the level designs into one another but also the various quests.  There is much that is intertwined in the game.  For a below average player like me, this game is going to take well over 120 hours to beat and I'll need to do NG+ to get all of the missing quest items I overlooked.  The problem is that I may not want to play NG+ because the game is so constantly bleak and depressing thematically, to the point that the main soundtrack theme in the opening of the game doesn't really represent the actual feeling you get during the game, the music that represents this game is the one from the catacombs..."
Positive,"So my initial review was about invisible enemies. I have discovered that even with a Ryzen 4000, I still needed max graphics. The game is perfect and beautiful but wow does it require alot of resources and a powerful pc."
Positive,Not Relaxing as promised
Positive,i will NOT be forgiving anyone for the questline of boc he deserves better !!!!!! other than that 10/10
Positive,Better than sex
Positive,I have a boner for this game so good
Positive,"I am loving this game.This game far exceded my expectations, and contains so much content.A free roam, open world, souls game.Truly a great time for gaming.Welcome to the Soulsborne family Elden Ring.10/10"
Positive,"This is the best open world game I've ever played; it combines all the good aspects of every great open world game of the last 15 years to make a breakthrough in the field. As for how the game ranks along side the previous Fromsoft titles, it's honestly lackluster in one major aspect. The level design that initially drew me into the studios games is all but faded to say the least, this was obviously a conscious decision as to make the game's map appear more open but in my opinion it seems like two steps back and one forward. Overall though, it's a great game and I've had a blast playing it. I only wish to not see the strides made by the studio in past games to go to waste."
Positive,"I loved this game. Past tense. I would recommend this game wholeheartedly to anyone who will listen for 15 seconds. Until the end game. Even with 60 vigor nearly every enemy will 2 or three shot you, the bosses are not only lazy and copied but also have very few openings that you can use. I'm not going to say much for spoilers sake but there is a certain secret tree that I would recommend visiting if you disliked the bed of chaos at all because despite there not being cracking floors I felt like I was having flashbacks. Not only does the combat suck in the endgame but so does exploration. Going into the same copy pasted catacomb with enemies that 3 shot you only to get to a boss who you also already fought only to get a weapon that you can't use because it is too much effort to upgrade it to make it worthwhile. Despite all of these MAJOR flaws I feel like they can be easily fixed in time. I still recommend this game but for now play the game until you have to go to mountain of the giants. You'd be better off pretending that's the end of the game."
Positive,"I love it, It has everything I wanted from it thus far. I've never had to stop so many times to just take in epic and beautiful scenery as in Elden Ring.Edit after 232 Hours: Just finished my NG+, this is one of the best games I've ever played."
Positive,"After the last couple of years brought us monumental flops like Cyberpunk 2077 and blatant cash-ins like Battlefield 2042 and GTA Remastered, it feels like a ""hyped"" game can't match the lofty and unreasonable expectations placed on it by the gamer mass in general - like the consumers are somehow wrong for expecting an amazing video game from publishers that spend millions of dollars on advertising and work their developers 70 hours a week for meager pay. Elden Ring arrives at the perfect time to dispel this notion and humble an intellectually bankrupt triple-A industry. A culmination of over a decade of learning and experimentation, Elden Ring aspires to perfect the Dark Souls formula, a mission in which it largely succeeds. Everything good about Dark Souls is here, and there is more of it - much more. Your first playthrough can easily last over 100 hours and you won't even see everything it has to offer.The game is not just a larger souls game either. It's an open-world experience, and what a world it is; there is not a corner in the HUGE map - which, by the way, expands several times, constantly surprising you on how big it is - where you won't feel thought and care were given to the player experience, an earnest attempt at making every dungeon and encounter somehow unique and interesting.As an example: if you fought a big ogre in the open world, you can be sure you will find it again, but this time in a narrow bridge with no railings, where you can't dodge as easily without falling off to certain death; or worse, find a cracked up version of said ogre that will kick your ass - my friend, the first ogre was just the tutorial. This is what is called ""game design"", a long-forgotten art by most triple-A publishers that just mindlessly copy whatever video game sold the most the last five years, with no interest in understanding why or bettering the formula.It's also worth noting the game now has a dedicated jump button, and platforming feels very responsive. I'm not telling you this as a positive, but as a warning, because the developers know that and made sure to make the infamous ""Anor Londo Archers"" seem like a walk in the park in comparison to some of the more acrobatic encounters in this game.Jump attacks are now a thing and the posture damage system from Sekiro is present, making the combat even more diverse and complex. Apparently, completely changing the world, level design, and adding over 60 hours of extra content was not enough for From.This game managed to capture the exploration and discovery of a game like Zelda: Breath of The Wild, but kept the souls dungeon style and perfectly adapted the open-world to the Dark Souls design ethos, vastly improving the experience since now you're not finding a worthless korok seed; you're finding a sword that shoots magma, guarded by a magical dragon, and if you pay close attention you can drop from the ledge into a secret cave, where a giant bear drops a new armor set. Not a korok seed.This game rewards you like no other for engaging with it, and if you wanna ""git gud"" and find the coolest weapons, skills, and spells: you have to. It's a brilliant design that understands the player's wishes and fulfills them by constantly surprising and rewarding you for the tough challenges you face, and making said rewards meaningful exactly BECAUSE the challenges are so tough you need all the help you can get.The only blemishes present are the performance issues and poor balancing on a few weapons, skills, and encounters, which is to be expected from a game this huge. I also think the summoning mechanic is a bit too powerful and inelegant as a ""sanctioned"" easy mode, but that complaint sort of falls flat since not using them feels more natural, which is what I did and I recommend you do as well if you're a souls veteran.The most recent patch mostly fixed the broken weapons and skills, while buffing the underused stuff, which is always nice. Don't worry, they left plenty of broken build options if you want to play on easy mode like Dark Souls always allowed you to, despite what brain-dead gaming journalists believe.Overall, while I would still consider Sekiro a more mechanically engaging game, it is very hard to argue this is not From's magnum opus, and a strong contender for the title of greatest game ever made."
Positive,"Overall Rating: 8.5 / 10Elden Ring is a great introduction to the Soulsborne games for new players and a respectable entry to the catalog for returning fans of FromSoftware's work.The Good:- The game world is massive with lots of interesting and visually stunning locations to explore- Combat is some of the best you can get in the action RPG genre- The main bosses have interesting designs and serve as memorable encounters- Itemization is mostly balanced and serves well to allow you to customize your gameplay- The story is interesting and has an openness to it that gives you a sense of agency in your role in its world, with several possible endings that aren't entirely predictableThe Bad:- The large, open world lacks emergent AI - enemies are always in the same places doing the same things and unaware of the world around then - and the size of the world combined with the difficulty of the game results in it often feeling tedious- Enemies and minor bosses are often reused across the different in-game regions and as a result end up feeling like boring chores instead of engaging encounters- The story is dangerously close to being the same as Dark Souls - something a little more divergent from those games would've been nice- Many of the characters in the story have very similar names which made it confusing and difficult to follow at times (this is mostly a minor complaint)Technical Notes:The PC version of the game is a bit of a sloppy console port with occasional crashes and considerable performance issues. Online play is extremely unreliable during peak hours, with people being kicked from your session every two minutes or so."

This game is beautiful and the voice acting is unreal, however, if you have an ultrawide monitor, you will be playing with bars down both sides of the screen.

Positive,"i never really liked the other souls games, but with elden ring there's just so much awsome content"
Positive,"One of the Best games I have ever played.Not an easy game for people who don't like Souls games. That was my second game(first Bloodborne). Try it, feel it and you gonna love it. Huge open world, a lot of NPC that you probably gonna miss while playing. Overall 10/10. I really love it"
Positive,"This is an absolutely amazing game. I would definitely recommend it to anyone that thinks that they like video games. I have explored this world to its fullest, feeling the immersive atmosphere ringing through my bones. This game has sucked me into its all in compassing grasp along with many others, and I am really glad that it, along with Bill Clinton, won game of the year for 2022. If you are seriously looking for a game to play this is the one. This game will allow you to never feel like you wasted your day, and will in turn allow you to have something to look forward to in life. Though this game may get frustrating at times, it was always reassuring to me that I could just explore elsewhere in the magnificent world of Elden Ring instead of bashing my head against a wall that I couldn't climb. Additionally, while this game might be challenging, I personally beat it at the level of one without using any cheesy strategies. Proving that Elden Ring can be beaten by wit and not skill. Well anyways that was my ramble about one of my all time favorite video games. Bye."
Positive,"As someone who has not really played a Fromsoftware game before (tried but could not get into it), this game was an extremely pleasant surprise. I didn't pay any attention to this game's marketing or hype or anything about it because I didn't care about it. Then once it was out I saw clips of it and thought it looked ok so I thought I'd try it.Cue a weeks long period of me playing Elden Ring and ONLY Elden Ring because it was so captivating. The world is beautiful yet haunting, the musical score is phenomenal and the gameplay feels very tight and smooth. The way you can build your character gives you so much freedom and so much replayability just due to how many different ways you can play the game. The boss fights are magnificent with each of the major ones being not only challenging but a spectacle to watch. Some of them you don't mind getting slapped around over and over just because it is so neat to see.Definitely a game to try, even if you haven't played another Fromsoftware game like myself."
Positive,"While it is by no means a perfect game - in particular some frustrating (not in a good way) boss designs - the scope of Elden Ring, be that mechanics or worldbuilding, is simply too great. An absolutely amazing experience"
Positive,Make it little harder maybe?

Positive,"Title: A Majestic Convergence of Souls and Sorcery - ""ELDEN RING""Rating: ★★★★★""Elden Ring"" by FromSoftware Inc. is a monumental achievement that transcends the already lofty standards set by the Souls series, delivering an awe-inspiring blend of challenging gameplay, an expansive open world, captivating graphics, and an intricate narrative.Graphically, ""Elden Ring"" is a visual masterpiece.

Positive,try finger but hole
Positive,"Playing this game is some of the most fun I have had playing a video game in a long time. I am loving the challenge and the feeling after defeating a boss, it feels amazing. The world just looks....I can't put into words how beautiful this game looks. Just the moment you step into Limgrave and as you continue exploring you find so much more detail.It is incredible the amount of love that went into this game and it definitely shows. There really is nothing else that I can say other than buy the game, play it for yourself, and then you will know what I mean. I will say, it is challenging, you WILL die, a lot, but it is so worth it. Especially when you defeat a strong enemy or learn where enemies are when exploring a dungeon.****For those of you wanting to play with friends, you can play with up to 2 other people in your world, and you will be able to be invaded by other players while you are doing that, so look up how cooperative play works because it is a little strange at first, but you get the hang of it. I recommend turning off the matchmaking and make sure play offline is active when you are playing alone if you do not want to be invaded.****Overall, I love this game and just think that it is something that you need to experience, if for nothing else than for how beautiful the game is, the level of attention and detail the FROMSOFTWARE put into this game, it is just truly incredible."

Positive,"Ok so, I deleted my last review.. I would definitely give this GAME an 11/10. No doubt about it. This is one of the best games I've ever played.Here's my one and only problem...The community.Due to the high amount of salty losers who play this, the community message boards are literally flooded with posts from people who cheated their way through the game (using wikipedia or just waiting til there's a guide to show them whats the best of this and the best of that), and now their only goal is PVP related. Consequently, all they do is fight other people in stupid little fight clubs around the world (which is totally fine), however, because of the nature of how co-op and PVP works, Co Op weapons and protections are all the same as PVP weapons and armor.. So basically, everyone cheats and gets themselves a maxed out godslayer weapon, then they artificially limit their own character to low level, and no one raises health because literally every single person thinks they're Lobos and they can run naked through any souls game and just dodge and never get hit. Then they try to PVP and they get killed in 1 shot. So they come HERE, cry about the game in these huge forum topics which blow up heavy, and they get all the fun items nerfed in to shit because they assume the whole game is about PVP... So what was once a good shield and spear combination? Not anymore, because its not fair that someone can wield those two items together and just block, apparently. You HAVE TO just roll around like a retard as your play style. If you don't, Then ""Fuck you, play something else.."" And the developers listen to them... They listen to these losers that dont care about the game,The PVP community in this game assumes the whole game is made for them. Thats the only problem with the game...If you have a friend that wants to play through the game with you, do that because it is hundreds of hours of entertainment. Something like 100 bosses to kill.. 80 square km to explore..The best recommendation is DO NOT CHEATDo not look up guides. Dont use mods. Dont look up youtube videos. None of that bullshit.Just explore. If you dont know where to go, EXPLORE. Dont be stupid and you'll have a great time. The answer to your question of ""Now where do I go?"" - ""Anywhere you want."""
Positive,"This game is the best game I've played in a long time, super engaging as someone who's play plenty of souls-like but it's really accessible to new players too, get this game!"

Positive,"Good points : - You can run this game on an Intel I3 (Youtube)- You can feel the progression of your character- You have this incredible feeling of loneliness - You are going to wet your pants looking at this magnificent world - You feel great each time a friendly npc talks to you- You want to spend your journey on this game - You decide whenever you want to do your shit - You can restat and go fkin 99 int and dex to make a spellblade thing whatever you want - You can decide if you need an ""easy mode"" or a ""hard mode"" (not talking about the endgame hardmode)- You won't have to start a new character to get each success - You will understand that everything is bound - You can invade other people world- You can kill each (OK NOT EACH BUT MOST OF) npc in the game- You need to be patient and avoid rushing - You need to report your horse for killing you 100 timesMinus : - You make friends, family, companions, and they all die. Moreover, when they don't die, they become depressed, sad or lost their memory... Wtf let me be happy in this world ruled by the golden order???And despite the fact that I used the only rhetorical device that I know (which is the Anaphora) to emphasize the fact that this game is amazingly god likely incredibly fantastic in each aspect of it."

Positive,"FromSoftware knocks it out of the park again. PC performance does leave some to be desired as netcode is pretty bad. Somewhat absurd difficulty scaling towards the end (enemies dealing insane amounts of damage), slightly excessive amount of boss re-use, and a current mess of PvP are the only real flaws, but everything else is fantastic. Edit: After quite a few patches and balancing updates a lot of things have been pretty ironed out.Full Review on Medium:https://edmond-wu0895.medium.com/elden-ring-review-dark-souls-4-but-open-world-ccfff5c92bc"
Positive,"If you love Dark Souls then this is it, the game that can both introduce you to a Souls-like game and give you a real challenge, even for veterans this is a joy to play! Higly recommend it if you are brave enough to try it.Visuals: much better than the original Dark Souls games, still not liking the 60 FPS capGameplay: if it doesn't stutter it is a really good gameAudio: the sound of you dying time and time again is glorious10/10 would wanna be gangbanged by 3 crabs in Limgrave swamp and have a dragon lands on top of you.Praise the Sun.. I mean Ring!"
Positive,"Despite some performance issues, that causes lower frames than i like, I put 84 hours into it already, and have no plans on stopping any time soon. I had to lower resolution from 1440p to 1080p, but i've enjoyed every moment of it anyway. How many games would you lower the resolution for just to keep playing constantly? One of the best games I've played in a decade, definitely the best single-player game."
Positive,"Easiest way i could say it is this is Souls All-Stars. Take the best things from every game in From's recent years and connect em all together into one cohesive and fun experience, coupled with a massive open world, horseback combat, crafting, and a bunch of quality of life improvements and additional systems and changes.Does the PC port have problems? Absolutely, for almost everyone, including myself. However, the game is a fucking masterpiece, and I fully recommend it."
Positive,What if instead of Elden Ring it was Freaky Ring and instead of restoring order to the lands between you got freaky with the two fingers
Positive,"Why reinvent the bicycle? There is no need. The bicycle is perfect - all the parts do what they're supposed to do, and that's that. So... How do you re-sell a new bicycle to someone who already owns and likes the previous one?You make it bigger. You give it an armored frame. You put self-charging flashlight on it. You paint it red so that it goes fastah and maybe even put some flames on it. Maybe a gun holster, i don't know.This is how i see FromSoft making the same game for 10 years... And i'm perfectly fine with it.100+ hours of another explorative adventure. My completionist first blind playthrough run took me 150h;Certain improvements on the classic Dark Souls combat formula: proper combos instead of spamming same 2 swings over and over, counters give shields a reason to exist, characters can actually jump now like normal game characters, etc;I know some people don't care but: LoRe. The world of Elden Ring and how everything ties together is exceptionally fascinating. This is especially potent to me after DS3 left a confused, incoherent taste in my mouth.Basic crafting system which allows you to make up some makeshift arrows and bombs on the go if you need them in a pinch.Introduction of random resources to support said crafting system really feeds into my Compulsive Obsessive Looting Disorder. I know i don't need the Herb x257, but its RIGHT THERE, how can i not?!As always - some very lovely and rememberable bosses, including those that push your sh*t (in a good way).Optimization: allegedly the game struggles to run properly on old gen CPUs. I've upgraded my GPU while playing the game - and it BARELY made a difference, the game doesn't even utilize it that much - all the hardship goes straight to CPU, especially the trillions of particles.There are inherent issues with Open World games, and ER is no exception: getting lost, trying to remember every optional path i didn't take so that i could go back to it later, simply taking WRONG turns. I accidentally skipped the ""tutorial"" early area of the game and came back to it by accident later way too overpowered for it, commencing an indiscriminate genocide on the local population for the sake of ""i bought the whole game - i will play the whole game"";Some attacks by certain opponents feel rather cheap: way too often i had to ask myself ""How was i supposed to dodge that?"", quickly transforming into ""How am i supposed to dodge that?"", and then finally ""Am i supposed to dodge that?..."";Dogs. They're still here. They still suck.Ash Summons are OP and frankly kinda ruin the challenging aspect of the game, which is why i had to avoid using them unless i just REALLY didn't want to go through that one area again. Although probably not that different from summoning cooperators in the old games, so... Eh.Overall i'd give it 8/10 tops. The issues i encountered did not ruin my experience in any meaningful way - i still got my little big adventure, just as i was hoping to. Frankly - this is an Apex form of that ""i wonder what i'm gonna stumble upon next"" feeling that you find in the previous FromS titles.That's gotta be worth something."
Positive,I can't go back to dark souls now. I've been spoiled.
Positive,Elden ring is based
Positive,"LES POINTS POSITIFS:C'est l'aventure à 100000000% et ça commence dès le tout début, dès que tu prends l'ascenseur pour sortir de la zone du tuto et que t'es largued dans le monde ouvert. La map est gigantesque mais c'est le meilleur open world que j'ai fait de toouuute ma vie et de GIGA LOIN. C'est un pur open world au SERVICE du gameplay, pas séparé du reste du jeu comme dans un RDR2 ou TW3 par exemple. Au début, tu commence à Limgrave, et c'est déjà très joli mais quand tu ouvres ta map, tu te dis, le cadre est pas gigantesque... la map est grande mais ça doit pas non plus être colossal... et puis tu rentres malgré toi dans un téléporteur qui t'emmène très loin. Tu ouvres ta map et tu constate que le cadre a grandit et tu comprends qu'en fait le monde est gigantesque et que ta map s'agrandit au fur et à mesure que t'explore.Et la map est pas juste grande pour être grande, le monde est pas non plus vaste et vide. Le monde est extrêmement mega mega riche et déééééborde de contenu de tous les cotés, 99% des choses étant ""facultatives"" et c'est à toi de façonner ton aventure et de décider comment tu vas t'y prendre pour devenir ELDEN LORD.C'est pas non plus le même décors en boucle. Je nospoil ( alors on va faire du namedrop sans contexte) mais quand tu passe de Limgrave à Caelid... Quand tu est envoyé d'un coup à Lyndell... Quand tu te promènes tranquillement dans une grotte random à première vue, et que tu fait subitement face à la Siofra River ou encore Ainsel... Du début à la fin, à chaque découverte d'une nouvelle zone, je devais poser mon Steam Deck pour souffler un coup tellement c'est BEAU et ÉPOUSTOUFLANT. Et le level design est parfait à chaque fois. C'est un pur bonheur d'explorer les châteaux, les villes, les donjons, tout est fabriqué au millimètre près et ça se ressent constamment. C'est génial parce que chaque chose que tu vois à l'horizon, tu peux TOUJOURS y accéder, et ça donne l'eau à la bouche à chaque fois que tu vois quelque chose à explorer et que tu y fonces en sachant pertinemment que ça va être une expérience excellente. Le sentiment de découverte dans ce jeu est le plus puissant que j'ai jamais vécu dans un jeu vidéo et il ne déçoit JAMAIS. Et tout ça, c'est un contenu phénoménal et qui n'a vraiment pas d'équivalent. Plusieurs fois, je me demandais si je ne rêvais pas tant il y a de contenu à explorer. J'ai l'impression qu'ELDEN RING est un jeu qui a déjà reçu une dizaine d'expansions, ça ne s'arrête jamais, et il est quasiment impossible de faire son premier playthrough en voyant tout ce que le jeu a à offrir parce qu'il y a beaucoup trop ! J'ai commencé un newgame+ et j'ai déjà découvert plusieurs zones que je n'avais pas vues dans ma première aventure...La direction artistique en elle-même est stratosphérique et c'est ce qui rend chaque découverte incroyable mais c'est aussi ce qui rend chaque ennemi, chaque boss, chaque arme, chaque magie, chaque chose qui compose ce jeu iconique. ELDEN RING a une personnalité vraiment excellente et au fur et à mesure qu'on avance dans le jeu on commence à devenir familier avec certaines locations, on prend ses marques juste pour se prendre une gifle 1h après.Et tout ça se passe dans un univers avec un lore COLOSSAL. Beaucoup plus intense, riche et intéressant que ce que j'aurais pu m'imaginer. FromSoftware et George R. R. Martin ont écrit un univers qu'on ne pourra jamais oublier, mais pour ça, il est vrai qu'il faut s'accrocher. La plupart des ""quêtes secondaires"" sont assez vagues, tout comme les dialogues et les pièces écrites de Lore disséminées un peu partout. Il faut s'investir pour comprendre l'histoire de chaque personnage et de chaque boss, et même avec ça, beaucoup est laissé à l'imagination. C'est un équilibre très particulier. Mais à chaque fois qu'on en apprend plus sur un personnage ou un lieu, que ce soit à travers le jeu ou sur internet, on a la mâchoire décrochée.""Put these foolish ambitions to rest...""La rejouabilité est totalement présente. Des centaines de sorts, des centaines d'incantations, des tonnes d'armes de tous les types (épées, grandes épées, marteaux, fléaux, fouets, pugilat, haches, arc, dagues, et bien d'autres encore...), les ashes of war pour personnaliser le moveset de ses armes, et tout ça sans parler de toutes les différentes armures, spirit ashes, etc... On peut faire le jeu de tellement de façons extrêmement différentes et se build plein de personnages aux gameplay bien distincts. Dingue.Et forcément, les boss. Après avoir fait le Fatalis de Monster Hunter: Iceborne, je pensais pas que quoi que ce soit pouvait atteindre son niveau d'epicness et de fun. Mais alors là, avec Elden Ring, c'est des tonnes de boss Fatalis-tier, tous aussi différents les uns des autres, que ce soit des guerriers géants, des monstres, des dragons à la King Ghidorah, et j'en passe... Et ça va même beaucoup plus loin encore.Les composantes de multijoueur sont super funs. Le PVP comme le PVE, mais le meilleur c'est largement la coopération entre tarnished. Voir les messages des autres joueurs sur le sol, s'aider ou se troller. ""Likely weak foe"", ""Didn't expect bloodstain, therefore seek skill""... ""Hidden path ahead"" -> ""Liar ahead""...Point final: la difficulté. Si on commence en écoutant le bonhomme au tout début du jeu et qu'on suit donc la direction désignée par les sites de Grace, alors on arrive très rapidement devant Margit qui, logiquement, nous enc*le. C'est la leçon du jeu, celle de se forger de l'expérience en profitant du monde ouvert et de ses milliers de challenges qui n'attendent que nous pour qu'on se renforce et qu'on soit à niveau pour appréhender les plus gros boss. Moins on explore, moins on ""farm"", et plus c'est dur. Mais à coté de ça on peut vraiment mettre toutes les chances de notre coté avec un bon build, si on utilise les spirit ashes, tous les outils à disposition, etc... Oui le jeu est clairement très difficile et certains boss sont là pour ruiner ta vie (Malenia...) mais il faut s'accrocher et renforcer son personnage pour avoir plus de chances. Le jeu nous donne des TONNES d'outils différents à notre disposition pour appréhender chaque boss, il faut juste prendre le temps de les trouver/comprendre. C'est du die & retry très vénère mais il ne faut pas baisser les bras.LES POINTS NEGATIFS:Difficile d'avoir envie de jouer à autre chose après ça. Tous les jeux qui se rapprochent du style Action/RPG semblent tellement mais tellement fades à coté. Je sais que maintenant je serais incapable de faire un TW3 jusqu'au bout sans me lasser après joué à ELDEN RING (rien qu'y penser me fait froid dans le dos). L'avantage c'est qu'il me reste tous les Dark Souls à découvrir.Je rajouterais quand même que les quêtes secondaires sont souvent difficiles à suivre, et parfois on est quasiment obligé d'utiliser Google pour comprendre ce qui cloche quand on est bloqué quelque part. Pourquoi je ne peux pas avancer mon dialogue avec Biduletruc ? Parce que je dois parler à Machinetruc mais seulement après avoir tué Grostasdetruc sauf que pour affronter Grostasdetruc je dois avancer la quête de Jeanmichelcatin en parlant d'abord à Sabinecestpassorcier puis en lui reparlant une seconde fois après avoir rechargé la zone en me téléportant ailleurs avant de revenir pour qu'elle puisse être assise sur la chaise de gauche au lieu de la chaise de droite. Clc."
Positive,"I recommend this game with the caveat of it being offline.I've played the game in its entirety with the seamless co-op mod. I will not be going back to live servers because of this, obviously, but I have no wish to anyway.Trying to play this game with someone else on live is hell. I don't want to deal with PvP, and I don't really understand why it's a necessary feature to worry about invasions in order to play with someone else. I have no wish nor care to learn PvP, I just like facing bosses with my boyfriend. Fighting bosses together was the best part of this game. PvP was the only thing I really didn't like.So, with boring PvP out of the way, the game actually started being fun. I did miss being able to see the notes and ghosts of other players, but I'll gladly give that up to have some quality time slaying bosses and exploring the world with someone else. Even with someone helping you, the bosses can be tough. You really need to learn the attack animations and sometimes the hitboxes, and how your i-frames work with dodging. You need to learn your own attack times in order to be able to move out of the way when you need to. I played a mage, which is probably considered easy mode, and even with that I had a rough time. But this was also my first FromSoftware game.The designs of enemies and boss battles were incredible. I hated Radahn and loved him at the same time. Astel was a cool boss design, as was Mohg and Godfrey. I loved Renala's second phase arena. Every boss had a memorable design in some way, and each were challenging to face. Some enemies felt like total BS, like the huge lobsters, but most felt fair.Being a sorcerer was a ton of fun. There's so many awesome, flashy abilities to use and just blasting down a boss with Azur's Comet was so, so fun. In NG+ I've switched to incantations to act as a healer/support for my boyfriend, and that's super fun, too. Not sure how viable the latter playstyle is on live servers, though.To play the game to its most efficient level, you need a wiki open at all times. There's no journal to keep track of quests or who you talked to. I don't need a quest marker, but quest journals existed in games for decades for a good reason. I had a keep a notepad open on the first playthrough to manually checkmark off whose quests we've finished and who we have yet to talk to or what quest step we need to do next before some event happens and it's gone forever. Having to constantly double check the wiki after each boss or thing we did just to make sure we didn't accidentally lock out an NPC's quest line was super tedious, not to mention you don't even really know where an NPC is going to be a lot of the times after you talk to them. I'm glad I got the majority of quests out of the way on the first playthrough so I never have to worry about them again.Character creation is GARBAGE. Yes, there's a lot of sliders, but there is no reason for a chin slider to also affect the shape of the eyes, or a nose slider to affect the shape of jawline, or a forehead slider to change the shape of the nose, and so on. I spent 2 hours just trying to perfect my character's appearance, constantly going back and forth between sliders to get them to work harmoniously. It sucked. It was hell. I have no idea who at FromSoft thought having sliders work like this was even remotely a good idea when great character creators like Fallout 4, Black Dersert, or the Sims series have been out forever as examples to inspire from. The hair options are so limited, and the body sliders may as well not exist with how little they change. I don't know why you have to work against the game itself just to make someone remotely good looking.I think that's about it. I don't care if people think I'm bad for not going naked daggers only, or whatever elitist opinions people have on how to ""truly"" play the game. I had fun with the way I built, modded, and played. For that, I can recommend this game."
Positive,"I could write a huge long review for this game, but plenty of other people have done that already.Short story: Game good.Slightly longer story: This seems like a culmination of everything Fromsoft have been working on for the last 10 years. This game has elements of every game they've made previously. The new bit is the Open World, which is fantastic, full, and beautiful.If you're a new player, then know this game is brutally hard. However, if you're prepared to approach it on its terms - you will find a new favourite."

Positive,"It's not an understatement to say that Elden Ring is a masterpiece that will change the way open world games are perceived and made the same way Breath of the Wild did on the Nintendo Switch. Not only is it a masterclass in making a beautiful, mysterious open world, it also combines that with the series' best boss design, area design, and gameplay with a wealth of new systems to complement it. An unmissable experience and a serious contender for game of the decade."
Positive,"Negative review I know, but I have 100 hours on record and and a souls vet. I'm not saying the game is bad by any stretch of the imagination. But the coop crashes, the random crashes that are way too common and the over tuned bosses at late game are a lil absurd. IDK about y'all but i like doing challenging boss fights with my buddies. And when halfway through almost every damn fight, at least one person crashes out due to ""connectivity issues"" i find it bad. The ashes on weapons. They are absurd. PVP is terrible in a lot of instances because it's either Weapon art spam, or some asswipe using the ""death proc cancer"" build. that ill let yall look up on your own.... And finally late game, im talking last few bosses, the difficulty spike is absurd if you're not an int build hiding in the back and memebeaming everything to death. Almost every boss can 1 shot(or 1 shot combo you) and thats with 40 vigor. im sure the meta will change, but overall the game while being fantastic, still needs a lot of work. Whats sad is i could ignore all the BS abilities weapons have, if coop/pvp actually worked properly. til then, game isn't recommended.Keeping old so we can see changes. After the patch, coop works much better, much less lagstacking effects and spells are now working correctly pvp is possiblearcane weapons work!now that many of the game breaking issues have been patched, 10/10 would recommend, still very hard, but with the changes to some of the enemies, etc it's a little more fair now. Glad we got a patch to fix this."
Positive,"Hands down the best game I've ever played. It seems scary at first, especially since it was my first souls game, however once you get past that phase it easily takes the lead in the gaming industry. Everything is perfect. Once you open the doors you are amazed by the beauty and artwork that this game provides and it continues to surprise you throughout. The gameplay mechanics are like none other and you just have so much stuff to do. Only if I had the time to play this more and more, I would've completed it multiple times.Do I recommend? If I had to choose only one game to play for the rest of my life, without a doubt this would be it.PS. The first ""boss"" once you step into the world after the tutorial will kill you so don't cry over it, stop being a cry baby. Just move on and progress through the game."
Positive,i clapped when morgor said tarnished you truly are the elden ring
Positive,This just reminds me of my day-to-day life of living in Birmingham. Truly horrifying.
Positive,Big Dark Souls
Positive,Every digital and physical copy of Elden Ring has personalized performance.
Positive,this game made me pee white
Positive,"The greatest fantasy game I have ever played in my life, 10/10."
Positive,5 hours in im still stuck hunting down tiny soldiers that kills me in few swings
Positive,"Huge open world game that combines the best aspects of an open world with a souls game. It has so much content and replay potential, i just love it. 11/10. If you're not a souls fan, the game is not easy to beat and it takes some time to learn boss attack patterns and how to dodge/parry/sidestep attacks, take your time and try your best. Lost runes are not the end of the world."
Positive,"fantastic game, amazing soundtrack, this is probably one of the few open world games that actually got me to explore the whole map without feeling bored or like im doing some kind of chore i gotta complete, gameplay wise it has variety even thought is not like super impressive, regardless its still fun!difficulty it can be challenging at times but once you start leveling up and getting better gear things gets better for the player, i definitely recommend this game, theres a reason why it won GOTY."
Positive,melina is hot
Positive,Join game. See boss. Think boss easy. Die 237times before realizing he’s skipable. 10/10
Positive,Dark Souls 4 pog
Positive,Nothing to add to the rest of the great reviews here. I just wish this supported Ultrawide monitors.
Positive,"I'm a Soulsborne veteran, and up until this Bloodborne was by far my favorite. This game not only ended up being the best souls game, but one of my ""top 5 games I ever played"" list.It looks good, plays good, finally since DS2, everything seems to viable, poison, bleed, magic, fire, whips, rapiers, greatswords, everyone is dominating the game with anything, and its great to see! The game also has a not so soulsborne way to approach new players, ash summons give some respite in combat for those playing solo, statues of Marika stand as a checkpoint to boss battles so you don't have to make the run back, the ability to explore other areas when hitting a difficulty wall, and many more!100% Worth"
Positive,"The stuttering is inconvenient. The overworld music is underwhelming, though it does give me Secret of Evermore vibes. Dark Souls 3 combat, but way better, and with jumping. Armor matters. Very immersive.Falling from too great a height either kills you or it doesn't. It is hard to gauge how far is too far. And hitting double jump at the end of the jump doesn't save u either, which is dumb because it should. It's magic.Glowing ethereal runes that drift out of bodies like souls. That's what runes are. Souls. Everyone knows that. Just make it souls dude come on.The poop jokes are very there, as well as lots of awkward speak of various fingers. Cool armor sets. Fun, interesting boss fights. Change your appearance any time u want. 9.5/10"
Positive,like a videogame but better
Positive,like Nier Automata one of THE BEST GAMES last 10 yearseven better than DARK SOULS 1-3 Sekiro + Bloodborne different [] and c00L too
Positive,"Be patient with the UI; It's not the best for PC. The default prompt settings will be for controllers, but you can toggle it to PC/Keyboard. The lockon camera often feels weird and I find it hard to hit things with a melee weapon, while atop a horse. I like the game system - it's a very 1:1 stat improvement model. The choice of nouns can be a bit too esoteric but that too shall pass. It's a fun game. This was my first Souls game, I played a wizard, and I regret nothing.UPDATE: 150 hours later; I am become death, destroyer of bosses. The UI still sucks."
Positive,"good. try finger, but hole"
Positive,there are T-Rex dogs in terraria's crimson biome
Positive,The best game I've played in a while. I highly recommend giving it a try.
Positive,this game stinks
Positive,"I really wish steam allowed for star ratings or percentage ratings over YES\NO ratings, because there's a lot to say about this game.First off, I loved it! It was absolutely fantastic. The characters, the soundtrack, the world, the story! All of it was so fun to experience and explore! Truly a fantastic experience!...but that said. This game also... kinda sucks? And I dont mean its a bad game! Not at all! I had a great time with it! Ive put in 100 hours into it!! But there are some minor things that can really destroy the player experience. A lot of the bosses are... unfair. Not difficult - but unfair. The difficulty comes largely from a boss' ability to chain pretty much any attack into another - regardless whether or not you can parry, block, or dodge said attack after narrowly dodging the previous attack. For some, the final boss especially, it comes down not to the skill of the player to overcome the challenge, but on their luck of whether or not a boss will do a certain move.Not only that, but fromsoft still hasnt learned their lesson about boss arenas and level design. The dungeons are great! Winding, twisting paths that have multiple solutions and can be taken at the player's pace. But the places where you fight the boss? Often squeezed into tight spaces with oversized enemies and random barriers\blocks that prevent dodge strings and sacrifice the practicality of the arena for *aesthetics*. Again, its really pretty! But its also extremely frustrating to lose a fight because a boss's sword can clip through a random pillar or torch on the floor, but you cant dodge through it. Its like going to a carnival where everything is absolutely gorgeous, fun, and fantastic, but then you get to the main attaction of the rides and theyre... old, rusted, reused and decrepit. It seems almost unrefined or lazy of fromsoft to leave their bosses in such a state - especially since this is their 7th soulsborne game and this has been a constant player complaint since Demon Souls.Ultimately, if you love Soulsborne games, youll enjoy this. If you like open world games, youll enjoy the characters and open world aspects of this game, but youll find yourself increasingly frustrated at odd game design choices and random barriers to your exploration.TL;DR I loved this game, despite my gripes with some of the bosses and game design choices. It really is Fromsoftware's best entry into the Soulsborne series, and if youre willing to put up with some annoyances that come with open world games and with Fromsoft's game design, youll find yourself immersed in the world and playing for hours and hours and hours on end."
Positive,"Is this game particularly story rich? So far, not really. I love games with strong plots, character development and I expected to dislike this game assuming this was going to be a visually stunning yet bland, monster-killing open world game. I was excited, nonetheless! I purchased this game for experiencing the hype and the supposed ""annihilating difficulty"". I also have an ultra wide monitor (you probably are aware that the game doesn't natively support any aspect ratio other than 16:9)  and I walked straight past the tutorial cave (the Cave of Knowledge) in the game and was left to fend for myself. Consequently, I already had a lot of negative impressions about Elden Ring before even really starting. As someone who has barely touched the surface of Souls games, I expected a pretty steep learning curve but not to an extent that I would end up getting wrecked every second in those Catacombs! There is no hand-holding and you are greeted by a few lethal doses of that giant Tree Sentinal. However, after restarting a new game, getting into the mindset of actually learning the combat tactics, going through the tutorial and slowly, consistently building the character's strength, the game feels rewarding unlike any other. What makes this game so special to me are the surprise elements. You can never know what you are going to stumble upon.  All the grind and frustration pays off after you defeat bosses after dying again and again. The combat is so tight and the camera angles while battling some bosses are just OMG!TLDR: Elden Ring just makes hours fly by and I think it is an absolute essential for anyone looking to dive into what might be the best open-world RPG made till date. Fabulous graphics and excellent game play mechanics! P.S. From Software, please better optimize the game for PC and ADD NATIVE ULTRA WIDE monitor support. It's a shame that a game of this scale released in 2022 doesn't scale to the user's native resolution, especially when a dev came out with an unofficial fix within 24 hours of the game's release."
Positive,"I'll say this: I stumbled upon a building today, without any hints or markers on the map that it was there, took a look inside, found an elevator that took me MILES underground and released me into a gigantic new area that I spent the next 2 hours in; just exploring, fighting, looting...and the cherry on this cake was a beautifully designed boss fight, that was challenging (took me 4 attempts) but rewarding. I did not expect this when I started my session today, but the fact that it happened made one thing crystal clear - I'm in love with this game."
Positive,"The game is just amazing.  If you like dark souls types, you will love this.  If you are not good at dark souls types, you will love/hate this.  I'd say ""get gud"", however some of us (like me) just plain suck at it, lol!  So in that case, get friends to help."
Positive,The biggest euphemism in gaming history.
Positive,I haven't left my room in 12 hours.
Positive,Best game ever
Positive,"Massive learning curve. I was really frustrated to begin with and basically gave up. After slogging it out for a few days leveling up, I'm getting the hang of it - now the game is quite enjoyable."
Positive,"after getting all the achievements and playing this game for 74 hours i feel qualified to say: this is the best game ive ever played, buy it now. the performance is a bit iffy so if youre worried id advise waiting but the last patch seems to have fixed it.some of my favorite games were ds3 and botw, and this game basically combines those two (and other fromsoft games) and does everything they do but better. the bosses in this game, including the optional ones, exceed my favorite fights in ds3, and the exploration in it is a lot more fun and rewarding than what botw offers. great game."
Positive,Held off on reviewing as the stuttering was so bad. It got better as I played more but there's still issues (Tree Sentinel and the mini boss that guards the Stormfort for instance both incurred slow downs that hindered my fighting).Still going to give it a positive for the overall experience which is great.I miss some of the level design the non open world DS's had. There was something nice about how it all worked together. But it's also cool to be able to roam around and choose your own path.
Positive,"One of the only games I would want to re-experience for the first time again. Truly an amazing game. Have replayed three times now (2 solo and 1 with co-op mod) and I have yet to try faith, so I'll most likely replay the game again for a 4th time. Highly recommend, esp if it's your first ""souls-like"" game. I honestly have not ever been excited about any games or felt interested in much other games in the past few years and thought I was just getting old, but this really reminded me why I enjoyed video games so much. Just go for it!"

Positive,Got me hooked up to video games again
Positive,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is"
Positive,"First off, try fun but hole."
Positive,Dark souls on steroids
Positive,"Dark Souls II 2 has earned a special place in my heart as one of many games that I play and somehow find enjoyment in even though it pisses me off 90% of the time. Poise sorta works in this game which is a nice addition from Dark Souls III and offers decent build variety. This game ain't bad but idk if i'd say GOTY worthy.   Elden Ring Has the worst Fashion Souls out of any of the souls games, Yet has the most potential for build variety out of any souls game.   Elden Ring also rivals Dark Souls II for reused content. Remember the Pursuer? well you have that except in the form of a tree with a giant hammer, but atleast this time they have a variety of passive gases that can hurt you which is a step forward i guess.   Elden Ring mimics DS I in how fast you can beat this game, I mean hell DS2 and DS3 actually feel like an adventure and take me at least a week to complete even when I know what I'm doing it still takes a while to beat the game. This Game? nah its tantamount to heading down the street to the gas station to pick up a few things and then heading back.One thing that was a interesting addition were spell summons that could aid you in boss fights or gank fights, pretty cool stuff.  They added jumping which was a neat feature The story's kinda neat. I forgot most of it but imagine the daedra from skyrim or the daemon gods of WH40K that try and get mortals and such to worship them all, and the gods sorta compete for hegemony over the rest. Powerstancing got brought back from DSII except there isnt a stat requirement this time. Good Job Fromsoft!In terms of where this game stands enjoyment wise I would rank it as Such1.DSIII2.DSII3.Elden Ring4. DSIIts not a bad game but its a souls game and thats pretty much all i gotta say about itP.S. Best Girl dies unless you set the world on fire #Worthit"
Positive,"Simply the best game I've ever played. Aery, ethereal and mystical are the words that are coming first to mind with it. Even not going all esoteric with feeling and definitions of beauty, of decaying world filled with life and what life can mean in a broader sense - it's just an insane game mechanically that can be as deep as you want it to: be it a puddle or an ocean of possibilities. It's responsive, every move matters and hit boxes are madly precise, everything feels fair given you actually paying attention. Same goes into the lore and the stories, it's all up to you to dig, decipher and make sense of it... or simply don't and enjoy it for what it is to you. A brilliant design i'd probably not change a single thing in. DLC wait is almost over, cheers for that! :er_wave:"
Positive,"It's unbelievable, while playing this game for 25 hours, it feels like I've got everything and yet I'm probably only at 20% if not less."
Positive,"Lets just say that I have never been humbled this much before ,but as my first souls like game this game as my favorite no competition,don't even get me started with the amount of variety in this game in terms of weapons and build.you cant go wrong recommend 100%"
Positive,Might quit my full-time job.
Positive,"Pretty damn good game, full of dogs, finally got a maiden, time to touch grass."
Positive,Its a game where money means more to me. :')
Positive,"Mesmerising graphics, glorious fighting styles and very user friendly. I recommend it 200%! There's so much to enjoy about It... I have played over 176h and I did not complete every achivement yet! Did kill all the bosses, yes, but theres SO MUCH MORE to find and adquire!! Give your best, the game will gratify you ♥"
Positive,"My first Souls game.  Only reason I gave this one a go is the open world.  Not as hard as I was led to believe.  Combat is pretty fun other than the occasional frustration of game mechanics, which doesn't make it hard just fucking annoying.  The invasion system/co-op in this game is absolute trash.  It's super fun to team up and play co-op, but the way everything works is the most needlessly obtuse and complicated system.  Just let me team up and whoop ass with a friend, and not have some rando 389568 levels higher than us come in and 1-hit us.  It doesn't happen too often, but one time is all it takes to ruin the fun of the game sometimes.  Overall, the world is massive with a neat gothic style and the combat is fun 90% of the time."
Positive,"I have never once in my entire life picked up a Souls-style game from this studio, I especially refused to buy it due to the seeming 'impossibility' of the bosses. I come to tell you that this game is one of the best I have played in years. I have been a strict survival-shooter Tarkov/Rust player for 3 years, with sparks of small interest in other games or replaying others that I enjoyed.A friend came over with his pc, allowing me to play. I was immediately hooked and fascinated, and just bought the game today (he came over yesterday) and in that time I have sunk 14~ hours into it as of writing this comment. The Bosses present difficulty of course, but they are difficult enough that the challenge is enjoyable. I have yet to rage quit, and have at maximum taken 20~ tries for any opponent (goddamn golem I got teleported lol) and the game is just gorgeous. I highly recommend it to anyone who has been bored.Thou art of passing skill, ye must truly have warrior blood in thine veins."
Positive,"I'm a big fan, of games like this one as well as what I've experienced in this one so far, but I do have critique to give on Elden Ring specifically.The game itself is a masterpiece as an RPG, with a massive world to explore that took me over 100 hours to feel like I had squeezed it dry and I still found small details I missed the next 80 hours as of this review HOWEVER the games combat system and enemy design are the same as they have been for years. Not to say there aren't improvements, such as finally introducing a jump button, and crouching/sneaking, most likely due to the success of Sekiro, another Fromsoft game. I personally feel like they could have gotten more creative or flexible with combat mechanics and done more with enemy designs, which goes in to my first and biggest critique.The balance behind the game is some of the worst I've seen from the developer in several games. It has been receiving patches to increase or decrease the power of certain weapons/spells or enemies since release as of this review, but there is a flaw (in my opinion) regarding the lethality of enemies and the power difference between certain types of weapons, not just individual weapons. . Weapons themselves have always had rough concepts of whats the best for progression through the game, in all Fromsoft RPGs, however the concept of increased speed and lethality on the enemies in Elden Ring, while keeping the heavier weapons just as slow as they were in the Souls series of games they pull from? A big mistake in my opinion, and while they still remain fun weapons, its been disheartening to see players spamming one attack on massive greatswords, or weapon arts, just to make them safe to use against the aggressive reactive bosses of Elden Ring. . Enemies have some strange mechanics and ideas of difficulty in Elden Ring I don't believe I've seen in previous fromsoft RPGs as well, including the ability (Though rare) to hold their weapon ready to attack, which plays with the mind on the timing to dodge or block the attacks in question. Delaying attacks isn't my biggest gripe however, its the physical interaction with the monstrous bosses, and the classic combat mechanics working against each other in Elden Ring like never before. MANY bosses are large and imposing, however they also move extremely fast at times, and though your timing might be on point, your physical body still may be carried by the enemy with the insanely fast movement, causing your character to slide across the boss arena in a split second without even taking damage! This on top of the MANY grab attacks the new score of enemies have at their disposal makes for an unpleasant experience at times as a melee focused character that is spending tens of minutes chipping away at massive health bars with a supposed colossal weapon with ""A"" scaling for their stat.With my gripes aside, the RPG elements are on point, the characters, the world, the quests, the variety in play styles? Its better than its ever been! So many options that feel possible and fun, not simply more difficult for the flex. I recommend Elden Ring to veterans and new comers to Fromsoft flavored RPGs, simply because it has the options to make it as difficult as you want it to be, with the introduction of NPC monster summons that are mostly unconnected to character progression, and the ease of access to multiplayer (If you don't mind the potential invader PvP opponent), it can be a cake walk. There is no reward for making the game harder on yourself, its purely for yourself, no achievements or secret items, just play it however you want to play it.If you haven't yet, pick it up, I didn't cover everything right or wrong with the game, and there is plenty more to say, but find out for yourself."
Positive,"Elden Ring deserves the 10/10 it got but I give it a 9/10. My only issue with the PC version specifically is the random frame drops in the game while playing on a RTX 3050 Ti, if it were to get fixed in the future my rating will be a 10/10."
Positive,"Good game. killed last boss 5 times so far and love it.Pros :Plenty of things to explore.Nice open world.Alot of unique bosses that are fun to fight.Alot of diffrent weapons and armors.Nice story in a nice setting.Plenty of challanges and frustration.Usually if something is too hard you can go explore somewhere else and hopefully powerup.cons:Some overpowered aspects make the game too easy, like mimic combined with int based magic and high bleed buildup weps like claws, this can burst down bosses so fast there wont be any challange.Mouse and keyboard support isnt that good, could use some splitting of buttons like dodge/sprint etc.Some bosses are recycled alot of times, even ending up as normal enemys in the end.Alot of builds/stats SEEMS TO ME to be underwhelming compared to a high int or high dex character(tried faith based, tried str based, just didnt feel as strong. yes str can hit hard but the speed and weight tradeoff is terrible)Invasions was destroyed in this game, if you invade you will ONLY face 2 or 3 players and you are alone..Co-op could be improved instead of being a resource dependant single instance based summon that you cant ""rest"" with or have another go with.input queueing is a horrid thing, specially for heavy weapons.Imagine using a colossal sword and pressing twice to attack but something unexpected happens, and ur stuck 4 seconds in attack animation while being murdered, same goes with double rolls.Bosses can on rare occations (some more than others *cough tree-spirit* ) bug out and just stand still.Dragonkin soldiers are bugged, stand in the left kneecap and he will just push you along while you freely hit him..a couple of instances of mobs outside of bossrooms that can hit you thru the barrier or in castle sol even teleport into the bossroom.oh and get rid of Malenias heal on hit.. beyond stupid haha."
Positive,Best Dora the explorer expansion
Positive,Time for pickle
Positive,early impressions - fix stutters and it's 10/10
Positive,"This is how games should be. No battlepass, no game store, no lootboxes, no politics. Just a fun game. I'm tired of playing games that shove more shit in my face to buy, I just wanna play games and have fun."
Positive,"This is the exception. Its literally, the only single time you can ever trust a review from a major ""gaming review"" platform, or ""game critics"". Not only does it live up to the hype, it surpasses it.This is the new defining standard of an open world RPG period."
Positive,"First Review - Great game, but until framerate and stuttering issues are not fixed, I'll leave a negative review. I Can play at 60 fps constant in max settings, but sometimes in the open world, it stutters A LOT. Even people with RTX 3080 + are complaining. It doesn't matter if i set ALL to low/med, stuttering still happens. It's an optimization problem.(i7 7700k + RTX 2070 Super).Updated Review - After some time, performance issues have been addressed (i guess) and the game runs much better and smoother.I will be very disappointed if it does't win GOTY 2022M A S T E R P I E C E"
Positive,"My pick for  'Game of the Year 2022'  without a doubt!Despite its poor optimization at launch, the experience was incredible! I can't fully express how mysterious and intriguing it was to explore the world. Looking for quest hints, finding out where to go, discovering well hidden secrets, discussing it all with your friends and hopping into each others' games to beat bosses was incredibly memorable! It truly belongs in the catalog of the best games ever made!It offers a challenge that is fair, tough but not too difficult; something you would aspire to achieve. I hope this game gets more optimized for older machines. I did feel the user experience of things like menus could have been better for PC controls. They felt quite dated (more or less the same as DS/Sekiro) and non-intuitive for M&K. I eventually learned to play on controller as well.All in all, a fantastic game with an intriguing story and an amazing open-world that will remind you of old school masterpieces. Besides GOTY, I would give it the 'better with friends' award, the 'outstanding visual style' award, the 'best soundtrack' award and the 'best game I suck at' award, no regrets!"

Positive,when the game was out for ONLY 48H i had 32H on record...... Its an amazing game but.. i also need a life :)
Positive,"10/10.Up there with Dark Souls 1 and Sekiro for me.Ranni is best waifu, comet azur is OP, Mohg is super weird. This game is awesome."
Positive,Very Hard to beat some of the Bosses but very addictive!
Positive,"So much to do, huge world, numerous and varied enemy and area designs that are great, really awesome boss design and a *lot* of unique bosses. It's a hard game if you're not used to Souls games, but I highly recommend it if you have the patience for it. It has minor performance issues on my minimum spec machine (I'm not riding 60FPS), but it's far from making the game unplayable or even uncomfortable. It's a huge step up from a typical Dark Souls experience in terms of scope -- FROM has done an amazing thing here."
Positive,"I've been playing the Dark Souls series for a while now, and this is the open world version of the same series. It also adds new elements that were not present in the series. You can use jumping and crouching to defeat enemies stealthily, and many other new elements have been introduced. It's a very good game that keeps the good elements of Dark Souls and blends them well with new elements, making it both nostalgic and fresh at the same time."
Positive,"I'll start with my specs: i5 650016 gb ramRtx 2060ssdGame starts fine and controller detected with no problem.I almost had 5 hours of playtime and I'm very happy with it. I don't know how to lvl up, but I Will find it soon... I guess.It's a 10/10 for me. I started streaming on twitch from unpacking if you want to see it. akilar84https://www.twitch.tv/akilar84/v/1406887474?sr=a"
Positive,"I played Skyrim for 12 years and it's the only open-world RPG I ever played from start to finish multiple times.  I got Elden Ring on sale after it won GOTY, and I spent my first hour totally lost.  I own the Dark Souls games and since I died within minutes of starting them, I never played them again, saving them for later.  With Elden Ring, being more forgivable, I gave this a go and yep, it seemed just as hard, just because it's totally open-world, with no indicators of where to go.  I watched a YouTube tutorial for beginners (about 20 minutes long) and found out some basic fighting skills, and where to get my horse. I am now at that point, and I think I am ready to enjoy this game!  I still need to get the first map, but I found my bearing and can now play without any more hints.  This is a really fun and immersive game.  Recommended to all Skyrim players, just make sure before you give up, try watching some tutorials.  I really want to finish this, then go back and try the original Dark Souls games.Compared to Skyrim, I would say the environment in ER is beautiful, but not as awe-inspiring as Skyrim.  The dragons with their random appearances in Skyrim really added to the excitement, and having just ground enemies in ER so far, despite their enormous size, is pretty ho-hum.  But the fact that this game gives you no pointers of where to go really makes this a little more fun.  There's no hand-holding in this game, and it makes you appreciate your accomplishments that much more.  Bottom line, this game should be something all Skyrim fans should have in their collection.  There's room for both in our lives.  I will always be a Skyrim fan first, but this game will most likely make me a Souls fan over time.  The GOTY award to me means it was a game released this year that is worthy of everyone's attention - and ER is definitely worthy of it.  For Greatest Of All Time (GOAT) that is not Elden Ring.  It's not Skyrim.  I think the GOAT is yet to come. Got to love the constant evolution of gaming!"
Positive,"It's yet another souls game with the same technical caveats. But your first playthrough should net you at least 80 hours if you are actually exploring.0 Ultrawide support. I'm talking those sexy black letter boxes in gameplay! Hell yeah!The only work around does not let you play online. (Unless you use the COOP mod, which I recommend highly recommend)Also 60fps cap if that bothers you. But then you aren't a real souls player"
Positive,A culmination of every soulsborne title Miyazaki's development team have created. This is like DarkDemonsSoulsBourneSekiro: BOTW Ultimate edition. It adapts so many mechanics from previous titles and fleshes them out in interesting new ways. The world is gorgeous. The combat is fluid. Game is good.
Positive,"Great game, with amazing graphic design. For a New player, or a soulbrone veteran everyone would be able to find something they enjoy, Be it the combat or the amazing lore behind everything. Which was written by none other than George R. R. Martin. The game has a lot of replay-ability be its speed running or enjoying the free choice of doing everything you want. Game of the Year100/10"
Positive,"try fingers,but hole"
Positive,Best game of all time.
Positive,S6-8 of GoT was sacrificed for this
Positive,"Try finger, but hole."
Positive,Instead of running around for 5 minutes and getting killed I now get to run around for 30 minutes.
Positive,"A masterpiece, deserves all the praise it gets. I was hesitant at first to get it since I never played a soulslike game before but I've played games similar to it and I didn't think I'd enjoy it but oh boy I am addicted to this game. It's rare to get such a polished game and with so much content nowadays.Its not for everyone and its ok but this is probably the most accessible souls game so far. The inital struggle learning the game is worth it."
Positive,"I don't want to recommend this game to people who value their time, because it's very time-consuming, sometimes repetitive and usually frustrating, and often tries to f you up, and is very cryptic and confusing, and also is too big and expansive so you'll probably get bored over time.I still had a lot of fun somehow, idk"
Positive,"I don't get the negatives. I have no graphical issues and it runs capped at 60 fps on a 4k HD monitor on ultra settings. Not that the graphics is what makes this game great though. I'm enjoying myself possibly more than I've done in previous Souls games here. The more ""true"" open world design is great and we still have the feeling of a typical souls game. The only thing I'm hoping for now is really skins for the mount so that I may feel like a true knight! If you're not a souls player or seriously looking to get into the genre I'd probably stay away of course but I don't think you should give a game a negative review due to your own lack of effort to learn how to play it. Just refund it and don't leave anything at all then to be honest. And go play a game for kids like fortnite that requires zero effort."
Positive,"The note said ""chest ahead"" at the edge of a cliff with nothing in sight...there were plenty of bloodstains but they must've missed the jump... I had to be sure"

Positive,"As of me writing this review, I just got done playing for 9.6 hours straight on release. That being said; Here's my review.It's f*cking amazing. It's got some stutters here and there but holy sh*t it's a wonderful game so far and I'm glad to be here for the journey. It lives up to the hype for me, and it's everything I would want from a FromSoft game. Here's to a few hundred hours of Elden Ring!edit: 50 hours in. i've hit a point where my skill isnt good enough and the game steamrolls me. i do not enjoy this. 10/10 game. I will get better and I will overcome the obstacles that this game puts in front of me!edit: 150 hours in. honestly GOTY, love this game. ran into a few hiccups along the way in terms of framerate but its been mostly pleasant"
Positive,"This is such a gaming master piece.  After all the failed games of the 2020s, this came forward and anally railed any other game that even thought they were on a level similar to them.  Elden Ring is so beautiful, so smooth, and so challenging that it brings the best and worst out of you in the best ways possible.  The bosses are as disturbing as they are memorable, the grind can last anywhere form several hours to several weeks, and the enemies are plentiful and ready to kill; my only recommendation is you best be the first to attack, else be the first to die.UPDATE AFTER DLC:  I know have acquired many, many hours in Elden Ring.  The DLC is CHALLENGING, it is DIFFICULT, and it is, most importantly, FUN!  I just want, so so BADLY, for there to be a second DLC, because good god I just want to continue playing over and over!"
Positive,"Just buy it, and don't give up. You won't regret it.EDIT: 150 hours later, certified GOTY"
Positive,i think im in love
Positive,after 100 hours of the game i can say that this game is a powerhouse in terms of the gameplay: every single second of the playtime you have something interesting and entertaining to do. Lore is poggers too....

Positive,All the things we love packed into one game: Massive content that you would see sold as DLCs in other games.One Ring to bind us all... into really wholesome gaming... apart from the missing final optimization on release.
Positive,"A Legendary Game, An Instant Classic Fromsoft's  Elden Ring  is an awe-inspiring title. Breaking away from the semi-open-world level design of previous souls-games,  Elden Ring  features a world ripe for exploration. The world invites the player to search high and low, every corner of the map, rewarding those who take the time to look with various items to further their progression and 'ease' some of the combat.To those who have been curious of playing souls-games but worried about the difficulty,  Elden Ring  is great game to give it a shot. While  Elden Ring  can be challenging, the game is easier than its Dark Souls cousins. Co-op is more encouraged with plentiful materials to craft the needed co-op item to play with others. Remember, there are always players ready to help others near tough bosses.  Short Summary   Elden Ring  invites the player into a fractured world that has fallen from its glory. With few friends to guide the player, it is up to them to restore order to the world, however, if that is indeed their choice. The classic elaborate dungeons from Dark Souls entries is still present in the form of ""Legacy Dungeons"". These dungeons retain the same feel Dark Souls dungeons have on a smaller more varied scale. Contrasting against the tight dungeons, the open world lets the player breathe, letting them explore the vast world to level up, complete quests, and gain better gear. With the ability to traverse great distance on horseback, the rich world of Elden Ring  awaits you to become the next Elden Lord! Summary Extension As is tradition, Elden Ring  does very little to hold-the-hand of the player, respecting the player's intelligence to find the next main boss, the next quest location, etc. Listening to dialogue in Elden Ring  is as important as ever, skipping it is a surefire wayto send you to a quest guide, though, never hesitate to consult it. Elden Ring  Has multiple endings and as of writing this 6  have been found. Each one has its own pre-requisite that is tied to getting a certain item or completing a certain quest. The player will have a moment after defeating the final boss on choosing which ending they can take.  Some Note Worthy Positives  Elden Ring's  combat is near identical, if not completely, as previous souls entries. Those who have played other souls titles will feel right at home. The precision of combat is all present and feels great. The weighty, slow, methodical combat is a staple of what makes souls-combat enjoyable and gratifying once a challenge is overcome. The musical scores in this game are god-tier. Not much else to say.Boss designs are as fantastic as ever, each with their own unique ways to send you back to bonfi- I mean 'sight of grace'. The visual spectacle of watching their flurry of attacks in their arenas is enough to make the first few deaths painless. Some Negatives This game could have been near-flawless if not for some glaring issues: lack of proper keyboard/mouse support & performance issues.The keyboard/mouse support is bare-bones. HUD icons are shown in the Xbox controller format which is as helpful to the player as not showing anything at all. Rebound keys do not update said icons and not all actions can be rebound. For example, to open the map, you need to hit 'G', which isn't told to the player in the beginning except for the controller button. The same goes for switching between tabs in your inventory and accessing your pouches by holding 'F'. Fromsoft can 100% be criticized for their lack of support for keyboard/mouse users, I can only hope their next title can better it.As of writing this, performance issues such as stuttering or low frame rates in certain areas can certainly take the player out of the game or worse, greet them with an untimely ""You Died"". Elden Ring  is not the kind of game you want these issues with, the combat is tight and the boss fights near pixel-perfect. Hopefully these are fixed in the coming months. Closing Thoughts All-in-all, Elden Ring  is a fantastic, near-perfect game plagued only by technical issues. With great gameplay and a deep, intricate story at play, this game is sure to be remembered for years to come."

Positive,"The legacy of Hidetaka Miyazaki continues.. and his team showcases yet again what the gaming industry can be capable of. • No artifical hype• No unoriginal copying• No corrupt marketing strategy• No ingame-shop• No time=money development• No major bugs• No bullsh*tThis game has what every company in the industry should aim for:A fearless vision without being compromised by money, fame and success."
Positive,"This was my first souls game. I am not so interested in the repeated challenge of difficult fights, but rather the open world RPG aspect of the game. It delivers. On both fronts - for someone like me the game allows open world exploration allowing me to skip bosses and (over) level XP until I am ready for a fight, whilst those interested in more of a challenge can choose if/when how to level. The game is beautiful, and obscure, and atmospheric. Best game I've played in a while."
Positive,love this game im deep in
Positive,dont get me wrong its a hard game. but once you get use to combat its still hard. but somehow its still extremely fun to play
Positive,finger print great shield makes me want to burn down buildings

Positive,Not not normally a fan of daiting sims but the mini games between were surprisingly engaging.9/10
Positive,The Game Of The Year
Positive,All my friends are dead and it's my fault.
Positive,Average dad lore before getting nerfed
Positive,Simply a Masterpiece! It's a must buy!
Positive,From software is always the king
Positive,"10/10. The game makes you feel like you've been transported into a painting. If the difficulty is what is keeping you from getting this game, don't let it. The game isn't as difficult as people make it out to be and there are plenty of ways to cheese everything. If you like medieval fantasy, this is a must-have. There's a reason why this was game of the year in 2022."
Positive,"I don't even have words to tell you how amazing Elden Ring is. This comes from me who is a big From Software's games fan. So I'm kinda biased towards them. But they deserve the love from their fans.The game takes ""Souls"" formula and cranks it up to 11. Vast open world filled with puzzles, dungeons, items and enemies. Almost every location just overwhelms you with beauty and epicness. Colossal castles and endless mountains make you feel small. Locations are made with attentention to the details.Gameplay wise - people who love Souls games will sure love this one as well. People who never played games like these - will sure love it too. The game allows players to take a different approaches if some enemy becomes ""undefeatable"".The music and sound design are just marvelous. Every hit you deliver to your enemies makes a satisfying sound. And OST is just pure dophamine. You feel like an strong knight trying to slay the spawn of evil when you fight bosses. I've got goosebumps countless times when I heard new boss' themes.There is just one ""negative"" thing for me in this game. When in other games you could beat all bosses just by learning their attack patterns, Elden Ring seems to have a little different formula. A lot of bosses encourage you to summon players or use other tools to fight them not alone. Also some attack patterns change in speed it seems (don't know if it's true or not, just my feelings). So trying to beat some bosses seems unfair using some strategies.A word about quests. They seem a little hard to follow since they used the same formula Souls games has - NPC's explain you what to do next in cryptic ways. And the world is so large - it's really easy to miss the next step in quest progression.TL;DR - Elden Ring is absolute masterpiece of a game. This is pure art. Other developers should learn from From Software how to make games instead of cloning the same stuff over and over again. Almost every aspect of it is polished and you will sure have a lot of fun playing it."
Positive,"One of the greatest games to be released in recent times. This was the first souls-like game I ever played, and I couldn't put it down even after 13-hour work shifts. Truly addicting and incredibly rewarding gameplay. Amazing story, huge build variation, and unique enemies and bosses. This game provides everything you can want and expect from a AAA experience. If these types of games interest you, this is where you should start!"
Positive,This is one of the games ever made
Positive,the real first strand type souls
Positive,Game of the decade material
Positive,the final game. i'm good after this. time for a new hobby.
Positive,finally a game that lives up to the hype (performance issues aside)
Positive,The only game i need a swear jar for.
Positive,Its fun to hit enemies but not fun when they hit you
Positive,Best game ever made
Positive,"Yup, Dark Souls, but better."
Positive,ratio + L + maidenless + runeless + guard broken + tarnished + touch grace
Positive,Easily #1 game I've played in the past decade.
Positive,"Really didn't want to leave this game a review until I had beaten it and I can safely say that this is honestly the best FromSoftware game ever made, its a culmination of all the Dark Souls games along side a really vast open world so you never feel like there's downtime particularly.Particular boss absolutely wrecking your day?Go off and adventure elsewhere and become stronger and then come back.An amazingly beautiful game with fun combat to boot, feels even smoother than DS3 in my opinion.If you're a FromSoft fan or even just interested in the soulsborne genre I would highly recommend to play this game.10/10, absolute masterpiece and I cannot wait to start on NG+."
Positive,At least somewhere I can get hugs from a girl.
Positive,"I'm enjoying the game, but for some reason I'm having motion sickness while playing the game, I never had this before with any game, only when I used a oculus VR for the first time, from someone that played Sekiro, DS3, Demon Souls Remake and Bloodborne, Elden ring it's the only one that It's giving me motion sickness, there's a whole forum on Reditt about guys that are having the same thing and they never had before, please DEVS give us some fix or acessibility for this, sadge but I will keep trying..."
Positive,Best open world souls game.
Positive,Where is maiden sex???
Positive,fortnite no build
Positive,This is by far the best FromSoftware game ever created. Playing with friends has never been easier!
Positive,My eyes have been blessed
Positive,"So far it's everything I wanted and hoped it would be. Immediately weirder than Sekiro and with a greater range of cool stuff to do. I'm running it on medium settings in 4K on an Radeon RX480 (which is about 6 years old) and I've been *extremely* impressed with the performance, especially for a day 1 release simultaneous with PS5 and Xbox. Averaging 24 FPS on this aging rig is more than I could have hoped for. Runs better than Borderlands 3 or Nioh 2 for comparison.I feel like this recaptures the magic of my first playthrough of Dark Souls. If that's what you want, I couldn't recommend it highly enough."
Positive,So many things to do!. Cant wait for the DLC!!!!!!!!!
Positive,I push rock up hill
Positive,Mad Cause Bad
Positive,PVE in this game is Great probably the best in the series.PVP on the other hand... yeesh.Its actually really fun! until you play against someone with worse internet than you... then its just a guessing game and the laggers win 99% of the time
Positive,"The ultimate Souls game. This is a must-have addition to the library of any serious or casual gamer. Open world, PVE, PVP, arenas, co-op, etc. Now just awaiting the DLC xD"
Positive,"Probably the best game I've played this decade. And the first one in a while I took the trouble of writing a review.Some important TLDR if you are thinking of playing this game but is not sure if it is for you before the actual review:- Elden Ring is the most casual dark souls game, if you came from previous DS games and feel like skipping Elden RIng specifically because they weren't for you , Dont. -Elaborating on the previous point, this game is not for you if you are bad at the game AND gets easily frustrated AND too stubborn to try new things. Almost every enemy in this game can be dealt in many, many different ways. From poisoning a hard hitting Dragon from afar before finishing it to letting big enemies hit themselves to using your horse to drastically change the battle, using very different and specialized summons to help or playing co-op. -The world is not linear, you dont HAVE to beat a boss as soon as you meet him. Explore, find new gear, craftables, level up, explore places with your horse and run away if you can. Be Smart and adventurous because the game rewards you for it. Soon you will be able to get through challenges a lot better.-And lastly, dont quit early in the game, the first few hours are gonna look pretty linear, and believe when I say this game has much more to offer. Try to get to the open world, find your horse or learn how to craft before deciding if it is not for you. That said, the game review:   - 10/10 Incredible exploration with rewards that actually feel like they change the gameplay or reward you properly for exploring. -10/10 Absurd power of choice and build customization , you can swap builds in a run with only a few steps and try out different stuff. The game has over 300 weapons and many more spells, talismans and craftables that are incredibly distinguishable and fun to use. 10/10 Beautiful game , it might not have the best graphics in the market but the scene composition is so well crafted you will feel like it has. This game is an artist masterpiece and the scenery has been crafted with that much care so that whenever you stop to take a rest, you can find the most stunning sights just by looking around. 10/10 Community . The Social aspect outside of the game is amazing, you can find content, forums and people ot talk about it and most are incredibly positive just because of how much they love the game. Even if some things are a bit imbalanced, he community stays positive and earning for more content and you can find studious people or casual people to chat everywhere, its an amazing experience. 10/10 content/cost ratio , this game has so much content Id say it is the first AAA title in a long time it felt worth of spending the full price on, I am almost 300h in and I feel like I`ve still got a lot to see and have fun with everywhere. - 9/10 World Building . Take this with a grain of salt since I enjoy worlds that do not tell you every single thing about it, but let you experience it connecting dots between items, npcs, bossfights. The world is alive you can unveil its mysteries by yourself. If you prefer something more digested you might not enjoy it as much, but it also will not get in the way of your experience. The game does not have complex character or story since it is a heavy action adventure game, but does solid work interweaving the NPC characters and the plot. -9/10 Solid combat system   with different levels of expertise that are not really needed to finish the game and many different styles of gameplay that always impress me on how different and great they feel.The usual dark souls input queue and specialized combat learning curve might turn off some people off but I find it incredibly fair and rewarding when you can pull it off. Diying in this game doesnt feel as bad as in other games since there are many checkpoints and experience is plentyful from exploration 7/10 User Interface . The game has some considerable issues when navigating through menus, Most features you need are there, but sometimes not that well implemented or hidden. Item sorting, Map usage and multiplayer interface are impaired by this. -6/10 co-op Experience . If you came for the co-op, you are gonna have tons of fun because of the above, but you are also gonna get stressed by it, connection issues might happen, playing with friends has many restrictions you don really want in such a great open world, like barriers when transitioning from different areas, not being able to ride the horse together, non intuitive friend summoning interface, or simply not being able to play co-op after clearing area bosses. I think they could have made a few more concessions from the Dark Souls Formula so that this game could shine more in co-op.Overall this game is a solid 9/10, even though I want to give it maximum grade over how much fun I`m having with it, it does have its issues that will turn off some types of player. I just heavily recommend people not to disregard this game if they didn`t enjoy previous Souls titles, Elden Ring is a Master Piece of it`s own.Last PSA if you came from Sekiro, you might get saddened that you can't parry everything, but you will most definitely enjoy the game nonetheless."
Positive,Left my wife to try this game... So I could feel fully immersed... I am maidenless... 15/10 will be Tarnished again.
Positive,Best game I've ever played
Positive,"AS OF 4/6/2022--Most of my technical issues have been resolved, occasionally online functions don't work as they should and I get a crash or two during extended sessions (4 hours +) but most of the time, the game runs well on an older i7 and a 1160Ti. Elden Ring is in the elite class of video games ever created and certainly the best game to come out in recent memory.  If you enjoy videogames at all, you will enjoy this game.  At the very least, support a truly AAA  release that comes with no microtransactions, day 1 DLC, none of that bullshit.  You buy the game you get everything.   I can't recommend it enough to anyone I talk to."
Positive,Most fun I've had getting my butt handed to me over and over and over again. Hours of frustration punctuated by moments of elation. Highly recommended?
Positive,"I made all my characters look like handsome Squidward, even the women 10/10"
Positive,"7/10 for the PC version but overall 10/10Elden Ring is probably one of the best games I've ever played. From the characters, to the story, to the epic boss battles, there's SOMETHING for everyone. Boss battles are probably the best thing about this game (even though they nerfed Radahn). The fashion aspects are really cool though sometimes the alteration on some outfits is kinda useless and I sure wish you could dye some tops and armor pieces. People complain about this game being too hard but then they cant even get past Margit (lol). If you cannot handle taking time to learn and dying to learn the fight (like all other souls games) then this game is not for you. There's lots of exploring and things to collect and because of that I just now recently reached Crumbling Farum Azula and I'm about 100 hours in. I heard NG+ is nice too.But most of my issues come from the PC port. Here's my issues:- Frustrating lag (esp when riding Torrent). The game lags severely at points where you're trying to go fast.- Straight up Freezing either in the middle of a boss battle or on the load screen. When i was fighting Malenia it froze on me three times and it's so frustrating because that is the most challenging fight in the game. When it freezes, I have to completely shut down my PC and reboot again because task manager doesn't even open.- Controller support set default to Xbox controller. Now I use a PS5 controller and I have to guess where my keys are relevant to Xbox controller. This game was also released for PS so i don't understand why its default to Xbox. Should be both no matter the game. I do not want to switch back to Xbox controller just for Elden Ring. I'm used to where these buttons are now but this should really be fixed anyway.- Quest glitches. Some objectives like looking for magic turtles and some of the sort straight up doesn't even show up. And then it progresses the quest anyway?? Weird as heck.I hope Fromsoft fixes the issues with the PC port because it really feels like its just ""oh just another shitty port"" which is the reason why some people won't even buy this game. It's annoying and ruins the experience. Overall I recommend Elden Ring in terms of gameplay and overall scoring. :D"
Positive,Really amazing game that builds upon much of what made the other souls games great. Aside from connection errors while playing online and a handful of bosses that are a bit unfair near the end the game is incredible. 9/10
Positive,"Besides for the multiplayer being a hit or miss, this is genuinely one of the best games I have ever played."
Positive,"why, fia. why."
Positive,"Was really loving it until I encountered disembodied hands with way too many fingers and on occasion hid in the ground or on the walls. I still loved it mind you, but I now I felt uneasy and fearful like some primal fear was awakened within me."
Positive,"8/10 (A-tier)A nice twist on the successful Souls formula with some flaws that keep it from being truly groundbreaking.Elden Ring is basically Dark Souls 4. Many of DS3's pros and cons are also applicable here. However there are things that set it apart from its predecessors, most notably the open world. There is also a bunch of other stuff, for example jumping, horseback riding and QoL improvements. (One of the biggest QoL improvements is that you have to spend a lot less time walking back to bosses after dying to them!)First off and most importantly in my opinion, the open world is done insanely well with a lot of variety. You can find points of interest wherever you go and almost every dungeon rewards you with at least one unique/useful item or a cool boss encounter. There are also many quests and hints which point you towards particular things to do in the world.And the game is absolutely huge. I've seen people who spend over 30 hours in just the first area alone (which is maybe 1/6th of the game or less), finding and doing new stuff the whole time.The world has many distinct looking and expertly designed areas. Luckily, fast travel is readily available and simple to use.There are many small optional dungeons and caves which can be found all over the world. These are mostly pretty similar but still neat to find and fun to explore.There are also a bunch of more important ""legacy"" dungeons which are structured similarly to areas from previous Souls games and these are very fun to explore.One small issue with the world design is that certain environmental assets are reused a bunch of times (like generic castles, ruins, dungeon and cave layouts and such) so you'll start to recognize them over time. But since the enemies and items found there are usually different it doesn't matter much imo. I don't play Souls games to find as many assets as possible, I play it to have fun. And I had fun playing through almost every single dungeon even if they looked roughly the same.While a large amount of the bosses is also reused several times throughout the game there are still tons of significantly different ones overall and they are generally well-designed. There are about 60 different bosses. In total there are over 100 boss encounters but about 40 are duplicates of others (often with some changes to them, mind you). In my eyes the boss variety and design is still great in this game despite that and I didn't mind the refights.Many bosses have strange attack timings though (possibly to throw off veteran players) and can hit very hard, especially in the late game. In my playthrough this didn't affect me for the most part but one or two of the bosses were quite frustrating because I would get through the first phase only to miss one dodgeroll in the second phase because I didn't know the timing yet, basically causing me to die instantly. But yeah, this is a minor gripe for me.The difficulty overall is rather dependent on your build and what abilities you use. In short, the game isn't all that well-balanced.There are many ways to play the game and many tools at your disposal. But many of them just make it very easy and you have to actively avoid them if you want the game to be challenging.You can of course view this as both a downside and an upside because it lets you control how challenging the game is by simply using a corresponding build. But if the build you WANT to use is too weak or too strong for your tastes then it kinda sucks.I myself went through the game using only melee weapons (mostly greatswords, great axes and hammers) without dual wielding and it was enjoyable and the difficulty was just right for me.Graphics and animations are great (though there is definitely stuff being reused from old games here. No judgement on that from me) and the sound design and music are impactful, making for a superb atmosphere. Player-made messages can disrupt this somewhat but they also serve as a simple but effective form of entertainment and quasi-cooperation just like in previous titles. And you can just play offline to get rid of them.The story and side quests are cool but you have to really get into the game to experience them. NPCs can be hard to find and their quests can be difficult to follow. Well, this is the way FromSoftware always does it and I find it rather likeable.Just don't go into this game trying to have a traditional story RPG experience.Coop can be fun, at least when fighting bosses together with random people, but I've unfortunately had tons of disconnects and this is apparently a general problem. Also, after leveling up, getting summoned for early-game bosses by random players becomes basically impossible which is quite sad.Can't say much about PvP as I haven't tried it actively. The few times I did get invaded or had to invade someone else I was mostly killed instantly by overpowered abilities / optimized builds. As someone playing the game casually with a fun but not very powerful build it seems not exactly easy to get into to say the least.The crafting mechanics seem rather pointless. I haven't had to use them at all yet and I also haven't felt like using it yet... most of the craftable items don't seem worth making, much less grinding for.It's neat to have though and the materials add some more item variety I guess.I want to mention that the variety of weapons, armor and spells is very nice. Many of the weapons have unique skills or even movesets and they look pretty cool.The combat is fun and feels similar to Dark Souls 3. However, many bosses have delayed attacks, AoE moves and long combos that provide a challenge even for seasoned Souls players. This can be frustrating but I wouldn't call it bad. It simply makes you learn dodge timing windows and recognize attack patterns.An unfortunate side effect of the large open world is that you're quite likely to go into some areas, dungeons and boss fights over- or underleveled without knowing. Being underleveled isn't a big deal since you can just come back later but being overleveled just makes you sad about not being able to experience the encounters at the intended point of your playthrough.Well, this is a price the game has to pay for trying out the open world concept.There are some performance issues and crashes. This PC port is also a bit clunky in general because some menus and controls are a little weird.The framerate is acceptable for me but still not great. Mostly sitting at 60 but still dropping to around 40 occasionally depending on the area. My specs: RTX 3060 and Ryzen 5 5600X.I could think of a few other problems the game has but all of them would be so minor that it would just be a waste of brain power to even list them. So I'll leave it at this.All in all: If you think your PC can handle the game... and you enjoy Soulslike gameplay and you don't mind the open world aspect as well as some bosses being recycled throughout it then get the game!"
Positive,"The expectations I had for Elden Ring we're incredibly high. Like, *humanity* restored high... I know I'm a fool for casting such wants. However, Elden Ring has proven itself to exceed my expectation. Astronomic as they were, this experience is the best thing I have yet to encounter. It's beyond a game. It's art in it's finest. but hole"
Positive,"If you are a lover of souls games, but always wanted to explore just a bit more of the worlds that Fromsoft made, then this is it. It is so vast yet and still holds true to the idea that your path to the ending is however you want to make it. The variety of new spells look awesome, and so many armors now have capes. If you don't like capes you can have them removed. Lots of interesting weapons and the inclusion of Ashes of War (weapon arts from Dark Souls 3) that you can swap between weapons is really neat."
Positive,Never liked Souls games before. but this just clicked.
Positive,"An incredible 10/10 if you like Fromsoftware RPGs. Hopefully even if you don't, but maybe not."
Positive,great game breathtaking visuals and great new add ons. i love the fact the game actually punishes you for doing co-op to try get through the game faster
Positive,"Open world Dark Souls. If that sounds good to you, Elden Ring will be amazing. It improves on the soulsborne formula in many ways while retaining the core elements that make the genre so enjoyable."
Positive,"goty game forever, shadow of the erdtree goty expansion, Bloodborne pc port next?"
Positive,"No support for Ultrawide display resolutions, consistent crashes if you use HDR in fullscreen mode and click out of the window for any reason, controller recognition is pretty buggy.Despite these technical issues the game is great. If you like any of the other Soulsborne games this one is an obvious purchase."
Positive,Probably the best souls game right now and the best place to start for a new souls player. Shadow of the Erdtree added another Elden Ring inside Elden Ring so there is an enormous amount of content in this game. Highly recommended.
Positive,"This game is phenomenal. There's not much else to say about it. The world is beautiful, the gameplay is challenging yet satisfying, and the story is what's to be expected from FromSoftware. There is so much content I don't think I'd be able to experience all of it within even 100 hours.I see a lot of reviews are about the PC stuttering, however this is not a reflection on the amazing quality of the game. I have played it both on my desktop and home and on a travel computer (that literally has just Intel integrated graphics) and other than very occasional stuttering it runs at 60fps.Overall, the game has been thoroughly enjoyable and I cannot wait to replay it after I finish the first playthrough."
Positive,"I seriously dont understand how people are having issues with this game, I have good specs, not a single bug or issue. in 10 HOURS ive seen maybe 3 hitches for a second or two, no crashes. nothing that even effects gamplay. i mean ffs my 3090 doesnt even clock up, it is sitting at 800mhz 80% usage.Even on the discord I was on, I LITERALLY say someone with a 970 running the game fine????I feel like these people either do not meet the specs, or have neglected to update their drivers and restart... and instead chose to blame the devs.I am SHOCKED how well this game runs. its a huge open world, yeah, its gonna load stuff and lag from time to time.  running it off a HDD is gonna suck, nothing you can do about that. but FFS its 2022 if you are seriously gaming on PC and can drop 60-80 USD on a game. go buy a 20$ SSD to put your games on lol.ACTUAL REVIEW TIME (placeholder)Ive played 10 hours and have gotten to the castle, the gameplay is solid, if not a little easy for the first 7 hours, dont worry it gets TOUGH. I feel like my biggest issue so far is having trouble finding things im looking for, i have tons of t2 and 3 smithstones, but no t1, very annoying. This will only get better as the game is discovered and explored but still.After hitting the roadblock at the castle, I decided to go back and scour the starting area for upgrade mats. I certainly missed a lot, especially as there seem to basicallly be dungeons where you clear them to get loot.I do like the overworld aspect, but I think the horse combat leaves a lot to be desired. I started Uchi so IDK how it is with different weapons. The horse combat boils down to holding one direction on the stick while unlocked and mashing the trigger. at least for smaller enemies, its not so bad for thegiant minibosses.One thing that has greatly benefitted this game is its sense of scale, it already feels MULTITUDES larger than the other games combined.I can only see it getting better.I will probably come back and expand on this later when I have played more, but I will leave this part in.Give the game a try, dont listen to the people who are either being dishonest or too ignorant to update and restart. in a discord of more than 50 people, even ones with low specs the only thing I saw people have an issue with is the mouselook. and I mean cmon, its a controller game, but whatever. hopefully that will be fixed."
Positive,Big Darksouls innit
Positive,"Miyazaki you cruel cruel man, you've done it again. Stunning visuals and challenging but rewarding game play."
Positive,"Oh, I got to tell you, it was perfect. Perfect! Everything, down to the last, minute details."
Positive,"Wonderfull game!!!. 9/10. I only dont give 10 because the things I say below.FromSoftware, have to preform a urgent Quick Patch for: NOTE: (I'm playing with a NVidia RTX 3080, i7 10700k with 32GB 3200Mhz RAM)- The FPS drops abit sometimes from 60 to ~50+, no mather what resolution we are.- A Fix for shadows on fooliage, trees and some shadows on rocks.- Adding a option for Raytracing.- Adding a option for DLSS / AMD Supersampling Resolution / AMD FidelityFX.But for me overall the game it's a MASTERPIECE.Thank you FromSoftware."
Positive,"one of the best games I played this year spent a lot of time on it and had tons of fun probably has the best visual effect and tons of combat style and replayability the PVP  is good most of the time it is unfair because most of the time it will be 1v2 or 1v3 hope they fix this for fellow invaders and for co-op it is fun wish it would be possible that both the host and summons could ride torrent it would be really fun to explore like that and Elden's ring is big and I mean it its one of the biggest games from soft has ever made I can't imagine how many times I reached somewhere after 80 hours and said yeah this must be the end there are no more areas to explore but then I get surprised when I find another huge area and boss in short, it is worth your time and your money differently worth playing"
Positive,"Bro.... get it.  I recommend this game to anyone.  If you like FromSoftware games, it's a no-brainer, but you probably already have the game and love it if you are a FromSoftware fan.  If you are tired of AAA games sucking on release, get this game.  It has not only lived up to the hype, in my eyes, but it has surpassed it.  The Bosses are phenomenal and the score is jaw-dropping as always.  The lore is not shoved down your throat but it is super rich and in-depth for those that want to learn more about the world.  This game's environments and art direction are unlike anything I have ever seen in a video game.  The sheer variety in the massive and I mean MASSIVE open world is just staggering.  I remember when I first got teleported to Caelid by a trapped chest, and I immediately assumed that it was the last area in the game.  Little did I know that it was just a mid-game area and I had barely scratched the surface of what Elden Ring had to offer.  If you like open-world games and want a more engaging experience where the game does not treat you like a toddler by giving you a million indicators telling you where to go, this game is for you.  I haven't truly enjoyed an open-world game since God of War and Red Dead 2.  This game has sparked new life into the genre and has honestly given me hope for the future of AAA gaming.  Some developers do still care.  If this review still has not convinced you, have fun playing Madden 2022.  For those of you who I have convinced, Enjoy this MASTERPIECE."
Positive,"First of all: GOTY for me and probably the best game I have played since Divinity: Original Sin 2.It's a ton of fun, it's hard enough so one does not just breeze through the game, but easy enough to keep one motivated playing it. If a boss or area feels too difficult, one can just explore another region, level up and find better gear, so one can come back and continue ones original path.The quests can be frustrating, if one does not carefully read or remember stuff. Then again the conversations usually are so short, that the information on where to go or what to do next is packed into two sentences. Some quests do not abide to this and will have one questioning if there even is more to whatever one just did. Since they added the NPCs to the map, they at least fixed some quests where one can not be sure what to do next.The builds one can go for in the game are great and one is not locked into whatever one has chosen so far. At least not up until one point in the game, roughly 20-30% in. There is no unlimited re-specialising tho, so still choose wisely.The World is vast, with a couple of different biomes and a lot of caves, hills and structures to explore. Most of those will have a boss waiting for one at the end. There are over 200 bosses in the game, ranging from slightly stronger soldiers to huge dragons, so there is definitely enough to kill!Elden Ring has six different endings, so the replay value lies not only in the different builds, but also in the different endings.This game got me into the Soulsborne Series. Since finishing Elden Ring, I have completed Demon's Souls Remastered and Dark Souls Remastered, with Dark Souls 2 already installed and waiting for me to get going.This is a clear 10/10 for me, especially since it runs flawlessly under Linux :)"
Positive,"I've just upgraded the Dragonslayer aka Gut's Sword, so i need to give this game a good review. This game took a lot of the unpolisheness of the other FromSoftware's games and evolved it into another level, i loved to see all the unique mechanics of Dark Souls 2; the stealth of Tenchu/Sekiro; the fast combat flow of Dark Souls 3: the scary enemy designs of Bloodborne. Thank you Hidetaka Miyazaki for all the Soulslikes (except my beloved DKS2) that made an important impact in games history."
Positive,"This game is one of a kind,It's not an exaggeration when I say it's one of the best games of all times, It's simply beautiful."
Positive,"""This game is easy!"" Said the naive child, not knowing that he was about to face the strongest boss in the game, SOLDIER OF GODRICK!"
Positive,The best game.
Positive,"Elden Ring is the culmination of everything ""Souls"" that FromSoftware has done and possibly one of the greatest games of all time! The sheer amount of content in this game is astounding! Even more so that the game does not hold your hand. You will be spending an incredible amount of time exploring, fighting and of course dying as you make your way through the Lands Between, discovering interesting locations, enemies, bosses, characters and loot. Honestly this game is so massive that it does not need DLC...however! FromSoftware does have DLC planned for this game and i'm incredibly hyped to play through this colossal game once again!"
Positive,"This game very very very quickly became my favourite game of all time. Especially after finishing the entire Dark Souls series a couple of months before. Elden Ring offers you an experience that no other game (as of right now) does. Complete freedom in a fantasy soulslike game to go and do whatever you want. Not only that, but it provides hundreds of hours of unique playtime with random questlines, random bosses and completely optional areas. If you want a game to get lost in and realise that its 5am before you've even been to the toilet, this is the game!- Yes, this game may be hard for complete beginners but the game also encourages you to make it easier for yourself by exploring and getting new items that make you more powerful.- I recommend this game to absolutely everyone! If you do the tutorial and read the messages on the floor, the game can hold your hand for as long as you need it. Also don't be afraid to google or youtube some things if you are struggling. There are plenty of friendly youtubers that will have posted material that will assist you along the way. So good luck tarnished, and PRAISE THE SUNPffft... Maidenless..."
Positive,"First souls-like game for me. Amazing experience, 10/10"
Positive,I played it for 30 hours straight. Now i have beat ng +7 ez.
Positive,You are so... Very warm...
Positive,"Disclaimer: this is my first From Software game, I am completely new to the otherwise famous ""Souls formula"".A brilliant game, one of the (if not THE) best open world game I have ever played. The world is amazingly built, and always invite to explore a bit further because you have just spotted some ruins, or a bizarre group of enemies guarding something potentially valuable. Graphically, the game is beautiful, not transcendant, but light effects and the art direction is great.The fighting is very hard to master, BUT the game manages to provide many helps for poor player such as myself. You can escape most fights, except crucial ones like bosses. Once you manage to understand your weapon and its own flow of attack, you can get some real rewarding moments.The story is intriguing. There is almost no narration or cutscene in the game, you barely understand the world around you, which is akin to the character you will incarnate in this game. A few dialogues and NPCs will give you some hints, but my guess is that you won't understand everything at stake until the very end.Sound design is great, it will indicate threats, interesting points, etc. and the music is grandiose.My only gripe with the game is that it's set in a med fan universe. It's very well crafted, but I wish we had a more unique universe to explore. So you will get your regular collection of enemies: humans, wizards, dragons, fantastic beasts, poisonous plants, etc. Ugghh, you know the recipe."
Positive,first review ever through 11 years says a lot
Positive,Dark Ring - Elden Souls #42!This game is special.
Positive,I loved it. Nothing else to say.
Positive,"Love DS3, but THIS game - much better.Well Done!"
Positive,Amazing game! 15 hours & I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.
Positive,better map design than DS1
Positive,"So you seek the safe haven on the Round Table?SAY NO MORE. But wait, you thought you are guarded inside? Think again Tarnished, THINK  / / John Wick is just around the corner lurking (in Color Red) / /  24 hours of gameplay - Level 40Simply 10/10"
Positive,"30% less repeating content and a smaller open world would have made ER a much better experience in my opinion.There is just something missing in this game and it is hard to pinpoint but I think there are a couple of issues that I have with the game.-I think the open world concept denies this title the identity that the level design of the souls series provided. Maybe a smaller, less bloated, and more compact/concentrated world, would have made the game more enjoyable to me. I really liked the first major boss fight and the castle leveldesign wich was technically just an old souls dungeon/level.    For anyone who has played the souls series, think of how it felt when you first discovered Anor Londo, or the picturesque scenes from Irithyll of the Borreal Valley as just two examples.In the souls series, every area had its own ambience, and felt unique, like you were truly discovering something. As a result, the bosses of these areas felt synonymous to the zones that they were contained in. Now, this is likely due to me having much more time in the souls series than in ER,  but in ER it feels as if you just stumble upon a boss in a random area that isn't significant and is just a hurdle to clear. In the souls series, the bosses where way viewer in number, but it felt like they where conquering their respective zone. Regardless i really enjoyed some of the worldbuilding and lore in ER. -The early bosses are overtuned. The progression ramps way too quickly in Elden Ring as well. The tutorial boss in ER is absolutely trival, and takes obscene amounts of damage. Compare this to Iudex Gundyr, who although is an easy boss all things considered, is an excellent way to introduce the player into the difficulty level of the bosses of the game in terms of approximate damage given and received, and mechanics. The tutorial boss in ER sets the player up to fail with such an abysmally easy tutorial boss.I'm sure I could think of more if I thought about it longer but these are the things that immediately come to me when I think of ER."
Positive,"I will never, ever, ever be finished playing this game.I'm writing this at over 300 hours in, and I just found a new chunk of world map.I think back on memories I have of this game like an old man remembering World War II.""Ah, yes. I remember being level 20. In February. That was a long time ago."""
Positive,"A fantastic game with fun gameplay mechanics, tons of ways to fight, loads of weapons to learn, interesting boss fights and amazing story you learn more about every time you play! Definetly hard ass hell when you start though, so be ready for pain lol"
Positive,"Constant freezing, fps drops.  Running on a 2070 super at high settings.  GPU maxing out at 70% usage, cpu at 30%.  Fix your crap Namco/From SoftwareEDIT: still a fantastic game"
Positive,I love pot man
Positive,Is this game hard? Yes! Is this game addictive? Yes! Do I recommend this game? Oh hell yes!
Positive,"Started the game as a samurai. Walked into a large room and got promptly dunked on by a giant spider. After this I wandered out of the first area and was promptly stomped on by a knight in gold. While it may not be as dingy or have ""Souls"" in the title it is indeed a souls game."
Positive,"Changed review to positive, since they fixed their multiplayer.Some minor issues here and there, but nothing too gamebreaking. Having progressed through the game more, I can say that I love the atmosphere of it, the whole world and story. People who dislike PvP and invasions should think twice before getting in, since you cannot freely coop with a friend without getting invaded."
Positive,"After 190 hours on PC and 300+ on all other consoles combined, and now beating and replaying the DLC. I can say this game is as close to a 10 out of 10 as a game can get. Its not perfect because nothing in this world is, but it is a close to perfection as a game could come. The Story, NPCs, Bosses, Weapons, Spells, World and Arena design are all fantastic. Very few things in this game seem rushed or half-. IMO this is the best game that has ever won GOTY and I think it deserves every award it has ever gotten. They only downside to this game is that some people, simply won't play it because it IS hard, if you never keep trying or look for items or weapons to help you. However if you are someone that is willing to put in the work and effort to play this game, you will find one of the defining creations of the entire Video Game world."
Positive,"Finally the long awaited new FromSoftware game is here, here's my take on it.First of all, the performance. I'm playing this game at 1080p with a GTX1060(6gb) and an i5-8400 on medium-high settings (Grass, Shadows and Lighting on medium, everything else High with Textures maxed). During the 36h i've played the game i've only had a few short lasting stutters every now and then in the open world, nothing game-breaking, with the game running mostly at 60 fps with a few drops i've had down to 54~ while i'm looking towards some areas, still nothing game-breaking. While me and my friends haven't had any major issues, it's understandable that -while not the majority- some people might have some more apparent ones. On a general note, the game definitely isn't running as poorly as some people make it out to be, especially with some temporary fixes posted by the community (until the game gets patched), which solve most performance issues and reduce the stuttering  to a minimum.Now on the gameplay part:Fromsoftware really outdid themselves this time with Elden Ring, this game arguably takes the top spot from all the souls games for me. While the game is not on the high end graphically, so far the world, enemies, NPCs and the art direction of the game in general is superb, truly going beyond my expectations (I can't even count all the times i've stopped to stare at the scenery while exploring).  The open world features a lot of things to explore including mini dungeons and field bosses (some secret ones, some appearing only during certain periods). The normal enemies are not too few and not that many to the point where it becomes mind numbing, I believe they've found a good balance. The combat is -for the most part- similar to their previous titles (who would've expected FromSoftware's new souls-like game to have souls-like combat) while they took on the good parts from the previous ones and expanded on them, making it one of the most -if not the most- enjoyable one so far. The new Ash of War system lets you switch the weapon skills of your weapons, adding even more customizability to your play style, and while there's a few re-used skills from previous titles (i think that's good, some of them were pretty fun to use) they've still added a ton of new ones, so i see them as extra additions. The horse combat and controls feel solid, not too realistic but at the same time not too arcade-y, i could even go as far as to say it's probably the most fun mounted combat i've had in an action game. The OSTs, oh the OSTs! As expected from a FromSoftware game, they're marvelous and bring back that bone-chilling and goose bump inducing vibe all the past Soundtracks had. I. Can't. Get. Enough.Did the game live up to the hype? As a big Souls fan, it seems like i still wasn't hyped up enough for this game!As someone who plays their first Souls-Like? You might either love it, or hate it after dying to the first boss a dozen times. Fromsoftware's games don't hold you by the hand and are quite punishing, requiring some patience until you've played enough to improve at them, obviously they won't be to everyone's liking.I could go on and on, but i think my review is messy enough already. I just wrote it up on the spot, so it could definitely use some tidying up, sorry for the mess~TLDR;-For people that like souls-like games and enjoyed From's previous titles, this is an amazing game and a must.-For people that like action RPGs and have it on their radars, but haven't played souls-like games before and have the patience to die multiple times while trying to improving in the game, it's definitely worth a try."
Positive,"Elden Ring is the Magnum Opus of the Souls Franchise.It takes all the best parts of all the other souls games and amplifies them by a multitude of 10. It has the intricate and well-crafted world-building and level design of Dark Souls 1 expanded to every legacy dungeon and every area across the map. There are times when I am playing this game where I think, ""Surely there wouldn't be something hidden here in a place so far away from the main content,"" but like the other souls games, Elden Ring rewards players for attentiveness and exploration. Few developers have the confidence in their players to put some of the best areas and fights behind optional areas, and FromSoftware does this more in Elden Ring than any of their games in the past.The amount of content in this game is like two souls games combined, and maybe that is even cutting it short. This is made better by the insane amount of variety that Elden Ring gives. Playing a spellcaster in this game is better than all of the other soulsborne games. The wide range of spells, the application of each of them, and the fact that you can hold them to increase their damage or release them early for a faster attack makes playing a spellcaster more dynamic than ever before. But the depth of combat doesn't end at spellcasting. The fluidity of melee combat seems to have carried over from Dark Souls 3, but made several magnitudes more complex. If you have played any of the previous Souls games before, you would quickly notice that light attacking (R1) is the best way to play the game, but with Elden Ring, Melee combat encourages players to use their entire weapon's kit. Mechanics like guard counters, enemy stagger, charging attacks, curved sword feints, and powerstancing just to name a few add so much variety and replayability to Melee combat alone. It is like they have taken the complexity of combat in Dark Souls 2 and combined it with the fluidity of combat in games like Dark Souls 3, Bloodborne, and Sekiro.The presentation of the lore of the game is, in my opinion, an improvement on the previous Souls games. For the Dark Souls games specifically, the lore was cryptic at best and left players feeling lost and purposeless at worst, often relying on community videos and posts to figure out the story of the game. But the way that the lore is presented in this game is more easy to follow for the average player, allowing players who do not want to spend hours reading every item description to understand what is happening and to be more engrossed in the world.Because Elden Ring is an open world game, it is simultaneously the hardest Soulsborne game and the easiest Soulsborne game at the same time. If someone just wants to do the main story, they can, and it will be difficult. People can start off the game with the first boss they fight being Margit. These players will have a hard time with the fight, but the fight is still very much doable as an experienced player's first fight. The first ""main"" fight in Elden Ring, is much harder (in terms of boss mechanics) than the first bosses of the other souls games: Asylum Demon (DS1), The Last Giant (DS2), and Iudex Gundyr (DS3). However, Elden Ring offers the players the opportunity to do some side content: to explore the world, to meet NPCs, to find new items and upgrade materials, and to learn spells, all in the quest to get stronger to challenge Margit. A player fighting Margit an hour into the game and a player fighting Margit 20 hours into the game will have completely different experiences. This means that for hardcore players, the game is the hardest Soulsborne game, but for the more casual player, it can be the easiest. FromSoftware has done a perfect job allowing Elden Ring to be both simultaneously the hardest Soulsborne game for players who want it and the easiest for players who just want to experience the world. If this is your first Soulsborne game and you are afraid to play it because you think it is too hard for you, with enough patience and determination, I promise you can beat it. This is true for all Soulsborne games, but it is true for Elden Ring most of all.By mixing together and amplifying the best parts of the previous games: the complexity of the world and sense of interconnectedness from Dark Souls 1, the depth of combat from Dark Souls 2, the fluidity of combat from Dark Souls 3 & Bloodborne, the polish of mechanics from Sekiro, and new ideas like the ability to do side content to prepare for main content & the more open telling of lore, Elden Ring has not only lived up to the hype, but surpassed it. Elden Ring is truly the Magnum Opus of the Souls Franchise, and its nothing short of a 10/10 for me."
Positive,It's BIG Dark Souls
Positive,"After beating the game (and hopefully the DLC soon), I can say that this game has forever changed the way I view games. It is one of the best games I have ever played. Without a doubt was money well spent."
Positive,i hate this fucking game
Positive,"Really good, one of the best from software games (only loses to bloodborne) and it will definetly be a contender for best game of the decade."
Positive,"Be wary of madness, First off, Try Jumping, Hidden path away, You don't have the right, O You don't have the rightO Elden ring, O Elden ring,O Elden ring, O Elden ring,I can't take this.... I want to go home..... O I want to go home....."
Positive,"I have played 53 hours of the game and have barely touched the wonderful story, fantastic side quests, creative weapons, and overwhelming amount of content this game has, and that is all without mentioning the fact that there is so much replayability between side objectives and the builds you can make. This game is a breath of fresh air after game after game releasing unfinished and uninspired. This game is a perfect 10/10 and may end up as my favorite game of all time as I spend more time playing. Update: Amazing all the way through."
Positive,"I've never been a big soulslike fan. However THIS GAME is spectacular. The freedom to go where you want and fight what you want feels amazing. Not to mention the sheer number of possible weapons and builds you can go for is great.There isn't much in the way of multiplayer, but seeing the ghosts and messages of players who have come before me makes me feel happy. Like I'm being guided by friends even if I'm playing alone.Thanks for a fantastic time, FromSoftware.S-Tier Game"
Positive,"The game is totally approachable. It was my first Fromsoftware game. Do I die a bunch, totally but the fact is there is a great feeling when something normal would just decimate you and you literally learn the game and overcome that thing. I like the open aspect because if something is giving me a lot of trouble I can just move beyond it and get a little better elsewhere then circle back. I thought it was really attractive and that growth actually felt like growth, all in all, this thing is just an absolute delight."
Positive,"Rating : 9.5/10Graphics : 10/10Performance : 8/10Atmosphere : 9/10Game mechanics : 9.5/10Open world : 9.5/10One of the best souls like game I ever played and I played all the souls series. You will be addicted to it's amazing graphics, combat and lore. From software really did a good one this time. For people who has FPS problems, Don't worry it's only the front maps that are not optimized. Most of my lags are only against the tree sentinel. I can assure that as I already almost completed the game. I haven't played such a great game since The witcher 3. PRAISE THE ELDEN RING !!"
Positive,"I've never played a game before and thought ""Wow, I only paid $60 for this???"" There is no doubt that elden ring is my new favorite game of all time."
Positive,Game of the Year
Positive,I wish to send a pipebomb to Miyazaki
Positive,"Game engine selects integrated graphics by default, you have to go to nvidia control panel to force it to use actual graphics card. The game is optimized just fine."
Positive,"My first Souls-like game.  Once you give up on button mashing rage and learn your skills, learn the enemy patterns, it all starts coming together.  I can honestly say this has broken the open-world exploration genre for me.  Every nook and cranny in this gorgeous game begs you to explore it (...carefully).  I am genuinely interested in the story, the lore, figuring out where to go or just picking a direction and going there to see what's over the horizon.  No quest markers.  No level-specific areas.  No level-scaling.  If this doesn't reset the bar then nothing will.  I don't think I can go back to the way games like these have been done in the past.  So then I will wait patiently, tarnished, exploring my little corner of the Lands Between until I am done and, when the other games from From Software go on sale,  I must resume my journey."
Positive,"So far I only have 4.7 hours into the game. I have killed many bosses with little issue as I am a Dark Souls veteran. Honestly I have had no stuttering or frame skips that the down voters are talking about. It's been smooth every minute of my gameplay and I have enjoyed it so far. I have noticed the occasional bug, but nothing that breaks the game or changes the difficulty. Just some floating enemies before they pop back into position. The game is solid, the system they put into place for upgrading yourself and fast travel shows the size of the map and I have yet to unlock the rest of it. This is my early review and it may change. But for now I give this game 2 thumbs up, and if you decide to get it I know that it will be enjoyed."
Positive,man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man
Positive,This game will give you finger a lot
Positive,"Shadow of the Eretree DLC:It is good but not as satisfying as I’d hope for.In classic Fromsoft’s fashion, map design has very interesting interconnectivity, hiding numerous secret areas to explore. Exploring the Land of Shadow is enjoyable, but the first area (Gravesite Plain) and the southern part of the map are massive yet quite empty despite the beautiful scenery.No matter how high your level is, or how good your build is, you are going to get your a$s kicked in the DLC, because collecting Scadutree Fragment is the only way to negate the huge stat spike in enemies. Effectively, collecting fragments is more important than making a good build in DLC, which I am not a fan of because it shifts from the direction of the base game. But I also understand that it doesn’t seem have a better way to balance the difficulty, given the base game is already out for two years and many people are over-leveled with crazy builds.In the base game, lock-on on some large enemies like the ancient dragon is problematic – it is hard to get a melee hit with lock-on because often you can’t see your character not knowing his/her position, but without lock-on, you can’t see the moves of the enemy making you vulnerable to attacks. In the DLC, this problem gets even worse with the lock-on point being weirdly high – you often can’t see your character and can’t see what the enemy is doing either, because the camera gets stuck into the enemy’s body. It also brings dizzy and disoriented feeling with the constant fast movement of the camera. This issue is the worst part of the game.Bosses are a lot harder than the base game, due to the stats spike and much more frenetic move sets, but I have no issues with bosses except for the second phase of the final boss, whom hurt my sanity to fight. Even with Scadutree Fragment +20, most attacks are one-shot kills if the health bar is not top-up. With the insanely fast attacks, there is little room for errors, making it the hardest boss fight in Fromsoft’s history. On top of that, attacks have crazy light effects like flashbangs constantly exploding on your face, not only making it hard to see the moves, but also completely tanking your framerates (can drop from 60 to 30). In a frame-accurate game like Elden Ring, this causes dodging even harder. Therefore, people can only seek cheeky tactics like shield-poking to beat the boss consistently. The fight is cool, but a boss design that has tons of BS and heavily relies on quick reactions just feels cheap and unfair. It falls into the category of being difficult for the sake of being difficult.Fromsoft is very good at the environmental narrative. After beating the final boss and walking down from the tower, seeing the remains of NPCs struck me quite hard. DLC also sheds more light on the lore, still, it leaves something unexplained (Godwyn, the serpent of Messmer, Gloam-Eyed Queen). I actually want to have another expansion just for the lore."
Positive,Might be the best game ever made. Truly something special. Highly recommend.

Positive,it is a king's game
Positive,Yup this is good
Positive,"The things that make Souls games good is the Sense of Discovery, Exploration, & Wonder. The continuous question of ""What's around the next corner"". The accomplishment of discovering something that wasn't Obvious. be it a Quest line that didn't explicitly tell you to slay a ""Ulcerated Tree Spirit"" at the base of a castle. it instead encourages you to figure things out on your own, to explore & find this epic fight, Overcome it & acquire the next part in the quest line you didn't know was there. Because the game doesn't tell you what you have to do the journey doing it becomes all the more important. This is only achievable through not having a Story forced down your throat. a Stark contrast to how most games does it. where they tell you that you can find the gates of Mordor so that you can throw the ring into Mount Doom, And give you a Quest marker to tell you were to go next. that doesn't say that those types of quest lines or stories are bad. but to me it feels like i'm just checking things off a ""Check list"" to get to the next story bit. The game still gives you the hints from the NPC that is the quest. The NPC that continues the quest has said ""I'm looking for something in this castle."" eventually you find him sitting in the ""Home Base"". no longer able to move & Flies circling around him. those Things encourage you to explore the castle. go to places you haven't been. Eventually you will find the next part in his story & you can go back and talk to him. to continue his quest.The bosses themselves provide a sense of accomplishment that other games don't provide. since it's more about individual skill, Reaction, tactics & understanding the boss. Not to mention that every enemy you meet their armor, Their Weapons, Shield and Magic can be found in the game somewhere. if They don't drop it after some farming then you can find it somewhere else.The game also helps you with learning what you should do against a specific boss at the end of the area, if you just pay attention. You entered a new dungeon, in this dungeon you find ""Fire Grease"". This often means that the main boss is weak to Fire. maybe you find a sword. If you read the lore bit you may learn that the sword was once held by a Daring explorer that tried to fight a deadly beast of ice. by giving you the sword in this dungeon, and by getting the ""Fire Grease"" you can easily surmise that it's a ice enemy that is weak to Fire. The game doesn't tell you the story of how that hero died. Or it's told How the Boss is weak to fire through dialogue. Instead you are tasked with figuring things out. This game is poorly optimized. But playable. it stutters, randomly switched system Focus (ALT+TAB). it has slow downs. Worst bug i've encountered was ""Ranni The Witch"" fight, Phase 1. Obscure SPOILER WARNING! where the thing you need to attack doesn't load in. a Game Reload fixed the issue. The stutters Doesn't matter what hardware you are currently playing on. I get the same stutters with a similar frequency on all LOW settings and all HIGH, with a RTX 3070 & AMD 3600x. So only buy if you can overlook those issues. This game gives me a sense of excitement i haven't had for a game since ""Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time"". I still think this game can improve. With them continuing to work on fixing the games stutters, Lag etc Then this game will eventually become the greatest game I've personally ever played. But for now it's just an amazing game."

Positive,"I consider myself very critical of video games, I tend to rant and be very snobby when it comes to judging games, but Elden Ring has literally no flaws I can think of.Even if I was forced to name something, I cant think of a single thing that is bad, that wasnt bad on purpose for the sake of difficulty or likewise. It's a very finely crafted and intentional gameBut it can be very hard"
Positive,"As a huge Dark Souls fan I was very surprised to see how well they've managed to put the feeling of a true ""Souls""-game into an open world. It's basically like Breath of the Wild for the Zelda series.It easily takes on a top spot for my favorite games BUT I'm not sure if I'm going to finish it. The game just drags on for far too long, you fight the same enemies and bosses over and over again and the scaling between regions is...annoying to say the least. One moment you're the king, the other you get one-shot by some random enemy. I've never been so truly frustrated by a Souls game - and not because it's hard, just because it's messing with me too much.If they removed around 50% of the world but kept the quality to the same degree, I would love this game...but the way it is now, I just can't."

Positive,"Ignoring the performance issues and the one crash i had after 10 hours, the game is solid and i do not regret buying this. Combat is amazing as always and now with jump attacks to make it even more badass. Sad to see it being so downvoted."
Positive,"Gotta post a positive review to combat all the performance reviews. The game did indeed stutter a bit to start. I personally disabled steam overlay as suggested by a few, and that steadied out my frames. It is unfortunate to hear that some PC's are having a pretty hard time with stutter, but FROMSOFT has already addressed the issues and likely has fixes already in the works. The game itself feels AMAZING to me. The open world tropes arent overdone (collectibles, crafting, etc), the game is beautiful visually, and the combat feels tight. I've gotta say, even when the stutter was bad, the game still runs better on release than just about EVERY other game we've had released in the last year or two. Has nobody been playing warhammer 3 or any other new releases? Compared, Elden ring is a gem. By itself, for me, Elden ring is a goddamn gem."

Positive,"Elden Ring is fromsoft's most approachable game yet... Sorta, kinda. The game does away with the bottlenecking that plagued the other souls games, wherein a player will be stuck on a boss for like i dunno 300 years or something and not be able to progress, instead of that, Elden Ring allows for you to up and leave that fight and do something else, coming back when you're stronger. This is absolutely the best part of the game, along with this the game places a lot of confidence in its open world and... Woah! The first hours of this game were something else, stumbling into Caelid on accident was some of the most fun I've had with a game, open-world fits the game perfectly, as you can visit such large swaths of the game without even fighting your first boss it is absolutely, utterly unreal. What's the problem? Rewards, kinda...For my first playthrough, I went with samurai and pumped DEX and VGR. For the entire game I struggled to find something to adequately replace my equipment. The Uchigatana I started the game with was the best weapon I had hitting late-endgame. Even after getting a unique katana as an upgrade... It just didn't deal the same damage.Armor was probably on me though. I stuck with the basic samurai armor until I hit endgame... Mostly because it looks cool.To some, that might be great, you don't need to worry about equipment too much since you start with some very very good pieces right at the start. But I think the best part of the previous games was getting upgrades-- let me put it this way, in Dark Souls, at around 4 hours in you might be rocking completely different equipment than when you started, 24 hours in you're completely changed again and so on and so forth. You can certainly use the same equipment the whole game but it was built around you switching semi-often. In Elden Ring, melee characters will struggle to find variety in equipment. This complaint is nonexistant for magick based characters.Magick makes the world go 'round in this game, its crazy how many sorceries and incantations you'll end up finding in it. I imagine glintstone pebble remains a backbone spell, but the sheer variety you *can* achieve dwarfs the melee fighters tenfold.Once more, it's hard to articulate my thoughts with this game, I really enjoyed the early-midgame but loathed the endgame. I feel like this will echo with other players as well, where you'll be told the last 30-ish hours aren't as good as the first 30 or so. Because of this lacking consistency I cannot in good faith call this fromsoft's magnum opus. I would call it their best game to date though.The optimization sucks really bad thoughand im glad mages are the exact type of glass cannon murdermachines that i oh-so loveunless if its in pvpand theyre wearing armorthen it sucks"
Positive,"It was a fine ride! This game had a tremendously big map! It was huge actually! Beautiful places to visit and places that will make you feel like you're in hell. But the aftermath makes up for it. It is very recommended to play this game if you're a souls fan! It is a combination of Dark Souls and Sekiro in my opinion. A solid choice if you like one of them and you need something to push you play the other one. For me, playing Elden Ring, made me wanna play Sekiro, even though I was not so amused with it. This game will provide you with a huge variety of weapons with special attacks. The negative stuff about this game is that once you fight a boss, it will hunt you for the rest of your life. You will face it multiple times as a mini boss throughout your playthrough.. Soundtracks, nothing special. In general, Dark Souls franchise had a lot better soundtrack and aesthetic, but Elden Ring is also a very beautiful game."
Positive,My favorite game of all time :)
Positive,"Genuinely feel like they perfected the soulsborne formula with this one, highly recommended."
Positive,Die die die die die die die die die. Enjoyable. Captivating. Die die die die die.Wonderfully crafted game. Would recommend to anyone looking for an adventure and for capturing some of that magic of exploration and discovery.
Positive,"An epic game, and one I wish I could experience for the first time again. The first play-through includes some truly memorable gaming experiences, like when you first step out in to Limgrave, or a dragon swoops down from the sky crashing in to the ground before you. Like finishing a great book, I now feel lost, unsure what to play next as I was so invested that my next game will struggle to compare. It will need to be an amazing game to beat this to GOTY '22.I have very limited experience with Dark Souls games, having only played a bit of DS3, but enjoy open world rpg's and am used to a grind. Do not let a lack of DS experience stand in your way of trying this game, nor the fanboys demanding others to ""git gud"" - it's an amazing gaming experience and one that feels shared with the messages from others in the open world. While the bosses do offer a skill check, like any open world rpg you can go and level up and come back, and investing in vigor (life) makes the game start to feel more balanced. At first it seems too unforgiving, but now i see that progression was necessary to feel your own power (and skill) gain, which is reinforced when you have rematches against what you thought was an early boss, but turns out it's just a typical inhabitant of the lands between. The technical aspects of the combat do take a while to click if you're new to the series, but learning timings and realising you should pace a fight - as your opponents will counter you well, results in most boss fights giving an adrenaline rush and sense of reward i've not had from a game in a long time. It's rare for me to buy a game near release, I have such a steam backlog, I never have need, but i took a gamble on this game, and haven't regretted it for a second, even when dying repeatedly to melania. It's a fantastic gaming experience. I won't shrill with words like masterpiece, as it has some short comings. Some fights became quite repetitive (e.g. hacking the ankles of dragons), repeating bosses, and I found NG+ disappointing as I felt too OP, but more importantly knowing where to go in NG+, and where every monster was takes away the sense of discovery and amazement as you end up rushing to where you need to go (there really should have been more randomness in spawns in the world), After taking down the boss after 70 hours in my first play through, I was able to rush to it in a matter of hours the second time, As I said, if only I could experience it for the first time again. Whether you are new to Dark Souls like me, or more experienced, this game is a must experience!"
Positive,"I have no words to describe just how brilliant of a work of art Elden Ring is. I've been playing Soulsborne games since the beginning with Demon's Souls, and like everyone else has been saying I feel as if this is THE game they've been wanting to make for so long. For me personally, this is now easily my favorite game of all time. And I believe Elden Ring to be FromSoftware's greatest creation thus far. They've perfected it with this game. I can't think of a single moment in my 140 hour playthrough where I wasn't sucked into the world and combat of Elden Ring. The additions of a dedicated jump button and stealth allows you to approach combat scenarios with surprisingly more depth than their previous games. I've used the world and the terrain around me so incredibly often to either get a view further ahead to see what might await me, to planning an entire plan of attack on a group of enemies. Weapons all feel fantastic to use, poise has finally returned, and weapon arts now dubbed as Ashes of War can be swapped between nearly all weapon types which in turn also affects their scaling with your stats. It's an incredible system that allows for an insane amount of customization for your weapons.For this being FromSoftware's first attempt at an open world Souls game, it's incredible just how perfect they did it. The sheer amount of enemy and boss variety in this massive world is impressive as hell. I've not once gotten bored of the types of enemies I was facing, because the variety of them was changing on a frequent basis exploring the world. All of the bosses are fantastic as well. They really flexed their art and enemy design talents with this game. All of the locations are stunning and have their own unique vibe, along with a day and night cycle with ever changing weather patterns, the world feels alive.FromSoftware have done it again. They've crafted another masterpiece that will be talked about for several years to come. I will be genuinely surprised if this game doesn't win GOTY. In my opinion this is as close to a perfect game as you can get. I can't recommend this game enough to anyone. It's perfect in nearly every aspect, and I can't wait to dump even more hours into so many more builds. Try fingersbut hole"
Positive,"Not an easy game to begin with, but it gets better.[38 hours in] Rock Sling is so OP, I switched to a magi warrior now. I think the meteor staff (218 sorcery scaling + gravity spell enhancement) plays an important role also."
Positive,Elden Ring is definitely my Game of the Year. Outstanding! Just like all other FromSoftware games it is full of challenge. The new open world feels alive full of all different kinds of enemies and friendly npc's to discover. You will die a lot but that is all apart of the fun.Just GitGud and play this game!
Positive,"Elden Ring is everything I ever wanted in a souls game and *more*. I cannot put into words just how much I love and adore this game - almost 30 hours in and I haven't even explored the entirety of the map or fought all of the bosses. Aside from some frame rate stuttering every now and then, I've been able to have a consistent 60fps throughout my time playing, and the stuttering is just about the only thing I can think of that would be even a small complaint. This game absolutely lives up to the hype, and sets a new standard for open world games."
Positive,"This is at all cost, something to be hold and treasured!Combine the vast and huge amount of World, such titles like Breath of the Wild and sprinkle From Software lore and flair all over it, and something truly beautiful is created!This game is the type of RPG many of us will remember and reference over the next decades, believe me or not, but this one is a pure gem!Period!"
Positive,"It's sort of like Dark Sekiro : Souls of the ColossusThe game feels so strange but yet so familiar at the same time.Combat is fast and fluid. The UI has had a MUCH needed overhaul, there's lots of really nice features to make items easier to access. Art direction is great, I'm really enjoying the setting and the story so far, which is also strange but familiar.If you like souls, you'll like this. If you wanted to like souls, but wished it was more open, you'll like this.It's basically the dark souls of skyrim clones.Edit : After finishing the game, I can confirm it's a masterpiece. A flawed one at times, but a masterpiece none the less. The whole experience from start to finish was a journey that really pulled me into the game world. This is something so extremely rare these days that it alone is worth the asking price.Overall I give this game a nervously rolling through a giant AOE attack with elevated heartbeat out of 10."
Positive,"Im 44 hours in, Ill update if my opinion changes/to add anything. This is the best work From Software has ever done I had high expectations coming into this game and the game so how managed to exceed them. It takes the best parts from all their previous games, the amount of thought and quality of life when it comes to the little things shows how much care and consideration they gave it. On top of that its a brand new world so brand new lore which makes the entire thing even more refreshing. Its also graphically breathtakingIf you liked any of the souls games you will enjoy this one.I have a high end PC with 3080TI so it performs fine. There are occasional stutters when loading new assets but these are far and few between and I barely notice them. Ive only had one boss fight where the fps dropped and that was due to it using a massive AOE affect but only happened the one time and when it did the same thing after it didnt drop so I presume the game is wierd when loading stuff for the first time. This does little the impact the quality of the game"

Positive,"Elden Ring is nothing short of a triumph, a breathtaking masterpiece that pushes the boundaries of what we thought possible in the realm of action RPGs. FromSoftware and George R.R. Martin have joined forces to create a gaming experience that transcends expectations, delivering a world that is as rich and immersive as it is challenging and rewarding.One of the most remarkable aspects of Elden Ring is its expansive open world, a sprawling landscape teeming with breathtaking vistas, mysterious dungeons, and diverse biomes that seamlessly blend together. From the moment you step into this beautifully crafted universe, you'll find yourself lost in its majesty, each corner filled with secrets waiting to be uncovered.The level of detail in Elden Ring is truly staggering. From the delicate animations of the flora and fauna to the intricately designed armor sets and weapons, every aspect of the game has been meticulously crafted. The artistry extends to the enemies you'll encounter, each more formidable and uniquely designed than the last. It's a visual feast that keeps you engaged and constantly marveling at the sheer creativity poured into every pixel.The gameplay is where Elden Ring truly shines. The combat system is a delicate dance of strategy and skill, requiring players to master a wide array of weapons and abilities. The sense of satisfaction that comes from overcoming challenging foes and colossal bosses is unparalleled. The game strikes a perfect balance between difficulty and accessibility, making it approachable for newcomers while still providing a formidable challenge for seasoned players.The narrative, woven by the brilliant mind of George R.R. Martin, adds a layer of depth and intrigue that elevates Elden Ring beyond a mere action game. The lore is rich and engaging, with a story that unfolds gradually, encouraging exploration and discovery. The characters you encounter are memorable, each with their own unique motivations and backstories that contribute to the overall tapestry of the game.The open-world structure, coupled with the seamless integration of multiplayer elements, enhances the sense of community and adventure. Whether you're exploring the vast landscapes solo or engaging in jolly cooperation with friends, Elden Ring's multiplayer features add a dynamic layer to the overall experience. Elden Ring is a magnum opus, a testament to the limitless potential of video game storytelling and design. It's a journey that captivates the senses, challenges the mind, and rewards the soul. From its awe-inspiring world to its finely tuned gameplay mechanics, Elden Ring stands as a shining beacon in the gaming industry. Prepare to be enchanted, enthralled, and utterly absorbed by this modern classic."
Positive,"They really took all the positives from their previous games and expended them with an open world. Amazing, 10/10"
Positive,"What can I say? It's absolutely beautiful. I love it as a fan of the first Dark Souls only, I never understood the hype around the third Dark Souls it was just bad in my eyes compared to the first. This one on the other hand is finally not a Dark Souls named game and I can see that, it's different and I love the Open World, Sneaking, jumping even though it needs more work to feel better and not clunky it's amazing and a step in the right direction I feel with the Souls Series, they can never make a game like the first Dark Souls, a map designed so well so choosing Open World was nice, for now I love it. The only big downside is the performance but I do hope it's gonna fix in the future. Buy it or wait, whenever you will play you will like it I hope. Still amazing."
Positive,"It's Elden Ring, you know what you are getting.32:9 5120x1440 still not possible natively. Needs mods for offline play and flawless widescreen."

Positive,Beautiful world. Beautiful bosses. Beautiful game.It's just amazing to play a game that doesn't interrupt you every 10 minutes with cutscenes and just lets you live in the world its created.
Positive,"I""m too retarded for this game . View is nice though"
Positive,this game BIG
Positive,F*** This game. 10/10
Positive,"Elden Ring is simultaneously respectful of your intelligence and experience as a gamer and devastatingly rude. The Lands Between is harsh, but it isn't heartless. Each time you click that green 'play' button to open the game you are knowingly opening a mist-filled treasure chest that will snare you within a world full of fascinating lore, engrossing storytelling, and charming NPCs that continually reward players who are prepared to try."
Positive,"One of the best gaming experiences in the past decade, Elden Ring introduced me to the souls genre. It is the perfect game, offering no guidance to the players, which just evokes the feel to explore and learn about the humoungous lore of this game. And it's Level Design, it's the best in the business no questions asked. I am waiting for DLC as i write this review, and i'm damn sure it'll deliver as well.10/10 A True Masterpiece"
Positive,"Start the game.Get excited.Follow the grace.Try to reach the boss.Reach to boss, Get your ass kicked hard.Deny that you are weak.Try 10 times.Give up, explore the map.Be amazed by tremendous amount of content.Kick his/her ass.REPEAT"
Positive,"Very challenging, incredibly well designed boss fights and an open world that will set the stage for all open world games. Visually stunning. Recommend you play with a controller. If you do not like Souls like games, you won't like this - but if you do, it will be the best one yet. Works great on PC but can be demanding of hardware. Wish it had native PS Controller support and button identification."
Positive,"Elden Ring is the culminative mastering of Fromsoft's design for the past decade on top of treading new grounds in the form of an open world with horizontal progression compared to past games which were much more linear in design. It is unabashedly masterful in execution; it feels like the Soulsborne series was always meant to reach this.By far this is the game where it is the easiest to get into; progression gating is very limited, most of the map is accessible without the need to defeat bosses. There is a plethora of play-styles that are viable; Miracle builds are now finally made viable, its on that level. The Spirit Ashes add a new option for solo play that's more available for players to use.The story feels much more cohesive and fleshed out than any previous Fromsoft game that I have experienced. Not going to drop spoilers, but its amazing how things feel connected as you progress through the story.There are a few prominent pain points. There is some reusing of bosses, which in an open world game is perfectly fine, however there are instances where they are poorly placed, such as two different instances of a boss enemy with different movesets in a small arena, which makes the encounter feel arbitrarily difficult. There are a few enemies that are less than enjoyable to fight as well, and there is a big difficulty spike in the later areas. However these are relatively minor flaws that can be circumvented.Elden Ring feels like a childhood dream of adventure. Its easy to lose yourself to the adventure. Take it from me; game already ate up 100+ hours in the first week. To the veterans of the Soulsborne games, this is a worthwhile purchase. To the newcomers, this is probably the best first game for the series, it will take some learning but if you really want to get into souls games, this is one."
Positive,"First Souls-like game for me and I'm loving it. Feels like Breath of the Wild, but for adults. Needs a framerate fix badly though, some areas are rough"
Positive,10/10 must play
Positive,Yeah its okay
Positive,"MIQUELLA, ST-TRINA WHEN!?!"
Positive,"This game was recommended to me and I have no regrets, best game ever 10/10 would play again"
Positive,"Beat Malenia, started a new save, got absolutely stomped by tree sentinel 10/10"
Positive,"Elden Ring is a vast, brutal, game that has much to do and gives you true freedom to do whatever you want, given you have the patience. The game incentivises you to explore its many beautiful settings, nooks and crannies, always giving something to find. You're always finding new weapons to use and spells to cast on the many, many different enemies and bosses. The combat is difficult and punishing, but is fun and rewarding when you push through. You get the most out of this game when you put lots of time into it, but that time is almost always rewarded someway somehow."
Positive,"Graphics - 9.3/10 really good and eyepleasing.Content - 10/10 There is an insane amount of content to be found and it is really fun to find it.Gameplay - 9/10 Feels really good and smooth, very similar to Dark Souls 3Soundtrack - 8/10 It is really good but, I'd sadly say it is one of the worst in the Soulsborne franchiseStory - 8.6/10 really good but you will need a TON of digging to understand is correctlyTime to Beat - In my first playtrough it took me around 35hOnline Play - 6.5/10 the game is clearly not centered around online play, it is quite unbalanced and laggy, but can be fun stillOVERALL - 10/10 Even with all the bad things I said, this is by far one of the best games I have ever played and is on par with other masterpieces like Red Dead Redemption 2, Dark Souls 3 and many others... Trust me, it is worth every cent."
Positive,"Phenomenal game that gets even better when you use the Seamless Co-op mod. Makes for a fun experience regardless of skill level in games. Don't be scared to give it a whirl, I believe in you, Tarnished."
Positive,I recommend this game because it allows you to do things that are not possible in real life such as talking to girls and having sex with them.
Positive,"One amazing work of love, the most incredibly looking game I have ever played."
Positive,"Easily able to go 100 hours for a first play-through, Very rewarding.Many ""Dogs"" - 10/10"
Positive,"Elden Ring really feels like a culmination of Fromsoft. It is not perfect. You've probably already heard the major criticisms about late game areas and repeat bosses. However this, and Dark Souls II, were the only games that made me feel like the build variety was begging me to play consecutive playthroughs. Completed thrice back to back, and I've still not touched magic/intelligence builds.The first playthrough was magical. 151hrs of deep exploration. The most accessible and QoL-centric game in the series to date <3"
Positive,"By far one of my favorite games of all time. I feel Elden Ring really draws on all of the success that Fromsoft has had over the years from Demon Souls, Dark Souls, and all the rest of their games. This one really came out swinging with their largest world and didn't disappoint, a sad reality with most game releases nowadays. If this is your first souls game you will die a lot but that's part of the fun and if you persevere through the game you'll see just how much was put into this game and just remember there's achievements in the games for dying so expect to die a lot."

Positive,"I'm a die-hard Dark souls series fan, and after finished 1 playthrough with as much blindly as possible, this one is not disappointed me. But**Combat**- mechanic is similar, it's been improved with faster combat, more flexibility of attacks but the weapon's moveset is so weird and same same for all weapon in that category(or almost)- weapon arts are just brilliant- dual wields moveset can't be mix/combine between category like in DS2 but still allowed for the same category except some special weapon that comes with dual wield, a bit sad and happy at the same time- why the hell I'm getting one-combo kill by a blade-flurry?- I rather fight malenia and Radahn together without a weapon than approaching a fucking rune-bear, that thing is nasty.come to think of it, I probably needed my weapon, but still.**Armor**- a bit more varies but less unique/grim for mix & match for heavy armor- first time I see recolored armor from Fromsoft**Gameplay**- POI guidance is next to nothing if not none, confused af, I was playing survival game in Caelid for many hours before I realized I probably needed to go to the Lake first, when I do? felt like real main protagonist since I was already far over-leveled.- npc playing hide and seek, no talk, just standing there waiting for you to start a conversation.**World and Story**- a lot more waifus, but still sad since they don't even stay to talk to you for long like Firekeeper that always be there when you come back, even Fia, the journey is so lonely.- The ""tone"" of the game is brighter and more lively than any Dark Souls game, but still as dark and depressing as we always know from Fromsoft's games.- story is quite harder to grasp, I don't know if it's because of GRRM? yet not as grim as DSover all story is just great but I didn't get the same feeling as when I was playing DS series, like the grim, sad? fate of the main character and those NPC. It's feels a bit difference from their previous title."
Positive,"It's Elden RIng, you already know that it's good"
Positive,"Came for the hot wolf man, stayed for the amazing game.Stayed a bit too long."
Positive,"one of the greatest games i've ever had the pleasure of playinga painful, imperfect and frustrating experience you grow to love and forever cherishcame at the perfect time in my life when i needed direction - ended and wrapped everything up sweetly"
Positive,"This is what games should be like. Fuck hundred waypoints on my map and a HUD that's completely overloaded. What you find here is a challenge. Not everything is perfect, but this game is a milestone for the gaming industry. I hope all these lazy ass mainstream devs finally wake up and provide us games we deserve. This was my first ""soulsborne game"" and now I understand why FromSoftware is being praised by their fans. They deserve every single inch of it."

Positive,"Here is what happened while I was taking a bath just after making to the ""Frenzied Flame"" ending:*‘What is up those finger things... it seems just like mumble jum... wait, I think I kinda get it... maybe... You are not born knowing how to count. You learn by simple differentiation, and as you evolve consciousness you grow and turn things into more complex matters, so one becomes two and two becomes... three? The three fingers. That’s how you learn how to count. Fingers. hmm...’*The game mechanics are good. Not great, specially in the end. I still think Sekiro manages to deliver a better difficulty setting as you learn how to navigate the complex combat mechanics. But the reason I keep coming back to this series of games might be solely the narrative. As in a “From-Software” game fashion, you are In Medias Res of something that was once glorious and great, but now is dwindling down and losing momentum. If you are the kind of person that don't like this kind of narrative, you don't need to learn anything about the past of this fictional universe, you can simply go and live the life of a cynic-player (nothing to gain, nothing to lose, just great). But if you want to understand the complexity of the state of the things that 'are', then you will have to go through a series of descriptions and NPCs accounts about some of their perspectives. What you might piece together, may not even be reasonable enough to call this 'narrative'. It is like if 'Odyssey' were translated by James Joice and then he decided to go with his account, while burning every copy or mention of Homer's work. It is a work of constructive-destructive universe creation. The anti-Silmarilion. The ""nope, try to figure it yourself"" answer."

Positive,"If the Witcher 3, Monster Hunter, Zelda breath of the wild, and Dark Souls had a baby, Elden ring would be the outcome. It's too good! This is not your typical hack and slash spam your way through game. It requires smart decision making when progressing through. As a player, you set the difficulty for yourself and its up to you to find the tools you need to succeed. Best game I've played in years. Look forward to more updates!"
Positive,One of the games ever made. Playing this game will make you feel like this is a game. It has all the elements of a game and some may even call it souls like. Truly one of the games made this decade. If you don't agree then you can unfriend me. Game/10.
Positive,"better than sex, im guessing idk i've never played sex"
Positive,Everything you could want out of a Fromsoft open world game.
Positive,try fingers but hole
Positive,"Elden Ring is the epitome of over a decade of fromsoftware's soulsborne genre made into an open world masterpiece.  Up until now my only adventure into fromsoftware was through Sekiro, and helping my little brother beat Dark Souls 3.  However even without experience in the genre, I was able to pick up this game and have a great time.  This game has stunning graphics, unique enemies, and hundreds of hours of unique content to shuffle through.  Hopefully this isnt the last we see of fromsoftware and hopefully this is the beginning of a new era for them that further catapults them into the spotlight.  This game will be one that is looked back on like many of us do with Skyrim."
Positive,dont play this game during midterms
Positive,the elden ring of souls games
Positive,"One of my favorite games that I've ever played. I've played all the other souls games, and this one is my favorite. It's so big, so many different ways to play, and it's just so beautiful. The combat is that perfect level of challenge. The NPCs are all interesting with good stories. The world is amazing and rich and gorgeous. I played for about 90 hours and I did not want it to end. I'll probably play through it again very soon, and I hope that there is DLC coming."
Positive,"This is a good game. Too good.I completed the game.I got all the achievements in the game.Now my life feels empty and I don't know what to do with my free time.Because ""its still not as good as the time I played Elden Ring."""

Positive,So many reasons to love this game! Play it however you like :D
Positive,It's an amazing game with amazing views and fantastic boss fights. Fromsoft has really learned from their past games and have made a fantastic game!
Positive,a relaxing game
Positive,It's like a giant From Soft theme park.
Positive,crashes on startup but in a hot way
Positive,"Now that I have a little more time in the game, I believe I can give a proper review.This is the greatest game I have ever played. People will claim that it is an easier version of the Souls series, and to some points I may agree, but taking points from every Souls game before this, I know in my heart that this game is a masterpiece, and that the challenge and overall reward of completing this game is by far the greatest of the Souls series. Pros: Open, breathtaking world More cohesive story than it's predecessorsGame play that will leave you almost pulling your hair out, but coming back for more Sword Arts, or Ashes of War, that are no compatible with any play style, not limiting you to a singular weapon/ play style that caters to all who enjoy a different assortment of weaponsCinematics that make you feel as though the choices you have made throughout the game have you in the driver seat, and command your attentionOne of the widest ranges of enemies and learning curves that demands focus, and an iron will to overcome even some base-level enemies One of the most lived-in, open world games where the crafting and gathering mechanic does not feel like chore, and rewarding to those who hoard resources and want an extra edge during some combat and boss fights Smooth as butter combatBoss fights that will have you running through a fog wall over and over until that orgasmic victory (Melenia I am looking at you... HARD)Allowing summoning to happen at any point in the game adds an entire level of multiplayer possibilities the dark souls has needed for a long timeCons:Buggy combat sequences with some framerate issues Horse combat seems quite silly at timesOnline connectivity to friends has you disconnecting more often than staying in their world With online play, having players be able to summon Torrent with friends would make exploration and covering ground a bit less tedious Disconnecting randomly during bossfights during solo play has hurt me on an emotional and physical levelIn summary, this game is a 10/10 and I feel privileged to have had it come out in my lifetime.To those complaining about the learning curve and the game being too hard; Get GudFort NightFinger But HoleTry pickle"
Positive,where did all these hours go...?
Positive,Legitimately the best game I have played in the past 10+ years
Positive,The parkour in this game is so much harder than 90% of bosses.
Positive,"It's a Pikmin game, except you're playing as the only Pikmin."
Positive,"Lord of the Elden Rings is pretty fun, my favorite quest was infiltrating the Thalmor embassy and staging a false flag to attack Ferelden with my favorite follower Bronn of the Blackwater."
Positive,"Still in my first playthrough - trying to see every single thing and to get every single item - and this is the BEST SOULS GAME EVER MADE.I need ""FlawlessUltrawide"" to fix the PC performance issues and that's a damn shame, but the game underneath is the best piece of software ever crated."
Positive,"There's an awful lot of game in this game. And it's all pretty incredible. Inherent difficult in an animation-locking combat game will turn some folks away. But hot damn. If you're down with that more deliberate pace, this game is about as unskippable as they come. A new benchmark not just for souls-flavored titles, but for open world exploration games as well.ELDEN RING scores 10.5 / 11 on my arbitrary rating scale."
Positive,"+much more beginner friendly than most soulsborne games+If too hard, just farm & google. No shame in that+a never to be bored in open world, always smth to explore+pleasing new features in combination with the best from Dark Souls, Bloodborne & Sekiro+more complex bosses+-kind of overwhelming or frustrating for new people that are new to stuffed open world or soulsborne games+-very little explanation; got to listen very closely +-more options, more complexity-sometimes even more cryptic story/lore than Dark Souls (DS3 did better there)-hard start as a Wrechted if you want to mage; most weapons in early game good have Strength scaling9/10"
Positive,"Game Of The Year in March, My only complaint is the size of the world being too large :D"
Positive,i finished it and it is really the best out of all souls games love it
Positive,"""Hmm this looks like a neat area to explore with friends.""Summoning Ally.Take 10 steps forward towards the enemy.Ally has been disconnected.You are being Invaded.""Oh. Oh no."""
Positive,"It's a solid upgrade to the From formula. I'm not even that big into exploration, but you can play it completely linearly if you want."
Positive,O you don't have the right O you don't have the rightO you don't have the right O you don't have the right
Positive,"This is a middle of the road recommendation. Overall I've enjoyed playing the game, and think it looks great.Performance wise it's a little unoptimized, especially if you're playing on older hardware. I'm personally not a fan of the open world, and I felt like most of the time if I didn't have a fast travel point to get where I needed to be I was just bored making the run. The level design and world building itself was nice though.Combat feels really unbalanced with magic seeming to be the only option for a lot of area. Lost of enemies that can't be staggered or that can just block counter you forever. Dodge timing feels strange in this one, if you don't dodge super late enemies just track your position to hit you. The leveling in this game is bad. Enemies relevant to you give next to nothing XP wise, and you pretty much have to resort to killing the same mobs in the East side of the map over and over, or watching a rock fall down a hole. I don't understand this design at all. I'm playing in the final areas of the game, just let me level at a good pace in that area.Bosses get reused a lot in this game. The handful of main bosses are ""mostly"" unique, but the rest of the bosses you'll see over and over just getting scaled up numbers wise every time, which I was not a fan of. I'd rather just have less fights overall than fight the same stupid worm a dozen times.The respeccing needs to be more readily available. Having a limited amount just means that I can't try out the hordes of spells, incantations and items they throw at you the whole game without worrying about getting stuck in a build that's not viable. There are a lot of random bullshit 1 shot things that can happen in this game, and I get that's the meme for Soulsborne games, but it's a little over the top in some fights. I don' think this is the most difficult game in the series by any means, but it definitely has the most bullshit.I enjoyed the story in this game, it was pretty light as expected, but overall held my attention. I liked the characters, although I wish there were more warning when you were going to potentially lose an npc you might need to buy things from later.I really wanted to 100% this game, and I still may at some point, but when I saw the same boss worm pop out for literally the 8th time in my run I just had to set it down. Part of the accomplishment of a Soulslike game is ""Thank God I finally beat that stupid enemy, so I never have to do that again."" But instead they just give it more health and damage and make you fight it 10 more times.There's no real sense of direction in this game, which is standard for these games, but feels worse with the open world. NPC's will give you clues where to go, and the map gives general suggestions for directions to walk in, but I ended up just clearing the whole map everytime I got to a new area because I was afraid of missing something important otherwise.Overall I'd give the game maybe a 6/10. I think it was worth the money, but it has a lot of flaws that keep me from really wanting to keep going with it."
Positive,Very cool game
Positive,"This is my first From Software game. It's really hard. It's also incredible. I've pushed through the difficulty and gotten to a place where I'm a bit more confident. It's rewarding. The aesthetic and thoughtfulness put into this game is unmatched. One complaint: sometimes it drops frames. Both PS4 and Xbox controllers worked fine on my PC. Many people had technical issues, which turned this into a mixed review score at launch. The game itself is a masterpiece.If you can deal with the difficulty and like exploration, there's probably not a better game out there.If you don't want a difficult game (completely understandable), pass this one up and ask your friend to tell you about it.That's my recommendation."
Positive,"I got the game late last night and played it today 3/2/22. I had zero stuttering or graphical issues but I have a really powerful processor, ram, and a 3090 so.... might not be the best benchmark for you. Now this is my very first souls-game and my first From Software game. I am thoroughly impressed by the quality, effort, music, art, and challenge of this game. I was a tad worried about the infamous difficulty I had heard about with this game. But I am happy to say anyone can beat it with persistence, because there are always softer ways to level and different paths to take.NOW I have to warn people about one major issue I have with the game that can so EASILY be fixed. The camera. It is a terrible camera system. The option to turn off auto-targeting doesn't seem to make a difference and if you use targeting to get an idea on your enemy while your back is turned, it will randomly wander off to target any other enemy around you. Also it desperately needs a mode/option where the camera does not auto-follow you when you move/turn. I would really love an unfixed camera mode. But that is really the only thing keeping it back from being one of the better games I have ever played."
Positive,"There is ALWAYS something to do. If a boss is too hard? Run away and do something else- the map is full of things to explore and power up your character. The variety of options you have at your disposal to tackle the game's challenges are absurdly wide, and it is incredibly satisfying to overcome a challenge. This game is not for everyone- and that's OKAY. It punishes mistakes severely and rewards patience and learning patterns.As far as being ""the most accessible soulsborne game"" - this is only because you have an entirely open world to explore from the beginning, there are no roadblocks unless you want to specifically get past a certain boss. In terms of difficulty, it's about on par with Dark Souls 3, but less difficult than Bloodborne."
Positive,"The game itself is Dark Souls in an open world, similar to Breath of the Wild. If these things appeal to you, I strongly recommend checking it out.The elephant in the room is of course technical issues. For those experiencing the major ones, the game is nigh upon unplayable. For my part, I have not experienced any major hurdles. There have been the occasional stutter, but only when moving between what I believe are different zones. There has been one occasion in which a stutter popped up mid-battle and killed me, but that's it so far. I do have a pretty powerful PC: Ryzen 5800x, RTX 2080, 32 GB 3200MHz RAM (should OC to 3333 but hey,) Windows 11.  I've seen people with more powerful rigs still experiencing issues, though.If you play the game and experience technical issues right out the gate, I'd do some serious troubleshooting early on. If they won't fix it, I'd refund the game and wait until more patches are rolled out. If you don't experience these issues, though, the game is a joy."
Positive,Best game I have played in half a decade. An absolute must-have.
Positive,"Anyway, heres Elden Ring."
Positive,"if i find myself thinking about the game every time im not playing it, its good."
Positive,"It's Dark Souls where the world backdrops are actually fleshed out. Play it you dinguses, the FPS drops are minor."
Positive,spent 30m making characterwalks out a doorgets one shot by horse dude10/10
Positive,"Worth every penny. There's a certain satisfaction that comes from facing and overcoming challenges within these types of games, I'm currently stuck on a boss right now that as I get to the second phase, I find myself freezing up more than I did the first phase, this excites me greatly! I want to overcome situations like this and then go on and help others as a Phantom to do the same! That feeling invokes a near-infinite gameplay loop for me; overcome difficult boss, help others do so for Runes, move on or repeat."
Positive,"Elden Ring has been a great game so far and very challenging just like the  Dark/Demon's souls games. If you ever wanted a Dark souls game with open world,  mount, and behold a real JUMP button this is the game for you.  The game has very amazing and beautiful  scenery and creative  monsters  as  well. Story  been very interesting  and staying  together  As far as the problems a  lot of players  have  had I only gotten the frame rate lag few times lucky no player  death with it. I'm sure it will be fix in next few  patches."
Positive,"It's all I wanted from a Souls game and so, so much more."

Positive,One of the best open worlds i have explored in a long time! Game is running impressively with no problems for me.  Im roleplaying a coward in game and avoiding all the bosses just to get away from real life where im a stud.  Its going surprisingly well!
Positive,"All I can say is...WOW. FROM software really outdid themselves with this one. Only complaint I might have, would be that some of the explorable ""optional"" bosses in the catacombs are REALLY easy compared to most boss experiences I've had in the soulsbourne series but other than that the game is EXTREMELY satisfying to play!"
Positive,dark souls 1 in open world.good game i have no problem only little drop FPS in some area this setting i playhigh settingturn off Motion blur + depth of fieldturn medium illumination effect + grace effectinstall game in SSD/NVMEinstall new driver and remove old with DDU
Positive,"Game is better now than the unoptomized problems it had at launch.Probably my favorite dark souls title, right up with sekiro and bloodborne. But where those games were hard as heck, elden ring takes a more adjustable difficulty curve for most of the game through a open world design rather than a linear corridor of death.Would recommend to someone as their first souls game hands down."
Positive,People who say this is just a boring open world Dark Souls are certified maidenless.

Positive,"Simply amazing. I'm running this fairly well with a low spec rig. 1050 4gb, i7700hq (3.4ghz,) and 16gbs of ddr4 at 2400. Settings are are mixture of off, low, and highs, just have to play with them. Framerate is fairly steady, averaging 40ish at 1080p. Though definitely had sub 20 on some co-ops. Haven't tried at a lower resolution yet. I'll edit this review if something game breaking comes up.If Nintendo and BoTW get a pass for it's technical issues and framerates, so do FromSoft and Elden Ring.  GoTY so far for me.Edit: OoooOOOOoooOOOOOoooooOOOOOOoooooo"

Positive,Every Fromsoftware game put together and then some... OOOOOOOO ELDEN RING...
Positive,"Now that I have reached the ""point of no refund"" (2 hours mark), I would like to leave a bit of an initial review. For the first part, the game is beautiful and very enjoyable. The difficulty (or at least what I have experienced) provides an exciting challenge and lives up to expectations for these kind of games. The music is great and the environment is fantastic. The only draw side is a bit of stuttering (only a little bit) that was a bit of a distraction at the beginning--fortunately a friend on Steam warned me about it so it was not too alarming. For the most part, however, it has been smooth and enjoyable. I just hope they put this kind of effort into the entire game and not just the small bit that I have experienced.Edit: On a side note, this game is definitely NOT designed for keyboard+mouse! It is incredibly tedious to use them so I suggest just sticking with a controller (I use a Playstation controller and it does just fine)."
Positive,"Based on 100+ Hours, All I can say is Masterpiece.The Open world is crazy and Filled with tones of enemies, So watch out your steps because they are deadly. The Different Area's definitely attracts you because the visuals are stunning. Gameplay is so damn crazy as you can build your character with infinite skills based on which replay ability of Elden Ring never feels bore. You can try different builds, weapons, spells etc. Enemies & Bosses are really challenging based on area you are roaming, It might be frustrating to die again and again and again and again but its really worth it. Multiplayer is also a great option in this game, you can get help from players in the world or you can help other players in the world and of course you can play the entire game with your friends or make new ones. You can definitely go for it."
Positive,"i really hope this open world thing was just an experiment and they go back to making tight experiences and thoughtful and engaging level design again after this. the open world is incredibly weak here and the boss design, while bigger and more frantic than ever, isn't enough to carry long stretches of horseback riding and rewards that rarely feel worth the time spent exploring. the novelty exploring small side dungeons and other tangents wears off quick for how much content they actually put in this game, and makes you wonder if the main bulk of the experience would not have been even more epic if their dev time was focused.also the stuttering still exists this long after which is just wild to me but surely the dlc is better about it.still a great game but DS3 clears this i fear"
Positive,Needless to say
Positive,"this game is amazing and a lot of fun but fromsoft please fix the PC port, it stutters more than jimmy from south park no matter how powerful is your computer or low the graphics are."
Positive,10/10 Masterclass (for the base game)DLC makes you feel the Best and Worst of Fromsoftware
Positive,the game of all time.
Positive,Probably the best singeplayer game ever created. Excellent work from fromsoftware like always :)
Positive,"I am a massive Dark Souls fan and this game really feels like the evolution of that formula. The story is fantastic, bosses are varied and fun and the whole gameplay loop feels super satisfying"

Positive,"Alright, I'm probably one of the few people that have actually completed this game and done all of the main content there is.This game is extremely huge, like, it's messed up how huge this game is. It doubles in size every couple hours and you'll keep wondering: ""When is it going to end?""This game is practically an amalgamation of everything good about other From Software games, but bundled up into an amazing open world experience.It's hard, but acceptable, mostly because you're able to go anywhere else for a while and come back whenever you feel like it, which is one of the huge strengths about the open world nature of the game.The bosses are amazing, the music is fantastic, the story is as elusive as it was, but still understandable.This is my favorite game. Thank you Miyazaki."
Positive,"Se vi è un destino personale, non esiste un fato superiore o, almeno, ve n'è soltanto uno, che l'uomo giudica fatale e disprezzabile. Per il resto, egli sa di essere il padrone dei propri giorni. In questo sottile momento, in cui l'uomo ritorna verso la propria vita, nuovo Sisifo che torna al suo macigno, nella graduale e lenta discesa, contempla la serie di azioni senza legame, che sono divenute il suo destino, da lui stesso creato, riunito sotto lo sguardo della memoria e presto suggellato dalla morte. Così, persuaso dell'origine esclusivamente umana di tutto ciò che è umano, cieco che desidera vedere e che sa che la notte non ha fine, egli è sempre in cammino. Il macigno rotola ancora. Lascio Sisifo ai piedi della montagna! Si ritrova sempre il proprio fardello. Ma Sisifo insegna la fedeltà superiore, che nega gli dei e solleva i macigni. Anch'egli giudica che tutto sia bene. Questo universo, ormai senza padrone, non gli appare sterile né futile. Ogni granello di quella pietra, ogni bagliore minerale di quella montagna, ammantata di notte, formano, da soli, un mondo. Anche la lotta verso la cima basta a riempire il cuore di un uomo. Bisogna immaginare Sisifo felice"
Positive,very nice no longer maidenless
Positive,darks souls but you have to treat it like botw and take time to explore but realise your not ready for everything you find
Positive,what will you do... when the elden phone... begins to elden ring...
Positive,"No lag or frame rate issues what-so-ever. Running a RTX 3080 with a Ryzen 5800x. Only real issue is running an ultra-wide gives you two nice black bars on the side. So, yeah, needs ultra-wide support. The game itself is fun, challenging, and lets you choose your own path for progression. You can even skip those annoying things like crafting pack, starting equipment, etc., just to make life more miserable.Edit:Just finished getting all achievements. Loads of things I haven't even done despite the 100%, for example unexplored caves and quest lines left to do. Looks like I'll be putting in some more hours after all."
Positive,"The Good: Am I allowed to say 'everything'? It's Dark Souls, but so much bigger.                   You can run and jump without using stamina outside of combat.                  Changeable weapon arts.                  Massive world with hidden areas and bosses in every nook and cranny.                  H O R S E.The Bad: Bit of a rocky start optimization wise. Nothing that can't be patched or worked out, but i can understand why                some people got a bad taste in their mouth. The Ugly: Review bombs and people too lazy to look into troubleshooting and fixing a PC game are giving this game its                 'mixed' status on here right now.                Most issues have already had fixes found for them. If people would spend half the time they do researching that                 they do whining, they wouldn't have the time to complain because they'd be too busy dying over and over to the                 goat tree man."
Positive,"A masterclass in game design, you can tell it was crafted with love. This has to be one of the best if not the best open world maps I've ever experienced. Well worth the wait, the price, the deaths and the triumphs. Go forth tarnished and become elden lord!!"
Positive,"I don't have any other words to say about this game than ""Masterpiece""."
Positive,Dark Souls with jumping.
Positive,"Finally 100% the game and man i gotta say, best money ive spent on a game since RE8. We need more singleplayer games that are up to the Fromsoftware polish."
Positive,Pure hitbox porn
Positive,"One of the best games I've ever played. The exploration is awe-inspiring, there is always more things to find. The variety of builds, weapons, talismans and spells has made me come back to it again and again during the year, and I am very much looking forward to any DLC or additional content."
Positive,"I hate how good this game is! Its too good, I can litterally spend hours at a time in this game wondering its like breath of the wild but on roids! Love it....and hate it....the emotion of winning is something I feel that is lost in many different games, but it is here in this game. It is amazing 10/10"
Positive,"This is easily one of the best open world RPG fantasy experiences you'll ever have. It can be very challenging at times but that  makes it even more rewarding. This game is like the illegitimate love child of botw and dark souls, highly recommend it.Try finger but hole"
Positive,"This game is absolutely incredible. its frustrating at first, especially if its your first game in the souls-bourne genre, but holy crap is it rewarding. This game is just difficult enough for me to say its hard, but its also very very possible to beat. the optional challenges are excruciating but so so fulfilling. if you like open worlds buy this game instantly"
Positive,"An absolute masterpiece, BUT far from being fromsoft's best title. gonna list some quick negatives.- too much filler, reused enemies/bosses- very spiky and unbalanced difficulty, fuck spirit ashes (me trying not to write the games too easy)- having sending gates (teleporters) everywhere ruin the exploration and the open world level design - unkillable npcs just ruin the damn immersion. why the fuck even is this a thing? - having background music outside of bosses was a bad idea, I really liked the atmosphere sounds in previous games.- the slow walking ghost that shows you caves is really the stupidest most ubisoft design ever, didn't expect from to stoop that low.- no solo pvp invaions? I never was mainly interested in pvp but it was a great part of the hostile environment and was always a great rush being invaded out of nowhere and having to fight for your life, goodbye to that shit now. where every invasion is 1v2. also some very fun areas like the raya lucaria rooftops are totally no-invasion which is stupid.I really hope froms next game isn't open world and doesn't have spirit summons but ofc it's looking like they will after such success.some positives+ great replayability+ great build variety+ amazing lore, most characters are exceptionally well written+ they built upon the previous games play styles really nicely, identified what moves were being overused etc and built the bosses moves to abuse those (love the delayed attacks)+ the world building is amazing and the best in the series, never have i felt a world as alive as this one. Seeing, hearing about rumors, myths, customs related to some religions/cults/gods in early game and little by little discovering the birthplace of it, and getting to kill that very god feels really amazing.+ Regal Ancestor Spirit"
Positive,I like the part with the ring
Positive,this game distracted me from beating my family 10/10
Positive,Welcome to dark souls
Positive,I've beaten the game multiple times yet some random at the start of the game still calls me maidenless :(
Positive,"It's like if Dark Souls and Skyrim had a kid, with a dash of ""Try tongue, but hole"""
Positive,"Graphics: So far, Elden Ring is the prettiest From Software game. Is it the best looking game out there in general? No, but the overall presentation and art style makes up for most of it. More about that below. Visuals & Art Style: The game offers an ambitious and wonderfully designed open world with beautiful landscapes, dungeons, forests, unsettling and fogy marshlands, architecture (castle, towers, academy...), enemy/boss or weapon design and more. Different areas have their own different atmosphere / feel to them and a unique, rich color palette.  Music & Sound Design: The Souls-like games, at least for me, are also characteristic by their wonderful score and sound design. It’s no different with Elden Ring either. The game features a sublime, robust and varied score.  Gameplay & Replayability: Elden Ring offers a lot to be explored, a lot of different weapons, spells or special items, big variety of character builds, enemy types or multiple ways to approach areas or fight bosses. It all results in rich gameplay and adds to the replay value. What bugged me though, is that some of the bosses (or mini bosses) have been reused too many times. That way, when you were fighting your way through, say, a cave, and you ran into a boss you'd already seen, it was disappointing. The combat feels responsive, fine-tuned and optimised, the exploration overall is rewarding and now you have a dedicated jump button. You also receive a spectral steed called Torrent, which you can use in combat or to traverse the Lands Between, although, It’s riding mechanics could’ve been done better.  Difficulty & Game Lenght: One of the main factors that made the souls-like genre popular is it’s high levels of difficulty. Elden Ring however, is more approachable for newcomers. An average playthrough can take around 30-50 hours, but there are dozens more hours worth of gameplay. Story: Another defining factor of the souls-like genre is it’s emphasis on environmental storytelling. The game introduces you to some of the events and characters, but it doesn’t ""hold your hand"" and most of the time you must rely on side quests or item descriptions to put the story together. But when you finally start to see the full picture, the story itself, is fantastic.Summary: On a night of wint’ry fog, the Rune of Death was stolen and the demigods began to fall. The shattering ensued a war that wrought only darkness. Five tarnished were deemed worthy to pursue the mending of the Elden Ring by collecting the Great Runes from the demigods. You play as a tarnished of no renown on a quest to become the Elden Lord. Optimization and Requirements: A very well optimized and executed port with decent hardware requirements. There were some frame drops on release, but it should be all fixed by now.  Price: The price tag of 59.99$ is absolutely worth it based on the amount of playtime and content this game offers.  Final Thoughts: Elden Ring is a great game. I enjoyed my time with it and will definitely hop back in once the DLC comes out. If you're not a souls-like player, but are thinking about trying out this one, go for it. It can be challenging, but the feeling after overcoming challenges is very, very rewarding. Final Score: 9.5/10"
Positive,"Well, thou art of passing skill. Warrior blood must truly run in thy veins, Tarnished."
Positive,"my favorite game of all time and a must a play for souls fans, best one yet. MASTAPICE"
Positive,"If you are on the fence about buying this because of reviews, do it.There are some bugs, but they are so minor, you're just hurting your self by holding off. The only annoying things are:1. summoning other players alot of times just says 'failed to summon' 2. choppy fps in specific scenarios, for me it was a big choppy when i first came out of the start area, but as I moved to other areas in the game no performance issues at all.those are really the only things worth complaining about. The game is amazing, super fun and its so worth the price. If you are on the fence. do it. buy the game. start your suffering today."
Positive,"So, this was bought for me for Christmas by a friend.  I've never played a Fromsoft game before, but I watched a Let's Play when it came out and I realised this was a game I would probably enjoy.  So after one video I didn't watch anymore.  That was when the game first came out, so I've forgotten most of what I watched and I'm pretty much playing this game blind.  I'm happily surprised that I don't suck.  Am I ""Gud""?  Nope, I die a lot.  But I learn each time what I've done wrong and I'm progressing slowly, but steadily.  I'm not a great gamer by any stretch, I am slightly above average at best, but with a bit of patience, you can work out the fight set of the monster you're facing and get by almost anything.  I've even found ways to creep around seriously dangerous monsters when there was no way in heck I could beat them in my current state.I'm still maidenless and don't have my horse. I kind of know where to go, but couldn't work out how to get around a major road block and went exploring instead.  So with no Fromsoft experience and with no way to buy my stats up, I'm doing okay.  I managed to kill the tutorial boss first time, even though I wasn't ready and freaked out when he ran towards me.  I've also killed a few bosses, running into them when I went exploring, hoping an underground route would get progression and finding a boss instead.  Honestly, you don't need to be great to play this game. I've died a lot, but haven't yet got frustrated, the game knows exactly how to reward you for your efforts and keep you pressing on.  I only stopped when I realised I was starving and pulled myself away from the game to go get something to eat.  After this review, I'm going back in and I'll probably make it an all nighter.  This is the first game I've played in years that has hooked me like this.  I normally get bored after a few hours and go do something else before returning, but Elden Ring has got me chomping at the bit wanting to explore the next castle, the next beach, the next outcrop...  It's difficult, but very engaging and extremely fun.        I've actually played about 7 hours. I meant to just download it and test it for an hour today, but I got hooked very quickly. It says I've just played over 2 hours because I had to go offline.  My computer hated the online stuff and death froze three times.  In all honestly, the player messages are all in jokes from the fandom, trolls trying to trip you up, or people warning you of the good stuff, so I'm not missing out on anything.  Some of the ambushes/traps killed me outright, but left me laughing at how crazy they were.  The messages also drew me out of the game, as soon as I went offline I was pulled far deeper into the world and it's wonderfully dour setting.  Dour to the point of absurdity at times, but that somehow makes it better and I really love the feel of it.      It does mean I can't access the multiplayer features and I'm going to have to take on everything by myself, so if you want to know how multiplayer runs, I can't help you.  But saying that, my computer is an old gaming laptop (about 4 years old) and once I went offline, it runs the game fine.  For a game of this scope which came out this year, I find that very impressive.  I was ready for a bit of frame drop or stuttering, but haven't run into any issues once my computer didn't have to keep track of all the ghosts of other players running around.  So, in conclusion, as a person who has never played a Fromsoft before, is not part of the fandom and went in blind, I am loving Elden Ring.  The world building is amazing and the pacing is excellent.  I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to mess around in a fantasy open world, discovering new stuff, dying horribly, then pushing through to discover even more.  The game is hard, but very fair and I found myself swearing at my own idiocy or bad luck, instead of raging at the game itself.   10/10 lots of fun and value for money.   Would recommend.EDIT:  After finally overcoming the roadblock through some judicious tactics of drawing out enemies and then running like heck, I reached the castle the game was pointing me to and came face to face with an obviously scripted boss battle room.  I still had no maiden.  So I had to look it up.  Playing blind, I thought I would find her through an encounter.  However, she's supposed to show up after you activate 3 grace points in the main open world.  I'd opened over 10 by this point, roaming the main starting area and the direct south under it.  I think it was because I was playing offline, so the game didn't register my progress properly.  I let Steam sync up, went back in and lo and behold the first grace point I rested at triggered the cut scene and I have my pact with Melina at last.  Thought I'd add this in as an interesting performance issue."
Positive,Oh man! I love Baldur's Gate 3
Positive,"Preordered the game adn played it in PS4, never regretted. bought it for my new pc and didnt regret again. now the DLC. what a time to be alive. 10/10"
Positive,"If you want to jump right into action, Elden Ring is the way to go.  Though it does have some story and cut scenes, much of the deeper lore is hidden in item description.  Though this game is not for the faint of heart, it will test your skills as a gamer.  No one way will always work for you, but finding what works best for you will give you good results.  Sometimes you have to be rash and quick, other times you have to be patient and still.  Up to you to decide when.  You can make the decision in the vast world with friend and foe alike.  Keep up your guard, for there are certainly more foes out there.  Many enemies big and small are ready to get in your way and change up the way they fight if you fail.  Solve puzzles in dungeons and craft items for restoration/buffs or throwables for combat.  Many weapons to choose from of different weapon types.  Find the one that suits you best(Katanas, Shortswords, Longswords, Greatswords, Axes, Bows, Bowguns, staves, knives, flails, etc.).  Will you take on the adversity to crown yourself as Elden Lord?PSIf you get easily offended because you are SINGLE, I wouldn't recommend this game for you."
Positive,"I have a lot of mixed feelings about this game. I think it is the best open world game I've ever played, but I also think it's a critically flawed game that has some glaring issues I can't believe made it through production.The exploration in this game is phenomenal. There is always something to be doing wherever you are, always a cave, always some ruins, always an evergaol or a puzzle or something. There are no vast, empty stretches of nothing in this game like there are in so many other open world games. However, this does lead to the issue of encounter reuse. A lot of those caves are filled with the same enemies, evergaols are mostly just reused bosses, once you do one puzzle tower you sort of get how to do all of them. By the time you finish the game, you'll realize that there are really only a handful of unique encounters, and I think that's a bit of a shame. I wish some of the bigger fights were truly unique so they felt more special. But instead you can find a copy of a big quest-ending boss in a cave somewhere.The main issue I have with this game comes down to balance. The player is given a lot of tools and a lot of talismans and equipment that seems to imply that those tools would be useful, but the vast majority of them are just trash. Poison status damage is just worse Scarlet Rot. Holy damage is basically unusable at the end of the game. Smaller weapons like claws and daggers and fists stand no chance against larger enemies when you can't even reach their bodies. Death blight is completely useless in PvE, but a lot of spells/gear inflict it.On the flip side, some stuff just feels way too over-tuned. Jump attacks are almost always the best thing you can be doing as a melee player. Some sorceries scale so hard you might as well just have a gun to shoot enemies with. Dragon cult incantations are way more powerful than most other incantations. It feels like the game has a handful of ""correct"" builds, and a lot of distractions to throw you off of those builds, and it hopes you figure out which is which by the end game.All of that being said, this game is still a lot of fun. It feels great when you make a build that works well, and it has so many options that you'll be thinking of alternative builds for future characters the whole time you play."
Positive,Game of the year 2022
Positive,"Okay... so where do i begin... I first downloaded this game because everyone was talking about it. When i started playing, I had no idea what i was doing (no prior soul-like game experience) and was ending up running into enemies only to keep dying over and over again. This made me frustrated and demoralized to the point where I decided this game wasn't for me and returned it on steam. Fast forward 5 months later, my friends are still loving this game. So after watching a spoiler-free overview of the game, i decided to download it again during the steam sale and give it another try.  All i can say is.... WOW! I can't believe how much fun i'm having playing this game after giving it another chance. The lore, music, and boss fights are amazing! I have no background in playing soul-like games, but there were two key personal obstacles i had to get through to enjoy this game.1) Don't be a perfectionist! You will have moments where you are frustrated, accidentally fall off ledges to your doom, or keep losing to a boss. Nobody is keeping count of your failures, just go with the flow and do your best to tolerate them. Remember with a little bit of practice you will get good at taking on most if not all of the enemies in this game in no time.  2) There are no quest markers on your map (with the exception of the golden light trails). Some of us are use to having quest markers and NPC's guiding us through the journey, but this game does none of that and at times will make you feel lost and directionless. Remember, this game empowers you as a player to create your own journey and go explore the world the way you want to do it. I definitely recommend anyone to try the game! I re-purchased this game and gave it another try and it was really fun. Also, i would encourage anyone to watch a spoiler-free intro video on this game. It definitely helped me out!"
Positive,Bought this game. Died at the tree sentinel. Tilted. Refunded game.Decided that was weak and repurchased game.Was reminded that I am maiden-less.Acquired maiden.Became Elden Lord.Wrote review for game.
Positive,A Masterpiece. Easily in the TOP 5 Best Games I have ever played in my 26 years of life.
Positive,Doge Souls YaYa YES DOOOOD
Positive,Big cocks (cock also means rooster)
Positive,"Best souls game. Everything I ever wanted from a souls game. Best open world RPG game, period."
Positive,"After playing through a second time, I have decided that this is perhaps my favorite video game ever made.The difficulty is BONKERS, as to be expected. The sense of accomplishment after beating a boss is wonderful. I feel like a scholar when I'm watching 8 hour long lore videos at 3 AM after beating a fun boss. All the cool weapons, armors, spells, and endings make the game worth playing over several times, some of the best replay value in gaming history, I always find something new in every playthrough, which can last 80-100 hours.I would buy it full price. Perfect game. 10/10."
Positive,Elden Ring is great although it has a several things it needs to work out. ProsThe world From has built is GORGEOUS and MASSIVE. Combat is spicy and fun as hell (weapon arts are sexy). YOU GET A HORSE AND HIS NAME IS TORRENT (what else do you want)Sooo many weapons to slaughter your enemies with.Cons:Has bad performance issues at times regardless of graphic settings. Music I don't care much for; I just have it turned off so I can hear the world ambiance. (Dark Souls 3 OST is fire)Game hasn't had very good patches even though it's been out for a good month.PvP is broken and real cheaty broPvP is broken and real cheaty broPvP is broken and real cheaty broPvP is broken and real cheaty broOverall a delicious addition to 'Soulsborne'
Positive,I die so much and that makes me want to come back and keep playing so I can kill the boss that killed me. Then you find a giant flying chicken bird that gives you a crap ton of runes and become almighty powerful and lay ruin to the gods and bask in eternal overpowered glory.This Game is going to be Game of The Year 2022.Update: This Game Was Game of the Year 2022.
Positive,"its in the relaxing category for a reason! 10/10 super cosy, very easy-going :) loved every second of it"
Positive,"I've played 3 days now and I've maybe explored 12% of what the game has to offer. Game of the year, game of the decade. Runs fine even at max settings on a computer built with parts that aren't 5+ years old. Can't wait to pvp and coop more when they fix the server issues."
Positive,"So far, it's really really good. If you like Dark Souls, you will like this game a lot as well.Some minor performance issues (frame dips, but no big freezes), and I would really like more customizable controls. (c'mon guys, dark souls 2 let me rebind almost everything)But besides that, it's living up to my expectations"
Positive,"I am so very sorry that many players suffer stuttering and other various issues. As of writing, I have played for 4 hours and I haven't experienced any major stutter or bug. The game is gorgeous and overall a masterpiece. But there is a possibility it won't work on your PC, so I would recommend waiting a patch or two until it's fixed. I took a gamble and it payed off.EDIT after completing all achievements: Now that all game breaking bugs are fixed, I sank over 90 hours into the game and completed everything that there is to see (at least I hope so). The only major nitpick is the difficulty spikes near and at the end game. Some bosses are weirdly easy and some side bosses can one-shot you even with billion vigor. Hoping for DLCs down the line so I once again have the incentive to delve even deeper into this amazingly crafted world. Hands down one of the best games I had the privilege to play."

Positive,"I was supposed to go to work today, I missed several appointments, forgot to eat, and didn't make dinner for my husband. When he tried to beat me, I was able to quickly dodge and guard his attacks and take him down. Still stuck in the fucking castle though. I hate this game. 10/10 GOTY"
Positive,"The best open world RPG I have ever played. Elden Ring truly nails down what it means to just go out and have an adventure. Nothing is holding your hand, there isn't a bunch of stuff on your screen pointing you in a specific direction or to a specific person. You just go out, explore, and discover the world. On top of that, it has the renowned combat you know and love from a FromSoftware game. It can be brutal, unforgiving, but it isn't necessarily ""difficult"". The game isn't going out of its way to crush you or make you feel bad, it is simply not throwing the match, as most games tend to do. Elden Ring gives you the tools to succeed and from there you just need to figure out your enemy, learn from your mistakes, and keep trying. In my personal experience, and just know that it is indeed that, my own personal experience – I have not been running into too many technical difficulties. A stutter here, a stutter there, primarily in areas where the game is transitioning you from one zone to the next. No crashing, no frame drops, and no freezing. Hopefully FromSoftware irons out the issues in the coming weeks, but those issues are by no means universal.If it helps anyone, my rig consists of: Intel Core i7 970016gb RAMGeForce RTX 2060240 Hz Monitor And I downloaded the Elden Ring drivers from GeForce Experience (GeForce Game Ready Driver ver. 511.79). Not exactly top of line, but not necessarily middling either. Beyond that, Elden Ring is just brilliant."
Positive,You can tell how good a game is based on how many threads there are on /v/ discussing all the reasons it sucks.
Positive,It is very good
Positive,"this shit made me quit my job, sold my soul to keep playing this shit. i love it."
Positive,Besides the frame drops this game is amazing its the culmination of all of From Softwares games and ideas
Positive,"This shit is more addictive than crack, and I'm sure shadow of the erdtree is gonna be the end of me"
Positive,Game of the Year baby. Ponies coping and seething.
Positive,"A legit dating sim game, I really enjoy it"
Positive,"An absolutely incredible game with beautiful graphics, incredible music, perfect gameplay and probably the most annoying duo-boss in history. 11/10 would spam sleep pot on godskins again. PS.: Play STR/FTH build like a chad, slinging lightning and big claymore at anything that moves."
Positive,"I was on the fence for this game only because it's a Souls-type game and was worried it'd be too difficult for someone who's not familiar with them. My co-workers nagged me for an eternity about how good it was, so eventually I cracked and got it. Glad they did. It's amazing.The first 10-15 hours were a slog because I was just SO BAD at it, but now that I know what I'm doing, I have a much better sense of whether I can fight a guy or just come back to him later. And there is LOTS to explore, see, do, and kill."
Positive,Who is Grace and why do I have to touch her?
Positive,"Great game, especially if u hate life :)"
Positive,10/10 you can beat the shit out of your enemies with a stick and that's cool
Positive,2022 game of year confirmed
Positive,"Its fun challenging and rewarding, I recommend this game to people who enjoy open world aspect games and are ok with getting beaten around a bit before achieving the goal. its awesome 10/10 :)"
Positive,Basically everything you can ask for in a souls game. It's got everything.Bosses can one shot you later on if you don't invest heavily in HP and they get damage spongey themselves but all and all great game. Would recommend. 9/10
Positive,"Game of the Year 2023Best game that truly made me feel something. Even that something was fear, doubt, uncertain and anxious and finally conquering that fear made me move forward as a person. Definitely recommend for all people who love a challenge and work on themselves to overcome those challenges.There are mods available to make the experience easier for you. I recommended a co-op mod that makes it easier to play without invasions and easy mode mod that makes the game little bit easy for your skills. I do recommend checking the game out without mods first and try different builds(There are a lot of busted builds)FromSoft have truly outdone themselves with this game. Dark souls was always unforgiving and a depressing world i could never get into. Things don't make sense in dark souls in a common sense perspective and how alien the world building is. The same is true for Elden Ring but it's a lot less and oh my god the game is gorgeous. Elden Ring is the most newbie friendly souls game. Don't listen to internet people who dictate how to enjoy or play or live your life. It's just a game and having fun is the most important part. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did"
Positive,"If you're familiar with the Soulsborne games and like what From Software does there's no need to read further. You'll have a great time, will be unsurprisingly familiar with the game but will also discover a few new tidbits that will most certainly make you fall in love with the game like most From's games.However, if you're interested in Elden Ring because maybe you've played games like The Witcher, or Skyrim, or Breath of the Wild or any other open world-ish kinda-RPG and now there's a new open world game and maybe you hear from it at every corner of the internet, or even in that thing called real life, because it seems like the hottest shit in the yard and the only clues you have are ""it's difficult"" and ""it's an RPG"", you'll probably want to read on before jumping in and get crushed into the ground a hundred times before you even beat the first real endboss.+ art design and mystical world+ traversal (the horse is amazing)+ combat (many different styles and combinations)+ subtle storytelling, general direction pointer+ soundtrack+/- NPC and quests (don't expect The Witcher like quests; this is completely different, feels less cinematic bus also less mechanic and less to-do-list style)+/- difficulty (there are no difficulty settings, but the game offers some option to overcome difficult sequences; some will still find it too easy, some too difficult)+/- loot system (often feels unrewarding because there's rarely something making you vastly better, you won't have to fiddle with your overloaded inventory full of crap every minute, though)- technical aspects and render technology (no DLSS, no ray tracing, no FOV, no 21:9 and no >60fps without mods, flat lighting, missing shadows, FPS drops, stutter and other performance-issues)The story goes as this: The Elden Ring kept the world together but was shattered so the world keeps drifting apart and is practically broken. 90% of the population seems to be dead and half of the rest gone crazy or changed in other, more wicked ways. Then there are the Tarnished trying to set what's right and restore the world's order. You're one of them. Your task: collect the broken pieces of the Elden Ring who are being hold by demigods (your endbosses), repair the ring and become the Elden Lord (whatever that means, but apparently saving the world grants you its throne, so that makes somewhat sense).NPCs and faint light rays from Sites of Graces (your safe and rest points where you also level up) point you roughly directions. You still have to figure out how to get there, which enemies to fight, and which to avoid at first until later when you become stronger and better with your chosen playstyle.While the technology seems quite dated and lacks many PC features (no DLSS, no ray tracing, no >60fps support, no 21:9 support without mods, no FOV setting) the world itself is brilliantly designed with different areas resembling European medieval with dense forests, destroyed villages and ancient ruins, more hellish interpretations like earth covered with rot and disease, mushroom-like infestation, swamps and mountains and so on.You're practically free to roam wherever you want to and it's strongly advise because you'll find items that'll grant you some permanent bonuses but most importantly you'll gain experiences (Runes which is your currency for buying things and leveling up) and get better with the combat systems. After you feel more confident you take on enemies and bosses and dungeons you could not previously. When we talk about dungeons, there are some very small scale dungeons with a boss at the end and some treasure, and there are big dungeons more like your Demon's Souls/Dark Souls level with winding catacombs and alleys, shortcuts and traps and lots of hidden secrets – your classic Soulsborne experience.When fighting enemies the combat systems allows for a variety of playstyles due to offer control over both hands. Shield and sword? Wielding two swords? Left a magic wand and right an axe? No problem in ER. It also allows you to quickly access up to three armaments in each hand, letting you quickly switch from shield and hammer wearing warrior to wand wearing sorcerer or crossbow bolt shooting sharpshooter mid-fight.The storytelling isn't like your typical open world RPG. If you expect cutscenes and directing as in The Witcher or Asssassin's Creed, you'll be disappointed. Your character is silent and NPCs often only speak vague or give you only a few sentences. Which can be quite refreshing for a change; you won't be bombarded with information like in BioWare's games where you can talk to NPCs for HOURS. ER is ultimately more gameplay, less cinema. The cinematic cutscenes there are, however, are well done.ER often reminds me of Zelda with its subtlety and mysticism, often not telling you the truth or leaving many things implicit and unuttered. It has this wonder of a strange world that doesn't explain you everything and leaves room for interpretation or simply wonder.My only gripe with the game is that exploration could feel more rewarding. Often you'll go lengths in finding a treasure, only to get an item you already have two times that simply increases stamina recovery temporarily – very specific use and not making you stronger permanently. In ER, most things you find only last until you die or a few seconds. Weapons and armour you'll find is rarely inherently better but scales differently with different attributes and playstyle. If you therefore expect impressive loot you'll also be disappointed.Ultimately I find ER the most 'accessible' FS game because you still can compensate lack of player skill by farming and becoming stronger, and you can often summon an NPC and/or beasts fighting for you in certain areas. And just pulling agro from enemies and bosses is often a life saver."
Positive,"one of the most re-playable games ever, alot of weapons variety, alot of bosses that you 100% missed on your first play through, and the game is very rich in lore."
Positive,The closest I'll ever get to playing my first From Soft game again.

Positive,"Encompassing brutal yet rewarding boss fights, an enchantingly ominous open world, and a narrative cloaked in mystery, it embodies a journey of both pain and triumph. Dying 100 times to conquer a boss isn't a failure; it's a rite of passage in this darkly exquisite universe, offering unmatched satisfaction upon victory. Elden Ring is an unmissable, if punishing, adventure for those who relish overcoming ruthless challenges and uncovering hidden lore."
Positive,"This is my first entry in the souls genre, so I’ll just list of all the memorable things I did in this game.-died a lot-got “good”-still died a lot -I am Malenia Blade of Mikala -Maidenless -dog-finger but, hole11/10"

Positive,"There are so many little moments. Like I came upon a mine with an angry fire-breathing miner. I sneaked past him and stole his ore he was trying to mine. Then after dying and coming back through the same mine the ore was gone (I'd taken it), but the miner was still there. Instead of repeating his same mining animation or patrolling behavior or even being a threat he was just having a coffee break. He had nothing left to mine for since I'd taken his ore. So he was just kinda sitting there. Almost looking broken-hearted like he'd lost his purpose. It's little precious things like that... Carefully hand-crafted environmental and character-driven storytelling... Which have no reason to be there, but they put them in there, that make this my Game of the Year 2022."
Positive,It's Alright. I can see myself putting a couple of hours into this game.
Positive,best game ever made
Positive,FANTASTIC SOULS GAME. JUST NEEDS A BIT OF WORK ON THE PC PORT FOR PERFORMANCE ISSUES.
Positive,The apotheosis of everything From Software has ever created.
Positive,"I have I think about 25 or so hours into the game at this point. It's absolutely beautiful. Open world is much more forgiving, but grinding definitely helps. The exploration and discovery of all the locations, items, ect, is fantastic. The game 100% rewards exploration.The horse combat is fun and helps you make quick work of many mobs, in multi player, you don't get a horse, which is good to balance out the play and help keep some things a challenge.Multi player can span the entire game, you just have to re-invite for different zones. It's been a riot playing with friends. We have to do everything twice since progress is only stored on the hosts save but, you keep your souls from your visit so it's still fun and worth while to do. The bosses are interesting and brutal still. With a ton of mini bosses scattered across the land. Once you kill them, they are gone, so if you want something they drop, you help another player, this is a great way to encourage multi player. Besides the initial hiccups, and still some on going networking issues.... The game has been an absolute blast. Love it. I've played other souls games, only ever beat Dark Souls 2... Dark souls 3 and 1 was just so brutal trying to even get to the bosses. This game sets you up right next to the bosses. So it's a little easier in that respect. A grace I'm happy to have since I would get constantly owned before even getting to the bosses in 1 and 3... In 2, eventually mobs stopped re-spawning.. that's how I beat it heh. Networking issues and a few crashes get it a 8/10, they fix that I'll update to 10/10Shortly after Launch day:Now that the game works, it's beautiful. Will update as I go. First impressions though, it's super easy start, which is a odd thing for a souls game. Looking forward to getting owned on repeat though by I'm sure the very first boss.Launch day:Game just CTDs... I don't really have any time in it, let alone the reported time, as it doesn't ever launch...Windows 10i9 10900k32 gig ramM.23090FTW3Won't even start..."
Positive,fire giant gives me unaliving thoughts. LOVE IT.
Positive,"I had never played soul's game before, but this game truly amazed me."
Positive,"Pros:-The best of everything from all their other titles, blended in a way that doesn't feel patchworked.-The open world was not turned into a Ubisoft sandbox of busywork. Obviously there are some copy-pasted assets, but it doesn't feel like ""clear these 100 bandit camps"".-I'm still on the fence about the crafting, but it at least doesn't detract from the game and allows you to craft items that have otherwise been a pain to gather/limited in supply in other FromSoftware titles.-Runs mostly fine, even on my below-minimum-requirements machine (currently running 8GB of RAM rather than the recommended 12)Cons:-Combat options like for the player like stealth and verticality have been expanded, but the AI is still dumber than a sack of hammers and really doesn't respond well to backstab safaris.-UI and customization is initially a bit overwhelming for me, so I can only imagine how new Souls-like players feel.-Some stuttering issues that are difficult to pinpoint the cause of, but I'm running at under 12GB RAM so make of that what you will.-Easy Anti-Cheat. Yay, no cheaters encountered yet, boo, performance hits and long startup times.-""Press any key"" on the start menu does not actually mean press any key."
Positive,"This game is incredible. This is my first souls game and my god it makes me want to go back and play dark souls. The story is amazing. The characters are amazing. The game play, weapons, armour, spells are amazing. I'm coming to the end of my first play through and after i finish i literally want to play it again with a different build. Let me just say there's a reason this game got game of the year on steam. The boss fights are incredible, when you spend a while on a boss and finally beat them it feels so rewarding. I also love how flexible the game is for all players, no matter your gaming skill. All the spells, items, summons and npcs make it so casual players can still enjoy the game without spending hours and hours on a boss. But if you do want a challenge you can avoid these and a lot of bosses become incredibly tough.I absolutely love this game"
Positive,I hate souls games. I have hated every single Dark Souls. Didn't Bother with Sekiro. Didn't try Bloodborne. A friend swore up and down that this one though I would actually like. He doubled down and bought it for me. Well he was right. This game is so so so so good. It's like your elementary school friend Skyrim moved away to a rough city and became kind of an asshole but it's fun to hang out with them still since their stories are so good. It's brutal. It's a souls game. But they made so many quality of life changes that I can actually enjoy this game. It is absolutely immense. I still haven't completed my first play-through and don't expect to until at least 100 hours. This is a game that actually matches up to all the hype and is 100% worth the $60. Buy it.
Positive,good game ahead
Positive,"This game does not comprise its artistic vision, from design, to visuals, to story. From does not chase trends, they create them. Not on purpose, but just because they do not comprise. This can change, but for the last... what, ten years or more, they have not. You could see this is the games they made before the Souls games, like Kings Field, and my fav Armored Core.Anyway, I think this is one of the best games ever made. I guess I have say 'its not perfect', but nothing is, so I won't. What I will say, if you let yourself be humbled, struggle, and grow, it will fill you with wonder. There are moments, many, where you see a vista for the first time, and it will blow your mind. There are moments where you will see an enemy, and think 'how the hell can I kill this?',  as it destroys you over and over... until you learn, and you overcome the panic inducing fear, and kill it with a sliver of health left... and you will yell out loud a triumphant bellow at the monitor. The feeling you get from that is worth getting better, trying different builds, learning the enemy's moves and weaknesses. From powerlessness to powerful. All the while, doing this in a gigantic world with hundreds of secrets and deep meaning if you seek it out."
Positive,"So this is kind of an incredible game, huh?It's like Dark Souls but you ride a horse and fight every boss three times."
Positive,"Good Gem, very cool, much wow"
Positive,Didn't expect message
Positive,lots of sandwiches :))) love a sandwich
Positive,Simply a masterpiece.
Positive,Never thought I would enjoy this type of game....Now its all i want to play.
Positive,"open world gamble paid off even with a fair few caveats around copy pasted dungeons and some annoying input reading bosses. the highlights are high enough to carry it, The glut of runes and feasible changing of build mid-game really helps you play around and be inventive with weapon arts and experiment with character concepts, or chase whatever munchkin guide-reading winmore cheese build that 'content creators' are talking about if youre one of those people who gets filtered and doesn't just use mimic to cope with being bad like true patricians"
Positive,"It's certainly not perfect, and there are some big problems i have with it (pvp disappointing a bit, for one, at the moment), but considering it was a massive undertaking, and so much bigger in scale for Fromsoft, it's genuinely awe inspiring how well they pulled this game off.Everything about it is greatbut it does, really, scratch that itch a lot of open world games don't scratch right for me: that experience of getting lost in a scary, big world. It's gorgeous, engaging, and makes you really feel like a wayward adventurer trying to score the coolest loot and tales you can find.Love it"
Positive,"A great entry in the FromSoftware universe of games. Its easy for new players and veterans alike to pick up, but a challenge to master. The content level of this game feels endless and immersive. I constantly find myself trying to do the main story, but instead end up easily pulled into side content. This is a game that is worth savoring, listen to character dialog, fight the hidden bosses, try new weapons or a build outside your comfort zone. At times you will want to break your controller, but that makes victory all the more rewarding. This is not a game for everyone, but its a great place to start your FromSoftware journey."
Positive,"Remember how everyone laughed at Dying light 2 needing 500h to complete? This is that game. This is the biggest most detailed world I've ever seen. So many weapons, so many bosses, so much too see. So many of my friends telling me about different encounters, going different places, taking different routes. Everyone has a different experience. I can imagine someone needing months to finish the game if you only play for a few hours each week. There is so much to see and and with the known Dark Souls gameplay style and difficulty you will need hours time to finish an area.I had some technical difficulties. Game shut down a few times inexplicably, had some freezes that forced me to alt+f4 the game and every so often I can't see signs of my friends I just tried a boss with minutes ago, which points to a connection problem to the Elden Ring server behind the scenes in my opinion.Despite all that this game delivered. A masterpiece.10/10"
Positive,Try finger but hole
Positive,Ohhhhh elden ring ( ͡° ᴥ ͡°)
Positive,Best thing since Skyrim.
Positive,Try fingersbut hole9.9/10 game gud
Positive,"Thoroughly enjoy this game and the ability to explore and find new areas and treasures is seemingly limitless, at least for now. I'm halfway through my second run and still finding many places I missed on my first try, or seeing how the story plays out differently. The bosses are challenging, but not impossible, and the open-world aspect allows you to turn around to more manageable regions until you can get better at fighting, thus keeping gameplay fluid (at least when you know to retreat). That effectively limits the feeling of being stuck on a boss in more linear games."
Positive,"This game is the definition of a masterpiece. From the open world experience captivating me with its beauty at every single corner paired with it's enjoyable combat system that favours any type of build. I am glad that this game was my first souls borne game. It has everything, fun and enjoyable bosses(Most of the time at least), Amazing OST and vibrant music that always add to the atmosphere of the game and most importantly the level of world building this game has, it's unbelievably godlike. I can't wait to play other souls like games after exploring both the base game and dlc fully, Thanks Miyazaki and fromsoftware for creating a unparalleled experience that isn't like any other i have ever seen.""Brave Tarnished ...Thy Strength Befits a Crown"" - The gigachad of the century"

Positive,"Oh, Elden Ring, game of the year ahead.."
Positive,"good bideo, wao"
Positive,Dark souls open world! With jumping!
Positive,"Why is it always joy?Try fingers, but hole."
Positive,"This game cured my depression, very much recommend."
Positive,Visions of Game Of The Year
Positive,This game has an unparallelled open world experience. Even if it will pound you into the dirt hundreds of times.
Positive,"Truly a captivating open world experience that isn't afraid to flip you the bird and throw you off a cliff. The DLC introduces a difficulty not seen before in fromsoft games be it the Bosses or lesser enemies, you will always Face a proper challenge especially if you choose to not use the Scadutree Fragments introduced in the DLC. 10/10 game everyone needs to experience at least Once in their Lives."
Positive,"Story - 10/10Beautiful story and atmosphere.PvE -  8.5/10Has some issues and broken mechanics.PvP - 1/10Dragged invasions through the mud compared to DarkSouls3 which also changed how you do fight clubs, and no arena in the game so the only pvp you will get is 1v2 or 1v3 and get meat grinded.... only way to do somewhat of a fight club is to have another friend actively on with you so you cant host one by yourself anymore and then even at that you only get one other person and 2 invaders."
Positive,"I only have a few hours in so far but it's amazing. There's the usual game launch stutter or framedrop here or there, especially for a fromsoft game (anyone remember DS3 or Sekiro at launch) but the game is completely playable, no game breaking bugs, and it's one of FROM's best games, easily. If you've played Bloodborne this is like heaven compared to that so.. not sure what all the whining and complaints are for."
Positive,"Elden ring is a great game, the beginning is a bit rough and the first main boss is very hard that it drove me off the game in frustration for a while, but after that I got into it.There is much more content compared to the previous soulsborne games, many bosses, mini-bosses, side quests, secrets, weapons, rings, magic spells, items, etc.The world is really huge it is easy to stray from your goal and just go exploring. The environment is gorgeous, character models are very well made, weather and particle effects are top notch.It is an open world game, unlike the previous titles, which is new to this genre. You won't run out of things to do or places to explore.Just a piece of advice. If you got into a new area and noticed that enemies are extremely hard and you are not dealing enough damage, please take the hint that you are not supposed to be here yet. Leave this area for now until you have progressed a bit and upgraded your character stats and weapons, otherwise you are just torturing yourself for no reason.There are many weapons, melee and ranged, with different effects and move sets, that suit every taste. Magic, of course, has a big role. It is split into 2 categories. There are so many spells. It is fun to use in general.Co-op is fun, but network is unstable. I got disconnected from my friend several times. I hope they fix these issues soon.It is the latest and one of the best games From software has made so far. For me it is the game of the year hands down. It is definitely worth your time and effort if you are into this genre. It is not an easy game or a walk in the park, even for veterans of the souls games, but this is a part of its charm.Game is running well for me. I get stable 60 fps at 1080p, on Maximum gfx settings, with rare occasions of brief stuttering.I'm running a core i7 8700K, GTX 1080, 1 TB SSD (Samsung 970 EVO), 32 GB RAM."

Positive,"If you like Souls games, you'll like this. Its slightly easier than previous games, so it may be worth giving it a go if you've struggled with the difficulty of previous games."
Positive,"Game of The Year. Haven't obsessed over a game so much in so long. **Edit: Just finished the game and still wanting more. Highly recommend to people wanting to try a Souls type, since this was my first proper go at one and first completion of one."
Positive,"14 Hours in two days, Thats all i need to say."
Positive,"This review is for the folks who have never or maybe just once played a game from the Soulsborne series by From Software.  Series veterans who know the name Vaati or can literally hear, ""How's it feel, Seath..."" in their heads (among so many others) are dyed-in-the-wool and can nitpick Elden Ring until the cows come home, get old and develop some kind of awful tumor in the barn.  Regardless of their gripes, this game is fantastic... if it's your bag.The fact is that the Souls series and its numerous prodigies have always been niche despite its overwhelming popularity and it's often the case that someone out there hears about the hype and the memes and feels a heavy load of FOMO, picks up something from the series and gets completely blindsided by what kind of game it is.  So I'll do my best to anticipate some of the biggest questions from those who are wondering whether or not Elden Ring is the one that's going to win them over.Yes... and a little no.  Yes because it stands alone and is fairly forgiving in the series' famed difficulty with tons of optional challenges that can be completely ignored, a massive open world that doesn't funnel you into danger until you're ready for it and a whole lot of different weapons and items to style your play on (but you'll have to go find most of it).  Being the latest iteration of From's formula, ER is arguably the best-playing of the bunch with lots of QoL improvements over its predecessors when it comes to controls and interface.  No matter the circumstances, Elden Ring is a great place to start and while it (or any other game in the series) won't really hold your hand, you'll soon find a way to survive and exploration won't be so scary anymore, especially when most of the time you can just hop on your magic horse and whack at people as you zip past them.  The only reason I'd say no is that if you're looking to go to any other game in the series, Elden Ring doesn't really prepare you for them; you'll learn the DNA and gain the muscle reflexes, of course, but the open-world nature of ER is new to the series and not characteristic of how the earlier games play.  Most notably, ER shares most of its design principles with the Dark Souls trilogy rather than the quick-fire Bloodborne or the block-everything play of Sekiro.Probably not, but it depends on what turned you off in the first place.  The controls, while improved, are still mostly the same and yes, your run button is still mapped to your dodge button.  The landscape is hauntingly beautiful, but still a dreary and depressing place to explore even though you're outside a lot.  Boss fights are still daunting and terrifying challenges.  On the other hand, the difficulty here is much more forgiving (I will not say it's 'easy') and you have far more control over the pace of how you play.  Invasions don't really happen all that much or at all until way later or unless you want them to happen.  You also don't need friends because you can summon stuff to help you almost whenever you want.  Once you get the horse, a whole world opens up to you and if you're really struggling, you can always hop on its back and rush by many enemies safely while hitting them and gaining much-needed XP.  But even dying and losing all your hard-won runes (ER's version of souls) isn't that big a deal because the game is constantly giving them to you.  I'm not kidding.  Wander around a bit and you'll just find them on the ground.  So maybe that can change your mind, at least for a little while.  In the end, the game can be enjoyed by anyone, but a certain mindset needs to be present - you need to enjoy being challenged and trolled and feel great satisfaction in overcoming obstacles.  Yes, some bosses might take you an hour or two to figure out how to beat, but when you beat them, therein lies the biggest draw of why people play these games.If you happen to like your games to show you everything like a movie does with hard-hitting emotional scenes and character development, then no.  No, it's not.  If you like everyone to speak in cryptic tones, spaced few and far between each other and working to discover your story, then yes!  As you may have heard, much of the lore and backstory to the world of Elden Ring is found in item descriptions, just like in its predecessors.  People talk about the 'story' all the time because putting everything into item descriptions allows From Software to dive deeply and richly into the world they've built without sidelining the player for hours of exposition.  Few people actually talk about the main story because true-to-form, you are coming into things long after the big stuff has happened and now it's up to you to figure out your place in the world's history.  The game only tells you that you should put together the broken Elden Ring and become the Elden Lord, but it won't tell you why the heck you want to do this in the first place.  Then again, nobody told Mario to walk to the right, either.  Whether or not you figure stuff out is up to you and for the most part, there's a subset of players who really, really enjoy that aspect of the Souls series.  On the other hand, a lot of people just don't care and are more interested in the challenge.  If you only care about the story, then stick to YouTube; the only real experience you're missing by having someone explain it to you is finding the puzzle pieces and putting them together yourself.  There's no cutscene or anything to reward you for finding a full set of armor, for example, but if you read all of its descriptions, you'll get a ton of implicit or explicit lore to enjoy.If your main gaming experience is standard AAA third-person games coming out of EA, Rockstar, and Ubisoft, then yeah, it's a pretty difficult transition from being guided at all times to being completely unguided and left to your own devices.  That said, as stated above, Elden Ring is the most accessible and forgiving entry into the series in many ways.  There's a lot of crutches to lean on in the form of your horse or spirit summons that allow you to employ hit-n-run tactics or use NPCs to distract bosses and really, the 'difficulty' is really only in developing your reflexes which naturally comes over time.  I posit that the entire series can be enjoyed by anyone so long as they have the proper mindset - you are expected to lose repeatedly and you need to be okay with that.  Nothing lost cannot be recovered over time.  The stakes are high, to be sure, and even the lowliest of enemies can hit pretty dang hard, make no mistake; however, it's not about being masochistic and subjecting yourself to torture (for the most part, at least).  It's about being challenged and finding the right way to overcome that challenge and most importantly, allowing yourself to fail at that challenge, sometimes repeatedly.  It's not a game to be binged on a weekend and then you move on - it takes time, practice, and sometimes just straight memorization to get through some obstacles and while yes, there are some arguably cheap bosses out there, people say that like that's never been the case in the entire series.  It has.  And it will continue to be.  Yet nothing is impossible if you have patience and that is the key.  If you are an impatient sort, move on.  Otherwise, I don't find the game to be 'hard' at all in that except for some outliers, I think anyone can get by if they just take a breath and try again.  If you can do that, Elden Ring and its predecessors can be an entirely rewarding gaming experience and you can't just throw cash at it to make your life easier.  This is how people 'git gud'.In short: start here, if at all"
Positive,"Finger, but hole"
Positive,It's BIG Dark Souls
Positive,"The game is great. Occasional graphical stuttering, but I'm running it on max, and its rare. The difficulty is a bell curve."
Positive,beautiful.you can jump.horse.
Positive,The hardest boss is the co-op system
Positive,"Absolutely loved the experience. There are a few minor things about this game that I didn't personally like very much (from the design perspective), but overall I can sat that if you are still debating whether or not to buy this game, put your mind at rest and dive deep into the Lands Between."
Positive,The best souls game

Positive,Game of the century.
Positive,This game make me wanna kill myself.12/10
Positive,Absolute masterpiece. Can't go back to ds3 since this game IS SO DAMN GOOD!
Positive,"I've played a whole lot of Dark Souls and Dark Souls 3, I think both are masterpieces. Elden Ring feels what the whole Souls franchise was building towards. I still think I've barely scratched the surface."
Positive,Dayum good game! This is my new drug...literally ;-{
Positive,Difficult but fun if you like dark souls I would recommend you get this game. 8/10
Positive,"Never in my life did a game push me so close to ending my own life one instant, and then the next, thinking this the best damn video game I have ever played in my life. Feels like my last romantic relationship. Thank you Myazaki and FromSoft."
Positive,"I have a few stuttering issues but nothing that I can't deal with. I suppose I got lucky in that case. The game itself is amazing, basically everything that I could want out of a Souls game and more that I never knew I wanted."
Positive,"Had a blast just wandering around and exploring random dungeons for like 10 hours before I even realized there was a ""main storyline"" to follow in a church way back near the starting point10/10EDIT: It took me 150 hours to finish one playthrough (playing probably 90% solo without looking up anything or using any guides). After starting again on New Game+ and still having so much that I haven't done or seen, I realize that this might be one of the greatest games of all time. I truly feel like we have another Ocarina of Time on our hands here. I mean seriously, there's just so much replay value in the vanilla game alone, granted you don't ruin it for yourself by googling everything (or anything, preferably). Having gone through my first playthough as a pure, katana-only Samurai, switching things up to a dual GS user with heavy incant in New Game+ really adds to the replayability. Like all Souls game, is there are plenty of playstyles that will suit almost any type of player, and so much content and branching stories that you really need to do multiple runs of new game+ if you truly want to see everything (which just gives one an excuse to switch it up to another build)."
Positive,"For fans of other Soulsborne titles this game is a must have. The world is amazing, the NPCs memorable and the combat is slicker than ever. Honestly, if it weren't for one late game required boss I would give it a 10/10 but that smoldering heap of garbage towards the end mars an otherwise perfect gaming experience.9/10"
Positive,I played DS3 for over a thousand hours. I suspect Im going to double that with this one.Invasions need work though. Bring back six player invasions.
Positive,one of the best games ive ever played
Positive,"Seriously a masterpiece. They took everything good from the Dark Souls series and added on top of it. That doesn't mean it's a mess, it is incredibly lenient and allows for any type of strategies. Beautiful game."
Positive,this game made me lie to my boss.
Positive,"As a male audience, I can fulfill my fantasies in this game; furthermore, I can be hugged."
Positive,"As a new player to the souls series I strongly recommend playing this game, as an open world game I was expecting the average ubisoft open world of going from point A to point B liberating outposts and all that lark; Elden Ring however throws you into this massive world which is full of life and endless things to do. I'm not really that good at story based single player games because I tend to lose interest after certain parts of the story where things die down but Elden Ring kept me interested until the final boss, speaking of bosses I find alot of the bosses in this game amazing with a few exceptions like the copy paste ones but even they are few in number. If you want an introduction into the souls games I strongly recommend buying this one due to it being replayable and can be turned into an easy game if you get the right equipment. yeah."

Positive,"I don't typically like try-hard challenging games, but I do love me some 3rd person action RPGs, and this is the first FROM entry that knocks it out of the park for me.  While a bit more relaxed than its DS brethren, it still motivated me to sweat and swear my way through the whole darn game and finally finish with my faith-based murderhobo.  I didn't even miss some of the side content!  There's a lot and it's infuriatingly easy to miss or munsen up.  The instant any new DLC/xpac is out, I will be back to whisper-cursing and fist-pumping in the wee hours of the morning, trying not to wake my downstairs neighbors.  The combat is sublime, the world is interesting and the plot is...well, like some half-aborted avant-garde anime nightmare submerged in lysergic acid - but who really cares?  We just want to bonk."
Positive,"to be brief, this is the culmination of almost a decade of FromSoftware's design decisions being refined down to a science by their team, and having that newly-created formula applied to what may be one of the most ambitious, rich, beautiful open worlds i've ever had the pleasure of experiencing in a video game. if the linear, somewhat clunky, grounded nature of the souls games kept you away in the past, i implore you to give this title a shot. if a recommendation was all you wanted to hear, this should be all you need, but i will elaborate.it is jam-packed with things to explore, secrets to uncover, almost to the point of being overwhelming for a veteran of the soulsborne series of games - as if i am constantly anxious about missing out on secrets, but in the best way possible. because no matter where i sidetrack to, i find something to do, and that much cannot be said for most other open-world adventures released in recent memory.i am nowhere near completing the game, but even if you only play this game for the same amount of time that i had when i wrote this review, i would still count every second of that time worth the price of admission; but i know there is so much more to enjoy and i cannot wait to continue.every playstyle is viable, experimentation is encouraged, and you will undoubtedly find that no matter which weapon you wind up using, every move in its moveset is a viable option during encounters. incantations and sorceries are incredibly satisfying to use, everything fits seamlessly onto the mounted combat they have incorporated alongside the horse, which is an absolute blast to explore with and makes traversing the gigantic world that much more lovely.elden ring makes every souls game that FromSoftware released feel like it was just a piece of the puzzle, a way to find what gameplay mechanics do and do not work in conjunction, mixing together paints in just the right way to get the color they wanted to paint the open world canvas with.and they nailed it.the game is difficult, yes, but no matter how insurmountable it may seem at times, the open world allows so much subversion of obstacles that it's practically impossible for any player to reach a 'dead end'. death is still punishing, particularly with the usage of Great Runes, but the design decision to put respawn points near bosses - both world bosses and dungeon bosses - cuts down on unnecessary travel time and lets you get back into the action after you die to the same attack for the 4th time because you haven't figured out how to dodge it properly yet.and then you have the soundtrack, in which the ambient exploration music, general battle music, and phenomenal boss themes are all finely tuned to enhance the experience. the sound design in general, from the battle cries of enemies to the impact of weapons, and of course the aforementioned sorceries and incantations, FromSoftware has admittedly outdone themselves this time.this title is a masterpiece, a genre-defining video game that people will compare new releases to for the foreseeable future. is it flawless? no, but really that's just because a piece of art cannot by definition be flawless. i genuinely believe that in terms of open world adventure titles, particularly high fantasy and dark fantasy ones, elden ring has set a new bar that will be very difficult for any developer to vault over as far as i can tell. i cannot put a number to my opinion of this game, but it is without a doubt one of the most enjoyable video game experiences i have had in a very long time.also, there's a wieldable anchor in this game, and if you don't think that's the coolest shit then i don't know what else to tell you"
Positive,Elden Ring is one of the games of all time. 11/10
Positive,"The best game of all time, minor performance issues notwithstanding."
Positive,"Yes, it has stutter issues. That's clearly a problem. But I'm enjoying the game either way."
Positive,dark souls with jump
Positive,There's a shortage of perfect games in this world. It would be a shame if you did not play this one.
Positive,"This game is absolutely fantastic. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is even remotely interested in it and I really hope that this game shapes, the future of gaming."
Positive,Not sure why they renamed my copy of Dark Souls 4 to Elder Rings
Positive,"I might update this later and make a deeper, longer and more detailed review of the game, but until then:Probably the number one game of all time! (ever)Master Piece!Beautiful!"
Positive,Second best Fromsoftware game to date.
Positive,this game is insanely fucking good i cannot believe it how the fuck can they outdodarksoulshowhowthefucktheycombinedall3ofthemandthentunedupthemappingevenmore THE WORLD IS SO GOOD AND SO BIG  CHONK AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA I LOVE IT
Positive,"So far havent played much but, altough i feel its easier than any other souls games i have played, i definetly am having more fun, i love the fact its Open world unlike dark souls for example, the weapons, magics and everything else feels amazing here. Definetly worth itEDITstill havent played much after this edit but its pretty fun and i've killed the elden beast, still am having fun the same way as when i started it"
Positive,40 hours in and still don't know what the fuck is going on
Positive,Try fingers but hole
Positive,Masterpiece. I haven't enjoyed a game this much in so long.
Positive,"Playing Elden Ring is like being in an abusive relationship you can't leave; You keep coming back, thinking you can fix it, that it's changed. And for a while it seems to have, and things are good. And then suddenly it punches you in the face because you were a bit too happy....Real talk though, game is amazing. Beautiful, atmospheric. It's souls through and through. But better.However, I can't recommend it right now, because it seems Fromsoft have gone backwards. Sekiro and DS3 were decent PC ports. Elden Ring is a *terrible* PC port. Frame drops, stutters, freezes. I can't believe this got past QA.To be honest, it's so bad I was going to refund it. But I'd *sailed* past my 2 hour window. They will no doubt patch and optimize and fix this, but my god, it's killed so much of my initial hype for the game, and made playing it kind of a chore.Much sadness :/EDIT 1: So another patch, and still the game is questionably playable. Overall performance, and lots of microstutters are better. But it still crashes very frequently, with no apparent rhyme or reason. Yesterday? Played for hours with no issues. Today? Froze 3 times in a cave, and then crashed 3 times in the space of 10 minutes trying to fight the same boss of an area.This is completely unacceptable. Still cannot recommend yet.EDIT 2: So, 1.05 onwards game has been more stable. I've also since changed to new hardware and it's been running much better. However, it *still* has terrible performance issues. My partner's machine has the same freezing problems (completely different hardware config to mine, still well over recommended spec). It's particularly bad if you use a controller and it loses connectivity for a second (as can happen with a PS4 controller after time), the game will lock up for 5+ minutes, then kick you offline for ""Unstable frame rates"".Like, we need an extra option between recommend and not recommend. Like, the sideways thumb? I recommend the game for the amazing gameplay and everything in it. I don't recommend the PC version because it's so poorly, terribly ported and still, over half a year of patches later, has issues you don't get on console. Not good enough tbh :/EDIT 3: In the most recent balance patches, game stability *seems* to be okay now. It took a while, but From have somewhat delivered. So it gets the thumbs up now. Still incredibly disappointed it's taken so long. GotY for sure though.So, I give it a Yes/no/maybe? recommendation :<"
Positive,My gambling addict friend said if I post a review on Elden Ring and it gets 100 likes and Awards that he will buy me a case of beer and some vodka . So I'm just gonna leave this here.
Positive,is good. hyped for elden ring 3
Positive,"I first met From Software's work in Dark Souls 3, it had stunning visuals, immersive and personality filled bosses and a cast of characters that I fell in love with instantly. Shortly after, Sekiro was released, I 100% it just like I did with DS3 and I once again was stunned by the absolute beauty of the work and polish that From Software puts into its games. While waiting for Elden Ring I played Dark Souls Remastered, the level design was unmatched by any game AT ALL, and it was released over a decade ago now. And now here I am already pouring dozens of hours into Elden Ring, loving every second of it. Marvelling at the landscapes, pining for more lore around each and every boss and npc, and trying out every build I can think of. This game is the best purchase in the gaming industry in years, and I don't think this review is the first one to tell you that. Edit: After more time with the game, the bosses in Elden Ring don't hold up to the standard of other From Soft titles, while that does make me sad as bosses are what got me invested in DS3, it is understandable due to the heavier focus on world design and weapon arts."
Positive,"You will die hundreds of times to the tiniest of goons but then you will first try one of the hardest bosses in the game.11/10 (besides haligtree)""CURSE YOU BAYLE"" -Igon"
Positive,The Best game i ever played
Positive,peak  of gaming industry and a masterpiece and a form of art where every frame is a canvas painted with a masterpiece. that's all i can say
Positive,"Great build variety, not a fan of the open world for new game plus purposes or new characters.Menuing sucks as per usual souls game. 5x5 grid to search hundreds of items on your inventory.75 inputs needed to max upgrade a weapon.No loadouts or preset options, otherwise would spend dozens of hours creating thematic/ lore accurate presets with all different weapons, armor, talismans,etc.No add as favorite or similar marking options.No equip full armor set option. Good luck finding those braces or leggins of the set you want!Only one chest so you cant separate into stuff or sort in groups of your liking,No discarding items directly from chest; need to add item to inventory, close menu, leave bonfire, open inventory and discard from there.Minor concerns for most people surely but just pointing it out as things that could improve an otherwise fantastic game."
Positive,"I've grown sick of AAAAA++ open world fun parks with tiny repetative quests at every meter, but this is something you don't get in other games. The open world is amazing and huge, but also surprisingly pastoral and picturesque for a world of death and sadness. There is little of that copy-paste feeling, everything is set up in such a way that even the less significant campsites feel somewhat unique and memorable.The gameplay features a lot less bull❤️❤️❤️❤️ than Dark Souls but still has that Montessori charm where you poke around different directions and have no idea if the next monster is too strong for you or not. Also, horseback combat is the best I've tried in video games.That said, it can still be a frustrating experience with tons of ""gotcha"" situations that hinder your current progress and no amount of online messages can help that. But if you're thinking about buying a soulslike, you probably know what to expect and already have a spare gamepad for situations where you throw the current one out the window."
Positive,i love elder ring
Positive,Great game! I enjoy dying because I'm trash!
Positive,No controller was harmed during playtrough.
Positive,"rage inducing, very good"
Positive,"ALL HAIL THE ELDEN LORD LORDAZIZO03, MY FIRST COMMAND SHALL BE GIVE ME RANNI AND HER FOUR HANDS *Side eye* NO QUESTIONS ASKED. This game so good made me roleplay, and this game so easy i named my morning shit Elden Ring"
Positive,I've beaten this game five times and I still haven't done half of the side quests or interacted with magic beyond buffs. This game is beyond massive. 10/10
Positive,"Oh Heavenly Father, bear witness to the strength of your own creation"
Positive,absolutely the best game ever created
Positive,This is it!
Positive,"help, can't help playing"
Positive,"Great game to explore on your own and even better to join a friend. There's a lot of weak players end game that camp the starting zones with powerful items, so heads up if you try to join a friend in the starter zones."
Positive,Ranni is hot
Positive,Best Game Ever!
Positive,amazing game now imma go buy 6 feet of rope and a wobly stool rq
Positive,Exploding Pizza carried me through this beautifully hard and tragic game. Very punishing game where patience is necessity and planning is crucial. Wish it had photo mode but still 10/10 game. Re playable too.
Positive,"I've played every game in this series, but this one could be my favorite.  There's a lot of good options for weapons and playstyle, and there's so many unique enemies, even if some of them are copies.  The actual core story path to the end is not too long, but the optional content is near 100 hours, not including replays. The gameplay is so good, it makes people hallucinate a story.  My only complaint is that the co-op is a bit clunky.  There's thankfully a mod for that, but I don't give the devs credit for community-made content.It's the DARK SOULS (TM) of FromSoft games 9.5/10"
Positive,"After nearly a year and 200 immersive hours, I've conquered Elden Ring. As my first foray into the world of soul-like games and expansive open maps, it was a breathtaking journey. The game's beauty and the experience it offered were truly remarkable. An unforgettable adventure."
Positive,Overwhelmingly positive it is.
Positive,Скоро будет 2 года как я прохожу эту игру. Jokerge
Positive,"Elden Ring is an unrivaled gaming masterpiece.Elden Ring isn't just a game; it's a sublime experience that has redefined the very essence of gaming. FromSoftware, in a harmonious collaboration with George R.R. Martin, has given birth to a world that is not merely played but lived, felt, and remembered.One of Elden Ring's crowning achievements is its expansive open-world design. The Lands Between, an immense and interconnected realm, beckons players with its enchanting landscapes, hidden dungeons, and formidable adversaries. Each corner of this world holds secrets and wonders, inviting players to embark on a journey of exploration and discovery.The narrative woven by Hidetaka Miyazaki and George R.R. Martin is a masterpiece in itself. Elden Ring's lore is a rich tapestry, intricately detailing the lives of its characters and the twists of its storyline. Every decision made by the player carries weight, adding layers of complexity to an already immersive narrative.In the heart of Elden Ring lies a combat system that is as graceful as it is brutal. The integration of mounted combat, magic, and an array of weapons provides players with a diverse arsenal to face the challenges that await. Mastering these mechanics is not just a skill; it's an art, rewarding players for their dedication and skill.Visually, Elden Ring is nothing short of breathtaking. From colossal bosses to the minutiae of the environment, the game is a visual spectacle. The play of light, the intricacy of character designs, and the dynamic weather systems contribute to an experience that feels like more than just a game; it's a living, breathing world.The game's sound design is equally praiseworthy. The haunting melodies, ambient sounds, and the clash of weapons in battle create an audio landscape that enhances the emotional depth of every moment. The voice acting adds authenticity to the characters, further immersing players in the world of Elden Ring.Beyond its technical prowess, Elden Ring is a testament to respect and challenge. The difficulty, a trademark of FromSoftware, is finely balanced, providing a steep yet fair learning curve. Overcoming challenges fosters a unique bond between the player and the game world, creating a sense of accomplishment that resonates deeply.In conclusion, Elden Ring isn't just a game; it's a magnum opus that transcends the boundaries of traditional gaming. With its stunning visuals, intricate storytelling, challenging gameplay, and meticulous attention to detail, Elden Ring stands as the pinnacle of gaming achievement. It sets a new standard, leaving an indelible mark on the industry and cementing its place as the best game ever created."
Positive,for the closet masochist
Positive,"Yeah it good, also play the fucking game jac"
Positive,"Elden Ring is one of the greatest exploration games that I've played in years.  Hidden quests, map regions, dungeons, and countless items to find.  It's pretty staggering in scope.  To the game's credit, you can pretty much beeline to the endgame in addition to bite-sized and lengthy side excursions.  Your time is rewarded no matter how you play this game.As with other FromSoftware titles, game knowledge is your greatest ally and that really only comes with sufficient trial and error.  New Souls-like players might hit the usual barriers of frustration, but those can be overcome with character leveling instead of skill alone (for better or worse).  The game is not unfairly difficult at all.  Even when you get stuck you can summon friends and random players to help crush a boss or dungeon.  Nothing new there.I personally recommend following a build guide for basic character progression.  As a new player, going no-guide felt like I was fumbling around without focus, and that distracted from my enjoyment of the game.  You can re-spec your stats if you mess up, just be aware that it requires a specific item and other events to be completed.  Avoid relying on FAQs and sites too much during your initial runs unless you're chasing build gear; there's a ton of fun secrets in the game.Elden Ring's storytelling is not for everyone; lore is drip-fed to you via in-game items along with landmarks, environments encountered during the game.  You'll probably need to watch videos to get the full understanding of the characters and backstory.TL:DR; Elden Ring is an incredible experience.  I recommend it to just about anyone."
Positive,"very very late review, but after noticing I never left a review I feel the need toElden ring ""excluding pvp"" is a masterpieceThe combat is a much faster pace compared to older souls games and in my honest opinion is a whole lot more thought out. although doing these types of games enough should in fact equal that, sometimes they don't ""looking at you *insert regular AAA company*!!"" getting hit by an attack feels much more fair as timing and memorisation is key, the fairness lies in the jumps. adding jumps to the soulslike industry in my opinion was a blessing in disguise and brought WAY more openings to dodge earth shattering attacks ""literally"" from bosses later in the game.The story as almost all fromsoft games stories are, is amazing. I know it's an odd grab from the pot of characters but Hewg pulled at my heartstrings more than any other. I won't go into detail but anyone who has had a suffering grandparent will understand when they play. all in all, I 100% this game, achievements and all. I wouldn't ever wish to take the time I spent back!also FUCK YOU GIDEON"
Positive,"17 hours in i finally managed to kill the first enemy i have met, who was a big ass knight, in my underpants with a club. i feel like god 12/10 gameEDIT: 340 hours in, i can safely say this is the best modern video game title I have ever touched, easily becoming my favorite game ever. I am only upset I didn't discover fromsoft games earlier so I can play the DS series in their prime.PROS: This game is an unwritten book that you need to discover and find a way to fit in yourself, giving the player a sense of exploration unpresedented in other titles.Graphics and animations are top of the line.This is not just a story, its an epic comparable to the Iliads.I have never seen a game so mechanically logical than this one. In the world of Elden Ring everyting makes sense.Cons: MALENIA IS THE BLADE OF MIQUELLA"
Positive,"With the seamless coop mod this game is awesome, without it i would rather get ran over by a 18 wheeler full of diarrhea that isnt properly secured and spills all over my soon to be corpse while i struggle to not die in vain."
Positive,I can't believe how much work went into this. Look at the god damn art in this! LOOK AT IT!
Positive,I refunded it when I was high and instantly regretted it.
Positive,I have a thing for demigods
Positive,i love elden ring you can run whatever the hell you want and it'll work
Positive,best game i ever could play in my life   thank you FromSoftware
Positive,I'm not someone that seeks out hard games. I got this as a challenge from my friends. I love every minute. If you like open world adventure you will love Elden Ring. Play however you want and just have fun.
Positive,it was fun while it lasted and it lasted quite long
Positive,Fought a crab then had goku sex
Positive,its an absolutely amazing game but if you do not have a controller i would not recommend you buy this
Positive,"Before I played this, I had a small penis, no girlfriend and no will to live. None of these things have changed, but the game is pretty good."
Positive,best game of the deserved no doubt
Positive,"Sex in game form, only for chads, pussy Elden Ring haters seething 10/10 would literally get sunflowered to play this game all day"
Positive,you die a lot... i almost put mine foolish ambitions to rest.... great game !!!
Positive,"GOTY for a reason. New game plus offers chances to explore places you definitely missed, even if you're an obsessive secret-finder like me!"
Positive,"i summoned a man named chaos lord jesus and we beat the hell out of an endgame boss together. incredble.wherever you are chaos lord jesus, thank you."
Positive,"Elden Ring is so fuckin’ amazing!Hidetaka Miyazaki, From Software & George R.R. Martin really out did themselves!If you liked Demon's Souls or Bloodborne, you'll love Elden Ring!I was amongst the 1st people to platinum Demon's Souls on PS3 when it originally released and before it got popular, I utterly LOVE Elden Ring!It runs silk & butter smooth with highest settings on my Steam Deck 512 too!Do It!Don’t be scared!"
Positive,"Eu sou um pai de 45 anos, provavelmente uma das pessoas mais velhas a jogar este jogo. Sou pai solteiro criando meu filho, que agora tem 14 anos. Meu filho ganhou este jogo no Natal de 2023 de seu tio, então o instalamos em seu computador e ele começou a jogar. Até o final da semana ele tinha 24 horas neste jogo. Isso foi horrível para mim, pois já era difícil encontrar maneiras de passar o tempo com meu filho, pois ele está sempre com os amigos ou apenas assistindo ao YouTube. Então eu decidi fazer uma conta no Steam e pegar esse jogo para ver se eu poderia jogar ao lado dele. Eu comprei o jogo, criei meu caçador e comecei a jogar, mas eu estava preso no que você deveria fazer. Pedi ajuda ao meu filho e ele organizou um jogo para eu participar. Adorei, pois foi o melhor momento que passei com meu filho desde que minha esposa morreu. Desde então, esse jogo aproximou eu e meu filho novamente e agora passamos um tempo juntos fora de casa também. Este jogo me lembrou que há diversão em tudo, e trouxe muitas lembranças felizes para mim e meu filho."
Positive,"This game is like sticking your head into a cement wall as it is setting and hoping you can get unstuck. This game drained me of my sanity for 366 hours of my life, would recommend again 10/10"
Positive,I beat the game with Keyboard and Mouse
Positive,Pain in the ass but very fun
Positive,"You do not have to git gud.Elden Ring has no difficulty slider, it does however let you play as easy or difficult as you would like.  The true nature of the game is uncovering the lands between.  Virtually everywhere you go, there is a surprise for you, sometimes it is gear, loot, or lore.  You will feel like you have uncovered everything, and you will then find a massive undiscovered area of the game to play.  Whether you like to explore, collect, or fight, this has something for you.  Minor Criticisms: The game is designed to have a nonlinear progression through the lands between, this means your own exploration can wildy differ from someone else.  But it also means you can miss quest lines.  It is ultimately a trade off, I am not sure id ask them to make things more linear, but be aware that you will miss out events potentially.  Life happens, sometimes you do not have time to play through all at once.  There is no log book in the game to remind you who someone is, or what they asked of you. I respect that there is no clear map markers, but a book that simply jots down conversations would be extremely helpful.Many of the bosses are reskins.  You could play through the game and only allow yourself to fight a single boss type once and it would still be a pretty good game, but it would be nice to have had more variety and creativity when fighting some of these."
Positive,Ranni's feet is what I fought Radahn for
Positive,Epic journey. Highly recommended

Positive,Got sent death threats for killing an invader Love this game
Positive,"played it for a bit, told my friend i would quit after beating margit cos I didn't like to rage... I now have all the Achievements in the game"
Positive,"One of the best games I have ever played, copius amounts of replayability, great visuals and incredible music, I could not suggest it more"
Positive,"Probably one of the best games I've ever played, 75 hours in and I'm still finding new bosses, legendary items and enemies that kick my ass. Even once you've hit end game and dealing 1,000 damage per hit, starter zone enemies keep you on your toes because you can get stun locked and killed if you're too cocky."
Positive,"The reason I buy this game is because I had heard lots of recommendation of this game before this game launched. As a player that plays soul series games for the first time, in the beginning of early game was very hard to me, the Grafted Scion is so strong to me, and I faced my destined death(unescapable, as everyone will face in real life).And the first NPC-Melina, guides us all the way to the Forge of the Giants, after defeating Fire Giant, Tarnished(maidenless player like me) that doesn’t do much research while playing does not know that she had to sacrifice herself to set the erdtree on fire, in order to let us to become the Elden Lord. (Just like someone that burns themselves to light others in life)I spend about 1 hour to kill Margit, the Fell Omen, and my friend is scolding(encouraging)me, shouting at me, tell me to learn to dodge when the enemy attacks. I was newbie and also noob, he see me suffered and helped me on Godrick, the Grafted, which is the only boss he helped me in the whole game. This game has given me a new experience of open map game, unlike other open map games, this game has no guides to guide you whether should you go and what you should do atm. No guideline/ questline progress is provided, you must find informations from Internet(Fextralife,Fandom),note down the questline and the progress of the questline to complete the questline successfully. And all the npc’s life is in your hands, their dead or alive is according to your decision, but some of the npc’s are linked together in some questline, which means that killing them will ends some of the questline. If you kill them, you can receive their items, but cannot continue the questline as well unless you go for another journey(journey 2/journey 3). [We are facing many multiple choices in game, just like our daily life.] I nagged to my friend that running around to buy items from the merchants that are scattered all around the map is very tiring, and he told me that I can kill them if I want, so I did it(Yea, I’m selfish, doing this for my own personal benefits). After I told him and he was shocked for what I did, I said that he says I can do like this but he reclaims that he was talking a joke(Heheheh).Malenia, the strongest boss in the game, has make many players suffered(including me), keep dying and dying, learning from every attack she does, at the end, we will win and victory belongs to us. (So, when facing difficulties in real life, pls don’t give up, just like the attitude we have in game, we will win in the end unless we choose to escape/hide from difficulties like an ostrich.) After defeating Radagon and the Elden Beast, it is the end of this magnificent story and it’s time to choose the ending of this chaos world, and I choose the ending that I think is the best, and also the one I like among all of the endings, “Age of The Stars”. To me this game is just like a mirror, that reflects most of the things we face in real life, in game, we have unlimited life, so we are not afraid of dying, so we try until we success/achieve victory. But we only live once, do whatever you want, we’re born free, difficulties are challenges that makes us stronger, (touchwood) if failed at the end, at least we had tried our best before. Life is not 100% successful, we gain something and loss something at the same time, Life with 100% successful is God/creative mode, that’s not human life. Our life is full of joys and sorrows, it’s your own choice to be good or evil, but my friend told me to be optimistic and focus on good things in our life but not bad things as bad thing ruins our feeling and mood.😊I’m glad that you had read through here, pls forgive me for any grammar mistake/ don’t scold me if I have different game understanding with you(everyone has different game understanding when playing)."

Positive,"The best review i can give for this game is that no matter the reason you are interested in buying ""Elden Ring"" it doesnt matter, because there is so much to this game to love... you just wont be able to play it and not fall in love with it for one reason or another.The attention to detail and the love put into this game shines through every fiber of this game and you would be foolish to pass it up."
Positive,"I genuinely hated Bloodborne, Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 2, and Dark Souls 3. I did. I wanted to hate Elden Ring, refund it, and never think about it again. Then I played it. The game's ambience is still DISTINCTLY Dark Souls, but I don't feel that overwhelming Doom and Gloom, but rather ""a world in trouble"". It invites you in without setting you up as a hero from the start, especially when you meet the first boss, almost immediately after the tutorial area. No coddling, no funny business, just brutal bossing, especially for a non-veteran player like myself. But what sets Elden Ring apart from other titles? You can jump almost straight back in. You can keep running your face into the boss with little downtime, ramming into a brick wall, chipping away at it with your meagre skills, until it drops dead. THAT feeling, is the same in Elden Ring as it is in every other Souls game. I would say absolutely is this game more forgiving than some other FromSoft games, but more than anything, the game puts few barriers in your way to do whatever it is you want to do. Want to farm? There's several spots where you can easily power up close to Sites of Grace. Want to keep practicing a boss? You can keep respawning with often minimal downtime to get back to the boss. You want to explore? Walk around! The game even ""gives you the opportunity"" to explore zones you are not yet supposed to be in with your power level. Want to know the story of Elden Ring? Play the game, read the descriptions of items and form your own theories! The world of Elden Ring is your oyster. For what it costs, it's a damn bargain."
Positive,"Pros: Feels exactly like DS3 in a good way. The game is enormous, looks great, and has some really unique boss fights. The different builds are really fun and crazy, for as long as you willfully avoid the meta. The sheer number of spells, incantations and weapons can allow any character to do anything. Cons: Like most souls games at release, PVP is unbalanced. Late game balancing as a whole is very lackluster, even with over 60% resistance to Fight the elden beast isnt enough to prevent being 2-shot. (with 55 Vigor)Armors look badass but have very little effect, given the ineffectiveness of resistances late-gameLastly, the game is 70% complete. The last 1/3 seems to really fall off, as enemies/bosses are often seen multiple times. The later-game locations and dungeons are smaller and scattered than earlier locations. Too many bosses, and some common enemies, simply do not stop attacking. Mostly isn't an issue, as patience is rewarded and aggro is easy to direct. But some AOE bosses I'm loking at you, Mohg and Ragadan can hit you during a roll. Verdict/TLDR: 3.5/5, the honeymoon phase is over. Great game from beginning to middle, but late game becomes a chore, with bosses that are non-stop aggressive and are a little RNG."
Positive,"Best game I have played in awhile. Not a newcomer to souls-like games but wouldn't consider myself a veteran either. This game is expansive, you WILL NOT complete everything in this game in your first run, but that is the joy in this game. The decisions you make in the game will decide the fate of NPC's as you progress. The story is hidden behind some deep lore within weapon and item descriptions, as well as interactions with NPC's throughout their respective side quests. This is a game that you get what you put into it, so don't expect to understand everything that is going on if all you do is fight the main couple of bosses. All in all, this is a 10/10 masterpiece in my honest opinion. Just realize that this game is not for the weak, so expect to die ALOT in this game, but as you get stronger and understand the mechanics of the game you will get better."
Positive,"It doesn't have the right, O it doesn't have the right, therefore it doesn't have the right, O it doesn't have the right to be this good."
Positive,"Now that I have finished the game 3 times and gotten every ending I can finally review. It's good like really awesome. This is the first time I finished a souls game, I played a little bit of Dark Souls Remastered and maybe got halfway through. For me Elden Ring fixed everything I hated about Dark Souls, the taking 5 minutes to run back to a boss after every fail was awful. As well as being hard stuck on a part of the game where you can not do anything else until you kill that boss really sucked. Elden Rings open worldness was amazing and a breath of fresh air. It wasn't an open world just to be an open world. It filled every nook and cranny with something amazing. If you're constantly complaining that there are no good games because every single one feels like a copy paste and or is just ""go to this waypoint and spam M1 until you win"" then this will feel like a great change of pace. It's hard enough that most will feel challenged but easy enough that anyone could do it if they work for it. Some of the quests I feel are a bit obscure and were very hard to figure out and I ended up looking up walk throughs on some things when I got stuck but I would rather have that then quests that are ""go collect 10 berries"" or ""go kill 25 wolves"" it builds community and conversations. same goes for the difficulty of the game, it feel like the whole community is all in it together. This is one of my favorite games of all time now and I didn't even think I would buy it when it came out. Give it a try. (also performance on PC can suck at times please fix this, changing some settings helps a lot and I barely noticed but it's still an issue)"

Positive,"It's a refreshing fresh air among the plethora of open world games. The world building is exquisite. There's a ton to explore and you don't get bored of exploring cause in every corner you know there will be an interesting find. I don't remember enjoying an open world game this much since BOTW, from which the producers clearly got their inspiration. The story and lore is good as always and I felt like it's more detailed and extended compared to other FromSoft games. Side characters and stories are also outstanding. They really add to the lore and story. Plus some of the side quest give very good gear. Gameplay is the best among Soulsborne games in my opinion. You have more flexibility in your fighting style, interesting and useful skills and the ability to fight with your mount is a good addition. Spirit summons in boss fights made them more manageable and fun. I think it's significantly easier compared to other Soulsborne games. While the side quests are good, I think they should contain more directions. Some of the side quests span almost all of the game and there are next to no directions about where to go next so you end up looking up guides to understand what to do.  Maybe if they add a journal section containing the dialogs and directions about side quests it would be more manageable. And adding some quality of life things like pause menu would be good too. The game itself is great but they could've done a better job on the pc port. Performance issues, no ultrawide support, capping the fps at 60 and controller issues at release were unpleasant but they fixed some of them with patches. They're also continually fixing unbalanced game mechanics and annoying exploits so I'm sure the game will improve and be even better with time. You should definitely play it even if you didn't like previous FromSoft games."
Positive,I LOVE THIS GAME AND I LOVE BLADEE!!!!
Positive,quite fun if you like scraping your fingernails into your skull
Positive,"addictive and fun , loving it"
Positive,"Really good. My first Souls/Souls-like game and it left a huge imprint on me. I look forward to playing all the other souls game, and hopefully getting really good at this one."
Positive,0 micro transactions
Positive,"First impression blew me away but with time, the wow factor has faded. Definitely recommend cause its still fantastic but the balance of later bosses was too much for my liking. Second half felt like a slog to complete compared to the first half."
Positive,"Elden Ring is one of the best games I've ever played. It isn't perfect but considering its size and scope, it gets really damn close. Starting with the pros; The open world is both massive and full of things to discover. Many recent games have an open world just for the sake of it and don't do anything interesting with it, but Elden Ring's world is both fun to explore, and massive. The combat is incredibly satisfying, with a huge variety of weapons and playstyles. The animations have weight behind them and there are so many weapons to find that stop the combat from ever feeling repetitive. The enemy design is fantastic and there are heaps of boss encounters to find. The difficulty is balanced most of the time, with almost every encounter being completely doable with enough dedication. The game flows between beating your ass with challenging fights and feeling like a badass against lower level enemies really well. One of Elden Rings biggest flaws is the last third of the game. While it is by no means bad, it doesn't quite live up to the standards set by the rest of the game. Another thing is that the side quests are too obtuse, and most of them aren't really doable without a walkthrough to help you. Finally there are a couple of boss fights which I felt were far too difficult, namely the final boss and Melenia, which both felt unbalanced and frustrating. Luckily the worst fight (Melenia) is optional and pretty out of the way. Overall, Elden Ring is one of the most well crafted games ever made, the gameplay is fantastic, the world is amazing and it is very replayable. Despite its few flaws, it is a game that everyone should try and is absolutely worth sticking with until the end."
Positive,"Brabissimo, so compra e seja feliz.O pessoal sempre vai chorar e achar defeito(a repete alguns boss), querendo botar defeito no jogo que é incrivel por si so. Todo jogo tem defeitos, esse nao é diferente, depois do lançamento tinha muitos bugs de performace que foram melhorando conforme o tempo, sendo constantemente atualizado. :)"
Positive,I hugged a woman for the first time because of this game 10/10.
Positive,"One of the Best Games Ever Made!!Definitely Worth 100%ing this one.Awesome Story, Art-style/visuals, Gameplay and World."
Positive,"My favorite part was when Malekith looked at the player and said ""Its Rune of Deathing time"" and he Rune of Death'd all over, coolest shit I've ever seen."
Positive,time for gesturing
Positive,"It's Elden Ring ...From the Devs of the Dark Souls series and Sekiro.Maybe you heard about that, like, entire genre, called Souls-like. They made the OG of that. Go play it.Yes, you can criticise niche things on a high level, but overall, it outshines 99% of the games out there."
Positive,"While there are certainly some minor issues with the game, it is single-handedly one the best games of all time. It is easily worth the 60$. If you have any love for the RPG genre then this is a must-buy even if you feel you are not 'good' at Dark Souls-like games.Only thing I would add is to not look at any guides as it will help your experience tremendously. Exploring and figuring out stuff yourself is what makes this game amazing."
Positive,"Try rolling, and then, try fingers but hole"
Positive,Got to Malenia in about 70 hours and have been fighting her since
Positive,"NOW I FIGHT AS HOARAH JEW, RABBI!!!"
Positive,My wishes have been granted. I always wanted to see Dark Souls in the big open world. Great Game. Thanks FromSoftware
Positive,"never been a big fan of souls like game, but this one is pretty good"
Positive,"One of the best games in recent history. I've never played DS games before. Loved this one! 9.5/10PS Don't let anyone tell you these games make you sick due to their difficulty level. They're beatable and far from the most difficult games out there In case of Elden Ring, the open world exploration allows you to get a level that makes some bosses feel like a joke. If it's still a lil bit challenging for you, get someone for a co-op. The community is super helpful.PS 2 Now a GOTY winner. Congrats and well deserved!"
Positive,This might be one of the best games I've ever played.Huge world with so much beautiful things to discover.The build variety is insane.Only negative aspects I have are a few frame drops and maybe a bit much reused bosses.Still an easy 9/10. Hyped for the DLCs already
Positive,"The perfect first game for players new to Souls-like games, but as a returning Souls player, I have mixed feelings. In many ways better than its predecessors, but it falls short in a significant way.The best part about Elden Ring is it's open world exploration. Even though open world games in general have gotten really stale, Elden Ring avoids this staleness by keeping exploration intensly fun and rewarding. Bosses and secrets are crammed in every part of this game. If you like cryptic and secret, this game has it. Secret areas everywhere. With this game's map, what you see IS NOT what you get. It's bigger than it looks. But in terms of bosses, this game is one giant mixed bag. New players won't notice this as easily but I believe this game's bosses to be some of the worst Fromsoft have made. Elden Ring suffers from its own ambition. The bosses are flashy and pretty but some are not very fun to fight. The game feels like it was balanced for new players using summons and coop.  This game's optional superboss, Malenia, is one of the worst fights I've ever had to endure. Alot of bosses are reused. Alot of bosses are boring.If you're a new player, it's worth a buy. Don't be afraid of it, there's tons of help for new players. But if you're an old player, you might be disappointed by the bosses, the core of the experience. I know I'm not the only one."
Positive,"tl;dr: Try fingers, but hole.The story and side quests====================The story is deep and simply amazing. Without giving too much spoilers, I am looking forward which ending the devs consider cannon and will bring us Elden Ring 2 or even DLC which continues the story. The side quests, much like Dark Souls, are unclear in terms of what your ""current objective"" is, so do take out a notepad and take notes of your progression. I feel an objective log could aid in this, then again ... This is a Souls game.Gameplay=========The combat is very much like Dark Souls 3's, additions like jumping (made more easier), crouching, a mount and what have you, have simplified the flow of combat. You're practically independent from visiting a hub to either level or upgrade weapons, you still require to visit it for certain other things like upgrading your summons, getting some incantations, getting some sorceries, fetching quests and what have you.At times, jumping off certain heights with the mount is hit or miss, while it may seem totally possible to jump down and avoid certain damage. You either get one shot, suffer very little damage or not damaged at all. At first I thought I was just mistiming it, but it seems the fall damage * height is just inconsistent.The difficulty of the game, as stated by devs, is easier compared to Dark souls'. Not only is it very easy to farm runes to level quickly but the AI is noticeably more predictable by comparison.  The AI being more predictable is compensated by high damage, while this will surely keep you on your toes, it also becomes boring for those who already had a taste of the Souls series prior to Elden Ring. This becomes more obvious once you climb several more journeys (NG+) upwards and the scaling just does not feel challenging at all. Instead it becomes more of an annoyance and just makes high poise + damage negating builds pointless.I feel coop could've been expanded upon. We should be able to run the whole open world and the story with 2 or more friends. This is kinda a missed opportunity and should be looked into. I realize ER is an entry towards the Dark Souls franchise but still ...It's one of those ""nice to have"" things.Graphics=======The game looks beautiful and the open world displayed here shows Fromsoftware has taken it to the next level. While beautiful, it does come with its flaws. Capping the game to 60fps is yesterdays news and lack of widescreen support out of the box is questionable.PvP===I enjoy PvP, not only in Souls games, to me the PvP in this game is not what I expected it to be. I had set my expectations a tad to high and I was left disappointed. The current state of PvP has actually pushed me back to Dark Souls 3 PvP (which you can still do using a tool) and it has provided more fun than Elden Rings' PvP has. Not saying it won't be better down the line, but PvP needs incentives beyond what you get from it and an obvious balance pass.The verdict=========A solid 9/10, great game, surely recommended it to friends and I am looking forward to the DLC (if any)."
Positive,"Good souls gameplay, accessible story, beautiful visuals. Game of the year."

Positive,I died from fall damage 5 times in a row
Positive,Maybe if you got rid of that old yee-yee ass armament you got you'd get some maidens on your grace.Taaarniiished...
Positive,Turns out the
Positive,"I normally dislike open world games, but this game slaps hard."
Positive,"A perfect game.  200+ hours in and still finding new content.  The difficulty is high but it makes it so much more satisfying when you overcome the challenges the game throws at you.  I'm going to say this early on so you don't miss it... but be prepared to die... A LOT.  It's totally normal so don't let it get you down.  I have no earthly idea how many times I've died and I've beaten every boss in the game and again in 5 additional New Game Plus runs plus again completely solo with a brand new character.The invasion system is great.  If you are playing solo then you've got nothing to worry about but if you request help from another player, you run the VERY HIGH chance of yet another player invading your world with the objective of stopping you from completing your objective.  I love this since it drives you towards beating the game yourself and only requesting help for a small number of difficult objectives.There are plenty of helpful guides out there to help you out when you get lost or stuck but I highly recommend giving it a shot without using those resources first.  Pay close attention to the dialog your first time through.  The game doesn't provide a ""quest log"" to help keep track and most of the time won't even tell you where you need to go.  If you are a completionist then the Wiki is for you.  I highly doubt anyone will find all of the content in a single play-through without help.The game is a bit more popular than the devs anticipated so the server can get a bit slow during peak times so the coop system is a little hit or miss but it works fine for me the vast majority of the time.  Be careful if you judge this game based on the negative comments but it is true... if you don't have good reflexes, this game is going to eat you alive.Hurry up, buy the game, die a lot, and get good scrub."
Positive,Oh my....this game is good.
Positive,I pooped myself playing this game. Surely that is worth something.
Positive,I am the Elden Lord and I still play the game afterwards. Masterpiece of a game 10/10
Positive,"First ever souls game. Simply put, Amazing!"
Positive,100% hehe hoo hoo haa haa
Positive,Played this game blind for 115 hours now and im not even through it ýet and i enjoy every single moment of it
Positive,I am already waiting for DLC to drop.
Positive,"The most beautiful and well done open world game I've played. Sure, in regards to life places like the Witcher 3 it doesn't compare, but Elden Ring doesn't have menu clutter,the npc's call you out on being maidenless, you get fucked over by bosses in the open field and occasionally, a lobster will snipe you.But torrent is there, so my suffering isn't completely in solitude.Honestly though, the atmosphere as well as gameplay are very fun and I can only recommend it! It's been a while since I genuinely enjoyed a game this much. Going back to previous souls games will be difficult now."
Positive,"After beating the game yesterday, I decided to let myself digest my experience before posting a review.Elden ring is without a doubt one of the greatest games I've ever played, and has set the bar for every future From Software title.Elden ring isn't 'perfect'. But it is, perfect.The entire game is oozing with lore and story, without it being 'force fed' to you. The fights are challenging but not unbeatable, and you can choose to come back to them after levelling up some more for an easier fight. The combat in the game is incredible, and while it does have balancing issues the overall feel is smooth, responsive, and precise. Buy the game. It's worth every single cent."
Positive,"Too big to its own detriment. Rehashes bosses crazier than any Souls game before it and you will definitely the turn to hate the reused bosses by the end of it. Also heavily affected by the ''Boss but now it's two of them'' syndrome.Builds can get very specific so exploring and finding dungeons doesn't feel rewarding because the rewards usually end up something that you literally cannot use. Endgame areas end up being huge with a fraction of the density of early game areas, so you're stuck riding your horse more than you do actually playing. FromSoft hasn't taken a lot of cues from Sekiro in terms of boss design which is why this games boss roster (aside from the copypaste) ends up feeling weak because only a tiny part of them is actually engaging. interesting NPCs but awful quest progression. This game is also a DEX-weeb's wet dream. This game could have cut like 1/4th or so of its size down and paced itself better than it would have been a great game. But as it is now it's just okay, certainly not the masterpiece that everyone pretends it is. But if you like Soulsgames, it's a Soulsgame alright, complete with all the strengths and shortcomings of the genre in a much bigger setting.Still would have preferred Sekiro 2 over this.Maybe some Tenchu as well."
Positive,"One play through of the story, while exploring most of the world has taken me 93 hours. I went for a double colossal sword build, and was able (through a lot of dying and frustrating) to beat every boss in the game with that build.  At first I found the difficulty very frustrating, but as I played the game more and more, the better I got. And the feeling of finally downing a boss after playing the fight flawlessly the first time is just so rewarding. Elden Ring is probably one of the best games I've ever played. The world is utterly amazing, the range of builds is crazy and the story although not super in depth, is beautiful."
Positive,Big crab. ≧( ° ° )≦
Positive,Literally 10/10 on my second play through cant get enough
Positive,Its really really good.
Positive,"Ye dead who yet live, your grace long lost, follow the path to the Lands Between beyond the foggy sea to stand before the Elden Ring. And become the Elden Lord."
Positive,"Great game, just the pure magnitude of the massive map that you have to explore and have awkward encounters with deadly foes, this game is not just worth your penny, it's worth your time to get involved into.10/10."
Positive,L + ratio + you have no maidens + you're tarnished + touch grace
Positive,Has fromsoftware ever made a game that wasn't amazing?
Positive,"This is the result of a labor of love for games by From Software.Every little detail from the previous 'souls-likes' resulted in a decade of learning and evolving and this my friends, is the result of said evolution.Elden Ring is everything we hoped for and much MUCH more. Trust me when I say, even if PVP is not your thing, I put nearly 110 out of 120hrs in explorations and quests. Of course half of that was to kill Malenia and Radahn but that's beside the point.Listen when I tell you, this will be your best buy in 2022 and possibly in a couple of years ahead as well.Have fun, seize it and celebrate it while you can. Malenia is coming for you and if you made it this far, Congratulations, YOU DIED."
Positive,nothing makes me rage harder then this game but nothing makes me happier when im winning as well
Positive,"10/10 loads of fun, beautiful scenery and despite what people are saying the game has a difficulty slider; it's called your build."
Positive,Truly a worthy sequel to Dark Souls II
Positive,Could this be an Elden Ring?
Positive,Im bout to cummmmmmmmm
Positive,"Easy game, great for people just getting into gaming!"
Positive,5 runs in and im still finding new stuffgames real good
Positive,"Wanted to wait until I played at least 60 hours before I came here to leave my review, got sidetracked and played another 40 before I even realized how deep I got. I can say with certainty: this a good game.Do you remember when games used to be good? I member. Remember when the hype train DIDN’T ruin the expectations of trying out a new game for the first time? I member. Remember when games weren’t riddled with pay-to-win mechanics, broken matchmaking or just being dropped as a half-assed shell of what was promised in the trailer? I member. For the first time in what feels like years of watching titans fall and trend hopping onto new titles, Elden Ring has triumphantly restored my hope for future games and came out  swinging.  To clarify, I don’t consider myself a “Soulsbourne Gamer” or someone who traditionally enjoys getting my various body parts stomped into the dirt hundreds of times by bosses that don’t even fit on my computer screen. I’m the kind of player who checks all the corners, nooks & crannies for little secrets and collectibles. I enjoy getting lost in my own individual adventure and discovering parts of the game that many people would breeze right past. I feel rewarded for my discoveries and appreciate when a dev team puts that extra attention to detail with their subtle nods and easter eggs for their most curious and intrepid adventuring fans. This game delivers that experience on a silver platter and bestows a beautiful world for players like me to absolutely get lost in its splendor for over 100 hours. Elden Ring can be praised for a huge open world, countless replayability options, dozens of hidden pathways and dungeons or more weapons, armors and sorceries than one person will ever know what to do with. What is even more remarkable is the community that has already formed since launch. Just earlier today, I joined a fight club-style arena that was being broadcast live from YouTube. The host posted a simple rule set in the description of their stream, opened up their world for others to join and for several hours, we ran single elimination matches in an organized and respectful manner. I don’t know of many games that allow you to do that, but Elden Ring players have already come up with such wonderfully creative ideas just in the first month of being live. To the new players on the fence about trying this game: Please do. It was worth the investment for a game I see myself easily putting in another 100 hours into. Dirt smashing and all. I keep coming back with new ideas for characters, moments of genuine awe and a long lost sense of achievement that I feel games have been lacking in the modern age. It has a little something for everyone, the bloodthirsty hardcore purists, the slow paced explorers (like me), the min-maxers for broken combos and everywhere in between.And to the haters who would tell you otherwise, I say this:  …still no maidens? Try fingers, but hole. Godspeed, ye brave Tarnished. Seek the Elden Ring and call upon me should you need aid."
Positive,100 % the game. This game sucks.
Positive,There is a reason everyone is playing this - because it's VERY GOOD and VERY ADDICTING
Positive,"Besides the sudden invasions from dex or mage meta builds (unless not online) the main storyline and the rest of it is great. playing alone would be a huge challenge but still fun and playing with a friend or 2 can make it more or less difficult, but in my opinion better. If you want to you can tell me about your experience, or just agree or disagree. :)"
Positive,"First AAA game I've played in quite a long time that has no issues, no crappy extra launcher, no in-game store for microtransactions, and is fun and interesting for the sake of being a good game. First game in years where I  can say it is worth $60."
Positive,Never in my life have i ever spent 2 straight weeks doing nothing but play a game. This is not true for Elden Ring.
Positive,tfw no timesaver packs to buy with Erdbuckshow will I ever enjoy myself
Positive,this game just amazing there is losses frames and crashes but the experience is amazing world is beautifull too look and always amazing explore. weapons and combat is so amazing you can play this game a lot with different bulids and combat is really deep and lot of skills and magic and weapons are pretty fucking cool. and  story is amazing i have 192 hours in this game and beat it this give me  a fresh of a open world instead same thing a open world game have that is boring and doing boring quest for my opinion. this is really my favoritie game of all time and i always love software  games. but yeah v im gouing have second play through this game for me is my number one game of all time.
Positive,"Praise the Sun!  Elden Ring is From Software's best game.  Believe the hype; it really is a masterpiece.- Do you like Dark Souls 1, 2, 3 or Bloodborne?  If so, Elden Ring is a MUST buy.  It is From Software's magnum opus and an absolute triumph of modern creativity and game design.- Have you wanted to play a Souls game but felt put off by the difficulty?  Elden Ring is highly recommended; it is the most accessible game for newcomers to the Souls-likes genre because there are so many more ways to approach each challenge the game presents.  In earlier Souls games, some very difficult bosses would act as gatekeepers to progress through the game, forcing players to have to endure constant trial and error until they finally beat the boss.  However, in Elden Ring, these sorts of scenarios are much less common.  I mean, no one's stopping you from trying that boss for the 100th time yet again, but it's great fun trying new things out and it feels so satisfying when those trials succeed.  Also, if all else fails, you can spend hours exploring the massive open world to gain levels, obtain new weapons, spells, and battle tactics and then come back to absolutely smash that troublesome boss that was doing your head in.  I find myself doing this anyway because exploring the world is an absolute joy.- Do you like challenging adventure games?  Elden Ring is absolutely recommended.  It scratches the itch in ways you never thought possible.- Do you just want to switch off and takes things easy after a long day?  Maybe give this game a miss; this game needs your attention, effort, creativity and resolve.  You need to be able to take that 20th ""You Died"" screen on the chin.I could write an essay gushing about every aspect of the game and why each one is so special that it makes me fall in love with video games all over again, but I honestly don't want to spoil anything for anyone reading this.  Sometimes it's best to just absorb the experience, and, oh, what an experience it is!The only issue I've had with the game is stuttering and frame drops, which can get rather annoying and frustrating.  Thankfully this doesn't happen too often.  Please double check machine specs before purchase.I would also recommend playing this game with a controller; mouse and keyboard support is available and it's much better than previous Souls games, but imho Elden Ring, like all Souls games, is best played on a controller."
Positive,Best Soulslike you will play till date.
Positive,This reminded me that I actually love video games
Positive,There's a reason there are so many larval tears. And there's a reason someone online said that vitality is the best ROI on stats. Know these and you're golden.

Positive,are you a gamerif you arethen elden ring is for youbecause it is a video gamein factit is definitely one of the games ever made
Positive,Best Dark Souls like game I have played.
Positive,"This game is soo fun. I would like to talk to more people because I dont have friends and the first person I talked to said that i got no maidens. Oh I cant stop playing it because i spent money on it. Soo if I stop playing it, would be bad for my wallet because now I dont have money for food. I have a crush on character that is a doll, but I still would like to sleep with her. I also like the woman that hugs me, despite the fact that no one hugs me irl. I think I need to touch some grass, and find some friends. But I had a lot of fun while I was playing it."
Positive,Souls are on me mum and they gave me popcorn with razor blades soaked in the blood of my golfing buddy
Positive,This game is incredible and painful at the same time. perfect 5/7.
Positive,The problem with this game is I don't think I'll ever play a game like it ever again.
Positive,Amazing game. Takes a little bit like all souls like games but it was so enjoyable to play and experience the landscape that had been crafted. Traveling through the world i was stuck smiling and to see the sheer amount of content that felt endless allowed for this game to seem almost perfect. If you have 60 dollars and are willing to take the time to play the game I will HIGHLY recommend picking it up its so worth :)
Positive,"Probably the best game released in a long time for my part. Really like the open world concept in a game like this. Everyone has the same starting place but the routes to progress are... Perhaps not endless but there are many. With many routes to take comes more enjoyable playthroughs. Some questlines and tasks are harder to understand but that's not new for a Fromsoftware game. There are quite a few exploits of bugs, altough some have already been removed. In a game like this, bugging the game intentionally to your own advantage has very little meaning to me. Let the speedrunners do their thing. As long as there are few bugs that will get me killed unintentionally."
Positive,"It's really hard to review this game because it is Game of the Year 2022 from the looks of things and the game is simply amazing and fun, you'd lose yourself for hours in this world. The world itself is amazing, it's by far where I had the most fun riding around on Torrent, exploring and finding secrets. FromSoftware really took everything they've learned since Demon's Souls to Sekiro and put it in this game from the vast selection of weapons and armor to refining spell casting and incantations. The game is simply amazing and very fun to play.Problem is the PC port is still littered with issues, I crashed multiple times and had huge frame rate drops which in a game that can have intense fast pace boss fights was frustrating. Plus there's always that open world jank that plague these type of games. It also sadly falls apart towards the end which is a shame, not to spoil too much but the bosses after ""Forge of the Giants"" just seem to have never ending attacks, too much HP, and just do too much damage and I was level 120 in endgame.Still a fun game, if you can get around the jank and frustrations and they actually patch this game and make it run better on PC."
Positive,"Nothing has caused me as much anger and frustration as this game has, I can finally FEEL something.You'll love it"
Positive,"This game hides rich and scalable cities deep within the world, knowing fully that many players won't be thorough enough to discover them. That's the type of game this is."
Positive,"overall not really a fan of the open world, prefered the intricate design off previous souls games as all the interesting content was more compacted. especially hunting down every copy paste catacomb with a slight variation. but at other times it truly is a wondrous sight to behold the vastness of everything, look somewhere and spend the next hour trying to get there (or falling to your death 10 times in a row).but the combat mechanics, interesting items, even if some are rehashed and the combination with the new makes a truly enjoyable experience. bosses aren't too crazy aside from a few but the lore behind them all makes it interesting. can't wait for the mods and maybe dlc to expand upon it even more."
Positive,"I never got into the Souls games due to the high difficulty. I think the farthest I've ever gotten was in Bloodborne and even that I stopped playing due to being stuck on Boss X. The big difference with Elden Ring is that this is OPEN WORLD. This means if I'm stuck on Boss X, I can go pretty much wherever I want and come back to it at another time once I've gotten stronger. I just mark my map and discover other stuff. I have over 100 hours and looks like I only uncovered half the world map. This is definitely an experience that you owe it to yourself to see if you appreciate games full of stuff to discover on your own. Highly recommended!"
Positive,launch elden ringfind popekill popegood ending achieved
Positive,"you don’t have the right, O you don’t have the right."
Positive,Really takes the best from the souls game and puts it in the biggest video game world I've ever explored. Fantastic Game.
Positive,"Elden Ring captivates players with a dense world full of beauty, mystery, and terror. The game feels incredibly accessible to newcomers of Soulsborne-style games while still providing series callbacks and the raw brutality that veteran players have come to expect and crave."
Positive,Best open world game iv'e played in a long time fromsoft have out done themselves with this one and i have high hopes for what the DLC will hold. once you have played this game playing any other open world game will not feel the same this game is a solid 20/10 the soundtrack and level design are top fucking tier
Positive,"lacking in the grace department, never really got into ""soul"" games, but this one......"
Positive,"Elden Ring will and definitely be GOTY for 2022 hands down, besides that, the game is a strong 8/10. CONS-The game does have a lot of problems, so many useless gank fights and bosses that are just a copy of one another and it's just made for padding. It's annoying and somewhat lazy but it is an open-world game to begin with so I can't really complain.-Performance issues, everyone has complained about this so no comment about that (running a RTX 2060) and I've noticed only GPUs with RTX are suffering from fps drops. It really took away from the experience, and I wished the game would've ran smoother at start.-Revenant and Valiant GargoylesPROS+Most of the bosses are f*cking amazing, period. (Especially Maliketh, Malenia, Loux, and Radagon) are top-notch bosses. +Faith is actually useful this time, thank you.+Music. (no need for explanation) +Exploration is so good in this game, got myself just wanting to look around the world. I'm pretty sure everyone can agree that the exploration in this game is the best part about it. +Locations and Graphics are gorgeous, (Raya Lucaria, Nokron, Farum Azula, Haligtree, Leyndell) there are so many places in this game that just look beautiful. +Progression is really nice, I never had moments where I was severely under leveled but that may be different for any first-time players. +Torrent.The game is nowhere near terrible, anyone who puts negative reviews for absolutely no reason have the worst opinion. The game is frustrating yes, but that's a FromSoftware trademark and I can fully understand why people are mad.In all honesty, the game is definitely worth full-price, and I'm so glad to have played it."

Positive,good game ;)
Positive,Cancer but in good kind.Recommended 10/10Definitely GOTY
Positive,"It's like a souls game except Fromsoft went above and beyond.  They somehow created an AR (Augmented Reality) game without me using ANY extra equipment!  I know, amazing right?  It's just so much harder now that my computer randomly freezes and resets every 10 to 30 minutes and I have to Actually reach down with my physical body and fix it!  Other developers need to take some notes. Get on their level or be left in the dust. I recommend this to all my friends, and my enemies."
Positive,"I love this game overall, but there are a couple of things that could be a lot better. First of all, quest details should be able to be seen somewhere, once you talk to an NPC and get a quest, you have no idea where to go or do because there isn't any markers or anything to guide you, and 2, the leveling system sucks! This being a difficult game to new players, having to kill mobs to get runes and to level up is a pain in the behind. Besides that, Elden Ring is an amazing game."
Positive,"I was hyped for Elden Ring like for two years and man FromSoftware delivered. The sheer vastness of the world they created ist mindbreaking, their very own spin on the Open-World-Mechanics work pretty well compared to Ubisoft-Style games and got me to explore every nook and cranny of the world on my first playtrough (like 100% around 110-115 hours).Sure, on very rare occasions there are some FPS stuttering issues, but that never really happened to me while in an important fight. Also - this might not be the most stunning game speaking technical graphics-level, but boy, the world and enemy design really outshines most other games.Gameplay-wise this is peak FromSoftware. For me personally there is no game out there that feels better to play, every aspect you may have loved in DS 1 to 3, Bloodborne or even Sekiro, it's there in the most polished state imaginable. They added some nice new features which on the one hand lets you add even more customization options or on the other hand makes it more approachable for beginners to the whole FS-verse. Like the ashes for summoning ghosts that can help you in certain fights, which I didn't really use, because I felt like it would trivialize the challenges for me, but I guess if you are in for a more relaxed ""story-driven"" playtrough - that's your easy mode for you (even without multiplayer), no need to implement a difficulty level. And don't get me wrong, especially some of the optional bosses (looking at you Malenia) are Isshin/Midir-level difficulty.I even think it is pretty okay that they reused many enemies for harder variants, 1v2 oder 1v3 boss encounters later on, because that's how you get a sense of advancement and get to reiterate on the movement-pattern learnings you got down earlier.To sum it up, best gameplay there is with a lot of customizable options, stunning design on world and enemies, neat soundtrack, huge world with a lot of explorability and unique loot, your usual FromSoftware mysterious story (including a lot of cryptic NPC-questlines). Probably my favorite game of all times right now, tied with Bloodborne."
Positive,"One of the best games I have played.Progress through a beautifully crafted world.The further you go the deeper the connections between places and NPCs get.The game is hard as you'd expect from a FromSoftware title. But as always it feels rewarding once you overcome your enemies by pure mastery of the game and the enemies moveset (and maybe some levels you got elsewhere).Despite what many people say, the game has an amazing story to offer.It's communicated to the player through the world design. The maps you progress through and the different kinds of enemies you find.Other than that there are some really deep NPC story lines that sometimes lead to new, optional areas with amazing designs and fantastic enemies.There are a lot of hidden locations, items and quests. The game does aid you to find some of them but also leaves you a lot of room to explore on your own. You may miss a ton on your first few playthroughs but whenever you find something hidden you feel like your exploration is rewarded.All in all I like the game.If you expected ""Open World Dark Souls"" then you will get almost exactly that in the best way imaginable."
Positive,Best game of the last 15 years. Easily.
Positive,"One of the best games I have ever played. Greatest of all Time. I honestly cant even say more, just get it."
Positive,"Has some technical issues, but hasn't been enough to really bother me since I played most of the older games with even worse framerates. Game is incredible, it's hard to pull myself away from it."
Positive,Couldn't stop playing
Positive,10/10 This game is invited to the ranch.
Positive,"Great game. Not hard if you have a brain. I usually don't level multiple characters (ALTS) in games, but I wanted to replay this as another class. Elder Scrolls level awesomeness."
Positive,"Best game I've played in 2022. Probably the only AAA game that feels like devs actually put effort into this year, so far."
Positive,I've never picked up a souls game. Great play through 10/10.
Positive,"One of the most well-crafted worlds in a game.  There are secrets and rewards everywhere.  Exploration is well-rewarded.  The game can be difficult at times, but you can always go somewhere else and come back to whatever was blocking you later.The game can take some time to learn.  Systems are not well explained, so a beginner's guide may help get you started.  It's well worth figuring it out."
Positive,I can't stop playing! What have you done!?
Positive,"I'm now failing basically every class and I dont eat or sleep much anymore but I unlocked a room with a weird severed hand and an old lady in it so worth it. fort, night."
Positive,"Seek Elden Ring, therefore don't give up, skeleton!"

Positive,IMO opinion best souls game!
Positive,Literally the perfect video game
Positive,Hit your head into a brick wall for multiple hours.
Positive,This is it boys
Positive,I was fighting a boss in the open when another boss joined in then i was invaded which didnt let me on my horse leading to my death. elden ring is amazing 10/10
Positive,"It's not easy, but it's very cool, still!"
Positive,Best game that I have ever played.
Positive,Ky$aa got no maidens
Positive,"Remember, no rushing."
Positive,"Lets start with a simple TL;DR: The game is great and is definetly worth the price.Elden Ring, is indeed the convergence of the experience fromsoft has had with the soulsborne games of the last decade. It has very few negatives, something which I'd personally attribute to the fact that it is a open world, like minor dungeons (not the legacy ones) having repetitive bosses, and the performance on pc.Regarding performance itself, however, its not as bad as people make it out to be, given that my PC was slightly below minimal requirements, and still, for the most part ran fine, even at high graphics. That said, it would be a lie for me to say that it does not suffer from stutterings and small freezes in certain parts and after a long day of playing. Much like the invisible horse and enemies bug that I have experiences, I believe those issues stem from loading, however I have no real knowledge on the subject, so take this with a huge grain of salt.On the positive side of things, The game has been about what I expected from the hype of the last few years. If one likes Dark Souls, one will most likely like Elden Ring. The world itself is huge, exploring can be rewarding, there is a good size of armaments, a decently sized ammount of armors and has quite the huge assortment of sorceries and incantations, all of these which I am sure I haven't acquired all of them yet. Npc questing is very much similiar to Souls games, which, I personally quite like, however the open world format of the game can lead to quests being far easier to miss, especially in a blind run.Lore is, in this strange way, somewhat more vague than Dark Souls was, but also more consistent, aswell as easier to learn from npcs.Honestly, I don't know what else to say, Elden Ring is great and even if you are not someone that played soulsborne games, I still highly recommend it, however if you do try it, don't expect being able to refund it, as 2 hours isn't nearly enough to experience this game in a satisfying way (for better or for worse)."
Positive,"This Game, is the culmination of 6 games. Demons, DS 1-3, Bloodborne, and Sekiro all together, come to this game. The Legendary 7th.If you took the time to sink hours into any one of these games, you can come into this one with almost the entire understanding of what you may need. Hit, Dodge, Block, Counter Attack, etc. After 500+ Hours spent in their universes, From never fails to make the same mechanics feel entirely fresh, iterating their simple-but-complex combat system to the peak that is this game.It's more flexible, with Ashes of War, Refinement Types, and Freedom of MovementIt's more accessible to newer players, with easier multiplayer, dueling and invasions being separate items, the AI Summoning System.The old mixed in with the new to create the perfect flask of Physic that is Elden Ring. It's stylish, it's fast, it looks gorgeous. Buy the Game."
Positive,"After 80 hours in I can say this is an amazing piece of a game, definitely worth trying out. Love the story, love the hidden stuff that surprised me couple of times and the mix between open world and classic dark souls location design"
Positive,Almost forgot what  a complete game on release felt like. One downside from PC is the frame stutter/Freeze every so often. Other than that I'm enjoying my latest addiction.
Positive,The perfect souls game w/ one or two shit bosses. Genuinely Beautiful.
Positive,Try Finger but Hole
Positive,Try Finger But Hole
Positive,The Magnum Opus of Souls games
Positive,"I have some time in the Dark Souls game, but this game just trumps them all IN MY OPINION.The only gripe I have are the minor PC issues and frame stuttering during boss battles and wide open areas, though Im sure a patch is on the way to resolve this issue.The world is beautiful and dark, the story is enticing and this is the most open Fromsoft has been with stories as well, the gameplay is addicting, this game is a definite 11/10 for me <3"
Positive,"I bought the game after seeing numerous 10/10 reviews and hearing how my friends want it. I've really hoped something has changed for me in FromSoft's souls-likes. It didn't work for me again. - The overall repetitiveness of the gameplay.- The absolute lack of narrative, story depth or plot whatsoever.. It just doesn't bring any empathy or engagement, doesn't get me invested into itself.- The UI. It's awful and again NOT adapted to PC. The tutorial popover doesn't work when you don't know the hotkey you should press on PC. - The UX, the game design, the rewards system. The barrels that can be broken but why.. there's never any loot there. The difficulty. I'm considering myself a hardcore-loving gamer, and honestly, this time it feels better.I did not trash it because of difficulty. The world is beautiful and big. It's drawn really good. But it's JUST big.Why? Who am I, why should I roam it? What's the mission? Who are my enemies? Why should I fight them? It's just.. nothing is told. The intro vid is not enough. It's way too similar to all other FS games.NOT saying the game is bad. It's just not for me.Anyways, if you're a souls-like fan it may work for you. But listen... If you've considered yourself NOT a souls-like games person at least ONCE.. just don't buy it. Nothing changed here."
Positive,"After getting all the achievements I can safely say, Yes you should play this game. It is the most accessible ""souls"" game that FromSoftware has put out with a lot of things to do, my first play-through was roughly 90 Hours of in game time just from the sheer amount of volume to explore, from Dungeons to Caves to just natural progression through the entirety of the map. The gameplay loop is solid and keeps you engaged, and it's still the basic souls gameplay from previous FromSoftware entries with a lot of depth added; the Spells and Arts of War are INSANE now and feel so good and are so much fun to use. This Game is more than likely GOTY easily and it's only March."
Positive,"I actually didn't like it at first... took a minute to get into it, and even still I get frustrated with the difficulty. But overcoming the challenges is satisfying, and the world is quite large and fun to explore."
Positive,Thank you Fromsoftware
Positive,"Game is absolutely phenomenal. Feels like a perfect blend between the Souls experience and the Skyrim experience. Pretty sure this is what addiction feels like. Edit: As with every Souls game, invaders are completely cancer no skill sweats that can't win if they aren't using a cheese."
Positive,"Game grew on me.   Can be frustrating at times def, but that's the type of game you bought.   But part of the reason for this is PC mouse keyboard controls could be vastly improved.   The movement sets are also too limited and the character often doesnt respond fast enough.  Hopefully they rectify this.  Def a gorgeous game graphics wise.  Audio is excellent.   WIsh the coop could be expanded for more than just small areas."
Positive,"There's still some issues with this game PC port wise. Connection issues is probably the most apparent. When playing with friends, I kept finding myself disconnecting from their world. Stutters happened here and there, but that was easy to ignore. However, despite all this, I'll still strongly recommend this game, as these are features that can be fixed in the future.This game is a very fleshed out, beautiful world that kept on giving. I found myself surprised that they put anything in areas I explored, expecting nothing, but exploration is often rewarded. Even after 100's of hours into the game, I still hear things from my friends that I had missed out on.A complaint I hear about, is that it's still a hard game, something not accessible to a casual player. I would argue that this is as easy as you want it to be. It's an open world game, and while there is a linear path you can take, you can explore places that reward your character with both experience points and items that can continue to help you with future fights, or fights that you may struggle with. And while there's a bit of a connection issue during the time I wrote this, I will say that if you want a true ""easy mode,"" summon players. They'll often carry you through it.This is a game for hardcore players and people that are interested in starting a ""souls-like"" game. It takes all aspects of the best things from past FROMSOFT games starting from Demon Souls. This is a game with 13 years of experience.If you're doubting yourself, then that's fine. Everyone doubts themselves when they first hit a boss and see only them knock off 5% of their health, while they swing at you and straight up take 90% of yours.This game isn't for everyone, I won't pretend that it's for the casual audience, or an audience that has very little time. It's not going to cater for everyone, that isn't what this game is. It's a game that will try to get a wider audience, and I will say it's successful when it comes to that, but it's not for everyone still at the end of the day.It's a wonderful game, with a lot of content. Play with friends, play by yourself, cheese fights, die to fights hundreds of times over. There is no wrong way to play this game. This is by far, my favorite game of all time as it sits.I can't wait for future DLC."
Positive,"If you liked Dark Souls it is just that, but better.If you didn't like Dark Souls...try it anyway; it is that good."
Positive,sick game boyzzz
Positive,"Honestly, just a fantastic game all around. Runs great on my old GTX 970 and it's an absolute blast to play."
Positive,plentiful amount of mommies
Positive,"Maidens, Elden Lords, Swords, Sorcery, weird goat horse... A gorse you might say. 10/10 would bah again."
Positive,"It's a masterpiece and the most beautiful yet horrifying game I've ever played. I mean what else needs to be said? It's in the very small pool of one of those games you have to play before you die. Games that make your heart skip a beat when you first see them. On par with Half-Life 2, The Last of Us, and Fallout: New Vegas."
Positive,"An absolute masterpiece. Runs a little rough at times, but I'm optimistic From Software is working on a patch."
Positive,Dragons keep instant killing me.Game of the Year.
Positive,Tried jumping... DiedTried hidden path... Died Tried secret item... DiedTried range battle... DiedTried finger but hole... Still died but found out things about myself worth exploring. 12/10
Positive,"As a fan of the series since DS1, this is probably my favorite entry. This game is challenging, fun, and you can tilt the camera up at basically any point in the open world and see the culmination of work from numerous fantastic artists. Not to mention it's absolutely massive. I don't think I could sing it's praises or recommend it enough."
Positive,"If you like souls like game then this is exactly what you've been looking for. In addition to the difficult and tight combat you have come to love, this game truly brings back you love for open world adventures. Fight you're greatest rival over and over until you finally conquer them, or just explore the vast beautiful world for hours on end. The choice is yours young tarnished."
Positive,"Honestly the best Souls game in the entire series and possibly my new favorite game of all time.It feels like everything FromSoft has made up to this point has been leading to this game. It's like a combination of Dark Souls and Breath of the Wild, except it exceeds both of them and becomes something greater than the sum of its parts. Yes, I've had some framerate issues. But they're honestly barely noticeable to me. Besides that, framerate issues can be patched, but what can't be patched is this game's absolutely breathtaking art design and fine-tuned combat system.I genuinely love every inch of this game, and cannot recommend it enough to anyone who's curious, whether you're a veteran of the Souls games or just getting into them."
Positive,video game good
Positive,Praise the jump!
Positive,10/10 would recommend.
Positive,"I found a Greathelm... therefore, DEUS VULT"
Positive,"You don't have the right, o' you don't have the right to dislike it"
Positive,still running around the first area 60+ hours in. this rocks. i love it. i will not be touching grass irl
Positive,My frustration at this game has obliterated the relationships I have with friends and family.
Positive,"You DiedAlright, after 60+ hours I feel I can give a pretty solid review of the game.Having played previous FromSoftware games I knew what to expect going in. It plays much as I would expect it to, boss fights can range from straight cheese to a real nightmare. Some have forced me to summon a friend to help resolve because I was either ill equipped or its a poor match for my class type (Pure Samurai)While classes are really only your preset at the start of the game, it does help to know what you want to play ahead of time. Try out a few starts until you find what you like. Personally, I get great satisfaction when I slice someones face off in true Samurai fashion. It does irk me a bit that I am still using my starter equipment. (Yes the Uchigatana is that good) Just like previous FS games, some of the encounters are a bit uh excessive? Looking at you Gargoyle fucks. Ultimately, all the fights have a viable strategy as long as you are properly leveled and willing to take your licks. Overall I've been having a wonderful experience with the game. While it does frustrate me to no end on some occasions, thats to be expected. I'd like to see a bit of balancing for some of the play styles. Magic is currently extremely OP when compared to melee combat. That being said, you can still smoke people as a swordsman, its just that much more challenging because some magic attacks will delete you instantly. TLDR: Git Gud, RIP to all the NPCs I accidentally murdered while questing.EDIT 2: Now that I am within an inch of beating the game, I realize that I am a terrible person and I've killed every character I ever cared about. 10/10 would have horrifying revelations of evil again."
Positive,Phenomenal. A actual completed game.With a soul.This is it. This is the peak of gaming.
Positive,you can become the maiden 10/10
Positive,"Rise up, ye tarnished!"
Positive,OOOOH ELDEN RING
Positive,"Amazing, simply fantastic. The immersion is astonishing. This feels like a grand epic quest instead of one of those crappy empty meaningless Ubisoft open world games with a list of shit to do rather than living through a grand adventure.Surprisingly enough, the dark souls formula translates very well to the open world space. Now is it necessary, no, open world games are s plague nowadays. But this somehow manages to make you feel like not all open world games are terrible.Also G.R.R.M transformed the throne into a sword, so that's something.Visually lushious, you'll get lost in it's world and crave for more of it's secret and secret content hidding at the edge of it's world.Be ready to get invested for at least 80 to 120 hours."

Positive,"Wow, just wow. Great game FromSoft. Best new game ive played in a very long time."
Positive,"This game will break you, crush your hopes and dreams, it will make you feel less than, weak, unable to continue, however if you resist and continue to fight, become stronger and be the hero you want to be, you will feel accomplished like never before."
Positive,"I am Malenia, Blade of Miquella!"
Positive,"Perfect mix of old school souls, all while taking things they learned from Sekiro and packaged in a wild open world"
Positive,If only i had Giant.But hole.
Positive,a couple of the bosses are absolutely fucking atrocious but the exploration is really engaging with a ton of content
Positive,"Fantastic game. Handled it's new expanse really well. Plenty to explore and miss out on if you get caught up in exploring one thing. I like the changes on the map the day of time makes and the many various different classes that help streamline what you want your character to be. The new Ashes of War weapon arts are another cool addition to the game that makes me wish we had it in other Fromsoft games as well. The spells are beautiful and diverge quite a bit from the previous games which I absolutely love.I have some minor complaints about some things but most of my complaints, like others, are from the stability of the game. Constant frame drops when fighting enemies I could handle. The multiple random crashes, especially during loading causing my character to fall through the world and kill me is not exactly fun. Another issue I have is the camera while moving at all forces itself to stay straight along with your character. So when I try to look back at an enemy I get extreme screen-tearing and the camera forces itself against me.If this all gets fixed in a later patch, I'd say it's a good game to get.EDIT: Stuff got fixed. Good gayme."
Positive,"If you like the previous souls games, easy 10/10"
Positive,Elden Ring *Very Good

Positive,"Performance issues aside, this game is a masterpiece.widepeepoHappy BoooooooooooooooooopieswidepeepoHappy Palloooooooooooooooooons"
Positive,"A phenomenal game with pc port performance issues that are mostly fixable.If you're having performance issues try these methods to raise frame rate and reduce severity of frame rate drops.Outside of the game: Search in windows bar ""Graphic Settings"" then click on the settings app. Click browse, then search for eldenring.exe in your steamapps common folder. It should be found hereC:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\ELDEN RING\Gameafter you've selected it, set its performance to ""High performance"" For NVIDIA gpus. Search for NVIDIA Control Panel in the windows search bar, then select it. Go to 3D Settings -> Manage 3D settings -> Global Settings. Set Shader Cache size to unlimited. If you don't see an option for Unlimited, then you may skip this method.Inside the game. Lower or disable the following settings:Depth of FieldMotion BlurVolumetric QualityGlobal Illumination QualityGrass QualityI am using an Nvidia GTX1070 and the performance has been smooth after applying these settings. There are however still frame rate drops when crossing certain areas on the map, assuming the game is loading sections of the map. This isn't very frequent and the frame rate drops only happen for about a second or two.This game merges the open world exploration and souls-like combat and mechanics. If you're familiar with the souls games, the majority of the combat gameplay should feel right at home. Almost every weapon has their own skill, allowing you to live to your ideal playstyle more. Each of those weapons can have their skills reassigned as well. Get creative with your character build!The game's world is massive! Saying massive could be an understatement. You're encouraged to explore around the map to discover new dungeons, weapons, skills, NPCs, etc. If you're stumped on some enemies or bosses, try exploring other areas then come back to where you were stumped on. Discovery is one of the fun aspects of this game.The non-linear aspect of this game allows for excellent gameplay variety. Exploring, or getting through enemies. Every player will have a different experience. Sneak past the enemies or fight them head on. Tactically plan out your way past difficult sections of a dungeon or area filled with enemies. The AI is surprisingly smart and well thought out. They respond to sounds near them and you can bait them out.The player messages and bloodstains are the icing on the cake for the hybrid singleplayer, multiplayer experience. You may find some helpful (or harmful) player made messages on your journey that can give you some tips or uncover surprises. Bloodstains help give the player info on how other players have died and also serves as a warning of a high threat area. Elden Ring players are able to indirectly help each other out, adding onto the experience of a blind playthrough. If you don't want these messages or bloodstain warnings, playing offline is also an option.It's only been the first week and I already have over 40 hours spent into this game. It's an incredibly addicting game that can keep you up until 5am. I highly recommend this game to souls-like fans, and people who enjoy exploring open worlds. Frame rate drops at certain areas and rare crashes do hinder the full enjoyable experience on my PC.If you're unsure if your computer can handle the performance of this game, try applying the methods mentioned in this review then launch the game. Rush through the game's opening sequences and levels till you get to the open world area. If the game is STILL not performing optimally in frame rate, then you can refund the game (you got 2 hours). Here's hoping future patches can address the glaring performance issues on this otherwise outstanding game.I give this game a:9/10"
Positive,Didn't even finish the game yet but I already wanted a DLC.
Positive,Best souls-like ever
Positive,"So...I guess we start with a background. I don't consider myself a ''souls games'' person, i do enjoy a challenge but i consider souls games on another level. Yet the fact that after a quick ''tutorial'' you're sent in the middle of everything, you are next to creatures way above you and lambs you can slaughter with your bare hands, makes this masterpiece a game for everyone. A perfect balance between Breath of the wild and the rest of the ''FromSoftware'' games. If you're new, you will have enough monsters and bosses that as a beginner you'll enjoy facing but also some hardcore bosses for the rest of the fans of the DS trilogy.The freedom that the mount gives you, the amount of random encounters with random events makes the whole game feel alive and immersive.For #noSpoilers reasons i won't say anything about the story/lore of the game yet, considering it's been written by Gorge R.R. Martin...It's pretty desapointing but that's a personal opinion.Edit:I've only had 17 hours of gameplay at the time that i wrote the first review.I'm at 100+ now, far from compleating the game for the first time and i still love this ''trash''. Extra things i've felt during this gameplay: -The mount controll feels so amazing sometimes, but whenever you need it to be precise, that imbecile bull is messing everything up.-Get ready to die, a whole day over and over if necessary to kill a boss. (or play mage)-The ammount of ''Ashes of War'' and weapon skills...Is astonishing-Encounters as 1v2 with bosses, are trully, trully a pain in the very fabric of your soul. I'm dead serious, if you don't outlevel a certain boss, it feels like two hammer trucks are comming full speed at you while having a nuke just above you ready to hit in case you dodge any of them.(This applies only to specific bosses)-I've unlocked the whole map...and realising that's actually not ALL, it's frustrating and a blessing at the same time.-If you're into storyline you can either be willing to make human sacrefices for extra details or see it as some disney bullshid. There's no in between.-Playing this with friends is a majestique experience.Edit 2:If this is not the game of the Year i'll name my future child Elden Lord."
Positive,"I died 40 times before I beat the first story boss. Highly recommend. if the game is too hard for you and you're getting mad, try playing a mage. Then replay with more experience as melee."
Positive,"10/10, found a cool sword"
Positive,Weapon art is finally useable
Positive,Hidden Path Ahead
Positive,"Elden Ring is the culmination of everything FromSoftware has learned as a company, showing their experience and responses to many of the communities issues over the years with their prior games, resulting in the creation of a new ""masterpiece"" to stand shoulder to shoulder many other beloved titles. There's a reason many of us still re-install games like skyrim or Oblivion to recapture those feelings of exploration and memorable set pieces that lay the foundation for fond memories.  Players will experience what can easily be called ""Open world"" Dark souls, however the answer is not so simple and undermines the actual enjoyment I've experienced over 40 hours playing so far, mainly trying to progress through the story with little emphasis on gathering resources for the new crafting system.  My system specs will be listed here before I go any further because game performance can vary based on hardware.-GPU: RTX 2060 6GB MSI-CPU AMD Ryzen 5600x clocked at 4.2GHZ-16GB ( two 8GB sticks ) DDR4 G-skill RAM clocked at 3300Mhz-MSU Asus Rog B550 ( having a good PCI express lane is becoming more important as we manage higher and higher loads of data )- Hard drive ""Crucial P5 2TB 3D NAND NVMe Internal Gaming SSD, up to 3400MB/s - CT2000P5SSD8 "" ( just a lot of speed)In total at the time when I made my computer at the start of 2020, I had invested about 1800$ into my entire system so my experience is quite different from some.    Back on topic....   Elden Ring improves upon issues such as how to handle ""poise"", hyper armor, staggering and overall balance between magic, faith and regular damage that it actually feels more rewarding and meaningful. While the open world is quite vast and impressive, I feel these minor changes to the core combat such as a dedicated jump button have done more for me than just the open world.   Poise now goes hand in hand with how staggering is initiated, if your poise is broken, you're vulnerable and cannot maintain hyper armor to not be interrupted. ( it's not a precise explanation but Dark souls 2 had no poise and Dark souls 3 had some but it was mainly about hyper armor as well so armor was more like fashion. ) Poise is a hybrid between the hyper armor we used in Dark souls 3 and poise how it was known in Dark souls. A weaker weapon takes more attacks before you can stun or stagger an opponent and stop their attack while a larger and heavier weapon or attack is more likely to stagger your target. I think this is exactly what we needed and allows tanky builds to really feel tanky but also still be vulnerable to stagger through a variety of means.  Jumping is here and with it newfound verticality in levels  - THERE IS VALUE IN BOTH MAGIC AND FAITH BUILDS, CASTERS REJOICE!! Hopefully Fromsoft don't nerf faith or magic because currently there is so much value in either or and each have their own counters such as magic and trying to use it on opponents in the academy is found to be quite ineffective. Foes have various weakness and strengths that are slightly more emphasized this time around.- The open world feels really fleshed out with great pacing, open spaces are sparce but usually still have something to do like hunting small creatures for supplies. There are many places and encounters, each mostly unique and not just copied over like FOB's in a farcry game. Exploration is rewarding and meaningful because it's actually a mystery. You don't really know what awaits you when you trail off the main path the story wants you to go and you can find yourself in mystical, horrible and downright eldritch places of awe and terror. The world breathes and with it come many horrible things at night and many things worse yet undiscovered. You really feel like you're out to overcome this challenging world and not just take it over.- There's a crafting system that allows you to create utility related items such as firebombs or arrows that help you through various situations. Preparing for a boss can be just as important as being skilled with what weapons you have and learning a foes weakness feels rewarding when you realize you can craft a counter or potion to imbue you with further advantages.- horseback riding makes an entry, enhancing core combat between the main dungeons and enhances the experience quite  well by not just offering you a way to move quickly but also giving you a new way to play. You're weapons handle differently on horseback than on foot an you must learn how to ride and fight on a horse to really get a lot out of it. it's really satisfying doing circles around a large mob and using a bomb when they congregate together.- The story feels less cryptic as you go through and you learn more about the world and not just through items you gain along the journey. - Some changes to note + Talismans are just rings from prior games + ashes of war are weapon arts from prior games but add a lot of customization to how you play +having an actual map is really nice + You cannot be invaded when you're alone unless you use an item to invite invaders to you or you enter an area with a hostile NPC + Spirit summons are NPC's you can use to aid you if you;re having issues and cannot play with other players.  + smithing stones are now in grades of material, you can't just keep farming  the same grade of material an expect to upgrade your gear to max. + NPC's have moving mouths when they talk now yay!     FINAL VERDICT: Elden Ring is an absolute must buy recommendation and I cannot stress just how in depth the game goes. I was expecting to just play Dark souls open world but really it's so much more. This is arguably Fromsoftwares greatest game and possible GOTY.   My only warning is that if you;re running DDR3 RAM and are on an older computer with an older CPU that you might have greater issues with stuttering as new things are loaded. The game does rely on your GPU to an extent but really relies on your CPU."
Positive,Dark Souls just got good.
Positive,I am not a Souls hardcore fan.  Yet this game has everything a modern RPG should.  A-MA-ZING
Positive,"Have never left a review for a game on steam, but I am now. Elden Ring is simply amazing. 50 Hours in and still discovering areas, quests and new items. Love this game and so stoked to keep on playing and eventually get to new game +. And yes I am a huge Souls game Veteran and Lover but even a new player should give this game a try and experience it for yourself. Simply amazing."
Positive,This game is the best game that has ever come out in the last 4 or so years. 0 complains at all gameplay and content wise. The only issue is right now is the PC performance drops here and there but the game is still playable. Highly recommend to new souls players and old players alike.
Positive,"This is one of the best games I've ever played but the performance issues ruin the experience. The first 7 hours were fine, but recently, enemies have started not loading properly or turning invisible immediately after engagement, sometimes right in the middle of combat. Makes fighting packs especially fun. Also, the frame rate stuttering/freezing has killed me more than a few times.Until they fix the technical issues, I don't see myself spending much longer with this game.EDIT: The above issues have mostly resolved for me. The occasional framerate drop and invisible enemy still occurs from time to time, but they're pretty insignificant overall. And ignoring technical issues, this is easily one of the best games I've ever played."
Positive,"The game is awesome but damn those stuttering issues are ruining some moments. Deserves a yes for everything gameplay and art but damn that launch patch that ruined performances needs to be acknowledged and they deserve to be bumped for it because of the bait and switch that happened between the reviews a day before launch and the launch day being broken.Can't wait to say yay though.Edit : More than 100 hours later it is easily my favorite Souls game but performances are still subpar. No tweaks are working and with a rig like i have it is unacceptable, really sad to still have to say nay to such a great game. Still hoping.Edit2: After all those patches and SSAO + DoF off the game finally isn't a stuttery mess. It is after all than and having finished it the best Souls game to date for me, some really bad mandatory boss fights but overall it is tied for me with The Witcher 3 as the best open world game to date. This has better combat, The Witcher a better story but good job Fromsoftware you just keep delivering."
Positive,10/10 would try finger but hole again
Positive,very amogus game
Positive,there's a lady who hugs you whenever you ask her to. goty
Positive,Dark Souls 1 won utlimate game of all time. This is better than Dark Souls 1.
Positive,"If you havent already, just do yourself a little google search and trouble shoot some fixes if you're having issues. The game is very good and playable if you do some troubleshooting."
Positive,I finally have a maiden!
Positive,"I've played Elden Ring for 36 out of 72 hours now and it's been absolutely addicting.A perfect blend of dark souls and skyrim provides the best open world experience I've ever had. challenging bosses, satisfying gameplay and hours of entertainment.As of review time I've spent ~35 hours actively playing and I have no idea how close to the ending I am, if even close at all. Yet I already look forward to my 2nd playthrough, and my 3rd.Some downsides are poor PC optimisation, graphics and control wise, buttons doing multiple things, generally feels layed out for controllerThe fight mechanics leave nothing to be desired, it's gorgeous, challenging and rewarding. 9/10 Hidden door ahead"
Positive,"its almost been a year since this game had been released and ive gone through many phases with it.after my first completion of the game i was in awe, an absolutely cherishable time. around the second and third, the cracks started showing. i started questioning the balancing of the game and of the enemies and bosses, i 100% the game shortly after and left myself on a very unsure note about how i felt about this game. forwarding to february of 2023, ive started yet another playthrough on a newly acquired steam deck in a desperate lust to play a souls game again, any worry i had last year had faded. the game has recived plentiful fixes that make everything click once again. even if its entirely possible nothing was wrong to begin with and i was previously experiencing exhaustion from playing so much. regardless, this game is a beauty, a true standout amongst the souls games and throughout games in general. if there was any game to ever place your bets on, it would be this one right here. I love elden ring so dearly just as i love the other souls games and i heavily reccomend you play this absolute gem.  (side note: please put the souls games on sale its been 2 years, thx love :3)(side note 2: port bloodborne please i will literally give you my first born)"

Positive,"im pretty bad at souls games but this one is fun so farEDIT: I'm 60~ hours in, and this game is incredible. one of the best games i've ever played.If you are a souls fan, you will love it, and if you're not, you should definitely try it.Is it hard? Yes, is it crushingly hard? noEDIT: 90 hours, just finished the last boss. Which honestly was... not greatBut the rest of the game is STELLAR. Would highly recommend."

Positive,Man the new Elder scrolls 6 is amazing!
Positive,"Another masterpiece by Miyazaki, a polished, open-world Dark Souls."
Positive,time to edit my review......this game is perfect 10/10. While being difficult they give you so much to utilize to make it much easier (bc casual andys) so its good to bring more people into this genre of games. the pvp....oh the pvp...while people use broken builds this is the most fun ive had in game that has multiplayer in years. This game to me is a perfect 10/10
Positive,the games alrdefo backwards step compared to ds3not the best in terms of music or bosses or really anything but its mehthe last 1/3 of the game can be scrapped and the game would have done way better lmao

Positive,10/10 - Would happily hand my soul over to Hidetaka Miyazaki for this.
Positive,"Elden Ring has been an emotional rollercoaster: from excited to frustrated to excited again.I never really enjoyed the slower, clunkier combat of Dark Souls, but I enjoyed Bloodborne and Sekiro, and loved Nioh 1 & 2. They all have faster and more fluid combat. Elden Ring's combat feels faster than Dark Souls, but it's slower and more methodical than the other games I mentioned. It does grow on you and has its own merits. As you play, the combination of weapons, ashes, spells, equipment, talismans, and consumables gives you a LOT of different options in different situations. If you can adapt to the situation, you can overcome most situations. Otherwise, git gud.I made the mistake of starting as a mage. It's a very vulnerable character, and some early bosses have a near-immunity to your early magic spells. That was a rather frustrating experience, and not great for learning the game. My second real character is a sturdy paladin (confessor) and with some (over?) leveling managed to defeat the bosses my mage had struggled with. I'm having a lot of fun with my paladin.Some of the early bosses, such as the Tree Sentinel and Margit are _not_ meant to be defeated by a new player when they encounter them. If a fight gets too frustrating, just go somewhere else, level up, and then return when you are stronger and more experienced. The boss will wait.Experiment a bit with build  and playstyles, and find something you enjoy. Attacking from horseback is fun, as is doing shield-counters. You can wield a colossal sword in one hand next to your shield, so you can really punish attackers if you find an opening. I've yet to find a low weight gear nimble playstyle that works for me, and as mentioned earlier a pure caster is rather squishy so I need to circle back to that later to see how I can make it work. Archers may be viable? I've only used my crossbow as supplemental for foes I had a hard time reaching. There's many weapons that inflict status effects, which also looks like it will open up interesting possibilities.I've been roaming around to map while leveling up and doing content that I'm supposed to do: awesome early bosses that either hide in a small dungeon or that assault you out in the world. Open world fights let you fight the enemy mounted, which I find to be very fun.Elden Ring looks beautiful, and plays very smooth (it worked well on my older 1080TI, and is even better on my new 4080). Combat is fun. Each weapon behaves differently, so you might need to try a bunch until you find one (or more) that you like. The world is pretty bizarre, and the style of storytelling is mostly confusing, but it sort of sucks you in. After encountering a talking tree, I was not even fazed by a talking giant jar...Regular enemies are fun to fight. The more comfortable with combat you get, and the more familiar you get with enemies, the easier it gets and the more enemies you can fight at once. I swear that enemies you (the player) have mastered fighting start to look a little like bundles of experience and loot.This game is unlike other games. It takes a while to warm up to it, but now I'm actually enjoying it."
Positive,"Elden Ring is a very solid, very well made open world game within the Soulsborne series. From renowned developers, FromSoftware, is an experience unlike any the which they've released prior. With cool builds, INSANE fights, fun to use weapons, and countless hours of exploration to offer, it's hard to have Elden Ring anywhere below your top 5 games of 2022.That doesn't mean it doesn't have it's current share of problems...Usually in Soulsborne there's 2 basic forms of combat, even though there are multiple classes. These forms are usually melee or magic (because who REALLY uses bows?). I have always went melee, because that's what I have the most fun with. But magic is super broken in the current state of the game. Spells melt through even the toughest of bosses in early game, whereas melee builds late game feel like you're not even winning based on skill anymore. As a gamer, I want to kill bosses because I learned and worked for it, and only being able to kill a boss solely because it decided not to do 5 half-map AoE attacks at once does not feel like skill. It feels like luck. It feels borderline impossible to play this game as a solely melee build in late game. If you go close for any reason and you don't have a summon taking aggro, you die. Unless the boss doesn't do their AoE. Which is luck. Jester me if you want but it's true and it's annoying. I even went to do some light research and every single streamer/youtuber near my point in the game is running MAINLY magic. It really does feel like you NEED some level of magic to even beat a boss based on skill. But even then it's not really fun or skillful to players like me when all the strats are is 'run, spell, hit for 2k damage, repeat, boss dies in 3.' It's infuriating.This, however, does not stop me from giving Elden Ring a 10/10. And no, I will NEVER put points into Int, Faith, or Arcane. And I will beat this game ONLY melee.All-in-all, I highly recommend this game for any level of Soulsborne player, but heed my warning about melee builds."
Positive,"I built my pc two years ago and getting to explore this world at 60 fps, even with the occasional frame drop hiccup, is breathtaking."
Positive,"This game is great albeit with a few caveats. I'll list them down below.       The game is gorgeous with the design and detail put into it. Not to mention the amount of easter eggs hidden away here and there.     HITBOX!! This game has one of the most robust hitbox mechanics I have ever seen. Avoiding a large sweep by accidentally using a stomp skill which made you crouch down at the exact moment the sword swooped in. (ahh pure euphoria!!). Needless to say, the hitbox of the attacks are all valid and feels great!     Painfully rewarding You'll die a lot. You'll die a lot accidentally, hell you'll probably say cuss words a lot but boy oh boy does it feel rewarding to finish off a boss you've been having issues with. Also should note the game does not force you to keep fighting the boss over and over. You can always just explore other parts of the world and level up your character and come back more powerful the next time around. OPEN Though, I'd rarely call this a positive, the game is very open to whatever you want to do first. Want to do main storyline first? go ahead. Explore the wide world? shoot!, You're really ever limited by the choice you've made at the moment. How you wanna spend your time in game is entirely up to you. For good or bad.     This isn't a multiplayer game. If you are thinking of going into this thinking you could coop with friends, don't. co-op is very bare as it is and there isn't really any incentive besides helping a friend in an area he/she is having problems with.  Treat this as a single player game with occasional option of asking for help in areas you are having difficulties with.     Not beginner friendly. While I'd like to call this game as intentionally choosing to have the players learned by themselves, there are some aspects of the game that could have been better explained in a journal or otherwise format, for example, the game does not in any way mention that you have a map and assumes that all players will know that you can use this for fast travel, there are several others but this is the only one I'll give to keep it short.The game is great, If you are a fan of ARPGs, you'll feel right at home. It's obviously not for everyone but for the target demographic it was made for, it certainly hits all the right notes."
Positive,"Amazing game. Some performance issues as of now. Still very much playable if you follow some of the tips already mentioned to try and fix them.Still, FromSoft needs to address these issues.:praisesun:"
Positive,"Absolutely amazing game. Absolutely dog-shit optimization3/2/2022 EDIT: 6/10. I still get random stuttering, and the multiplayer randomly disconnects.3/3/2022 EDIT: I beat the final boss, plus most of the optional bosses, so I'm going to put my full review for the game here.The game is absolutely amazing. Starting off with showing a world boss that people can't beat to teach them to give up and come back later is genius. I loved exploring Limgrave and finding everything it had to offer, and I STILL have not explored it all, leading to some moments where I just one-shot the optional dungeon bosses in the starting area.So anyways, I got to the first actual boss in the castle. It wrecked my shit. I loved it, it was such a well-designed boss and at no point did I think ""This is utter BS."" It had delays in its attacks you needed to REACT to, rewarding skilled play. It was an amazing first boss for the game.Playing through that area afterwards was fun, but some enemies made it not *coughbirdscough* But that was all well and good. The actual boss of that area was ok too, I just didn't get too much into him like the first.That's when the game really opened up for me, and I got to go anywhere I wanted, do anything, and I didn't really like it. Don't get me wrong, I think it's great they tried something new, but the open world Dark Souls just isn't for me, especially since they made a huge world, but put almost nothing in it for half the game. Random drops you find were usually trash pickups, probably so you didn't get shafted if you missed them, but it felt bad to wade through a bunch of overworld enemies, just to pick up a useless mushroom.And now the dungeons... The dungeons are the absolute worst. Chariot dungeons are a nightmare, all different, but feel copy-pasted. The bosses in them are also just copy-pasted. It felt like a SLOG to go through them, and I still haven't beaten them all.Then entire game just feels like repeat boss fights, it's not fun after a certain point. And speaking of boss fights. You NEED to invest HEAVILY into vigor and endurance, because you are punished for not wearing heaviest armor and having 1500 health with being one shot. I had that much and was still taking a third of my health bar in damage because the boss' scalings were so out of wack. I really want to mention how you can't refight previous bosses, but there are so many repeat boss fights that issue seems unwarranted. The final boss was ok, until he hit phase 2, then became the most unbearable thing ever. It's a boss that doesn't like staying in melee range and is also prone to breaking completely, not doing anything for a full 30 seconds while you wail on it. It's a very unfun boss, and a horrible final boss for a Dark Souls game.The game also has major stuttering issues, freezing my game for no reason even on lowest settings, with a RTX 3080. Most of the stuttering has been fixed, but some still remain, which ingrains itself into my memory making it the worst possible experience.Multiplayer is the same as ever, meaning it's broken as shit. Several unbalanced things makes pvp unbearable, as well as the netcode. Multiplayer is also broken due to random disconnects, which makes cooping with my friends a roll of the dice to see whether i disconnect from their game.It is still a 6/10 for those issues, plus the random stuttering and multiplayer disconnects. If they fix the stuttering and multiplayer disconnects, it will be an 8/10, but not beyond that, just too many repeat enemies, frustrating scaling, and unfun slogs. This game does not feel like a 10/10 for me. It's fun, but it's far, FAR from perfect. I'd recommend Dark Souls 3 if you're looking for a game that doesn't have as much repeat boss-fights, and doesn't stutter randomly, plus you can actually mod the game because it doesn't have EAC, EAC is the worst.4/8/2022 EDIT: Still the same, lagging, stuttering, still here6/13/2024 EDIT: Performance isn't nearly as bad, some other stuff still holds true though"
Positive,It's Dark Souls 4. So gitgud or die tryin.10/10 will be playing until Starfield releases.
Positive,Rykard needs to stop being so freakishly charming but like in a weirdo way like i can’t keep kicking my feet and twirling my hair through his fight.
Positive,This is the greatest game I have ever played.
Positive,"After the optimization patches, I'm finally able to play. Easily the best game I've played in a long long time. Immersive world, tight combat, and loads of content to explore! If you buy this game, time becomes meaningless; days become weeks, you went into your room clean shaven but you leave the room with a full beard, you look at your phone - you have 27 missed calls from your mom and your friends are trying to hold an intervention for you but none of that matters. You are the elden lord and that's all that matters."
Positive,"By far the best game I've played in a long time. 100+ hours in and still chipping away at unlocking the next map section (oh it's big) and fiddling around with the multitude of weapons, armors, and spells at my disposal.It's a bit frustrating at times but boy does that dopamine slap when you finish something actually challenging."
Positive,"YES THE GAME HAS SOME ISSUES, YES FRAMES DROP LIKE A MOTHER FUCKER IN SOME AREAS, YES 60 FPS IS A BIT ODD BUT... Hear me out please.Frame drop issue is annoying... Honestly I'm in love with this game.My computer is quite old, I can run it on minimum settings with minimal issues, apart from the previously mentioned frame drops. As someone that always had shit connection and hand me down tech, sometimes makes me feel like I'm playing an MMO back in the early 2000s. That being said!From Software already said they are working on the issues and that people should update their drivers. Making games that work flawlessly in every single piece of hardware isn't easy. Am I defending a massive company for releasing something with a lot of issues? No, I think it's shameful and a lot more testing should have been done. Do I believe they will fix it? Honestly? Yes, I do.Do I think the game is worth it even in it's current state? Yup absolutely. Am I insane? Possibly but this is the most fun I've had with a game for quite a while. If you don't mind playing around some issues, go for it, otherwise wait a couple of months until the new patches come out. I will update this review as I see results... Hopefully I'm right and they will be here soon...:praisesun:"
Positive,cool ass game  (also to change the controller settings just go into the settings in game and change it)
Positive,"worth hollowing for 4 years, would do it again 10/10"
Positive,if u like souls games you'll like this if you dont like souls game you wont like this.
Positive,Glitches can be fixed.Framerate issues can be patched.The world and gameplay are what will stay in the long run and both are top notch.

Positive,Possibly the greatest game ever made; the crowning achievement of FromSoft.Once in a lifetime caliber game.Hug your loved ones.
Positive,Well it's classical dark souls but an easier version and you can jump.I have to say I LOVE IT!!! ITS ELDEN RING TIME BABY!!!
Positive,a great game
Positive,"""its simply incredible, literally an almost perfect game, I just took down an entire battlefield's worth of soldiers by picking them off one by one through stealth and ranged weaponry, because rushing in would be suicide, there's so much thought put into it, the world has everything EVERYWHERE, it's not a open world in words only there's literally so much to do and the game is beyond well designed to make sure you can always have fun wherever you go, if you ever hit a roadblock, turn around and head somewhere else, it's superb.I beat the first boss and he had me losing like 8 times till I managed to pull off the win, he's legit no joke and I say that as a veteran in souls games, it's super fun though, and I do have super high hopes for everything""Wrote this when I was 16 hours inI'm currently 49 hours in, this game is in my honest opinion, the best game of all time so far, the fact that it's an open world game that I'm looking forward to opening every day, and I am not getting bored of at all despite having no real objectives (trying to avoid main story stuff) still boggles me, I'm *still* barely finished and have 4 lords to take down, but the sheer amount of thought and genuine effort put into this game, really blows me away, they couldve just taken a safe route and made a simple open world game to test the waters, but as with Sekiro, from soft tests the waters by delivering goty material. This game is something else."
Positive,PERFECT!I just finished the game and still thinking ıt's perfect after 94 hours. It has very replayability and different style of playing. Has a lot of content and secret every corner on the map.8/10 graphics (not very realistic for 2022 but has amazing views and atmosphere)8/10 for music (compared the other souls games)9/10 for gameplay (1 point for camera angle on giant bosses battles)10/10 atmosphere10/10 map100/10 gonna git gud again for Malenia the Angel
Positive,"I believe that it is about time that i rewrite my review of Elden ring, when I first did my review I had only 9 hours played, with now over 140 hours on the game and beating it 3 times I have a lot to say about this game. Elden ring is going to be fromsoftware's most successful game in my opinion and It is clear. Even though it may be successful I feel as though this is not their best game and it all comes down to boss scaling. The boss's in this game are awful compared to other games made by fromsoftware (Dark souls). I am someone who likes to play these games and complete bosses by myself and without the help of others it creates a more rewarding experience and most veterans of the souls games like to beat their bosses without help. Doing this is a complete nightmare to face soloing bosses has never been this unfair and not rewarding, you get faced with multiple attacks that you cannot dodge and it mostly comes down to RNG on which attacks the boss will use. On the other hand if you play the game with others and with the use of spirit ashes it completely changes the difficulty of the bosses making the game insanely easy. Bosses in this game are poorly scaled for a solo experience and are made easy with the help of others, this was not the original intention of fromsoftware with their bosses. Dark souls managed to create hard bosses that were fair to fight making it so rewarding to finally beat them by taking away the factor and changing it with RNG completly ruins it all. The last phase of the last boss is legit the worse boss that i have ever faced it is so poorly made and designed the boss is not hard at all what ruins it is when you get magic attacks that are impossible to dodge while having to dodge other attacks on top of that, my first playthrough it took me over 3 hours to beat the last boss and it was becuase of RNG. This is evident because on my third attempt i beat it first attempt because it only used magic twice. In conclusion boss scaling in this game is horrible for a solo experience but made easy with multiplayer it takes out the factor of excitement of beating a boss when it comes down to RNG. I still believe that this game is amazing and I still love it but it needs to improve it's bosses. I still recommend it but if your having trouble with bosses use the help of your friends so your gaming experience does not get ruined."
Positive,"Cigarettes and Gambling, the Godskin duo"
Positive,"incredible game, haven't had any performance issues myself, it's been so fun"
Positive,"after two hours worth of playtime i could confidently say the launching screen was the hardest boss, after beating that issue another one emerges, constant stutters, that was just the tipping point for me. while ELDEN RING seems like a game of the decade sort of game it's far too unstable for PC players at this level, it suffers from a myriad of performance issues that ruins the experience and could possibly render it even unplayable. so until these issues get resolved I'd recommend caution, wait for further patches before traversing through the Lands-Between Fellow Tarnished.~UPDATE: game now works splendidlyAfter all the disappointments from hyped up games I vowed to get hyped no more, BUT ELDEN RING proves me wrong, it's a game that RIGHTFULLY DESERVES ALL THE HYPE GO BUY IT I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH HOW PHENOMENAL THIS WORK OF ART IS, IT'S THE PINNACLE OF SOULS-GAME. INFINITY OUT OF 10"

Positive,"ELDEN RING is a true Master Piece,   Hidetaka Miyazaki delivers once again in this Magnus Opus of a Game. It feels like it took the best aspects of all the games in the series and put them together, creating an astoundingly brilliant game. The game feels like a combination of the best of Breath of the Wild, Skyrim, Witcher 3 and All of the Fromsoft games combined into one game. Can't recommend the game enough! GOTY 2022"
Positive,"Game is in a stable state, and i have had a blast playing it on my steam deck. This game is the pinnacle of what fromsoft has learned and is truly capable of. Yes some bosses are quite repetitive and yes a lot of bosses have stupid spin to win attacks; however, beyond those inconveniences this game is just eons ahead of DS3 and launches itself to the top. I cannot state how good this game is without spoiling everything that it has in terms of lore and gameplay, but I can confidently say its a must play!"
Positive,"NOT OPTIMIZED! (As of 01.04.2022, it got better.)Getting stutters,  its bearable but annoying for sure.Overall there are so many people whining about stuff.Theres no widescreen support.Like.. is that a reason to give the game a bad review? Sure it is 2022, i understand your complaints. Stil. In my opinion no big deal.60FPS Lock.I get why you don't like it, still not a reason to downvote the game. Although considered as Con or neutral point.Graphics.What is your problem? These are fine. Not perfect and up to date but fine.Controls.This one had me laughing.Dark Souls 1-3 was recommended to play with an Controller/Gamepad.If you know FromSoftware you know this is a game where you should use your Gamepad/Controller.There are just some Games you have to play with it, sure i agree the mouse and Keyboard controls could be way better...(I noticed there are some issues where people only see the Xbox Buttons so they dont know what to press on Keyboard sometimes.)If you plan on playing any Soulsborne Game or Soulslike WITH KEYBOARD AND MOUSEyou are a madman.There are some games you should not play with a Keyboard and Mouse like some Beat em Ups, Fighting Games, Soulslike Games, Racing Games...And i'm saying that with a Gamepad/Controller which let's me walk forward by ACCIDENT because it does not work properly anymore.I'm liking everything that i have seen and experienced so far.(Also on some YouTube Videos.)Huge downside is the stuttering, even with good hardware.Some won't like 60FPS lock.EasyAntiCheat was weird, i have to admit that though.Do i recommend the game? Yes.Should you buy it now?No, wait a little to get some patches out.EDIT: The stutters got better on my side. Still enjoy the game.EDIT: Great game. Some annoying attack patterns, some odd bugs and some broken things... Still a load of fun. Haven't played a game in a long time that entertained me this much."

Recommend turning Grass & SSAO to medium and low respectivelyCombat is responsive and crisp. Rolling and powerstancing great.World vast and very beautiful, hidden gems everywhere.Worth the wait and the money"
Positive,It's a fun game if you like to die a lot
Positive,one the games ever made
Positive,"I am millennial, Iplaya da Miyazaki gam, and I have never known da feet."
Positive,"At this point any performance issues or problems are completely outweighed by how overwhelmingly good the game itself is.  The soulsbourne formula mixed with open world combines to create something really special.  Feeling more like playing old Zelda in a time when ""its dangerous to go alone take this"" was not only the extent of your initial direction but also an overarching design philosophy.  Exploring this world is satisfying, rewarding, and avoids stooping to the Ubisoft style ""ooo a piece of candy"" map-clutter syndrome that defines modern open world games.  I am engrossed, and overwhelmed by how many fun options and how much freedom you have to approach everything.  You should be playing this game."

Positive,Let's say this is very great game and  i love it its little bit different experience than dark soul games mostly because open world but after you play few hours you get used to this beautiful world we all play :)World 10/10characters 9/10boss fights 10/10performance 7/10 some issues but mostly fixed difficulty hard like all soul games 10/10
Positive,"The best game on the market since Skyrim (Everything is there for you to discover no micro transaction just some pure Open World game play) The game is a little bit Easier than the previous game from Software, but the only reason its easier its because you can go farm anywhere you want if you can't kill the next boss just go scavenge around for some better stuff bosses are not (Git good wall anymore)"
Positive,Thou'rt unfit even to graft
Positive,"Regarding my low playtime: After trying to make this game playable on my PC, I switched to the console version and play it currently there. I still don't get it why the game runs like Cyberpunk 2077 in 4k with RTX on, while looking like ""Dark Souls 3""... but ok ...I heard that it got better, but for now I won't start a new game on PC and just try to finish it on console first!Kudos to my best pal who let me borrow her Playstation. On console I invested +80 hours so far, but I am far from being finished.(Because I couldn't make screenshots so far I just took one from my friend Baadrix)The Open World I read a lot about the boring Overworld filled with nothingness, but I believe it has a lot to offer. The areas are filled with landmarks, secrets and astonishing views. Everywhere you go you can find either a cave, ruins, a graveyard, small random bosses, merchants and other NPCs. It might repeat the further you go, but it still keeps up with the overall good atmosphere. Combat:You lock in enemies and try not to die, while using swords (or other kinds of weapons) and magic. And don't forget to panic spam the parry button. If everything doesn't work, try to backstab!Soundtrack: It is so beautiful and I am so impressed that I even bought the Soundtrack extra!Design & Graphics:  Impressive! First let me repeat what I said before. The game doesn't look good at all and the graphics isn't even worth talking about. I can't believe that these people also made Sekiro, which looked mind blowing compared to its predecessors. As mentioned the areas look stunning, unique and the overworld doesn't need to hide itself from other great titles, but it feels a bit too dated at some point. What I really love is the enemy design. If FromSoft can do something right, it is the grotesque and fascinating way they design their monsters. Each boss is visually a highlight!How hard is it?:I had more problems getting used to Sekiro and even my first Dark Souls 1 playthrough was harder. It might be because this isn't my first souls-like, but this game feels .... fair. Even the weakest enemies still can kill you easily, but the more you explore the more powerful you get. It can even happen that you finish a boss fight first try, because you came in totally overleveled/overgeared. It is rare and there is still a challenge in each fight, but this happend to me a few times and I still have no idea if it was funny or sad. What I still hate are enemies which do an attack animation, stop for a small second (a second where you either roll or block or try to parry) just to hit you without any warning when you didn't expect it at all - Aka ""fakeout"" combo attacks. You get used to it, but it is a really stupid mechanic they added. By far less fun as any earlier boss designs they had.Controls: The bit I played with my standard Playstation controller on PC, I had no issues at all ingame. Just feels like all other good old Souls games. Story:Story? I mean if you expect a fully fletched and straight forward storytelling you are totally wrong here. This isn't bad at all tho. I was annoyed of how barebones the story was told in Dark Souls 1, but after digging into the lore I was suprised how complex it could get. Each item tells a story and each boss, area, enemy and NPC has a story to tell. Some are more easily to understand and others are far more complex. You will never get told at all how things work and all you get is a meager introduction. The rest is up to you (and up to all the great lore videos on YouTube).My conclusion is that ""Elden Ring"" is by far not a perfect game. It has its flaws and some new design choices are not that great. This all might sound negative at all and I really hate it how the game runs on PC, despite looking fairly aged. But besides all these things I still love this game. It feels like all the old Souls games and this is by far not bad at all. Some new mechanics are even very welcome! Did I mention that you can ride a horse? I am still hoping that the performance issues will be solved sooner or later (At least there will be 100% a mod for it.... like usually).  If you never played a Dark Souls game before, this might be the perfect introduction into the series/genre! And if you have played Dark Souls before you will surely feel the excitemnt all over again. Don't get lost on your new adventure and stay safe!"

Positive,"I have only killed the first boss so far, it is making me enjoy games again. The way i play is not watching online guides and just exploring.. This is by far the most nostalgic way to play and i recommend to anyone else to do the same."
Positive,yeah this one might be good
Positive,A love letter to the Souls-like fans.
Positive,"I really like FromSoft and their games so it is no surprise I like Elden Ring. While I didn't like it at first, mostly because my build sucked and I kept attempting areas beyond my level, upon returning I have found a lot of joy in it. It changes enough of the formula to make it feel unique from the other titles. The open world exploration is satisfying and fun, the build variety is magnificent, and the world is vibrant and alive.Unfortunately, this game falls into the same pitfall Darksouls 1 fell into which is a rushed late-game. It feels like right after completing the Capital and entering the Mountain Tops of the Giants the game's difficulty sky rockets and, with the open world design, it can become difficult to know when to back away and return again later. You can alleviate this by going to different areas to level up and get items to upgrade your gear, but then it makes the open world devolve back into the progression system of its predecessors where it almost feels more guided and linear. It is nice to have the option to travel wherever, but it can be confusing on a first playthrough and it made me wish early on that the game was linear instead. I must say, learning how to progress through the open world most efficiently through consecutive playthroughs helps this problem immensely and makes the game more enjoyable in my opinion. Actually, I'd say the whole game gets better the more you play it. Not only do you learn to traverse the world better but also make builds better, understand tough enemy moves better, and not to spend 2 hours getting ran over by a big murder-kart  in a dungeon for a stupid talisman you won't even use.Overall, I think the game is very good and I am excited to see how FromSoft learns and progresses from it. To any new players that are struggling to advance, my advice to you is:- Level mostly your Vigor in the early game. If you can get it to 30 or so then you will have a much easier time. If you regret any of your stats later down the line, you can respec after finishing Raya Lucaria.- Weapon damage is mostly determined by the upgrade level of the weapon rather than your stats, so don't worry about getting the highest strength until you find a weapon you like that needs a lot of it.- Weapon upgrade materials can be scarce, so find a weapon you like and stick with it if you can! My personal favorites are the Claymore, Zweihander, and Rogier's Rapier."
Positive,"its real good, dark souls 4.5"
Positive,Without any doubt one of the best games ever made.
Positive,"Unos de los Rpgs mas divertidos que he probado, especialmente por la experiencia en cooperativo que realmente nos sorprendio muchisimo. Apesar de los pequeños bugs que habian de vez en cuando, fue una experiencia relativamente estable y divertida.Lo pondria entre los mejores Rpgs de la historia? Sinceramente, No. Es un Rpg divertido con loot interesante y de exploracion amplia? Si lo es. Los unicos problemas del juego en mi opinion son el combate y la forma de ejecutar la trama principal.  El combate llegar a ser muy simple, al final del dia, tacticamente hablando no hay mucho que pensar solo esquivar y atacar. Obviamente tienes opciones, y creo que como hechicero en mi primer run, tuve mas, pero al final del dia estaras esquivando y esperando que termina la animacion del jefe para atacar, se siente bien? Si, pero se hace un poco repetitivo en ese aspecto y creo que pudieron profundizar un poco mas. Esta es una de las razones por la cual nunca me atrevi a jugar los primeros darks souls, que veo que tienen casi el mismo gameplay desde hace años. Y segundo es la trama, que llega a ser muy criptica y rebuscada, hay que jugar con una wikia al costado para ver que decisiones que tomas llegan a ser importantes o si le gustaran a ciertos Npcs de la historia o no, y sin ningun tipo de Diario para trackear misiones, pues las misiones se vuelven un poco cripticas de resolver y de ver tus opciones. El  universo si es muy atractivo, con personajes bien diseñados y coherentes a su universo. El final de Hechicero, fue corto pero satisfactorio y me gusto bastante.El aspecto artistico si es algo sorprendente, cada vista e introduccion a distintas areas del amplio mundo abierto son sorprendentes, hubo mucho cuidado en hacer cada zona, enemigos y jefes y se nota enormemente, es un juego muy imponente en ese aspecto. Musicalmente hablando es un poco olvidable, no recuerdo ningun theme de algun boss mas que el del boss final que tambien es el tema principal de Elden Ring que si es un buen track que sintetiza bien lo imponente de su universo.Por ultimo el aspecto de exploracion y progresion si es muy bueno, y con bastante contenido relevante por descubrir. Yo y mis compañeros pasamos horas y horas buscando cada escondrijo del mundo abierto y aun asi nos falta muchas mazmorras y jefes por descubrir.Al final del dia, un RPG pulido y muy divertido, que falla en ciertas cositas en mi opinion, pero que no le quitan su gusto o proposito. Buen RPG 8.5 de 10"
Positive,thank you elden john
Positive,best video game to ever be created don't @ me
Positive,"Great game, lots of content and a vast open world to explore. Difficulty is manageable due sorcery and summons helping a lot. A great 1st game to try from FromSoft, my favorite is between this and Sekiro. Really hope Bloodborne comes to PC sometime so i can finally play that."

Positive,"a breath of fresh air in a stale game market, well worth the buy"
Positive,"It's hard to talk about Elden Ring without singing all of its praises that you have likely heard before. Yes, it might just be the best open world we have ever seen. That's not necessarily because it's breaking new ground, but instead because it's the one of the most faithful presentations of the genre to this day.What so many open-world games fall short of is not actually taking advantage of what the genre has to offer. More often than not, open worlds are empty, lack artistic direction, and are littered with uninspired copy-pasted challenges sprinkled throughout the map. Elden Ring manages to eloquently avoid all of these cliches. Combined with honing its studio's decade-plus years of experience with the soulsborne genre, FromSoft has created one of the most sprawling, rich, and imaginative open worlds that gaming has ever seen. Every area is unique, with bountiful secrets hidden in nearly every nook and cranny. For the most part, its entirely up to the player to be thorough in finding these. With little to no direction of what to do built into the game, every discovery feels earned and intimate. The same can also be said for the story, which is completely non-linear. Players will find tidbits of lore in text, dialogue, and visual storytelling and then have to piece them together to get a picture of whats happening. Maybe this sounds tedious, and in some ways it is. In a lot of ways it makes the story feel confusing, and many players will likely have either not found key plot points, or have it go completely over their head. That's a real shame, as the story to Elden Ring is simply wonderful. With that said, however, even the presentation of this is completely in-line with the context of the world. In a world where the land is shattered, stitched together, and shattered again, it just feels right to have the story available in this manner. On top of that, it feels rewarding. Like a detective looking through a crime scene, solving the mystery of the Lands Between feels in your face while remaining out of your grasp. As a final note, I also want to say that unfortunately, the game is not perfect. For the most part, enemies are diverse in both their moveset and design, but Elden Ring is not without its blunders. More-so than any other soulsborne game, a lot of enemies have unfair, one-shot moves that left me feeling cheated. Now let's get it straight, every FromSoft game is hard. Honestly, I would argue that Sekiro is still harder, but it never felt unfair like Elden Ring does. As well, online play is honestly lacking, with the changes to invasions being for the worse, in my opinion. Other than that, though, you won't see me complaining about the game. Every hour was an hour well spent, and it's one of the few games that I'd argue is worth even more than its $80 price tag. Very excited to see what FromSoft comes up with next."

Positive,"One of my favorite games I have played in the past year. Take your time to explore and enjoy each detail in the game, its worth the time. If you're somewhat new to the souls like series as I was then be ready to die a lot and get use to not being an overpowered mega-chad like a majority of games nowadays. Having an extra controller wouldn't hurt either :) 10/10"
Positive,"Elden Ring is a bold and ambitious title that take the soulsborne formula to an exciting new direction. The transition to open world is mostly great with a few misstep along the way. Some repetitive design choices and balancing issue hurt the game.PROS:- The most accessible entry yet. Not much hand holding, you're free to progress and explore as you like.- Tremendous amount of contents.- Beautiful art style.- Fantastic atmosphere with a great soundtrack.- Great numbers of items, spells and equipment which enable to make many types of characters builds.- An enormous and mysterious handcrafted world with rewarding exploration and varied environments.- A very interesting lore with some compelling characters.- Memorable encounters with NPC, mobs and bosses.- Varied types of mobs and npc.- Refined gameplay now with more ""stealth"" elements, combat moves and platforming.- Day/Night cycle affect some area of the world.MIXED:- The catacombs are a fun distraction but some feel tacked on and arent rewarding.- Love the lack of exposition for the side quests but the design is really starting to show it age. Having to constantly reload an area for some events to progress is a bit archaic.- Despite all the new features, the core of the game hasnt changed much from previous FromSoft titles. We're still seeing some animation made a decade ago. Wich isnt entirely a bad thing. If it ain't broke don't fix it. But a few more change to the core of the game wouldve help this game to distinguish itself more from the other tiles.- Speaking of which the game does reuse old mob and assets from previous titles. It itches that Dark Souls 2 level of quantity over quality sometimes.- Lots of noticeable copy/pasted elements in the structures to give a sense of complexity.- The endgame content is brutal and some areas are very sadistic.CONS:- Some areas are badly optimised lot of stuttering and FPS drop.- Lots of connectivity issues in multiplayer.- Unbalanced difficulty in various areas. - The most chaotic and unbalanced multiplayer yet with many exploits that hasnt been fixed yet but probably will in the future. - A fair amount of bosses are Copy/Pasted from previous ones with little to no changes.- Some areas feel empty and devoid of any kind of atmosphere. Overall Elden Ring is a flawed masterpiece that is the most ambitious FromSoft title to date that struggle a bit from it transition to open world."
Positive,Right from the get go i knew this game was on another level compered to its predasesors i dont think i have had a better exsperience with any game. i think the game has definitly got a skill gap and if u havent played fromsofts titles before it will take some getting used to with the mechanics but once u understand it it becomes tones better and trust me the game will teach you the way of the sun. ill give one good tip for pepole who are strugling with margit its an open world ffs go and do somthing elese before hand pepole who are struggling with him dont understand what OPEN WORLD means but aprart from that prais the son you madless men.
Positive,"This game is currently trending #1 on steam concurrent users and it makes sense why. Not everyone is made to play souls games but I think Elden Ring definitely has something for everyone. If you need one reason to consider this game - know that it is a complete game, free of microtransactions and dlc-locked areas. It feels like the good old days when you could just buy a game and it worked as intended on launch and you could just sit down and play for hours and never have to worry about purchasing more content. And man, the amount of content is crazy. I am currently at 120 hours in the game and I think I am probably only 1/4 or 1/3 through the game. I had so much fun exploring that I didn't even worry about the main story stuff for days and then just came back when I was ready without any issues."
Positive,try edge but dung
Positive,Let your flesh be consumed. By the scarlet rot.
Positive,"TLDR - This is the most fun and rewarding game experience ive had in a while. I cant remember the last time I felt the need to shoot for 100% completion on a game. I'm actually sad im getting close to finishing. fingers crossed for an expansion. the rest of it...  i see a lot of rage about the 60 fps.  you arent playing in a counter strike tournament. im a fps whore and i got over it in like 3 minutes. it plays and feels great. let it go. no mlg sponsorships are being handed out today. recent rage seems to be about the weapon and ability nerfs. if you googled ""op elden ring builds"" you are playing this game wrong. the devs balancing broken weapons and abilities isnt a bad thing. its supposed to be hard. blowing through this game with a broken build is not the way to go. experimenting with weapons, abilities, magic, and spec points till you find what works for you is. again, no sponsorships are being handed out. take your time and find what works. there are so many ways to play.it seems they have ironed out the few big bugs. the one i noticed most was multiplayer. summon signs not showing up, long connect times, and frequent disconnects. trying to help a friend was a curse. the other was cloud sync issues. people losing a whole nights worth of work with one click. the issues have been fixed but i thought it would be fair to mention cause i know it caused myself and others quite a bit of pain.my positive review is not me being a fanboy. this was my first ""souls"" game (admitting that to my friends was a little bit of a hurdle and after playing this i wish i would have given this series a shot earlier). elden ring does not hold your hand and there is a lot you have to figure out on your own. it can be frustrating, but in a good way. im 200 hours in and im still like ""oh, that thing does that"" and still finding new areas / things to do. give it shot."
Positive,This is the greatest game of all time - one of humanity's peak achievements. We don't deserve this.
Positive,"Elden Ring is by no means a perfect game. In fact, as of me writing this after beating the game, the game still has a ton of optimization issues almost 3 weeks after the games release and is inexcusable. Fromsoftware may not be the best with PC ports, but there's no reason for them to not learn anything from their development history. That being said with the game itself, aside from some complaints and very specific nitpicks I have with Elden Ring, I can safely say that I got my moneys worth with this game. A game that in the modern era where games are becoming a service, breaks all the rules of live service games except for one. So is it worth buying? Yes, but like i said there's still framerate issues, and if you are sensitive to that kind of thing, I'd probably wait. Is the game better than any other souls game Fromsoft has made? I honestly can't say for sure. Elden Ring sure gets a lot right, but I think after playing this, Bloodborne is still my favourite souls game personally. All I can say about Elden Ring is that its a game I really do like. As with many other games I like, I'll criticize it for the things that I feel have missed the mark, or I just don't like outright."
Positive,"The game is amazing, but I have very similar problems to many people:- The performance is shit. I disabled EAC but even then I have to play on low at 1080p, and still get bad performance. I have a gtx 980 ti and a ryzen 5 5600x. I do play on linux, so it's probably the problem, but still: garbage performance.- The framerate is capped at 60 fps, and there is no ultrawide support. In 2022.- Terrible keyboard and mouse support, you basically have to play with a controller.Appart from those issues, it's a souls game with a great implementation for open world. It's immersive, has a ton of content, very little handholding and lets you do your own thing. Puts you in difficult spots and outside of your comfort zone very often. The game is quite hard, and slightly unfair at times, but in a fair way. Everything is beatable, and you have many, many ways to go through the game, you have to find those things yourself though. Not the game for everyone, but for what it's trying to be, the best game. Genuinely amazing game."
Positive,"One of the best games I have played in a very long time. From Software really outdid themselves on taking their Souls formula and improving it so it's not just a Dark Souls sequel. The scope of the game is enourmous. If you just try to stick with the 'main path' you'll likely miss a lot of stuff. The really meaty part of this game lies in how there's a bunch to find out just by exploring the areas. I'm personally a big fan of how the game didn't hold my hand. It gives some vague directions and there's a few tutorials on what I can do. But I had to make my own adventure throughout the areas as I progressed the story. If I reached an area or dungeon i couldn't get past i would just mark on the map and would come back later when I was stronger. If the screen was cluttered with markers and pointers on where to go it wouldn't have been the same experience.There are still some performance issues, had some crashes as well on odd times but it was still very much playable for me.It's an easy 10/10 for me. And I definitely plan to do another playthroughs later on."
Positive,This game makes me so angry... I love it
Positive,"What else is there to say, masterpiece."
Positive,good but made me realise that im gay and i like furrys now (edit dlc made me straight again)
Positive,i'm horny and want to fuck every characters in this game help me (everyone but patches fuck him)
Positive,pain is pleasure
Positive,"Try finger, but hole."
Positive,"Such a refreshing open world experience. The world is vast and exploration is always rewarding as the world never feels empty or lacking. The combination of open world areas mixed with classic souls-like level design works seamlessly. Diversity in builds makes many different play styles possible. The accessibility to any type of gamer, whether you be a souls veteran, or a newcomer to the series, makes Elden Ring a must-play."
Positive,Game's completed. Finally can get my life back.
Positive,fun no cap
Positive,Incredible soulsborne experience. Unfortunately the framerate is locked to 60fps and can perform somewhat poorly at times even with above average hardware.
Positive,That shallow lake looks pretty cool.
Positive,10/10 the game fingered my but hole
Positive,without a doubt one of the best games ever made
Positive,Get great swordSet it to HeavyStr Scale to BStr at 40Greatsword is +11Stun boss in 3 or 4 hits.Easy game.
Positive,"After 80hrs, I totally forgot that this game didn't support ultra wide and its absolutely amazing! As much as I would love to use my ultra wide monitor, I can for sure look past it! Still maidenless though...100% deserving of Game of the Year"
Positive,"Whoooo boy where to start .... Almost everything i ever wanted in a dark souls game is in this game. as always i wish the multiplayer was a little less wonky, but man everything feels so good, ... spells, weapon arts, customize-ability, the level design ... the crazy awesome wind jumping horse .....If you are a souls fan its a can not miss ... if you aren't i think this one just took the title from Dark souls 3 for best place to start .... i cant give it anything less than a 11/10 for a dark souls enthusiast 8/10 for anyone who isnt but has enough patience to be able to cope with dying a lot in a game ....Its important to remember when playing games like it progress is obtaining a new item, a new path, a new spell or ability, not whether you died or not. Persistence is in the games design .... don't give up skeleton."
Positive,I was trapped under big bear so I use old man ghost to widdle him down 10HP at a time. 10/10 would trapped again.
Positive,big dark souls
Positive,Now this game is what you call a Masterful Experience.
Positive,"We are finally have Zelda on PC, Nice!"
Positive,Countless quality of life improvements over previous Souls entries.  Incredibly fun world to explore and definitely a successful transition to mounted combat/huge overworld.Feels like a world worth getting lost in.
Positive,"Let there be futility! Praise the sinner!Beloved, O beloved!

Positive,Praise the elden ring!
Positive,I have never played a Souls like game and I love this game. It will make you mad but you will keep coming back for more.
Positive,"just got past the first boss, it's alright ig"
Positive,Best game of the decade.
Positive,love such a relaxing game
Positive,"Every time i beat this game, i get so hyped to try a whole new build, ive beaten this game 6 times, and ive gotten up to NG+3, and honestly its so much fun i dont even care how much harder enemies are.I made a Deal with a good friend of mine, he got this game for me for my birthday but he said i i had to 100% it, and get all achievements, and im telling you this right now, i did about 80% of the content and got almost all achievements just by playing, i was having so much fun i just wanted more, so i kept discovering over and over.is this game perfect? no i dont think there can ever be a perfect game technincally, but this game is perfect for me.im hyped for the DLC, but untill then im perfectly fine playing over and over and overi wrote this review fresh off a lightning magic only play through, and honestly, i wanna play again, i wanna do more builds use more weapons. its that good"
Positive,"Open world Soulslike with lots of quality of life improvements, such as the mount. Paced well, beautiful world, and made someone who never finished Bloodborne run through this 3 times.....so far. Could use some performance patches, and fingers crossed for more content. Fantastic game overall though."
Positive,First act as Elden Lord is to blow raspberries on Roderika's tummy until she smiles
Positive,"not as good as Hello Kitty and Sanrio Friends Racing but really now that's a pretty high bar. Hello Kitty and Sanrio Friends Racing's difficulty curve is a lot better than the new Elton John DLC, Shadow of the Turdtree"
Positive,"OOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHH ELDEN RING..i doubt you could even imagine it..i wrote a nice long review but it din't upload :/, so i guess i'll jus keynote it.i loved this game.Yes, the hype is real.Yes, it'll be a bit of learning curve for new players, but if ye like it, you'll love it.Yes, this is PEAK open-world game design..and imho PEAK game design.The freedom not only to just explore and literally skip or roomba every single thing on the map, but also the freedom to create the perfect build and play the game the way you want, truly shows how much the devs respect the player and how confident they are in their design philosophy.This game achieves all it sets out to and then some, and is an OBJECTIVELY good game.that being said, there are a few balancing issues that might hopefully get patched out in the future (primarily in the latter half of the game) and these probably exist due to how open-ended the game is, so accounting for the build variety would've undoubtedly been a hard task (and it clearly leans towards magic based builds, which makes the late-game exponentially harder for melee builds)..(especially EB, that fucker needs to be debuffed considerably and imho made into a seperate fight)..also, this game is a BIG commitment, it is a LONG ASS GAME, i doubt you can beat the main stroryline comfortably without spending atleast 85+ hours, let alone experience PvP, all of the open-world and optional areas within 150 hours..so in conclusion..there is no other game more worthy of a 10/10 than Elden Ring.---PS. i wont say much, but i suppose i do have a bit of a bias...ive been an active member of r/eldenring since 2019, this game was worth all the hollowing ;).."
Positive,This is probably the greatest game that will ever be released in my lifetime
Positive,"Best game I have played in a long long time, makes me want to hop in whenever I am free.I have only completed Sekiro and have never finished any of the souls but this game tells me to just get on with it and it feels so rewarding once you level up and scale, fight boss/mini bosses or even minions.Weapons and skills are extraordinary, UI is non existent and doesn't  poke while you are exploring the world and the best thing about this game is how alive the world feels, everything is hidden and mysterious.I have no words to explain how this game feels to me right now but appreciate how well done this is compared to other games which have been out for a while.10/10All the people who hate on it, just git gud?This is the GOTY and a future classic."
Positive,Good game. If you liked Dark Souls you'll like this. If you've never tried Dark Souls this is a huge version of the game basically so try at your own risk. Just get ready to die... a lot.
Positive,"Like Dying in an amazing world?If yes, then this is a great game for you.GAME OF THE YEAR BABYYY!!"
Positive,Fantastic GameDefinitely Fromsoftware's most ambitious gameprobably my favourite of their games but I can why some people would prefer the more linear FS games. Balancing is a nightmare in this game
Positive,"A masterpiece of a game, I've put just over 30 hours into it and I still feel like I've only just scratched the surface. Highly recommend even for newcomers to the souls franchise."
Positive,i dieded only because its lag man
Positive,I'm maiden-less :/
Positive,"Elden Ring so far is the best open world game I've ever played.It's a shame that its performance issues are bogging it down, it's very clearly From's opus"
Positive,Try fingers. But hole.
Positive,One of the finest game in the industry. I am not experiencing issues like some other. I have 3080+10900k so that probably be the reason.
Positive,"It is all the good things from every From Software game and more; lived up to its potential, to its hype, and I'm only 13 hours into my first playthrough. Worth the price tag and more."
Positive,Game of the year
Positive,try finger in but hole
Positive,"I have been a fan of FromSoftware for years,and I am so excited to see them come out with a new game. Elden Ring is the best game they have ever made. It combines all the elements of their previous games,and puts them into one open-world title that is just amazing."
Positive,"Since everyone talked about how great the game is (and i agree with them) here are my complaints:1. Too many reskinned mobs/bosses late game2. Weapons/magics/incs unbalanced, colossal weapons are a fucking torture while with magic and bleed i can clear the entire content with my eyes closed3. Input-reading is way too much 4. Lack of interactive boss fight, every boss essentially employs the same pattern: bait your rolls, switching between fast and slow attacks, 360 attacks, aoe attacks. It pushes players to play as mage and use moonveil because there is no meaningful interactions in the boss fights"
Positive,"It's ""finger"" lickin' good."
Positive,"Yoo honestly fams, this game is fire"
Positive,GAME OF THE YEAR !
Positive,Elden Ring more like Melden Shming amirite fellas?
Positive,"It exceeded all my expectations, praise the Golden Order!"
Positive,this game is probably one of the best games to be released in 2022 best 91 hours spent its a great challenge and has great lore and the graphics are amazing and the game play is great very value for money with around 100 hours of fun my final rating is a 9/10 but one thing i want is so that the fps isnt locked at 60.
Positive,"So far the best souls game I have played. The story is just dark souls with different mad libs nouns, but the game play is phenomenal. The world is big, but having a means of travel that can cross it quickly makes it feel a little smaller, so any deadspace just adds to the environment rather than slowing you down. Plenty of opportunity to level up between bosses and make the game as hard or as easy as you need it. The attacks are all well telegraphed and look very cool. Best of all, it runs on Linux, even for multiplayer, and supports Easy Anti Cheat for Linux and the steam deck."
Positive,try fingerbut hole
Positive,Yes. Buy it.
Positive,"As someone new to Souls-game and tired of bloated, hand-holding action RPGs, this is the best game in the past five year to me. Other developers must take notes!"
Positive,E Z P Z
Positive,"""Try finger, but hole"""
Positive,"Game reboots my entire PC every time I try to play. I have updated my drivers, reinstalled, etc. but no dice. Can't recommend the game in the current state.**Edit on 3/6 - see comments below. Buyer beware."
Positive,"Honestly the best part about this game is the Seamless Co-op mod and all the people in literal tears about it on the forums. I never thought I'd be happy to help ruin lives, but if me playing Seamless Co-op ruins somebodies life like the forums make it sound, I am all in.Take notes From - Seamless Co-op is the way to go! Full campaign co-op is what people want."
Positive,"Great game, EASY compared to other FromSoftware games but still challenging and in a OPEN WORLD, thats great. For usual players of these games, go for it, for newcomers, check out reviews and gameplay and so on before you make a choice to buy it, but if you want real challenge with your own pace this might be for you."
Positive,"It's a basic game loop, but it's fun for a while. Kill ""X"" to upgrade ""Y"" to kill more ""X"". The bosses become repetitive and uninteresting after the first one which i was surprised by, once you realise it's the same thing each time and the novelty wears off. There is nothing else when you kill that first boss, that's the game loop, you will be repeating this from now on.Game looked beautiful, played the amount of hours to get value for money, then moved on. No regrets, good game."
Positive,This is the game of all time
Positive,First time playing a FromSoftware game and I finally understand the hype.
Positive,I'm over fourty hours in I've yet to even enter my second Legacy Dungeon. This game is big.
Positive,try fingersbut hole11/10
Positive,"FromSoftware Magnum Opus. Unchallenged, undefeated."
Positive,"Ahh Kos, Or Some Say Kosm.... wait, wrong game"
Positive,OOOOOOOHHHHHHHH ELDEN RING
Positive,"Elden Ring is a masterpiece and I’m mainly writing this review now because I have no idea of when I will finish the game at this rate. I have been exploring every corner in the Lands Between, beating all main and optional bosses and trying to follow every single NPC’s quest, only to realize every time I enter a new area that I am far away from the end. From Software created an incredibly huge game able to satisfy all players, from the most hardcore soulslike fans to the casual players who enjoy open world action/RPGs. The game takes place in the Lands Between after the shattering of the Elden Ring. The realm is now ruled by the demigods children of Queen Marika, each one possessing parts of the ring that have corrupted them. As the Tarnished, you are summoned to embark on a journey, traverse the world, find the Great Runes and become the Elden Lord. The base story and setting have been written by George R.R.Martin, yet that’s barely visible due to the classic design, minimal narrative and typical lore that have always characterized From Software soulsike games.Dark Souls III came out nearly seven years ago. It seems ages now and judging by the success of Elden Ring, people really wanted to go back into a universe that was both new and familiar. However, From Software greatly improved the formula, introducing a beautiful open world structure with a day/night cycle that drastically changes the gameplay and progression system. One of Miyazaki’s core philosophies have always been the ability to explore every place you can see from the distance. Instead of adding fancy but unreachable backgrounds, like most open world games do, From Software went for a real approach. See a castle at the distance? You can reach it. Thanks to the addition of new mechanics such as jumping, crafting and horse riding, the open world allows to change your combat approach depending on the situation. Since you can clearly see (most) of the enemies from the distance, you can try starting with a stealth approach, attack them on your horse or use the verticality to shoot them from long range. Your class certainly defines your playstyle, but eventually you will find a way to respec and try a different build if you want to.There is no quest log and I’m the strongest supporter of this choice. The completion of side quests is more natural and satisfying, and doesn’t feel like going through a checklist of things to do. You need to talk to many NPCs at different times and locations and follow their long side quests that will give you access to optional areas, boss fights, rewards and even multiple endings. Following side quests certainly takes more efforts than any other game, as doing something wrong will permanently fail them.Multiplayer have been slightly modified and is now less invasive for players who don’t want to be invaded, but still want to get the other online features. Only if you summon another player, you will become open to invasion from others, and even then you can be assisted by more players joining you as hunters. The PvP is really fun and less limited thanks to the open world that allows you to go anywhere you want even while being invaded (entering any boss area will kick the invader though). If you don’t want to summon another player, then you can collect and summon spirits NPCs that will fight alongside you, but only in selected areas. There is also a wide set of consumable items for the multiplayer that you will gradually find and learn how to use. The asynchronous multiplayer is still there, so you can see other players’ phantoms and messages left. Upvoting them will heal the creator, which is a good way to encourage players to write useful messages (and funny ones, of course).Elden Ring is a mesmerizing experience you won't find anywhere else. After so many hours, I feel like I’m barely scratching the surface of what seems to be a more intricate world that costantly feels overlwhelming (in a good way) with its insane number of locations, boss fights, NPCs' quests and secrets. It has been years since a videogame gifted me the excitement and suffering of exploration. Every time I defeated a terrible boss, I felt a sense of accomplishment mixed with the sadness of not being able to relive that epic fight again. Elden Ring is not just the GOTY, it's the best soulslike game to this date."
Positive,"It's been an year and i forgot to update my review, it's just a love letter to all Dark Souls fans, if you liked those games you'll like this one but i probably don't need to tell you this, who haven't heard of Elden Ring at this point. Probably the closest i've seen to a perfect game.I'll do a better review once i finish the game but i'll just leave this here, it's easily one of the best games i played."
Positive,"I have long since forgotten the sensation of grass since buying this game, and I am okay with that"
Positive,THE GAME OF THE YEAR!!!!!!!!
Positive,"Incredible game! Solves the souls problem of getting stuck, by giving you huge amounts of different things and directions to go!"
Positive,still no head...
Positive,"itd be good if instead of having no maidens, you become the maiden."
Positive,Can I marry melania?
Positive,"Requires mental stabilty.I don't ever think I have ran into a game that has made (and makes) me more tilted than Elden ring. (except league)Though despite the rage i have gotten while playing this game, it is really enjoyable, the graphics are amazing and the story is well figured out. The areas, enemies and the bosses are also unique and well thought out. You can play around with alot of different builds and weapons, classes etc.It's totally not a game for everyone due to the insane difficulty but it is a very good game."
Positive,Time flies when you play this like all other souls like. Great fun. Too bad that the performance is not at the same standard as their previous titles... trying to play this with a 1060(6GB) on high just ain't happening. Medium to Low is your friend. I'm experiencing some stuttering but it's not game breaking yet.
Positive,"A stunningly-beautiful and immensely large world, enjoyable combat, and great design.So far I'm having a blast, and it's scratching every single itch I've had for video games. I haven't been this excited to play a game in years.Game runs fine at around 45 fps, stutters only right outside the starting area, and only had one crash so far (i7-8750H, GTX 1060 Mobile, 16 GB RAM).Some performance fixes would be very welcome for the people having more serious issues, and for the above-mentioned problems. Then this game would be an absolute 10/10."
Positive,I got humbled really hard.
Positive,"This game seems to be a masterpiece but I haven't even seen close to all of it, so who knows really.pickle!"
Positive,I am in massive pain
Positive,"You died, but this time with a horse"
Positive,booted it up to have some fun then it roasted me for being single. truly they have enhanced the suffering 10/10
Positive,"First Dark Souls game I've played and I really enjoy, it's challenging but not super hard like I've been warned about in the past. I've played like 70 hours and I'm still exploring and having fun with the first area. Really cool and fun Co-oP/PvP.Both of my PCs run the game perfectly on high settings, including my 11 year old PC, so from my experience very well optimized!"
Positive,"A spectacular game being able to manage to mesh well the formula that Fromsoft is well known for into an open world environment. The genre may not be for everyone but ever since the release of Elden Ring they were able to cater and level the player experience into an even field where you either play at your own pace to explore get some more levels, get some better gear or you can also go and give yourself a challenge by restricting or handicapping yourself. Though this doesn't mean that you're solely stuck to playing it with such restrictions, the game has managed to give the player more options on how to approach the game given the vastness of the map available, certain quests, areas to explore, dungeons or legacy dungeons conquer, and even open-world bosses that you can try to challenge!Exploration and lore always make one curious about what the game has in store; Beautifully crafted sceneries, mystifying and horrendous swamps, eerie-looking graveyards, abandoned ancient ruins or cities, and whatnot the game just delivers in making you feel immersed in areas you are trying to explore.Bosses by their creative design look really great! Albeit issues with most dragon enemies looking and feeling the same with almost the same movements and patterns. Some of the enemies in the end game feel like they can't give you time to breathe, looking at you Malenia! But overall the game just feels fresh and fun to learn their movesets are like and will punish you for being too careless. Though some classes/builds may not feel good against certain bosses due to how their arena or how they move or attack around though playing as a sorcerer, it felt really slow on my part but I managed to persevere by just being more patient than usual which I may think melee classes may have easier/faster windows to exploit but overall the boss fights were epic and fun!Overall player experience has been pretty good, there wasn't much guidance nor handholding but I did manage to understand some concepts that were being shown in the game like some NPCs/merchants would even give you guides or items that may help out in a boss fight or an area, and there are times that just looking at the structure of land and behavior of enemies can give you some clues either or with the help of trial and error.The music in the game doesn't feel as majestic as the previous titles but IMO they were still just as great but not as awe-inspiring as they used for boss fights.Overall I believe the game can still do better in terms of better optimization and performance, along with patches that will and should address balancing issues but with how much I enjoyed the game from the beginning to the start I can personally recommend this game to my friends and family even if they haven't played a soulsborne game since there's always a start for everyone!Waiting for DLC!"
Positive,"I just finished the Game, all Achievements, I played since DS 1 so I hope this gives my opinion some weight.For everyone that just wants a quick answer: 98/100, damn good game if you take the time and can handle the frustration.---------------------------------------------------EDIT: 97/100.I have to take another Point away since I focused on the Multiplayer lately (I'm about 300 Invasions deep at this point). The game crashes about once every 30 Invasions and every fourth Invasion has an connection error. I really do hope this is just a temporary edit.---------------------------------------------------The critic that came up the most was lacking performance. I had 5 crashes in 137h, most of them trying to invade someone, so everyone that plays offline should be fine in that regard. No problems regarding FPS or similar. I do have a good PC, so it might be a hardware problem for most (I saw one review that started with ""my PC is slightly under the minimum requirements ...).Regarding the Game itself: Everything you can imagine is pretty much perfect with just a few exceptions:1st: I do love pretty much all the Bosses. What I don't love is putting massive Bosses in tiny Rooms so you can't tell their next move since half of their body is inside the wall. - 1 Point.2nd: Making some NPC Invasions inaccessible after the Boss of that Area is killed. Why? Some Achievements and items become locked that way since you simply can't get them. Source of some personal frustration. -1 Point.Other than that: Visuals: Amazing; found myself pausing a lot just to enjoy the view,Combat: Amazing; the hitbox is perfect, you can dodge with inches to spare and it looks amazing,World: It's hard to find empty spots and we will find secrets for the foreseeable future.Story: Souls like; way deeper than you think and a lot of hidden secrets (Radagon=M) This game is like a good book; many have forgotten the joy of taking the long and ""difficult"" journey but if you take your time and accept that is not as ""easy"" as most modern entertainment you will find  a lot of joy hidden behind hardship."
Positive,"Ever since buying this title I have barely even stopped playing. I was late to the dark souls/bloodborne games. Played all of them after a friend showed me Dark Souls 3 in high school and I fell in love. I have played all the other games since then, and this game is just as good as the others if not better.There are performance issues. It sucks, especially when in an intense fight. But in my opinion, the addition of this open world style has made exploring and finding secrets, bosses, and items has had me more immersed than any other title in this franchise. It is not perfect by a long shot, but to me it is a great game with a lot of fun to be had.6/21/2024: played the DLC the entire night release day and it is amazing. Elden Ring is a GOATED installment by fromsoftware. god is this good"
Positive,better than sex
Positive,Blaidd is a hottie 10/10
Positive,PREPARE TO DIE
Positive,I cannot recommend this game until they fix the performance issues. There is no reason why my 12900k/3090 rig should be stuttering and on its knees in somes places.Edit: Pretty good.
Positive,"Try fingers, but hole"

Positive,"Finally finished creating my character. Now I can start, any tips?"
Positive,9/10Edit: Goty 2022
Positive,One of the best games ever made.
Positive,"I wish to forget it, so I can experience the wonder and discovery,and pain again."
Positive,"73 hours and I'm discovering more new things every time I play. Love the look, feel and story. This made me put Skyrim away for a while, which is no easy feat."
Positive,"this game goes hard asfminor performance hiccups on RTX 3070 Ti / Ryzen 7 3700X but only really when screensharing over discord, fine otherwise (except for loading new areas but that’s a given)overall I’d say a good 9/10 for me so far"
Positive,"Do you remember being a kid and playing OG 8-bit Legend of Zelda and wandering around the Lost Woods?  It felt different from the rest of the game but there was something very *wrong* with that part of the map.  Even as a super young kid, I could feel the game telling me that I was exploring at my own risk and my next turn would probably be my last.  The game told my juvenile brain that this is a place where bad things happen so why was I still here?Elden Ring takes this concept and turns out a 200 hour masterpiece where the overmatched adventurer explores and evolves into an all-slaughtering death machine.  I honestly never thought that Bloodborne could ever be topped but Elden Ring makes it look easy.  It's not a perfect game and the general inventory management is still pretty clumsy (unless you find a filter that always works for you) but the atmosphere and sense of exploration in the game IS perfect.  Knowing that you can easily be quickly killed if you're not careful, but if you use your head and push on, you will probably be ok is a glorious combo.  This game scratches an itch that no other game ever has and From's other games can't match the scale and the enhanced majesty of having each world being linked within the same overworld (instead of warping to different levels like in Bloodborne + DSes).  It's a small change all things considered but it brings the whole package to the next level so hard you could chip a tooth on it.  Miyazaki weaponized the concept of exploration and deserves all the money ever for pulling off an incredible balance that draws a clear line between difficulty and frustration."
Positive,"I had to change my negative review since all the crashes were mostly my fault. I fixed the problem now, very simple actually, just enter Nvidia settings and enable max performance mode, enable vsync, disable antialising. I played over 20 hours and not a single crash. Before i used to get a crash every 10-20 mins.As for the game itself, its just amazing, Walk on your own and discover everything, do not use any guides or tips or hints for your first play, you will enjoy it much more."
Positive,"This game is good. If you like hitting things with swords and using magic and stuff, this game has that in spades. ***DISCLAIMER*** If you hated the gameplay loop of every other SoulsBorne game, you will hate this game. Don't buy it, think it will be drastically different, and then be mad that it's a SoulsBorne game. This game is a SoulsBorne game. ***DISCLAIMER 2: THE SEQUEL*** If you have NEVER played a SoulsBorne game before (Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2, Bloodborne, Dark Souls 3, or Sekiro), this is the easiest one in the entire series. It is huge and certainly difficult, but there are a lot of new additions that make it the easiest. This will be a considerably forgiving entrance into the mechanics and play patterns of the series. Then, once you've got it down, I would recommend heading back and playing the previous ones. OVERALL REVIEW: Good game."
Positive,"Yes, there is a bit of stuttering. Yes it doesn't go above 60 FPS. Yes it doesn't have Unreal Engine 5 graphics but god it is one of the best game I've ever played. I think today's players are a bit spoiled. I remember playing Far Cry 3 or Crysis at 25 fps (if I was lucky) with so much tearing my brain was constantly on the verge of epilepsy, and I was happy. But maybe is just me! The sense of exploration in this game is absolute wonder. Think BOTW, but that takes you more seriously, more difficult, more handcrafted. The characters, in true souls fashion, are nothing short of epic. Progression is real and rewards are always on point. Elden Ring respects your time, more checkpoints, no time wasted in useless animations and a MASSIVE open world, that you can take your time to explore, full of stand alone stories and adventures. I am 22 hours in and I have only partially explored Limegrave, the starting area which is said to be around 10/12% of the game. I just randomly discovered an underground river area, accessed through a mausoleum in a forest infested by giant bears, inhabited by ghost centaurs which is half of the size of Limegrave itself, completely randomly. i could have missed this so easilu should I have progressed just with the main story and side quests. The sense of exploration in this game is NUTS, and (unless you just like hand-holding games) you'd be crazy not to try it!"
Positive,yeah its cool
Positive,"I may not know much, but I'm pretty sure Malenia is the blade of Miquella"
Positive,"its a souls game, if you like souls games, you will like this one too."

Positive,"Love it so far! The open world is amazing and challenging at times ^_^. Definitely the hardest game I have played, I am enjoying the challenge though. ♥"
Positive,game still good
Positive,Don't think about it just buy it.
Positive,Infuriating at times but addictive.Much better than most modern triple A games with the insanely overdone hand-holding. You can't rely on this game telling you what to do or where to go or how to do something. You have to explore and pay careful attention. Get used to dying and learn from it. This was my first proper go at a From game and I loved it. I haven't been so hooked on a game to completion in a very long time.Also try fingers but hole.

Positive,"Lives 100% up to the hype and exceeded all my expectations going into a Souls game. A culmination of everything that came before it from Demon's Souls to Sekiro and one of my favorite games of all time. Finished my first run at 67 hours, loaded up a new character as soon as it was done."
Positive,Get killed. Kill thing. Get killed. Fun.

Positive,"First time playing a game like this and I love it. Risk, reward, trial, error, accomplishment, disappointment it's all had here."
Positive,"This game is awesome. There are some technical issues but they didn't impair my enjoyment of this game. The only thing bothering me, is the lack of a pause feature, as I am an offline only player and I have some life matters to attend to."
Positive,"Pretty Pretty Pretty Good{Original Review}Game looks amazing and I'm itching to get into it, unfortunately I've been on the receiving end of the invisible enemies bug rendering a notoriously difficult game, near impossible to progress. I've tried numerous fixes as advised yet no dice. Hopefully FromSoftware will sort this out soon and I can change my review but currently (for me) its unplayable."
Positive,"I've not been so engrossed in a game since I played The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time back in 98'.  Aside from a few FPS drops, as many have had, the game plays great for me; they will only improve performance in the coming weeks with hotfixes, so be patient."

Positive,"Game is AMAZING! But if you're not very good at games, I'd steer clear, unless you want to improve your gaming prowess. If you just dislike hard games in general, you will go bald playing this. Only for elite players."
Positive,Basically Dark Souls 4 - as good as ever - FROM SOFTWARE at its best.Runs great on 1060 6GB / i5-11400 - Anyone who says it's unplayable is either over exaggerating or playing the game on a literal toaster.
Positive,i want to be inside ranni and then i want godfrey to be inside me
Positive,pretty good game
Positive,Amazing game!!!!! I do understand that others are having issues with stuttering and stuff but thankfully I have not. Running i79700k with rtx2080super. What can i say fromsoft did a very nice job with the game and a crap pc port in the beginning but all in all worth my money!!
Positive,"Gotta change my review and give this game a thumbs up. For the very first time I’m enjoying a game with this amount of technical issue. Why? Maybe because I’m huge fan from From Software games and this fact perhaps blinds my judgment. - The combat took DS3 formula to new heights. ( Still prefer Sekiro though )- The exploration is top notch ( I dare to say is better than BoTW, Fallout, TES, etc )- Bosses encounters- Very rewarding loot Well, there’s a lot more, but TL;DR is it about the good stuff. But, If you have an old system with CPU ( even 4/8, like a I7 6700 ) using DDR3, you’ll have issues, like low FPS at large open world areas, with really far vistas ( like the first time you enter Limgrave ), you’ll have sttutering from time to time ( not as often like before though ), and doesn’t matter your GPU, If you have a CPU based in DDR3, YOU’LL HAVE TROUBLE. But still, the Best experience in gaming I had in a very long time. My previous ( negative ) review, down below: ""I have a I7 4770 and GTX 1070, I know CPU is below the minimum requirement, but still a 4/8, and I see a bunch of ppl using much better setup and getting the SAME fps problem at Lingrave ( 35-55 fps ). Downvoting until you guys fix the game ( yeah, not much else I can do )! """
Positive,"Try Finger But hole.Spent 20 Hours trying to git gud, got gud, got beaten up by Melenia for a few days..... Profit?? Good game, Would recommend to all my imaginary friends!"
Positive,"After playing 17 hours on the release date alone i congratulate Miyazaki and his Team for creating that masterpiece. It surpassed my already tremendous high expectations.PROS:-The game brings everything i love about the souls formula to a whole new level. eg. Combat, World design, atmosphere, ...-The Open world is stunning. In every single part i discovered so far the world is so well built and points of interest awaits you everywhere - no question marks or other stupid open world habits are contained in ER.-I saw so much and yet so little - the game is enourmous. I haven't even seen everything in Limgrave (start Area). And I'm in the first legacy dungeon for about 2 hours and there are so many paths i haven't discovered yetCONS:-from a technical perspective the game sadly is disappointing. I'm playing on a 32:9 monitor and playing right now on a 16:9 aspect ratio. Yes i know that there is already a fix from Flawless Widescreen - but the possibility of a EAC Ban is too risky. -Many people are suffering trough stuttering or game crashes. The game stays at 60 FPS on my rig and i had a single crash in the time so far so i'm luckily not affected. (RIG: i7-10700k; 32GB Ram; RTX3080)"
Positive,"y difficulty so difficult :(Update*:When I first played this game, I hated it. It was hard, I had no clue what I was doing, and there's 0 guidance on what you should be doing.Talked to an NPC and they mentioned a place/person/artifact? Better write that shit down, because that's the start of a quest that you have NO idea you're doing, and have nothing but hopes, prayers, and cryptic understanding of what the next step is, and you can't go back and re-talk, because 95% of the time, the NPC will disappear and be waiting for you at the next part of the quest, that you AGAIN have no idea you're on. So much of this game can be easily missed, and I hate that.Because of my need to have my hand held, my first true play-through was done via Seamless Co-op. In my opinion, multiplayer should have already been an option for this game. Because of the way the mod is made, the difficulty is made to balance the fact that you have extra party members, and it was most definitely no picnic. Playing with friends made me TRULY enjoy the game. We had many adventures, laughs, and shared frustration, and if you're the type of player who likes to game with others, I'd highly recommend Seamless (at your own risk).Because I built the confidence via that play-through about what I was doing, where I was going, and everything in between, my original disdain for this game quickly changed. I love this game. I love that it's self-lead, that there's so many options and ways to play - it's replay-ability is insane. I have now begun and almost completed a play-through on Steam, and I'm enjoying it as much as I did in Seamless, as I'm now facing new challenges as a solo player.This game is beautiful and difficult, and fun and frustrating, buy it."
Positive,"hardest boss in the game was definitely reformed orthodox rabbi Bill Clinton, his move set is very complex and had many attacks that are almost unavoidable. Great game 10/10"
Positive,"best game ever made, change my mind"
Positive,"This is certainly the best iteration of the Fromsoft/Souls-like formula by a long shot, and in a lot of ways it's also one of the best Open World games in recent years. It's been a long time since I've been this captured by a new gaming experience.Elden Ring presents a world clearly influenced by many other works, but manages to capture all of their best sides while simultaneously overcoming or outright eschewing most of their worst sides. From Breath of the Wild we get an exploration-focused world with emphasis on Horse travel and emergent combat strategies. We get otherworldly visuals designed to evoke an immersive fantasy setting. And luckily we DON'T get Weapon Durability nor empty fields of nothing but copy-pasted bokoblins.From Elder Scrolls games we get a world with densely packed points of interest, each with its own little story to tell - every nook and cranny has something to find. We also get a grand sense of adventure - that no matter what our primary goal is, we are not only allowed but *encouraged* to explore and see the world before tackling the Big Bad. And our directives and quests are much more in line with Morrowind than Oblivion or Skyrim, which is to say that the game trusts you to find out where you're going rather than holding your hand and pointing you to every little objective. Mercifully, we DON'T get a bloated world full of NPCs all voiced by the same 3 voice actors who have so much to say about literally nothing - what limited NPCs we encounter in Elden Ring have a beautifully varied cast of voice talent, and each of them only say what they need to say.From previous Fromsoft/Souls-like games, we get a fine-tuned combat experience that explicitly tells the player that they need to employ strategy and timing in order to succeed. And it is oh, so satisfying to beat an enemy after learning its patterns and tricks, knowing that it wasn't by luck nor pity, but by one's own improvement that victory was achieved. What we DON'T get is a drab world full of greys, browns, or pale blues - Elden Ring is a vibrant and colorful world full of beauty and variance.Elden Ring evokes vibes of many other games and franchises as well - a little Shadow of the Colossus here, or a little Witcher there - any of your beloved RPG or Open World experiences almost certainly have influenced Elden Ring in one way or another.Now, that's not to say Elden Ring is a perfect game. There are a number of aspects of the game I would love to see them improve upon, starting with KB/M controls. While this is certainly the most KB/M-friendly Fromsoft game to date, there are still a number of things they could learn from their competition. Nioh 2's camera-lock system has an option to decouple your camera from your character's orientation, allowing you to lock onto an enemy for combat purposes, but still move the camera around to maintain situational awareness - I think this should be brought to Elden Ring as well.Overall, I am extremely pleased with this game, and I look forward to seeing what else it has in store for me."
Positive,"If you want to learn how to deal with failure, get this game."
Positive,This game is indeed THE Elden Ring
Positive,i love dark souls II-2
Positive,"Honestly, one of the best open world games I've ever played. Also one of the best ""souls"" games, If not the best."

Positive,"Elden Ring is an open world game that does exploration right. The combat is amazing, and the sense of wonder I go by finding my way through the Lands in Between was something I had not felt in years in a videogame. 10/10, would love to forget I've played so I could explore it all over again."
Positive,Very fun game. Similar to the older Dark Souls games but in my opinion not as difficult. My only real complaint is with how matchmaking and online play function. Theres a quest where you have to invade 3 people and it took me hours to find those matches. I also wish it had true co-op so you and your friends can run around the entire map together instead of just co-op boss fights. But other than that its been a great experience.
Positive,"There is not much more that can be said that hasn't already been said so I suppose I will write this coming from someone whose first @FromSoftware game was Elden Ring.  It is indeed a challenging game.  One that, in the beginning, may make you want to rage quit.  I know I did.  I took a long break from it and then returned.  The game is not perfect.  I am not a big fan of some of the NPC quests.  The reason is they are so esoteric.  You start a quest but then have no idea where to go to continue the quest.  It is almost simply pure luck that you find the NPC to continue its quest.  I do not like leaving my chances up to serendipity.  Additionally, just following the regular questline using the sites of grace as your guide, you will arrive at mini-bosses and bosses that are too overpowered for your character.  You then have to backtrack grinding for runes.  I am not a big fan of that either although it did allow me to hone my combat skills more.  With that out of the way, let's return to the challenge.  I played this game the only way I know how:  with a keyboard and mouse.  This game, I feel, was more meant for a controller, so to cut down on the challenge, you need to rebind the keys to something more natural for you.  This will help your encounters immensely, at least it did for me.  Next, this is not a FPS.  If you cut your teeth on mostly FPS games, this RPG will murder you.  Luckily, I had played The Witcher before so I had an idea of how to approach battles.  You cannot spam the ""hit"" button. You have to find out what the weakness is of your foe and play to that weakness.  You also must learn to dodge well.  I didn't deflect or block much because I rarely used a shield, but even then, you need to learn to dodge well.  Even understanding this, when I met my first real boss in the game, a shardbearer, I really hated the devs.  I thought they all must be sadistic types who love screwing the players of the game.  (Yeah, I know, irrational thought.)  This boss seems unbeatable, but after probably 10-15 deaths, I finally hit on its weakness.  After that the boss was actually quite easy.  I am simplifying things, but more or less, this is how to approach every boss.  Individual characters will have their stock moves that you will quickly learn and recognize.  Learn their moves well, and you will have less problems.  Notice I said, less problems.  I had to realize that dying is part of the game.  So if you die, except for losing runes, it is not that bad of an experience.  It resets the area and you try again.  You usually return to the last site of grace where you were.  The only time dying is really a hassle is when, for me, the game places sites of grace too far apart.  In cases like these, you do grind through the area and then die close to the end of the area and since there was no site of grace, you return to the beginning of said area.  In those times, dying is quite bothersome and takes the wind out of your sails so to speak. Pay attention to armor and your build.  When fighting certain mini-bosses and bosses, they attack using a certain type of damage, fire, sorcery, holy, lightning and so on.  Depending on your armor and your stamina, you may be able to put on armor that negates to some percentage the damage given.  In regards to your build, don't do what I did.  I was spreading my runes across all of the attributes at first, but really you need to decide on what sort of character you want: an all strength build or perhaps an all magic build.  There are other builds as well.  I ended up concentrating my build on strength, intelligence and holy attributes.  I personally found that incantations are more powerful and useful than most of the sorcery spells so I sunk a lot of runes into holy which really makes the incantations more powerful.  I also put many runes into vigor and mind, your HP and FP (for spells and skills.)  Now I am on my second playthrough.  It's not as exciting as before, but every once in a while I find something that I didn't notice on the first playthrough.  The game is absolutely massive.  I am so looking forward to the DLC.  If you are looking for a satisfying challenge, give Elden Ring a shot.  It will be well worth it.  If you get stuck, check out the many tutorials and walkthroughs on YouTube too."

Positive,"Leave it to From Software to redefine the genre they invented.Performance issues at launch aside, the game looks gorgeous, combat is challenging and rewarding, load times are super short, the design of the environments and enemies is phenomenal, and despite having played almost 20 hours at the time of writing, it feels like I've barely scratched the surface.Oh and I can get as many hugs as I want ;_;"
Positive,name 10 books
Positive,get better pcs nerds
Positive,"amazing game, havent enjoyed a game like this since skyrim came out in 2011"
Positive,"Maybe the best game FromSoftware developed until now.A rich world inhabited by countless beings, both good and evil, captivating lore (if you look for it) and still one of the subjectively best combat experiences.Just a heads up though, there are still ""problems"". Sometimes your mount is stuck in the smallest twigs of a bush for the 11th time; some world events won't trigger (but this gets fixed soon, I guess) and if you want to do quests for NPCs, better grab a notebook because you won't get a quest log as you're used to.EDIT: the ""problems"" got fixed after some patchesAll in all Elden Ring is a worthy GOTY. If you're already a fan, you're gonna love it. If you're aquainted with the franchise, this WILL be the game you'll love. If you never played a Souls-game, well, this is your sign."
Positive,"So, I am rewriting review after first playthrough which took me 113 hours on steam record. Truly great game, visuals, lore, boss design, vast landscapes and a lot of places to explore – are all nearly perfect. Optimization also have became better after some patches, though even on release date with 2060s I had only few stutters here and there in open world.I can recommend this game mostly to everyone even not to the souls veterans, may be for new players it will seems hard at the beginning but when you level up a bit it will become easier since you can summon spirits and due to the open world you can just simply be overlevelled every time, without even farming runes to lvl up. That’s what happened to me, most of the bosses I’ve killed within 5 attempts, only few of them got me for more than 15 attempts ( hello, Malenia). You can also use a lot of different builds and you can even remake your stats after some point to try new things, there are a lot of weapons and spells to try out.For people who like achievements, I can say that you can have mostly every achievement in single playthrough, and you only need to save scum or play the game 3 times to have all achievements for endings. And, I must say, Berserk references are cool! Thanks, Miyazaki- sama!"
Positive,"This review is from a perspective of a guy who never played any Dark Souls gameby the time of writing this, I have completed the game. and cleared all of it. (Probably missed some, if so RIP)I love playing this game :-The Background Music on each bosses are spectacular. although some boss do miss the mark-It provides a great wide challenges with different type of boss move-sets, Making most of the bosses unique, Although there are some re-used bosses that will appear later on in the game-Characters, enemies and bosses, have an interesting lore tied to them.-They intentionally created quests that you have to write down so you wonder more often, go finding secrets, ensuring you the best experience possible. You don't need a quest marker. just a good ol paper and Memory.-They stick with their theme even with their graphics, I appreciate those games who stick true with their theme.-Sadly though, There were slight stutters. and Connection Errors when Cooperating and Invading and Sometimes crashing. I've seen so many cooperators / Invaders leaving immediately or mid fight because of this. Same goes with me. It is a shame sadly. It'll most likely be patched in the future.-Would recommend if you love a good smacking."
Positive,i would have killed myself long ago if not for this game
Positive,Elden Ring has perfected the open world genre in my opinion. The game is all about exploration and it's all up to the player where they choose to go. Fromsoft took the linear game design they always had and managed to still implement it into an open world setting. I can strongly recommend this game to someone who's never played a souls game before because depending on how you play and the build you choose to go with (which there's so many to choose from and experiment with) it can either be very difficult or much easier. This game is a masterpiece!
Positive,Dark Souls 4: Skyrim Edition
Positive,finally some good fucking food
Positive,Try finger but hole
Positive,Just an overall great game.
Positive,a game worthy of goty!
Positive,"Still buggy on PC but not unplayable. Despite the bugs and performance issues, loads of fun."
Positive,"The game is good, slightly hindered by the crafting mechanics and invasion mechanics which forces a 1 versus 2 fight in favor of the defender, unless they specifically try to get invaded as a solo player."
Positive,"very nice, at the start  hard to master, but thats the fun."
Positive,"If you're already well acquainted with ""Souls"" games you know what you're in for. A challenging game with some interesting boss fights, and a great deal of content. With this being an open world game I'll add that you're definitely left to your own devices and expected to just explore. Some people like that, some won't. There is very little hand holding. I definitely do appreciate a game that respects my intelligence, and expects me to be able to read. With that in mind, pay attention to what NPCs say and item descriptions.Combat is pretty much DS1-3, although i haven't tried all the classes.  I love the slower paced, more methodical combat system that can be very technical. While you MIGHT be able to get away mashing the  attack here and there, you really do need to pay attention to what your foes are doing (specifically the bosses), I would imagine that fact is probably fairly obvious, but then again people are crying that these games need an easy mode so...take that as you will.If you're new to these types of games, I welcome you, be prepared to die alot, but don't be dismayed, it's all apart of the journey, and believe you me, even your most well experienced vet. got his/her ass handed to him by  the first boss, or a gaggle of lower tiered enemies.*****There is a multiplayer component with this game as with some of the other ""soulsborne"" games but i rarely have taken part in it. You can summon other players to help you, personally I've never done it. I try to finish these games by myself and without walkthroughs (at least on the first run). And, yes you do have summonable ashes to help you, while I don't use them, there's nothing wrong with using an in-game mechanic to finish the game, don't let retards try to put you down for it. *****While the notion of a perfect game is a subjective term, I would definitely put this game high up on the rating scale, it's well made***, fun to play, full of things to do, and challenging. As with the original DS trilogy I find it a nice call back to an earlier time in games, where you were expected to work for your victory, not just be given your wins.***At the time of writing the ONLY objective issue i can find with it was the frame rate drops. To me this is the biggest stain on the game. If you're going to put out a product that people are paying money for, it damn well better function properly on a technical level. Game mechanics I can debate happily over, but technical issues have no place in a final product.  While not a deal breaker this is a problem and this game should not have been released with the frame issues.  The frame drops were only at certain parts of the game, and generally didn't affect my enjoyment. The fact that there were present tells me the devs were being rather sloppy, or were rushed to push this out. I won't bore you further by writing a diatribe about game development woes, but if there was a major issue with this game, it would be the frame rate at times.At the time of writing of this it seems that there have been patches addressing these issues and I no longer experience any frame problems. I also should mention I am running a Nvidia RTX 3080.As an non-review related addendum I'll add that this is what I wanted Breath of the Wild to be, something challenging. Personally i haven't cared much for open world games, and i was not very impressed by BOTW in general. Playing ER though I was happy with what i got, and hope FromSoftware continues  to put out great games (BUT just makes sure they are technically ready to go at launch! I'm looking at you Ornstein and Smough). I do hope they branch out more though, this game is heavily built upon DS1-3, infact I'd say it pretty much is the same engine just put in an open world setting. That isn't a negative, because the DS game mechanics were very well put together, but I think are starting to wear thin.Overall, an amazing game that is worth the price, just marred by the frame rate issues."
Positive,"Oh yea, it lives up to the hype."
Positive,"Elden Ring is amazing and i had an absolute blast playing it. The weapons, armor and lore were all cool and enjoyable. Granted some bosses in end game are pretty meh (or even bad) but i still enjoyed finishing Elden Ring!"

Positive,"Prolly the best FromSoft RPG there is. The environments are stunning and the magic system leaves a lot fo room for customization for each player's build. This collaboration between Miyazaki and George R.R. Martin led to a story-rich world, fantastic gaming experience, with wonderful music tracks to accompany it. I wish I could erase all my memories of this game for each playthrough and then play it all over again each time I boot it up to play."
Positive,great game innit. godspeed brave tarnished

Positive,Life changing game 9/10 can only recommend
Positive,"Elden Ring easily wins GOTY in my eyes, especially with BOTW 2 being delayed until 2023. There are very few things negative to say about this game, coming from someone who's first dipped their toes into from software's games starting with Elden Ring. If you can get past the performance issues present as of April 2022, then I highly recommend this game. I haven't found a game which rewards you more than Elden Ring for being stuck on a boss for hours on end until you're finally able to beat it, the combat system in this game is simply unmatched."

Positive,This truly was our elden ring
Positive,"It doesn't open from this side, after all these years. Thank you Miyazaki."
Positive,"Its a very good game but a bit pricey, but definately worth it"
Positive,"Listen, I'll be honest, Elden Ring is a mediocre game at best, but the best part, is the characters. Ranni being one of them. Ranni, my queen shining under the moon, my muse. The way her feet move while she sits atop her throne. The way she rests inside of my jar of forbidden juices. I cannot bear to look at her without exploding all over the place. I want her, I need her, she needs to be mine. The length, width, and height of each of her individual toes. First, second, third, fourth, and fifth all wondrous in their own accord. My tongue yearns to understand the taste and texture of what may be awaiting on her soles. Just imagining myself bent over on the ground groveling at her... (shivers) feet. Awaiting her every command until she makes me her dog. I would fight wars for this woman, topple countries, and conquer continents for my beloved moonlight. All awhile waiting for the chance that one day I may be able to rest my eyes, my lips, my soul, on this woman's scrumptious, delectable, smooth feet. Alongside my azure muse, rests Melina, my pink haired beauty. With Ranni my Queen they shall dominate me as much as they please, stomping their feet in my face countless times a day before we finally are laid to rest as I curl up in my dog bed huddled next to their smooth smooth grippers. I imagine it almost every night before I, Funnytimeguy, rest my head. Alas, this is only a dream that a man can have, and what more is a dream than a cruel fake reality. For this is my passion, my two figures standing bright with their shining feet, glistening in the dim light of my lamp, surrounded by my snow white juices. Every time I wake, reality sinks in, only for me to realize what I cannot have. A destruction of a future, and once again awaiting until my slumber consumes me, where my goddesses await me."
Positive,Was my first soulsborne game and it took only 69 hours to beat. Needs a supreme difficulty button but otherwise amazing.
Positive,Like eating spicy food. Pain but you'll do it again.
Positive,Ranni r34 goes hard
Positive,"A game of patience, courage, and tenacity. Overwhelming and hard at first, but a delight to master with a variety of playstyles and thousands of combinations of stats, weapons and spells that allow for the freedom to play the game however you want (at your own risk!).The boss combat is especially spectacular, and the game rarely holds its punches. You will die, over and over again. You will constantly feel like you are not strong enough, not agile enough, not strategic enough. But every death is a lesson, not a punishment. Now you know not to dodge to the left when the boss does that move. And next time, you'll get even closer to defeating them. Rarely does a video game give me a feeling of triumph quite like defeating a boss in Elden Ring does. The graphics are beautiful, and there is no shortage of breathtaking views hidden away on a forgotten cliff edge, or from the top of a gigantic castle. Enemies are both visually distinct and passionately designed, and you will quickly begin to see how the color theory and design choices of Elden Ring complement the learning curve.Elden Ring is arguably the best entry point into the Soulsborne genre, and I highly recommend giving it a try if you feel that you have the courage to endure a game that seemingly directly taunts you and demands you to learn quickly or forever be stuck in Limgrave."
Positive,"I am not the type of person to play souls games at all (my favourite game WAS the sims) but this is genuinely my favourite game. It has the most beautiful scenery, its so fun to play solo and in co-op (seamless) but its honestly so fun. The boss fights are incredibly hard but not to the point that its impossible, as you see the heath bar going down it gives you so much confidence and even though you die a lot if gives you a mentality that everything is possible if you just try, even if it did seem impossible at the start. Love this game 11/10 would recommend , it changes your outlook on a lot of things in a good way. To all the new players: keep trying and you'll beat all the bosses you get stuck on and most importantly have fun!! <3 Thankyou Miyazaki for making an incredible game"

Positive,Amazing graphics and worldbuilding.
Positive,most hard and fun game iv ever played
Positive,I broke my pot
Positive,"A beautiful game that even if I had things to complain about. A lot of it is resolved by practice, cheese or summons.Music can keep you busy and once you get the rhythm you can always overlap with your needed white noiseOne of the few games I could see myself done with and yet come back too after a while and enjoy again. Highly suggested for those who want to test their skills with slowly more aggressive enemiesOnly thing I will say is that I hoped a bit more out of the last leg of the DLC without spoilers. Regardless it too was well worth the time I put into it and its story to the Lands Between"
Positive,"ELDEN RING, es tu cumpleaños elden ring, tu que saliste del videojuego"
Positive,this game good
Positive,The game where you fight camera angle more that the bosses but still 10/10
Positive,Legit the best game ever created so much replay ability my god this game is so good.
Positive,"This game's world is so engrossing and fun to explore. The sense of scale is insane and the traditional legacy dungeons are all absolutely superb. I do think this game is brought down by repetitive/reused content, some overtuned/unfun bosses and a couple other questionable choices. I did have a fantastic time, but I hope for the next game they do something smaller or more akin to Bloodborne and Sekiro design-wise."
Positive,"From the best visual and audio design, to deep unraveling stories paired alongside some of the most rewarding gameplay, this game has earned it's place as number one. At 333 hours on record, I still catch myself finding places to explore and items to obtain that I have never seen before. Plus the communities involvement in messages, support and invasions create an interactive and fun world. With tons of different ways to play and finish this game, the replayability is outstanding. If you've ever considered playing Elden Ring, I would firmly reinforce that feeling. Now. Go Forth. Become Elden Lord!"
Positive,words cant describe my hate and love for this game
Positive,this made me wanna kill myself multiple timespretty good game

Positive,"very fun, it's like dying simulator."
Positive,"Game is hard. Play anyway you want, but I had blast learning how to fight these bosses. I hope you will too."
Positive,"Writing this after the DLC has been released feels a bit odd. What is there left to say, that has not been said before..?This is the best game I have ever played. The gameplay, the visuals, the music, the lore are just too good and blend together in a perfect mix of greatness. Peaking sales show the popularisation of souls-like genre to the masses and perfecting it's formula at the same time. Of course this leads to glazing and fanboyish ""10 out of 10""."
Positive,Pain and Suffering
Positive,7/10 solid game
Positive,bit too easy for my liking only 42 deaths with invader deaths counted to reach full completion i expected more tbh be honest.8/10 could use a spear which is the only usable weapon dont @ me.
Positive,"Nothing hits harder than life, this is a joke."
Positive,So good it makes you wanna pull your hair out.Would recommend if in pain it will make it worse
Positive,FromSoftware's latest masterpiece Rating: 10/10
Positive,Spelet är väldigt kul i flesta fallen. Då det inte är kul är som när man möter firegiant i bitande kyla. något som inte heller är kul är när man håller på att soloa Rykard the blasphemous first try men ens cp kontroll bestämmer sig för att disconnecta. Köp spelet fall du har bollar av stål annars inte. Type shit fr fr
Positive,"Elden Ring not controversial in terms of graphics, plot, character images in the game and bosses. I haven't had time to play the Shadows of the Erdtree version of the game, or DLC for short. The game has its difficulty, requiring players to be smart and skilled in handling fights and situations. It took me dozens of times to defeat some bosses in the game because they are really strong. There's nothing to criticize about FromSoftWare's games anymore. Thank you Hidetaka Miyazakihas contributed greatly to building an empire called ELDEN RING. If this game does not deserve to be the GAME OF THE YEAR in 2022, then stop playing it."
Positive,"To I, Miquella, and my promised consort, Radahn.Most crazy, unhinged, wild, outright unfair boss fight ever introduced to myself, however, it was the most fun ive had in the game. The base game itself is an easy 10/10, It was a remarkable experience as for being one of the first soulsborne games I had tried. It really set the bar high in terms of gameplay. And this DLC, man. I was told by one of my friends that its a fat ""waste of money"", HELL NAH. This DLC reinvited me into playing the masterpiece again, and trying out a new build, and probably having even more fun than I did in the base game. Thats personally why this game and DLC rightfully deserve a 10/10. The boss designs, the fights themselves, the new items and weapons, and the map are all just perfect. I honestly couldnt ask for any more from this game than From already gave us. During that Radahn fight, I was frustrated at some of the mechanics and parts of his moveset which were quite literally undodgeable (double cross slash) unless in the right part of the arena or he did the move at a certain angle. And the second phase itself was absolutely crazy, the amount of times I had got him to 10% health near the end of my run was just insane. I will never recover from the ""divine gate front staircase"" site of grace. Many of the other DLC bosses - messmer, gaius, putrescent knight, midra, rellana, etc. were all phenomenal bosses of their own. This genuine review (unlike my others) has truly peaked my interest in other soulsborne games and souls-like, and Elden Ring is one of those games which I think everyone should try."

Positive,"Elden Ring: Die, Rinse, Repeat, Love It!Welcome to die simulator 2022. Perfect game if you enjoy stunning landscapes, intricate lore, and getting your butt handed to you by a dragon 500 times, that is a size of a small council estate. Look no further. The open world is gorgeous, filled with secrets, and designed to make you feel incredibly small and very squishy. The story Is dense, mysterious and makes about as much sense as a screen door on a submarine and only makes sense after you've read it backward under a full moon. You'll find yourself piecing together the plot like a detective who’s lost all the evidence. Exploring Is a brutal ballet of pain. Expect to die often, but every death is a learning experience, Git gud isn't a meme here it's a lifestyle. Elden Ring is a masterpiece. It’s punishing, beautiful, and utterly rewarding. Just remember you'll die a lot and beg for more.10/10 would get stomped by a boss again"

Positive,"Well, after almost 250 hours of playing Elden Ring at the time of writing this review, I can't go without writing a review for this game. It's not going to be a copy paste review, nor is it going to follow a strict baseline. Quick note: will refer to the DLC as SOTE (abbreviated for Shadow of the Erdtree)First off, kudos to Miyazaki and the FromSoftware team from learning from all their previous games and compiling all their knowledge gained over the years into creating this masterpiece. You can clearly notice design choices picked from here and there and trying to integrate them into the game, which somehow manage to blend wonderfully together.Recurring 'soulslike' design elements as well, well known and (jokingly) hated in the community like the poison/rot swamps as well. But what's a Miyazaki game without any poison lake to make it traversing difficult?Which brings me to the first point, the graphics. In typical FromSoftware style, the graphics are there but aren't too burdening - allow me to explain from a pleb's standpoint. Basically, the polygons aren't that crisp, looking up close at things isn't so graphically marvelous, however the fidelity is there and you without having to blink can figure out what is what, which is great.You open the door to Limgrave and your mouth gapes as soon as you step out. It's absolutely beautiful, and you can see quite a few landmarks as well which make sense with the mapping system (i.e Stormveil, the Erdtree, a bit of Caelid etc). This will constantly happen through the game when (not all instances, however) you will be greeted by such a view when you step into a new area, be it Liurnia, Altus  depending on the entrance chosen , and even in SOTE when first accessed and entering the Gravesite Plain. Every area is also very, very atmospheric, with great colour and artistic choices (you can expect Nokstella and Nokron to be indeed, starry and with a beautiful view). It's an open world exploration game with a humongous map. Lots of areas to explore, diverse in thematic and enemies. You also get a mount this time as opposed to all the other soulslike games. Jumping also makes exploration a bit more intricate and parkouring (platforming) will be required in some cases either for smart shortcuts, or flat out progression. Great slew of weapons to choose from, really, appealing to all sorts of pre-established fantasy roles and ones you can also make and bake yourself. The freedom is there with the stat system and the way weapons scale with stats (some better than other, indeed) however the weapon's scaling isn't the only thing that has to be considered when picking a weapon. Souls-fashion, coolness factor, the ash of war (in case it's unmodifiable) and how well it scales with your preferred stat also matter quite a lot (the last one might matter most in case of min maxing). Very good, thematic armour pieces as well which allow you to craft fashionable outfits or just wear full sets that look great. Focused on the classical I-frame (Invulnerability frames) roll, with enemies that can easily punish you if you're not being careful due to all decently packing a punch but easy to figure them out and defeat from clumsiest knight to the most nimble SOTE enemy. The addition of a jump button also makes some attacks and some AoE attacks avoidable via jumping if timed correctly, which adds another welcome layer to the combat. Allow me to preface by saying the story bosses are epic in their own right with great movesets that make the fights fun. They also come accompanied by brilliantly composed OST-s to go with their personality, the buildup until the boss and in the boss arena as well. The few quotes bosses have are quite memorable and overall make the encounters even more enjoyable.Like any FromSoftware (Miyazaki) game, the storyline is not directly exposed. You get to know some things in the beginning, and then you will have to piece together the intricate story from multiple sources: NPC dialogues, item descriptions, cutscenes and environment in some cases. Bonus points for having George R. R. Martin working on the story as well, there are clear influences seeping from his previous works into this story as well, with a unique blend from FromSoftware making it rather unique.I will start by saying I enjoyed the SOTE story and the SOTE bossfights to the fullest, as it is a hot topic in the community now (due to the perceived increase in difficulty thanks to a more aggressive AI). The SOTE area is also immense in scope and could have well been a game on its own right under other circumstances.The Scadutree Fragment / Revered Spirit Ash system is not the best, however. It's main scope I believe is to enforce exploration which is great, there's definitely a lot to explore in SOTE. But, with the nature of the game being an open exploration one, means that some DLC content, if not visited at the right time with the right amount of fragments, can become trivial and can make some character builds extremely strong, especially after the buff the fragments received.With that being said, the DLC contains probably two of the best/most atmospheric boss fights in the entire game and probably from a lot of souls games, namely:  Messmer, The Impaler  and  Bayle, The Dread  with one of the harder final soulslike bossfights in  Promised Consort Radahn .Finally, a small qualm I have with the game is some archetypes being unexplored to their fullest which makes them lackluster in comparison to others, namely:  Sleep ,  Madness ,  Messmer-Flame . They are all cool in their own right and you can definitely make builds with them but not many tools to use, unfortunately. All in all, I would give the base game a solid 10/10 and the DLC a 9/10.That's it, thanks for getting this far and reading the entire review, was a joy to write."
Positive,The best game I've tried
Positive,Currently i have 7.9 hours.i spent 0.1 on learning the basics and get some stuffthe other 7.8 were spent on the first boss fight.11/10
Positive,stunning beautiful visuals amazing game
Positive,"best game ive ever played, but I do dislike being touched by huge bears, two bosses in one room, and stinky dragons."
Positive,THIS GAME IS TOO GOOD ESPECIALLY THE DLC THE HARDEST BOSSES MADE ME SO HYPED FOR DEFEATING ALL OF THEM. I RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO SOMEONE WHO HAS A STRONG MENTALITY <3
Positive,"An utterly captivating game with an incredibly dense and immersive world to explore, a fantastic (yet confusing) story, and an addicting battle system that keeps you coming back for more, even when you've been screaming for the past two hours about how damn hard it is. This was my first Souls game, and it was a blast. The open world of Elden Ring is incredibly fun and intriging to explore. Areas are varied and fleshed out, even the most optional ones, and I felt like there was always a fight or a dungeon around the corner for me to take on. Some of the exploration controls and mechanics such as platforming and riding the horse felt a bit un-intuitive and awkward at times, but there were minimal moments of frustration due to those and the combat is really the main focus here. The open world is expertly crafted to teach you the main mechanics of the game, and the open nature of the world allows you to discover and come back to different areas at your own pace when you feel you are ready. I discovered the Caelid area very early in the game, and was having a hard time, so I just went elsewhere and came back when I was more confident and had more levels. The boss fights are expertly crafted and are some of the most satisfying experiences to complete. They are very hard, and frustrating at times, but you know that 9 times out of 10, you did something wrong which lead to you dying, and you just want to get better. That being said, the Souls community can be very pretentious and unwelcoming to newcommers. I can't count how many times I would look up discussion on this game and see Souls series veterans berating new players for using bleed builds, the blasphemous blade, magic builds, the bloodhounds fang, mimic tear, summons in general, and other items in the game. A lot of veteran players of the series find fun in doing challenge runs and in using harder or ""less cheap"" weapons and tactics, and unfortunately a very vocal minority berate and belittle others for not following similar standards. Don't mistake this as a comment on the entire community though, there's plenty of friendly and kind players in the Elden Ring community. I played a good bit of multiplayer and came across nothing more than kind players wanting to help through cooperative play. Overall this is an incredible game. A vocal minority of its community can sour the experience, but when ignoring those and focusing on the great, kind, and welcoming majority of the fanbase, it's a beautiful experience. I see why it got all the praise it did, and it's a brilliant move forward for the Souls series. I look forward to the next entry.9.5/10"
Positive,"This game contains misinformation and defamation towards the figure of Mohg, for more information regarding Mohg's sexual orientation and ideology it is recommended to play the DLC. Mohg was declared innocent before the court of outer gods on June 21, 2024."

Positive,"Found a camp of enemies in the middle of a marsh and thought ""I can take them!""As I walk up a giant dragon proceeds to fly in and one-shot me.Good game!(In all seriousness though Elden Ring is a game like no other, a game worth playing at least once in your life. And if you don't like it refunding is always an option! ;)"
Positive,"An Unexpected Love for Elden RingI never thought I had the fortitude for soulslike games, but after hearing so many people praise Elden Ring, I decided to give it a serious chance. I’ve fallen in love with this world. There’s so much to explore and discover, so many possibilities.My advice: don’t rush to the bosses. Follow the quests, explore every corner of the world, and truly live in it. This game is amazing.Score Breakdown:World Exploration: 10/10The vast, intricately designed world of Elden Ring invites endless exploration. Each area is rich with secrets and lore.Graphics: 9/10Stunning visuals and detailed environments create an immersive experience.Gameplay: 9/10Challenging yet rewarding combat, with a wide variety of playstyles and builds. The learning curve might be steep for some.Story: 8/10A deep, lore-rich narrative that unfolds through exploration and quests, though some may find it cryptic without external resources.Replayability: 10/10With multiple endings, countless builds, and a vast world to explore, Elden Ring offers immense replay value.Overall Score: 9.2/10Elden Ring is a masterpiece that deserves all the praise it has received. It’s a must-play for anyone willing to dive into its challenging, enchanting world."

Positive,"Got the game, played it for 32.8 out of the 48 hours after buying (until writing this). Thats all you need to know. Thanks for reading :)"
Positive,"at the point of me typing this I have finished 100% achievements, and the DLC. Great game, by far the most enjoyable fromsoft game I have played.If you haven't played this, don't let people online tell you how you build or play is invalid. Use those spirits, those cheesy weapons, summon your friend, play co-op mods, whatever  gets you through, because the game is worth getting through."
Positive,"Why are players complaining about the DLC for a game known for being very hard. I went into the DLC straight at NG+7, yes it was very hard at the beginning but as I explored more and got more blessings it became a lot easier, so for the players who complain about the difficulty of the DLC, put on your big boy pants, learn the bosses and beat them."
Positive,"If its too hard, just give up or git gudThis game is a masterpiece in EVERY sense of the the way,- Sensational world building, - Complex lore that requires YOU to search for it (through item description and more), - Amazing NPCS and storylines, - Musics that transmit emotions and stories,- A simple yet refined gameplay (camera is still your enemy tho),this game is not overrated, it is worth every second spent on it  if you haven't played it or are scared to, please, give it a shot and dont give up"

Positive,"Elden Ring destaca por su modo de combate excepcionalmente diseñado, ofreciendo una experiencia desafiante y gratificante que mantiene a los jugadores en vilo. Con una variedad de armas y habilidades a disposición, cada enfrentamiento se siente único y estratégico, requiriendo precisión y timing perfectos para derrotar a los enemigos.

Esta combinación de combate meticuloso y un entorno intrigante hace de Elden Ring una obra maestra imprescindible para los aficionados a los juegos de acción y aventura."
Positive,"One of the best games released in my adult life. Revolutonizes the very concept of Open World games, on a magnitude (but not same direction) that makes Breath of the Wild seem like a GTA copy. And this is basically my first FromSoft game!"
Positive,"The only game where I can summon ""Elden Freak"" to help me beat a boss. God bless you Miyazaki."
Positive,Nothing but pain and suffering... *sighs* good game tho

When my wife left me she took the dog with her so I threw razor blades at her and screamed NIHIL!, My court date is on the 3rd."
Positive,"Elden Ring is a masterpiece that I truly believe everyone should at the very least try. Yes it is hard, but these challenges may be overcome with time and effort. It's soundtrack, art design, and combat are all top notch. Elden Ring is truly a gem of the modern era."
Positive,You will die

Positive,"FromSoft keeps on delivering, yet another DLC that has intense and difficult bossfights! If you are up for the challenge dive right in! 10/10"

Positive,the best one ever
Positive,it's elden ring
Positive,Pretty sad that the modding community has to be the ones to unfuck this abortion of a multiplayer system. The DLC broke seamless Co-op and there ain't no way I'd play this without that mod.
Positive,"If you have any love for souls-games, desire to play one, or curiosity as to what one is like then Elden Ring is your game, in my eyes it is one of the greatest souls-games to have released, it's truly the culmination of everything fromsoft have learned over the years."
Positive,"This, so far, is an incredible game. I love how many choices and areas you can get to. The progression system is awesome. This is my first Souls-like game so I am finding it tricky but it really is worth it. I understand the obsession people have with it."
Positive,"Firstly, the game will never have proper  balancing . Between patches, weapons and skills go from overpowered to literally useless and vice versa. Even if you only play PVE, it will affect your experience in the long run.Secondly, the  PVP sucks  harder than an old bxxxx. Invasion's 3v1 matchmaking is just plain stupid. Even if you just want to do duels and arena fights, the balancing issues I've already talked about will make it feel as bs as a new season of LOL with its shitty exploits and meta. Also why bother with easy anti-cheat when it clearly doesn't filter cheaters,..."
Positive,"Elden Ring é, ao mesmo tempo, uma progressão natural da franquia ""souls"" e uma subversão das regras estabelecidas nos jogos anteriores. A dinâmica de mundo aberto amplia do conceito de mundo interconectado do primeiro Dark Souls, concedendo ao jogador não apenas a possibilidade de ir e vir com liberdade, mas de estabelecer suas próprias rotas e soluções para atingir os objetivos do jogo. Inclusive, tornando o ""stealth"" uma estratégia viável para boa parte dos encontros. O combate também segue essa mesma lógica de progressão e subversão, o ecossistema familiar de movesets e escalada de danos casa perfeitamente a adição de ""weapons skills"" a ""ashes of war"". Em suma, Elden Ring não é apenas um aperfeiçoamento da linguagem estabelecida pelos antigos ""souls"", ele pode representar o começo da sua transformação."
Positive,It do be game
Positive,"If die, learn. If weak, get strong. If bad, train. If door no open, you have no right O you have no right."
Positive,I enjoy boss fighting
Positive,Miyazaki never made a mistake in his life.
Positive,I Firmly believe they will look back on this game like we look back on works of art from Leonardo Da Vinci. Becoming envious of those that were able to play it when it came out and how ahead of its time it was. If your on the edge about the game or the DLC just buy it. its impossible not to fall in love. throw all the money you can at these Devs.
Positive,Elden Ring is one of those games that takes difficulty to a new level like other souls games but it feels rewarding. The game art style is amazing and the world is filled with lots of things to do and explore. All around after finally trying it out I can understand why this game got game of the year. It deserved this reward 100%. For people who like hard but rewarding games it's a must play game.
Positive,"I can't wait for the DLC,got off work at friday,lessssssssgoooooooooooooooo"

Positive,"game is great apart from fia's champions whoever designed that fight needs to have their position within the company evaluatedUPDATE: dlc is REALLY GREAT although if i were a fromsoftware shareholder and knew who was responsible for designing bayle the dread they would be out of a job and blacklisted from the industry as a whole, i do not think ive had a more miserable gaming experience than fighting him."

An absolute masterpiece and one of the finest games I have ever had the chance to play. I have been playing video games for about 25 years now and I have never been so enraptured by a video game than I did with Elden Ring.I loved the game so much that I originally played it on PS5 and then bought it here on Steam and replayed it to get ready for Shadow of the Erdtree.I am so ready for Shadow of the Erdtree! Cannot wait!Give this a go and persevere through it all.. you will not regret it. Ten out of Ten."

Positive,"After 200+ hrs in the base game and the DLC, 20+ hrs in modded and at least 50 hrs of Elden Ring content and lore, I still cannot describe this game with words. When you realize how amazing the game truly is, your first playthrough will already be over,and you will wish that you could erase the game from your mind, so that you could experience it for the first time again.This game makes you feel small, insignificant and powerless, but still gives you the OPPERTUNITY to become whatever you'd like. Elden Ring tricks you into thinking you are fighting bosses, when in reality you are only fighting yourself.How this game makes you feel WHEN YOU PLAY it, but especially AFTER PLAYING IT is unmatched.Right now?I am waiting for temporary amnesia so I can play it again."

I hated the game for the first few hours because Hard game no fun, but eventually I got better at it and fell in love with it. Plan to even get a tattoo of this game.if you're okay with being mad at yourself for dying a bunch in a game I couldn't recommend it more. there were times I felt like I was going to break my controller in half with frustration towards myself, and yet I have beaten this game 5-6 times and can't get enough."

Positive,"A true masterpiece with very little in the way of issues to subtract from its greats. My main gripe was that 90% of the rewards i found/earned while exploring weren't relevant to my build, such as getting 100 different ash summons, 200 different spells and 50 niche talismans that i couldn't ever use (ran a strength build). Despite this, the world, world-building and boss fights were unforgettable - an 11/10 experience. There's only a few games that I've ever been as invested in."

Positive,i think i have no maidens :(
Positive,"An ambitious FromSoft game taking the Souls formula of games and expanding it for an open world.All the same controls you're familiar with from Dark Souls 3 is here alongside the game-changing jump button! Other features new and returning like horse riding and power stancing are all great additions too.Despite the scale of the world, there are plenty of beautiful and unique areas for the player to explore, with an all-round great soundtrack. Not only is there some great boss music to listen to, but also atmospheric tunes to accompany the exploration of the open world.The bosses can be quite hit or miss at times, with some of the best and worst bosses you'll face in a FromSoft Souls game. It can be fun to take them down nonetheless, but there are plenty of bosses that would be unfairly difficult or just a slog to get through.Despite the open-world design and the fact I could get lost in it for hours with barely a sense of proper direction (NPCs can help to guide you however), a lot of familiar level design tropes harking back to even Dark Souls 1 and maybe Demon's Souls return here and make the individual setpieces a joy to explore.Overall, Elden Ring is a great game, it can't be denied. From Software really put their all into this game and it's clear the effort that went into crafting this game. I wouldn't say that it's my favourite Souls game from them, nor is it such a highly ranked game for me since Dark Souls 3 and Bloodborne are still some of the best in my opinion. However, if you are in the need of some more Souls games and you haven't played this game yet, it's still very much worth it."
Positive,i NEED a fj from sellen
Positive,"Graphics are absolutely beautiful. Gameplay is not over-complicated. Only an hour of real playtime in, but loving it so far."
Positive,Elden Ring? Goated. Win. Get this Flippin' game. Cheers
Positive,"I love this game, really, 10/10, but dear From Software, if you're willing to make an arena mode like in the other games, could you PLEASE remove the peer-to-peer type connection? It sucks, the hitboxes are worse than DS2, the lag is enormous, sometimes my hits actually deal damage after 5 or 6 seconds, the weapons with status effects build up on me even if I dodge the attacks, and many many more problems (it's not a net problem from me, let this be clear). I am waiting for the DLC and I've played this game's PvE enough, I love it and the PvP is the only thing I can do to keep playing for now, but if this is the result, I'll have to abandon it. Fix the online, From."
Positive,i like it
Positive,"What a game !!This is the first FromSoft game i managed to beat, after struggling to get hooked to Dark Souls (especially #1). I think it's a great starting point, because it keeps some From Soft things (the demanding gameplay, be willing to learn from mistakes, some boss design rules etc ...) but with a more accessible gameplay (summons, rune farming, sneak, craft ...)  (Tho i should wait until i beat previous Dark Souls before saying that ... I will)So if you never managed to play a FromSoft game but always wanted to, i recommand starting with this oneWith some precautions tho - the game is big, really big. I spent 80h, but i'm sure i could have spend 30 more hours, there's plenty of dungeons i didn't explore etc ... There's obviously some flaws coming with such a ambitious wide design, some (a lot) of bosses are reused, which isn't too much of an issue imho, but it's something to be aware of. A lot of dungeons are pretty much copy pasted, but once again, you don't have to do them all, except if you want every piece of loot. Some boss fight are frustrating : duo boss fights sucks imho, and there's a few of them. Some attacks seem a bit unfair etc ..., but overall, it's really an enjoyable journey. Just be ready to use everything the game gives you, because the game won't hold back, for the best and the worst. There's a lot of different builds available, and the game makes respecing quite accessible, which is great, because you can respec for one boss if you struggle too much. Some boss also suffer from awful camera placement (most dragons for instance). But overall, they are good, some are trully great.A lot of weapons, but every cool weapons is locked behind magic stats, which kinda sucks if you want to play with a pure melee fighter, because you won't get to use 90% of the loot. Armour is mostly for fashion, which isn't a bad thing imho (there's already plenty of things to manage), except that a lot of armours really don't match together, especially because of very different metal tints.  The biggest strenght of the game is the world design. Gorgeous ! Some places are simply breathtaking, and it shows that a lot of care was put into it. If you enjoy fantasy worlds, this one is great ! A lot of inspiration from different things (Berserk obviously, this is a From Soft game) but other things too !The story is kinda cryptic like From Soft usually does, but i enjoyed it. I'll be watching lore videos about it so i can get the whole picture ! NPCs writting is a bit lazy tho. Like, i don't mind having cryptic things and etc, but a lot of them seems almost parodic. Sidequests kinda share the same flaws, you will probably need to read a guide to finish them, but some are great !Overall i think Elden Ring is a great experience, i think their goal was to make a more accessible game without making too much compromise, and i think they achieved that in a very impressive way. If you are a knowledgable player of previous From Soft games, you might get rebuted by the flaws i mentionned ; because of the size of the game, it can't be such a polished experience as previous games. The size is a strenght and a flaw.I'm definitely looking forward the DLC which seem to be massive !"
